<HEADLINE> Can Broncos' Comeback QB Come Back? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- John Elway is always at his best with time running  
out, and now there's just 60 minutes left on the clock. He'll enter 
Sunday's game headed for the exit, the greatest comeback 
quarterback in NFL history poised to bow out in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not. The Denver Broncos seek their second consecutive  
league championship against the Atlanta Falcons, and as the game 
approaches, Elway sounds like a quarterback contemplating an 
audible on retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually, physically, you kind of run out of gas,'' Elway  
said Wednesday, ``but I don't think you ever want to stop playing. 
On Saturdays and Sundays in the fall, I've always been around a 
football game. The question of the unknown and how I'm going to 
react is definitely a scary thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't be fooled by the boyish grin, the daring scrambles or the  
strong arm. At 38, Elway is old. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Montana won the last of his four Super Bowl titles at 33.  
Terry Bradshaw won his fourth and final Super Bowl at 31. Of the 
five quarterbacks taken after Elway in the first round of the 1983 
draft, four are retired, and Dan Marino pursues a Super Bowl ring 
with a limp. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, meanwhile, can strut into his fifth Super Bowl showing  
scant evidence of the toll 16 seasons take. He missed three games 
because of injury in 1998 but still threw for 2,806 yards and 22 
touchdowns, directing the most potent offense in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons coach Dan Reeves said Elway is better than when they  
worked together in Denver from 1983 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how many times when I was there I'd watch him  
and go, `No! No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes!''' Reeves said. ``He would make 
so many plays just by his natural football instincts. That's what 
he got by on a lot early in his career until he starting seeing 
things better and anticipating things. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just gotten better through the years. It's part of the  
natural maturation process for a quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was on the verge of retirement a year ago when Denver  
upset the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl. After deciding in 
June to return, Elway said he was 99.9 percent sure that 1998 would 
be his final season, and he took a celebratory lap around Mile High 
Stadium after the Broncos won the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates, coaches and the city of Denver are braced for his  
departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quit talking about it, and maybe he'll stay and help us win  
another title,'' receiver Rod Smith quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	A shot at a three-peat might be the lure to hook Elway for  
another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There'd be nothing better than to get two in a row and have to  
contemplate coming back for a third, because no one's ever done it 
three times in a row,'' he told Fox Sports News on Sunday. ``If we 
could get a win here, it would throw a little wrench into my 
thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another consideration will be the health of his wife, Janet, who  
underwent colon surgery last August at the Mayo Clinic. It was 
Janet and their four children who encouraged Elway to return this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is she wanted me to come back,'' Elway said.  
``She wanted me to play another year, and I think deep down inside, 
I did, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll be a big part of it again this year. When the season's  
over, we'll sit down and talk about it and see where we're headed 
as a family and then go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grin turned lopsided as Elway added, ``Even if I quit  
playing football, she's not going to want to spend all of her time 
with me anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pride of Denver has saved his best for last, throwing  
touchdowns and winning games at an age when he should be rehearsing 
his Hall of Fame acceptance speech. But at least one paragraph in 
that speech has yet to be written: 
</P>
<P>
	The end.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Professor's Sex Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An attorney for a university professor charged with  
making a 16-year-old boy from Honduras his live-in sex partner 
asked jurors to evaluate the troubling charges dispassionately. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Hersh, who was suspended from his job at Florida Atlantic  
University after being arrested in April 1997, pleaded innocent to 
transporting a minor with the intent of engaging in sexual 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even innocence may not be an adequate defense,'' Jeanne Baker  
said in opening statements Tuesday. ``The challenge for you as the 
jury is to resist that prejudice, to resist the conclusion that 
where there's smoke there's fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1996, a caller gave child welfare officials a tip about  
Hersh and a 6-year-old from Costa Rica. Investigators instead found 
the Honduran teen-ager, who showed no evidence of sexual abuse, 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government agents were bent on proving what they believed,  
on proving that tip was accurate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutor John C. McMillan Jr. said Hersh pulled  
together many details to deceive people about his relationship with 
the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hersh bought a fake birth certificate and applied for a passport  
and Social Security card for the boy in the name of John Anthony 
Hersh, McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hersh also showed an investigator the boy's room at his Boca  
Raton home. But the investigator noticed there were no sheets 
beneath the comforters on the twin beds and no clothes in the 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually all the child's clothes were in the defendant's  
closet, in his master bedroom,'' McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Hersh could be sentenced to more than 60 years in  
prison.

<HEADLINE>  Vikes' Cunningham Is Player of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two years ago, Randall Cunningham was laying tile  
during a one-year hiatus from football. No one wanted him, and it 
looked like he would never play in the NFL again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he was stunned to hear his name called as the  
league's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like Miss America sitting there,'' said the Minnesota  
quarterback, who helped the Vikings set an NFL scoring record and 
come within one victory of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the greatest achievements I've ever received. I  
was losing my breath just sitting there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham was the winner in the closest voting in the 10-year  
history of the award. He received 37 percent of the vote from a 
nationwide panel of 200 writers and broadcasters, 2 percent more 
than Denver running back Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Davis was named the league's most valuable  
player by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Other finalists for the NFL award were Indianapolis running back  
Marshall Faulk and quarterbacks Doug Flutie of Buffalo, Steve Young 
of San Francisco and Vinny Testaverde of the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, pressed into service after Brad Johnson broke his  
leg in Week 2, wound up NFL's top-rated passer with a 106.0 rating 
that ranks No. 8 in history. The 13-year veteran threw for 3,704 
yards and 34 touchdowns as the Vikings became only the third team 
to win 15 regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings finished the season with 556 points, breaking the  
record of 541 set by the 1983 Washington Redskins. However, 
Minnesota's march to the Super Bowl was stopped by Atlanta in the 
NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an empty feeling,'' Cunningham said. ``The feeling I  
have is it wasn't our time. The year 2000 looks better for us. It's 
a year of completion. I think we'll do better next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham spent 11 seasons in Philadelphia, where he set an NFL  
career record for most rushing yards by a quarterback. But his 
individual efforts weren't enough to lift the Eagles past the first 
round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out the 1996 season, returning home to Las Vegas to go  
into tile construction. The Vikings signed him before the 1997 
season, and he was content to be the backup until Johnson's injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all that you go through is a good time, so something like  
this is amazing to me,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	In connection with the award, sponsor Miller Brewing Company  
will donate $30,000 to Minneapolis-based CAUSE Ministries. 
Cunningham has been active in the organization's Christian outreach 
programs for several years.

<HEADLINE> Program To Help Women To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Women earn less than men. They also live longer  
than men. The two facts combined leave women at an alarming 
disadvantage when it comes to retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a federal grant, two national women's centers  
have teamed up to help prepare moderate-income women for old age. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's kind of jumping on the (financial planning)  
bandwagon, but women still don't know where to go for 
information,'' said Arnaa Alcon, research coordinator at the 
Waltham-based National Center on Women and Aging. ``We want to 
provide that brokerage for women, from the point of view of having 
women's best interests at heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Program on Women's Education for Retirement -- or POWER --  
plans to teach low-income women especially that they can have 
control over their financial future. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint project of the women's aging center at Brandeis  
University and the Washington-based Women's Institute for a Secure 
Retirement, POWER has already held workshops in Atlanta and plans 
others in northern and southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lack of core educational materials and programs  
focused on the needs of the millions of women who are living from 
paycheck to paycheck and struggling to keep their families 
afloat,'' said Cindy Hounsell, POWER's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a retirement rule of thumb: For every $1,000 a month you  
make while working today, you should plan on bringing in $700 a 
month in income when retired, Alcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security now replaces about 40 percent of the income for  
the average woman. However, that figure could change as a result of 
an ongoing debate about Social Security finances. 
</P>
<P>
	POWER organizers cite five reasons why retirement is a serious  
issue for women: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Three out of four working women earn less than $25,000 per  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nine out of 10 working women earn less than $40,000.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Half of all women work in traditionally female, relatively  
low-paid jobs without pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women retirees receive only half the average pension benefits  
that men receive. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women's earnings average 74 cents for every $1 earned by men --  
a lifetime loss of over $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Women typically have more erratic careers than do men and do not  
stay in jobs long enough to benefit from pension programs, said 
Phyllis Mutschler, the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	And many women who do have access to contributory programs such  
as a 401(k) often don't know enough to take advantage of them. They 
feel they can't afford it, or they have other things to save for, 
such as their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	Many men, too, aren't as prepared as they should be for  
retirement, but women over 65 are especially at risk for 
impoverishment. Fifty percent more elderly women are in poverty 
than their male peers, Alcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 65-year-old woman can expect to live another 19 years, while a  
65-year-old man can expect to live another 15. And because women 
tend to marry men several years older than themselves, they can 
expect lengthy years of widowhood.

<HEADLINE> Fla. County Sues Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami-Dade County on Wednesday joined a growing  
list of municipalities suing gun makers, filing a lawsuit in hopes 
of holding the industry responsible for the costs of gun-related 
deaths and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that guns do kill people. They have killed our  
children by the hundreds,'' Mayor Alex Penelas said. ``We will not 
allow the gun industry to escape accountability any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that manufacturers negligently design their  
guns, failing to employ safety devices that could alert users to a 
round in the chamber or prevent firing by children. The suit does 
not list a specific figure in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are 26 companies that manufacture, distribute or  
sell firearms and three industry trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade is following New Orleans, which in October became the  
first government to sue the industry, and Chicago, which filed a 
$433 million suit in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., announced a similar lawsuit  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Shooting Sports Council, a defendant listed in the  
Miami-Dade lawsuit, plans to put up a fight in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an abusive use of the courts to try to establish public  
policy through litigation rather than legislation,'' said Jack 
Adkins, the council's director of operations.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scandal Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The worst scandal in the history of the Olympics broke after  
allegations of bribery in Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee says Salt Lake 
City's bid committee spent close to $800,000 on 14 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Mukora of Kenya resigned today, the fourth IOC member to  
step down in the bribery scandal. Mukora was recommended earlier 
for expulsion along with five others, and three members previously 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has said it will look into the selection process  
for the Games from 1996 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	In related developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt said Tuesday that IOC officials should  
expect fewer perks and make other concessions if corporate sponsors 
are scared away from the 2002 Winter Olympics by the corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Those perks total $10 million, according to Ken Bullock, a  
member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. Salt Lake City 
organizers are still $250 million short in corporate sponsorships 
for their $1.453 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rome's Mayor Francesco Rutelli demanded a new vote for the 2004  
Games, contending the choice of Athens, Greece, was tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	``A panel of IOC experts and athletes gave Rome the No. 1 spot  
on the list of candidates,'' he said. ``Until 24 hours before the 
vote we were in the lead. And then -- who knows what happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--In Greece, the president of Hellenic Olympic Committee, Lambis  
Nikolaou, defended his city's victory. ``The vote is closed,'' 
Nikolaou said. ``The games were given cleanly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Greens faction in Berlin's Senate sent files to the IOC  
from the city's 1993 campaign to win the 2000 Games, which 
eventually went to Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Greens leader Judith Demba called the IOC a ``club of corrupt  
old men'' and said its attempts to clean up its act were not 
credible. She said Berlin bidders spent $1.53 million on travel, 
lodging, car rental, gifts and other expenses for 56 IOC members 
who visited the city. 
</P>
<P>
	--A police official in Nagano, Japan, said IOC members visiting  
his city received free rides on police helicopters during the 
city's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games. Nagano officials 
already said voters were given free trips to Kyoto and entertained 
by geisha girls. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch himself 
received an expensive painting and a Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	--In England, the head of Manchester's failed bid for the 2000  
Games said IOC members were taken to tennis matches at Wimbledon 
and soccer games as part of a $9 million campaign. ``Gross 
hospitality is the phrase that I think we can be accused of,'' Bob 
Scott said.

	Social Security now replaces about 40 percent of the income for  
the average woman. However, that figure could change as a result of 
an ongoing debate about Social Security finances. 
</P>
<P>
	POWER organizers cite five reasons why retirement is a serious  
issue for women: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Three out of four working women earn less than $25,000 per  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nine out of 10 working women earn less than $40,000.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Half of all women work in traditionally female, relatively  
low-paid jobs without pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women retirees receive only half the average pension benefits  
that men receive. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women's earnings average 74 cents for every $1 earned by men --  
a lifetime loss of over $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Women typically have more erratic careers than do men and do not  
stay in jobs long enough to benefit from pension programs, said 
Phyllis Mutschler, the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	And many women who do have access to contributory programs such  
as a 401(k) often don't know enough to take advantage of them. They 
feel they can't afford it, or they have other things to save for, 
such as their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	Many men, too, aren't as prepared as they should be for  
retirement, but women over 65 are especially at risk for 
impoverishment. Fifty percent more elderly women are in poverty 
than their male peers, Alcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 65-year-old woman can expect to live another 19 years, while a  
65-year-old man can expect to live another 15. And because women 
tend to marry men several years older than themselves, they can 
expect lengthy years of widowhood.

<HEADLINE>  200-CD Piano Series Is Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the world hurtling toward mega-everything,  
even the once reserved arena of classical music is pulling out all 
its stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips Music Group has produced the largest recording project  
in the history of the industry: a 200-compact disc collection of 
the finest pianists of this century, playing at their best. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips is presenting the piano series to the Guinness Book as a  
new record, beating the company's issue of 180 CDs of all Mozart 
ever wrote, as registered in the 1998 edition of Guinness. 
</P>
<P>
	But quantity was not a factor in how the works were chosen by  
Philips' director of repertoire, Tom Deacon, for ``Great Pianists 
of the 20th Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to include recordings that changed how we thought  
about the music each pianist was playing,'' said Deacon in an 
interview from Amsterdam, where he's based. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Vladimir Horowitz recorded Tchaikovsky's Piano  
Concerto No. 1 in the 1940s with conductor Arturo Toscanini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horowitz played it hell-bent for leather, with tremendous  
gusto,'' said Deacon. ``For a whole generation, his version, his 
reading, changed the way in which people thought about that piece 
of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then along came Van Cliburn, winning the Tchaikovsky competition  
in Moscow in 1958 and recording the concerto at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``His performance was more winsome, graceful, gentle,'' said  
Deacon. ``That interpretation changed the way another generation 
thought about this piece of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in our time, Argentinian Martha Argerich put her stamp on  
the same piece, ``lighter, faster, more like Horowitz,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74 artists in the series range from Ignace Paderewski, the  
19th-century Polish virtuoso who died in 1941, to New York resident 
Evgeny Kissin, born in Russia in 1971. They are the oldest and 
youngest in the series. In between are Spaniard Alicia De Larrocha 
and British Dame Myra Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with household names like Horowitz and Artur Rubinstein,  
the series presents electrifying performances by less popular, but 
equally brilliant, pianists like Romanian-born Dinu Lipatti, 
Italian native Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and German-born Artur 
Schnabel. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting last October and continuing for a year, the work of 10  
pianists is being released each month, with one to three CDs for 
each artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Rave reviews have greeted the collection. For London's  
Independent, it's ``piano heaven.'' Newsweek called it 
``monumental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collection was presented recently across from Carnegie Hall  
under the domed frescoes of Steinway Hall, the showcase 
headquarters for pianos used by most of the featured artists. (An 
exception is Earl Wild, who apologized for being ``the infidel''; 
he plays his virtuoso transcriptions and showpieces on a Baldwin.) 
</P>
<P>
	No matter the instrument's name, the real keys to a century of  
musical fireworks lie in the hands and hearts of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	And in this lineup, one hears ``playing with long-ago rubatos or  
up-to-date precision, according to the era,'' says composer Ned 
Rorem. His Sonata No. 2 is played by New Jersey native Julius 
Katchen. The pianist had made the first piano LP record, of Brahms' 
Opus 5 Sonata in F minor, heard again on the new CD. 
</P>
<P>
	With Katchen at the keyboard, the Brahms ``is hurled at the  
listener, one of the most exciting performances of music,'' says 
Deacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rorem's 3 Barcarolles are performed by Leon Fleisher, who now  
specializes in left-hand repertoire after an incurable neuritis 
robbed him of the pianistic use of his right hand. Once considered 
an American heir to his mentor, Schnabel, Fleisher is heard here in 
two-hand classics, including Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of 
Paganini, as well as Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand. 
</P>
<P>
	As with all lists so popular today, one might argue with the  
choice of artists, compiled by a panel of a dozen pianists and 
piano experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hooray for points of view!'' said Fleisher. ``Let's just hope  
that some of these points of view will clash heads and maybe result 
in other new lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deacon made the final selection of repertoire. He got help  
especially from one featured pianist, Alfred Brendel, who dipped 
into old recordings of Alfred Cortot, Edwin Fischer and Wilhelm 
Kempff. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendel said he chose Cortot playing Chopin's 24 Etudes even  
though there are some wrong notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they don't disturb me -- they please me more than the right  
notes of many of my colleagues,'' the Austrian-born pianist said 
from his London home. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kempff's performance of Mozart's Concerto No. 23  
demonstrates that artist's ``deceptive simplicity. He let the 
spirit of the composer come down from heaven. It usually doesn't, 
if you don't do anything. In this case, it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opinions aside, there's no doubt these are ``Great Pianists of  
the 20th Century,'' a series that includes recordings from BMG, 
Deutsche Grammophon, EMI, London, Sony Classical, Decca and about 
20 other companies.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Futures Finish Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures finished higher Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat overcame early weakness tied to concern about weak exports  
as market participants worried that above-normal temperatures and 
dry weather in winter wheat growing regions would leave crops 
emerging from dormancy vulnerable to a late-season cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans slumped as rains returned to growing regions  
in Argentina and Brazil, putting farmers there on track toward 
bumper harvests. That would come at a time when U.S. exports are 
lagging because of economic turmoil across the globe, particularly 
in the key Asian buying region. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.72 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.15 1/2 a bushel; March oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.06 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 1 cent to $5.13 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle fell .83 cent to 61.97 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell 1.10 cents to 72.65 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell 2 cents to 40.80 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell 1.23 cents to 54.12 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Draws Outside Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Silver Charm will start from the outside  
post position in a 12-horse field for the $500,000 Donn Handicap 
Saturday at Gulfstream Park, boosting hopes Wednesday for owners 
and trainers hoping to knock off horse racing's star attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	A chorus of ``ooohs'' went up when it was announced Silver Charm  
had drawn the outside post for Saturday's race. The big gray horse, 
who shipped in from California on Tuesday, still was made the 8-5 
early favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too bad,'' trainer Bob Baffert said, with a straight  
face. ``You can only get bumped from one side that way. Once you 
have it, you've got to work with it. This should make it 
interesting. We'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, winner of the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
and the $4 million Dubai World Cup last year, is chasing Cigar's 
all-time earnings record of $9,999,815. He's earned $6,633,006 for 
owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. Second in career money earnings is 
Skip Away, the 1998 Donn winner, who retired with $9,616,360. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donn will be Silver Charm's second start as a 5-year-old. He  
won the San Pasqual Handicap Jan. 10, changing his stalking style 
to come from off the pace and overtake Crafty Friend and Dramatic 
Gold and win by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary (jockey Gary Stevens) says we'll just ask him (to run)  
when it's time to ask him,'' Baffert said. ``Silver Charm's kind of 
a lazy dude -- does enough to get by, like me. But he's so talented, 
he can get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's challengers, meanwhile, drew encouragement from  
Silver Charm's bad draw. Ralph Ziadie, trainer of Sir Bear, went so 
far as to predict an upset. Sir Bear, the second favorite at 4-1, 
will start from the No. 7 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would be surprised if Sir Bear wins, Ziadie said:  
``No. As a matter of fact, I think he's going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Bear, who finished third in last year's Donn, made his 1999  
debut by winning the Broward Handicap by three-quarters of a length 
over Behrens Jan. 9 at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, weren't so bold as Ziadie.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be in it to win it,'' said jockey John  
Velazquez, whose Unruled will start on the rail. ``He's going to be 
in with some real good horses. We'll see. I hope we can run him 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, another California-based starter, third choice at  
6-1, will start from six hole. A late entry was Littlebitlively, 
who was being shipped from Ocala, Fla., to join the field. He drew 
the No. 5 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm was assigned 126 pounds, with Sir Bear and Puerto  
Madero next at 120 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donn is the debut race of the NTRA Champions series, 11  
televised races designed to showcase horse racing's older 
champions. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association set up the 
series as a way to increase the sport's visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's field, in post-position order is Unruled, John  
Velazquez, 112 pounds; Crypto Star, Robbie Davis, 114; Truluck, 
Mike Smith, 111; Hanarsaan, Joe Bravo, 110; Littlebitlively, Eibar 
Coa, 113; Puerto Madero, Kent Desormeaux, 120; Sir Bear, Jerry 
Bailey, 120; Early Warning, Shane Sellers, 112; Behrens, Jorge 
Chavez, 113; Willing, Richard Migliore, 111; Frisk Me Now, Pat Day, 
117, and Silver Charm, Gary Stevens, 126.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Buck Williams Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Buck Williams, one of the greatest power  
forwards in NBA history, announced his retirement Wednesday after a 
17-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who spent the last two years with the Knicks after  
playing seven seasons in Portland and eight in New Jersey, was one 
of the league's most durable and consistent big men over the past 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tremendous journey, but the time has come for me  
to move on and do other things with my life,'' Williams said at a 
Madison Square Garden news conference before the Knicks' first 
exhibition game. ``I feel proud to leave with dignity and honor 
while there's still something left in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``My new lifestyle of spending more time at home carried more  
weight than playing another year,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NBA's rookie of the year in 1981-82 and a  
three-time All-Star, retires in fourth place on the league's list 
of games played (1,307), eighth in minutes (42,464) and 10th in 
rebounds (13,017). 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of only seven players to amass more than 6,000 points  
and 13,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every player thinks about the Hall of Fame, and I would be  
lying if I said I didn't. I would love to go into the Hall of 
Fame,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams came to his decision in part because of the realization  
that there might not be a place for him on New York's roster. His 
name popped up in a trade rumor last week involving Dennis Rodman, 
and he had not been practicing with New York since training camps 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed 33 games last season after undergoing knee surgery --  
the first surgical procedure of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said his fondest memories will be of the coaches he  
played under, mentioning Jeff Van Gundy, Larry Brown and Rick 
Adelman by name. He also said he as proud to have played so well in 
his final game -- a 12-point, 14-rebound effort against Miami in 
Game 5 of the first round of the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	His only regret, he said, was never having won a title.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams played in the NBA finals twice for Portland, losing to  
Detroit in 1990 and Chicago in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come to the realization that for some people a  
championship is just not in the cards,'' Williams said. ``Now I 
have to give up on the dream that I chased for 17 years. I think 
that's really the only thing missing from my resume.''

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Profits Rise 13 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp., the East Coast regional  
phone giant, recorded a 13 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits 
on growing demand for high-speed data and mobile-phone services. 
The results matched Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic reported Wednesday it earned $1.06 billion, or 65  
cents per share, in the October-December quarter, up from $940 
million, or 60 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 5 percent to $8.08 billion from $7.70 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The recent quarter's profits were reduced by 4 cents per share  
to cover continuing transition costs related to Bell Atlantic's 
1997 merger with Nynex Corp. Excluding those costs, Bell Atlantic 
met analysts' expectations for profits of 69 cents per share, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic shares closed up 18 3/4 cents at $55.75 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter growth was fueled by 30 percent rise in sales  
of high-speed data services and a 13 percent rise in sales of 
wireless services. Bell Atlantic also saw a 1 percent gain in sales 
of optional phone services such as Caller ID and voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Bell Atlantic agreed to merge with GTE Corp. in a  
deal that aims to create a huge provider of all-in-one 
telecommunications services, including long- distance, local and 
wireless calling. The merger is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Bell Atlantic earned $2.97 billion, or $1.86  
per share, up from $2.45 billion, or $1.56 per share, in 1997. 
Revenue rose to $31.57 billion from $30.19 billion.

	Senate Doesn't Dismiss Charges  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has refused to dismiss the  
impeachment case against President Clinton and voted to subpoena 
witnesses. The voting was mostly along party lines. That means 
House prosecutors will likely call Monica Lewinsky and two other 
witnesses. The vote was 56-44 to reject a motion that would have 
dismissed perjury and obstruction of justice charges against 
Clinton. The vote was identical for the subpoena vote.

mass for more than 100,000 celebrants and he covered some familiar 
themes at the Trans World Dome, urging his audience to be 
``unconditionally pro-life'' and spare even those who commit 
heinous crimes. Besides capital punishment, John Paul railed 
against abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide. The 78-year-old 
pontiff said the ``dignity of human life must never be taken 
away.'' He drew thunderous applause.

appointed his eldest son as crown prince and flew to the United 
States for treatment. Hussein was readmitted to the Mayo Clinic in 
Rochester, Minn., for treatment of a relapse of non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma. A statement from his medical team and Jordanian advisers

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A recklessly honest former  
member of the Irish Republican Army was found dead on a rural 
roadside today. Relatives of Eamon Collins -- who wrote about his 
work as an IRA intelligence agent in the 1997 book, ``Killing 
Rage'' -- identified his battered body. Police said they could not 
immediately tell whether he had been shot. There was no claim of 
responsibility. But Collins, 45, had made many enemies by 
confessing his crimes -- and implicating other IRA members -- to 
police interrogators in 1985.

	TORONTO (AP) -- Canadian men are crossing the world's longest

shopping lists: Viagra. Some travel hundreds of miles; others need 
only cross a bridge into Detroit or Buffalo. With the famed 
anti-impotence drug still not approved at home, Canadians account 
for up to 80 percent of the Viagra purchases at some U.S. 
pharmacies close to the border.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Wants Monetary Union With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The head of the Mexican Bankers Association  
said Wednesday the country should consider stabilizing its currency 
through a monetary union with the United States -- a move that could 
make the dollar the national currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``A first step could be the setting up of a currency board, and  
afterwards the establishment of monetary union,'' association 
president Carlos Gomez y Gomez said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez y Gomez said the Mexican peso's current free-floating  
foreign exchange regime has been very useful, but that monetary 
union would provide additional stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The peso traded Wednesday at about 10.18 to the U.S. dollar.  
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a currency board or a dollarization Mexican economy  
has been widely aired among private sector organizations, but 
Mexican officials have said they are not considering such a move at 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions on the issue increased after Argentina said last  
week it was mulling whether to make its economy dollar-based.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Down Down 36.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were lower at midday after giving  
up substantial early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 36.04 at 9,288.54, after shooting as high as 9,385.60, up 61 
points, on a burst of computerized buy programs in the first 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow added 121.26 to 9,324.58, leaving it 318  
points shy of its closing record of 9,643.32 on Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes were lower but trimming their losses. The  
Nasdaq composite was down 0.77 at 2,432.64, after rising as high as 
2464.12, up 30 points, in the first hour, then dipping nearly 9 
points before swinging back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was off 1.35 at 1,250.96,  
after giving up a gain of 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks rose at the open after Amazon.com released a  
smaller-than-expected loss and eBay's earnings beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon shares were up 17 19/32 at 132 11/16, while eBay's were  
up 89 1/8 at 310. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``technology stocks have slowed down a little bit,'' said  
Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago. 
``The number one question for the bulls is, do they have the fire 
power to fulfill widespread expectations?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nie said that while volume was impressive Tuesday at over 1  
billion shares on the Big Board, he was concerned that the number 
of rising shares barely beat decliners. ``We need dynamic breadth 
in this market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today on the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues  
outnumbered decliners by a 11-to-7 margin on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume came to 408.59 million shares, up from 
Tuesday's pace of 358.36 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow components were led lower by IBM, down 3 13/16 at 181 13/16,  
and J.P. Morgan, down 1 at 103 1/4. Financial services stocks were 
generally lower on concerns about Brazil, where the currency was 
taking another big hit today. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks, however, were higher. Dow component Merck was up  
13/16 at 144 13/16.

<HEADLINE> Pitt's Primus Posts Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former University of Pittsburgh basketball  
guard Fred Primus, charged during a road trip with stealing jewelry 
valued at $2,200, has posted bond on theft charges and applied for 
a first-time offender's program. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt officials apparently expect Primus, a 19-year-old freshman  
from Washington, D.C., to resume classes this week. But, citing 
student privacy rules, they declined to say whether he has returned 
to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Primus was charged with grand theft and receiving stolen  
property after friends of another former player reported the 
jewelry missing following a visit to their Malvern, Pa., home by 
four Pitt players on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Primus, Jarrett Lockhart, Ricardo Greer and Jason Boyd had  
visited the home to watch Mike Tyson's comeback fight, which was 
not available at the hotel where the players were staying. Shortly 
thereafter, the jewelry was discovered missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd, later dismissed from the team by Pitt coach Ralph Willard,  
was reinstated on Wednesday. Willard initially said Boyd was 
disciplined because the players skipped an 11:30 p.m. curfew and 
left their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I am disappointed with any violation of team rules,  
after a complete review of all the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the incident, I felt it was appropriate to reinstate 
Jason,'' Willard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard said none of the other three players had any knowledge  
of the theft, which apparently occurred after Primus briefly left 
the group to go to the bathroom.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky's Words Ripe for Twisting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky says President Clinton never  
told her to lie under oath about their affair, but did he make 
clear that was exactly what he wanted her to do? 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are likely to ask Ms. Lewinsky about her additional  
statement that Clinton never urged her to tell the truth. ``And by 
him not calling me and saying that, ... I knew what that meant,'' 
she told a grand jury last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers will want the former White House intern  
to reinforce her assertion that ``no one ever asked me to lie, and 
I was never promised a job for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how much new information lawyers in Clinton's  
impeachment trial will get from Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. Senators 
ordered all three Wednesday to submit to sworn questioning, and a 
vote is expected later on whether they must testify in the Senate 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want Ms. Lewinsky to testify ``because they know  
everybody will watch if she testifies and it will stir up a tempest 
of emotions,'' said New York trial lawyer Gregory Joseph. ``They 
want to do something to generate public emotion, because that's the 
only way they can sway this jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In cross-examination, Clinton's defense lawyers will be looking  
for ``character testimony,'' Joseph added. 
</P>
<P>
	For example: Did the president ask you to lie? Did the president  
ask you to do anything dishonest? The expected answers would be 
``of course not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to just throw water on the fire,'' Joseph said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have plenty of questions for Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan  
and Blumenthal in their uphill effort to persuade the Senate to 
remove Clinton from office for trying to cover up his affair with 
the former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer E. Lawrence Barcella said a crucial  
prosecution question for Ms. Lewinsky is whether when she was 
preparing a sworn statement in Paula Jones' sex-harassment lawsuit 
against Clinton, ``Was there any doubt in your mind that the 
president wanted you to conceal the illicit relationship?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, what were her conversations with Clinton about the  
possibility of her testifying? What about Jordan's effort to find 
her a job, and was it connected to her plans to file the statement 
denying an affair with Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky is likely to be asked about Dec. 28, 1997, when  
presidential secretary Betty Currie came to her home to pick up 
gifts Clinton had given her. Ms. Lewinsky has said Mrs. Currie 
initiated the pickup, while Mrs. Currie said she thought Ms. 
Lewinsky called her about the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	This ground has been covered before, but St. John's University  
law professor John Q. Barrett said prosecutors will be hoping ``a 
witness will change testimony or expand testimony or in some way 
pay off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan may be asked what he meant in January 1998 when he said  
``mission accomplished'' in telling Mrs. Currie his efforts had 
resulted in a New York job offer to Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also may want to know:  
</P>
<P>
	--Were Jordan's efforts on Dec. 11, 1997, to find Ms. Lewinsky a  
job related to the appearance of her name a few days earlier on a 
witness list in the sex-harassment case? 
</P>
<P>
	--Did Jordan see and suggest changes to an unsigned version of  
Ms. Lewinsky's sworn statement that denied the affair? Ms. Lewinsky 
said he did. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jordan's response to Ms. Lewinsky's assertion that she told him  
her former friend Linda Tripp might have seen notes she wrote to 
Clinton. Ms. Lewinsky quoted Jordan as saying: ``Go home and make 
sure they're not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal is expected to be asked about his conversations with  
Clinton shortly after the scandal became public in January 1998. 
Blumenthal earlier testified that Clinton said he rebuffed sexual 
demands from Ms. Lewinsky and that she told Clinton she was known 
as a ``stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Barcella said prosecutors ``want to make the  
president look smarmy. He used this woman, he used his best friend, 
and he used his spinmeister.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Scraps Non-Internet Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines has withdrawn the surcharge it  
had imposed earlier this month in an effort to encourage people to 
book their tickets on its Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Kay Horner cited competitive reasons for the quick  
removal of the 2-week-old fee, which added $2 on domestic roundtrip 
tickets booked anywhere else but through its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market spoke -- and we responded,'' she said Tuesday,  
declining further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Society of Travel Agents had been sharply critical  
of Delta's surcharge, saying it was discriminatory against people 
who preferred travel agents or didn't have ready access to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a clear victory for consumers,'' James Ashurst, a  
spokesman for the group, said Tuesday. ``I think the traveling 
public has spoken volumes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its earlier message to travel agents, Delta had blamed  
soaring costs of traditional booking methods for imposing the 
surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
	Also this month, Alaska Airlines instituted a $10 surcharge for  
passengers who want a paper ticket. The fee only covers tickets 
bought directly from Alaska Airlines or its regional affiliate 
Horizon Air; it does not affect tickets purchased from a travel 
agent or when an electronic ticket is unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Mesa Settles Lawsuit Out of Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Seattle Mariners pitcher Jose Mesa has settled  
a civil lawsuit filed by one of two women who accused him of sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was settled out of court Tuesday, less than a week  
before trial was scheduled to begin. Terms of the settlement were 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine M. Allen, of North Royalton, was one of two women who  
accused Mesa of sexual assault in a suburban Cleveland motel on 
Dec. 22, 1996. Mesa was with the Cleveland Indians at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitcher was acquitted of rape and other criminal charges in  
1997, the same year Allen filed her civil complaint in Cuyahoga 
County Common Pleas Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mesas are glad the matter is resolved and are happy to get  
on with their lives,'' said Gale Messerman, Mesa's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's lawyer, James W. Burke Jr., would not comment on the  
settlement other than to say it was settled ``to the mutual 
satisfaction of both parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said she was assaulted by Mesa and was injured when he  
opened the bathroom door in the motel room, striking her in the 
face. Burke said his client had to undergo $4,000 in dental and 
medical procedures as a result.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Reports Earnings Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont's fourth-quarter earnings  
declined due to weak markets in the chemical industry, though it 
still beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Not including non-recurring items, DuPont earned 60 cents a  
share, down from 65 cents in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted earnings of 58  
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $6.46 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31,  
compared to $6.07 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, the Wilmington-based DuPont earned $4.5 billion,  
or $3.90 a share, compared with $2.4 billion, or $2.08 a share, for 
the prior year. The 1998 results include a $2.4 billion gain from 
Dupont's spinoff of its Conoco energy subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year were $25.7 billion, up from $25.1 billion for  
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``After four years of record earnings, we are disappointed by  
these results but not discouraged for the future,'' said DuPont 
chairman and chief executive Charles O. Holliday Jr. in a 
statement. ``In this environment, almost half of our business units 
successfully increased their earnings year over year. Our view of 
the global economy suggests several more quarters of low volume 
growth and continued price pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Crooks, an analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.  
in Philadelphia, said the earnings were in line with his 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company has been seeing the whole deflationary trend in  
their prices since mid-'95 and volumes continue to eek along. Asia, 
however, seems to have hit bottom and maybe is turning up a bit,'' 
Crooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dupont, which has operations in 70 countries  
worldwide, fell 75 cents to $53.12 1/2 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> That's Entertainment! That's Life! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``The phenomenon of a Richard Simmons fascinates  
me. What other culture would anoint a diet guru who's fat? He's 
this fat little guy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like it matters. Neal Gabler knows full well why America  
embraces clownish, roly-poly Simmons: He's entertaining. As he 
would have to be. In a nation bathed in hot and cold running 
entertainment, why would any of us waste time on someone who 
doesn't amuse us? 
</P>
<P>
	But it goes a little further. Gabler says our entertainment  
whirlpool has taken us beyond passive audience state, and absorbed 
us into the act. ``Life has become art,'' he declares, ``so that 
the two are now indistinguishable from each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happens when all of us Tickle Me Elmos start tickling back?  
Gabler explores such questions in his new book ``Life the Movie,'' 
subtitled ``How Entertainment Conquered Reality. Starring 
Everyone.'' (Rolling! Action! Welcome to the world of 
post-reality!) 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment drives the economy,'' Gabler says. ``But while I  
mean conventional entertainment, I'm also talking about the way we 
want to perform in our own lives, so that we buy clothes, we buy a 
car, we live in a house, and we use a certain toothpaste, all of 
which contribute to the image that we want to project as 
entertainers performing our own lives for the audience of others -- 
and ourselves, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it's one for the money, two for the show, and -- uh-uh, honey  
-- don't step on my Air Jordans! 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm no prophet of doom,'' says Gabler, a dapper man with a  
salt-and-pepper beard who authored the splendid Walter Winchell 
biography ``Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity.'' Talking 
about his new book, he speaks in thoughtful pauses and animated 
bursts. And he radiates unapologetic good cheer. ``I don't say, 
`Entertainment debases us and destroys our cultural values.' I love 
entertainment!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, expect no happy ending in ``Life the Movie.'' Nor, for  
that matter, any quick fix for the problems that crop up in a 
society when reason is upstaged by sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment mentality demands that at the end you give the  
answer,'' Gabler says with a knowing smile. ``My book does not 
fulfill that expectation. Because, to my mind, the answer is too 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then why read it?  
</P>
<P>
	``I do think that this is a culture where people want to  
understand their own obsessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A cultural historian, Gabler has the presence of mind to look  
back. By doing so, he upends some popular assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he disputes the notion that television is to  
blame for all of society's ills. TV, he says, ``is a subset of the 
larger entertainment revolution, not the cause of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the Internet is simply another technology like  
television, radio or movies that will be driven to satisfy, first 
and foremost, our entertainment lust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about that common complaint that the business of  
news-gathering has somehow shamed itself in the age of O.J. 
Simpson, Princess Diana, Monica-and-Bill and other real-life 
melodramas? Not so. Entertainment hasn't compromised journalism, 
Gabler argues. It was journalism that pioneered mass entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	News as we think of it today didn't exist before the 1830s and  
the ``penny press'' papers. ``They purveyed news for its 
entertainment value,'' Gabler says. ``That's what they were all 
about.'' By such reckoning, it's The National Enquirer, not The New 
York Times, that follows in the footsteps of the Fourth Estate's 
founders. 
</P>
<P>
	But here's perhaps the book's biggest insight. Despite the  
outcry of parents and busybody virtuecrats, TV series like ``South 
Park'' and ``Jerry Springer'' don't inevitably trigger moral 
decline and national decay. 
</P>
<P>
	On the contrary, says Gabler, viewer support of rude, crude and  
lowbrow entertainment is not only as American as apple pie, it is 
pie in the face of its harshest detractors -- a democratic Bronx 
cheer aimed at society's bluenoses; an ongoing declaration of 
independence against Old World-brand stuffed shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most critics would say entertainment culture is `default  
culture' for the mentally impaired,'' Gabler notes. ``They would 
say that's why we like television, rock music and trashy novels -- 
because we're dumb! 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm saying we like these things BECAUSE they're  
anti-cultural, that the entertainment culture was devised 
deliberately as a way of challenging high culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So take that, Alexis de Tocqueville and Bill Bennett! We love  
``Beavis and Butt-head''! (Are we having fun yet?) 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`CUPID': TV reviewers often hate what they see, and say so. But  
not always. New York Post critic Michele Greppi absolutely loves 
``Cupid.'' She loves this low-rated ABC comedy-drama so much, she 
had a contest and invited its winners to a viewing party. She 
reports that her 18 guests loved the show, and promised to go forth 
and multiply -- recruiting their friends to watch ``Cupid,'' too, 
when it airs Thursday at 9 p.m. EST. ``Cupid'' is about Trevor 
Hale, who presents himself as the Roman god of love when he turns 
up in a Chicago mental ward. Dr. Clair Allen, a renowned 
psychologist and relationship expert, is sure he's a self-deluded 
fraud. But is he? Meanwhile, Hale insists he has been expelled from 
Mount Olympus and must bring together 100 couples before he can go 
home. Starring Jeremy Piven, the show is a mystery (is this guy a 
nut case or the supernatural real deal?), as well as a showcase for 
fascinating ruminations on the nature of love and companionship. 
It's a show to watch, fall in love with, and tell your friends 
about. And since it's sitting at the bottom of the ratings, there's 
no time to waste.

<HEADLINE> Hoeppner Named Miami, Ohio, Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Ohio (AP) -- A lot of things made Terry Hoeppner a  
leading candidate to succeed Randy Walker as Miami University's 
head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner has been an assistant at Miami for 13 years. His  
defenses were consistently the best in the Mid-American Conference. 
His two daughters are Miami graduates and his son is a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	Those all were selling points at a school that calls itself the  
Cradle of Coaches and emphasizes loyalty. There was one more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly, the guy can coach,'' athletics director Joel  
Maturi said, before introducing Hoeppner as head coach on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner, 51, was assistant coach and defensive coordinator  
under Walker, who rebuilt a downtrodden program in the 1990s and 
led Miami to a 10-1 mark last season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Walker left to become head coach at Northwestern one week  
ago, Hoeppner became the top in-house candidate to replace him. He 
wanted the job and got the backing of his players -- a major factor 
in his selection. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of players met twice with Maturi, lobbying for Hoeppner.  
</P>
<P>
	``Without the players' support, I don't think I would have  
gotten this job,'' Hoeppner said. 
</P>
<P>
	From the players' standpoint, hiring Hoeppner was the best way  
to keep continuity in a program that has gone 18-4 over the last 
two seasons and has the core of a 10-1 team coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one thing we wanted to emphasize: Right now, we're in a  
position to be an outstanding team next year,'' quarterback Mike 
Bath said. ``We didn't think that having a new coaching staff 
coming in and everything would be the best possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner wore a red Miami tie for his introduction in the Cradle  
of Coaches Room, a wood-paneled room at the football stadium 
decorated with framed black-and-white photographs of prominent 
Miami coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The honor roll includes Sid Gillman, Woody Hayes, Ara  
Parseghian, John Pont, Bo Schembechler, Bill Mallory and Dick Crum. 
Hoeppner has an autographed copy of Hayes' football book and is 
aware of the coaching legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to being part of the Cradle of Coaches,''  
he said. ``When Joel offered me the job yesterday, it didn't take 
me long to accept. I don't think he had the whole sentence out of 
his mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner grew up in Indiana and graduated from Franklin College.  
He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals as an undrafted free agent, 
but got hurt in training camp. He was with the Green Bay Packers 
for one year as a nonroster defensive back and never got to play in 
an NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a high school coach and an assistant at Franklin College  
before going to Miami as linebacker coach. He was elevated to 
defensive coordinator for 1995, and Miami's defense finished second 
in the nation that year in yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's defenses have led the Mid-American Conference in three  
of the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat Northwestern 30-28 in 1995, the Wildcats' only  
regular-season loss. The schools will open next season at 
Northwestern, matching Walker and Hoeppner on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``As for Randy, he's got a tough task ahead,'' Hoeppner said.  
``And I've got a bunch of (players) standing in the back of the 
room who are going to make that a special day for us.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Rails Against Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II brought his campaign against  
capital punishment to a death-penalty state in America's heartland 
Wednesday, urging 100,000 worshippers to spare even those who 
commit ``great evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform,'' he said 
during a Mass at the Trans World Dome on the final day of his visit 
to the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a  
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and 
unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message may have had particular relevance in Missouri, where  
the state Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an 
execution that was to have taken place while the pope was in town. 
Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the delay ``a 
mockery.'' On Jan. 13, a killer was executed by injection in 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the largest crowd of his 30-hour visit to the United  
States, his fifth to the U.S. mainland, the pope also lashed out 
against abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide, and declared 
that ``the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in 
the case of someone who has done great evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also invited Roman Catholics separated from their faith to  
return to the church, even if there are ``obstacles to Eucharistic 
participation,'' a reference to divorce and remarriage. 
</P>
<P>
	And he called on his flock to end racism. Racism is ``a plague  
which your bishops have called one of the most persistent and 
destructive evils of the nation,'' the stooped, 78-year-old pontiff 
said, his voice hoarse and his words slurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, John Paul was to meet with civil rights pioneer  
Rosa Parks, the black seamstress whose refusal to give up her seat 
on a segregated bus in 1955 led to the Montgomery, Ala., bus 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff also was scheduled to deliver an evening prayer  
service at the Cathedral Basilica and meet with Vice President Al 
Gore before leaving for Rome on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people filled the seats of the Trans World  
Dome and a convention center adjacent to the football stadium, 
where the pope's image was projected on giant TV screens with 
running captions of his homily. One thousand priests celebrated 
Mass with the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The faithful came for blessings, cures or just a glimpse of the  
man credited with hastening the fall of Communism and lessening 
religious restrictions in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Ida Costa, a cancer-stricken 77-year-old woman from Little Rock,  
Ark., looked for a miracle cure from the pope: ``I'll get the 
blessings God wants to shower upon me in his presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Mary DeLonais of Springfield, Ill., was a forest ranger  
when she saw the pope in Denver in 1993. ``Part of the pope's final 
blessing was a prayer for vocations,'' she recalled. She since has 
become a nun. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's condemnation of the death penalty brought mixed  
reactions from those at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I guess we've all got a right to live, but I  
don't know, especially when they take someone else's life,'' said 
William Walker of Alton, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic, it's easy to be against abortion,'' said  
Douglas Marshall of St. Louis. But as for sparing the life of an 
evil person, ``that's the thing. It all boils down to a matter of 
forgiveness. Are you willing to forgive an evil person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope arrived in St. Louis on Tuesday after five triumphant  
days in Mexico. He met with President Clinton and attended a youth 
rally where he got rock-star treatment from the crowd of 20,000. 
His message: that Americans should use their freedoms responsibly 
and strive for a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting for the pope to go back and start his  
pilgrimage in Mexico, to close the gap between Mexico and the 
United States,'' Rosalia Vazquez, 21, said in St. Louis.

	Timetable for Senate Trial Uncertain  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Majority Leader Trent Lott said he hoped for  
an agreement by Thursday on a timetable for the impeachment trial 
after the Senate voted Wednesday to subpoena three witnesses. 
Monica Lewinsky, Sidney Blumenthal and Vernon Jordan will be 
subpoenaed. Earlier, the Senate voted not to dismiss the 
impeachment case against President Clinton. The margins on both 
votes were 56-44. White House lawyers have warned repeatedly that 
calling any witnesses would mean protracted delays in the trial.

	Pope Departs for Rome

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II is on his way back to Rome,  
after wrapping up a 30-hour visit to St. Louis. At an airport 
departure ceremony, the pontiff was accompanied by Vice President 
Gore and his wife, Tipper. Earlier Wednesday, the pope urged a 
crowd of 100,000 in St. Louis to spare even those who commit 
``great evil'' from capital punishment. He also met with 
85-year-old civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks, the black seamstress

	Military Rule Ends in Honduras  
</P>
<P>
	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Decades of military dominance  
formally ended Wednesday when the Honduran commander-in-chief tuned 
over control of the armed forces to a civilian president. Brig. 
Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco handed his baton of command to President 
Carlos Flores Facusse, one day after the Honduran legislature voted 
unanimously to end more than 41 years of military autonomy. 
Legislators from five parties on Tuesday ratified constitutional 
reforms approved in September that eliminate the position of 
commander-in-chief of the army and disband the Superior Council, 
the top military body.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israelis closely monitored reports on the  
health of the Jordanian king Wednesday, anxious for news of their 
closest ally in the region. A day earlier, King Hussein returned to 
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota because of a recurrence of lymphatic 
cancer. ``The relations between Israel and Jordan have strategic 
importance to the two countries,'' Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu said Tuesday night, adding that he did not expect that to 
change.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is set to acquire the automotive  
operations of Sweden's Volvo AB, according to published reports 
Wednesday. The trade publication Ward's Automotive Reports said 
Volvo has been asking for $7 billion. Business Week magazine, in a 
story posted Wednesday night on its Web site, said Ford's $6 
billion offer won out over a $7 billion bid by Italy's Fiat SpA, 
which also wanted to purchase Volvo's commercial truck business. 
Business Week said an announcement would be made Thursday.

	Fla. County Sues Gun Industry  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami-Dade County today joined a growing list of  
municipalities suing gun makers, filing a lawsuit in hopes of 
holding the industry responsible for the costs of gun-related 
deaths and injuries. The lawsuit alleges that manufacturers 
negligently design their guns, failing to employ safety devices 
that could alert users to a round in the chamber or prevent firing 
by children. The suit does not list a specific figure in damages. 
Miami-Dade is following New Orleans, which in October became the 
first government to sue the industry, and Chicago, which filed a 
$433 million suit in November.

	McMURDO BASE, Antarctica (AP) -- World officials wrapped up their

of environmental threats to the frozen continent, where cruise 
ships dump garbage and illegal fishing boats plunder the icy 
waters. Environmentalists had urged the delegates from Antarctic 
treaty member states to propose specific steps to protect the 
world's most unspoiled region. But the officials' final statement 
did little more than list the challenges facing the continent.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell, after receiving a roar of  
approval in pregame introductions, scored 27 points to lead the New 
York Knicks past the New Jersey Nets 88-87. Not only was it the 
exhibition opener for both teams, it also was Sprewell's first NBA 
game in 14 months. Sprewell finished 11-for-14 from the field and 
4-for-4 from the line in 30 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Hitchcock Gets $15.5M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres left-hander Sterling  
Hitchcock, who beat former Cy Young winners in three straight 
playoff starts, agreed Wednesday to a $15.5 million, three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock, who got the largest deal in club history, considered  
going to arbitration and then filing for free agency after the 1999 
season, but said the team's three-year commitment and the fans' 
response during the Padres' World Series run convinced him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a desire to play closer to home than all the  
way across the country, but I'm very comfortable in San Diego,'' 
Hitchcock said from his Florida home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, I think it showed what kind of baseball town it is  
with I don't know how many nights of 60,000-plus attendance. It's a 
hard place to turn down to play when the club shows it's serious 
about keeping you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers said it was imperative to lock up  
Hitchcock, who began 1998 in the bullpen and ended up as MVP of the 
NL championship series win over Atlanta. He'll be the No. 2 starter 
this year behind Andy Ashby, who moves up with the loss of Kevin 
Brown to the division rival Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being left-handed and pitching as well as he did the latter  
part of the season and in the postseason, we just felt it would 
have been very tough to re-sign him if he has a comparable year 
this year and he's a free agent, with where the market is headed,'' 
Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock will turn 28 on April 29.  
</P>
<P>
	``Very few established pitchers come out on the free agent  
market at that young of an age,'' Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock gets a $3 million signing bonus and a $2.5 million  
salary this year. He'll earn $5 million in both 2000 and 2001. He 
made $2.25 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock's deal is $500,000 larger than the three-year contract  
slugger Greg Vaughn signed in February 1997 and the three-year 
extension Andy Ashby, the new staff ace, signed in May 1997. Tony 
Gwynn, who's always taken less to remain in San Diego, is entering 
the second year of a $12.6 million, three-year extension he signed 
in April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Brown will make $15 million in each of the final  
six years of the $105 million, seven-year deal he signed with the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock was brilliant in the postseason, beating Randy Johnson  
in the clinching game of the division series win over Houston, then 
winning against Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a no-decision against another former Cy Young winner,  
David Cone, in Game 3 of the World Series, the Padres were swept by 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to achieve that level on a more consistent basis this  
year is certainly not out of the question,'' said Hitchcock, who 
has an effective split-finger fastball. ``I learned a lot from 
those four outings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock was 9-7 with a 3.93 ERA in the regular season, then  
3-0 with a 1.23 ERA in four postseason starts, with 32 strikeouts 
in 22 innings. For his career he is 48-42 with a 5.07 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss of Brown, pitching coach Dave Stewart, Ken  
Caminiti and Steve Finley, ``we've still got a lot of guys left 
over,'' Hitchcock said.

<HEADLINE> Trying To Cope With Generation X </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the first day of school for Macy's new  
assistant buyers. The twentysomething recruits had barely signed in 
when one bustled up to training chief Bernadette Commisa, asking: 
``How am I doing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That took me back! We had only just come in and taken  
attendance,'' Commisa recalls. ``They see the world a little 
differently than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bold, savvy, confident and often demanding, the 45 million  
youngsters dubbed Generation X are hard to miss in today's 
workplace, and the staider side of Corporate America is only just 
learning -- sometimes with eyebrows raised -- to cope with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies from Macy's to Deloitte Consulting are revamping their  
training and recruiting programs, educating managers and 
streamlining communications to better understand and utilize this 
sometimes maligned generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we were exposed to was the (images of the) earring in the  
nose, snowboards and baggy clothing,'' says Deborah Gatti, senior 
training specialist for Mervyn's department stores. ``We've had to 
train our culture about the great things about these folks, and 
their shortcomings, and how we can support them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Bench, a 24-year-old Mervyn's manager in Okemos, Mich.,  
is well aware of her generation's mixed reputation. ``To me, 
Generation X defines an age group; to others, it defines a work 
ethic and many other things as well,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	But wait. Good young workers have always questioned authority,  
asked lots of questions and rattled their elders' nerves. Is 
today's youth so different? 
</P>
<P>
	It seems so. Just as baby boomers were shaped by Watergate and  
the Vietnam War, the generation that ranges from their 20s up to 
mid-30s has been influenced by this era of technology, television, 
daycare, divorce and downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of growing up in a fast-paced world, these young  
adults are said to be even more skeptical and impatient with the 
status quo than previous generations. Often reared as latchkey 
children, they're fiercely independent, yet needy -- working well 
alone but requiring liberal doses of feedback. Disgusted by their 
parents' workaholism, they defend their right to a full life 
outside of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The GenX age group does come to the workplace with different  
expectations and experiences,'' says Don Blanton, human resources 
director at Sandia National Laboratories, a Lockheed Martin 
subsidiary that has revised key management training programs in the 
last year to include lessons on what makes Generation X tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Just take a look at the many companies this generation has  
started, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Their offices are 
freewheeling, egalitarian, fast-paced, surf's-up kind of places, 
where play is taken as seriously as work. It's no wonder that many 
conservative companies, run by aging baby boomers, have begun 
trying to adapt to this younger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	And adapt they must. A big reason that companies are bothering  
to bend to the new generation is they are literally ``hot stuff.'' 
They get three, four or five offers in this tight job market, and 
many are confident to the point of arrogance. Further, they move on 
quickly. Americans hold an average of nearly nine different jobs by 
their 30s, according to the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's grads are bold enough to ask a prospective employer  
uncomfortable questions such as, ```If I don't like what my boss 
says, can I go to the next level?''' says Debbie Herd, manager of 
college relations for J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the strong economy ... they can ask those questions that  
can push a company close to the edge of not liking them,'' says 
Herd, adding that young candidates have been so tough that J.C. 
Penney tossed its ``fluff'' brochures and now gives out hard-core 
information, even details on salaries, at job fairs and first 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Generation Xers also are making splashes in the workplace.  
Macy's East, a division of Federated Department Stores, had to 
change its training of managers and of new recruits to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers had problems keeping the new generation of executives  
``motivated, stimulated, challenged and growing in their new 
careers,'' recalls Lawrence Naishtut, until recently vice president 
of merchant development and recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18 months ago, Macy's began sending top managers to a  
class on supervising employees that included lessons on Generation 
X. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the older management needed to recognize that life has  
changed,'' said Naishtut. ``Who cares whether (GenXers) are good or 
bad? The bottom line is that they are the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Macy's began training assistant buyers on what  
they could expect at work, since paying dues isn't considered a 
GenX strong suit. ``They're wondering why they're not at the 
Giorgio Armani show the minute they get placed,'' says Commisa, the 
merchant training director. 
</P>
<P>
	Deloitte Consulting, whose average worker is 35-years-old,  
responded to GenX demands for feedback by adding to its evaluation 
process a primer on how to succeed at the company, says human 
resources managing director Karen Morrell. 
</P>
<P>
	GenXers crave such roadmaps in order to manage in a world where  
workers get downsized regardless of seniority and skills quickly 
grow obsolete, says Bruce Tulgan, a Generation X consultant. To 
satisfy their strong needs for independence and recognition, they 
also like to feel they're in the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Mervyn's revamped its recruit training from an ad hoc  
effort largely based on shadowing managers to a more formal program 
that includes self-paced written studies and active training. 
``They've got the remote control,'' says Gatti. ``It's up to them 
to get through the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Hamilton, a 23-year-old Mervyn's manager in San Jose,  
Calif., thoroughly approves. ``For me, to read about and then 
actually do it makes me more comfortable with it,'' he says. ``It 
allows me to feel confident in that task or job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His generation is also comfortable drawing the line at too much  
work. They are driving companies to allow employees to make use of 
work-life programs that were little promoted or honestly supported. 
They clearly reject the baby boomers' workaholic ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Morrell recalls one Deloitte consultant who, after two  
years with the company, asked for a year's paid sabbatical. He 
didn't get it, but she says she has to admire the Generation X 
boldness. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want something, they ask for it, ... (and) it's good  
business sense to listen,'' she says. ``Their sense of balance and 
perspective and self-motivation is very good for our business.''

<HEADLINE> $100M Sought for Child Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for $68  
million to attack childhood asthma and $40 million to subsidize 
training of pediatricians by children's hospitals, a White House 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both initiatives will be included in the proposed fiscal 2000  
federal budget that Clinton will submit next week, said the 
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The asthma plan, to be announced Thursday by first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton at the White House, was billed as the ``first-ever 
comprehensive, administration-wide strategy'' to fight the disease. 
Most of the money -- $50 million -- would be used for competitive 
state grants to identify and treat poor children served by Medicaid 
who have asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was also scheduled to unveil the proposed new  
subsidies for training pediatricians in a speech at the National 
Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now helps pay for the training doctors by  
reimbursing hospitals through the Medicare program for the elderly. 
But that system is based on the number of Medicare patients a 
hospital sees, creating a disadvantage for hospitals that mainly 
treat children. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's hospitals lose money each year, more so than other  
teaching hospitals, partly because of this inequity, the 
administration contends. The $40 million would come through 
existing grant programs and amount to about $9,380 per resident. 
The average hospital would see $689,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The asthma initiative would help schools educate children and  
parents on how to avoid attacks, support research into 
environmental hazards and pay for a public information campaign. It 
would be administered by the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, and was developed 
in part by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 15 years, the number of children with asthma has  
doubled to about 6 million, with an even steeper increase -- about 
160 percent -- among children under age 5. More than 100,000 
children are hospitalized with the ailment each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Black children suffer the most. Their risk of contracting the  
disease is only slightly higher than it is for other children, but 
they are more than four times more likely to die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative being unveiled Thursday would provide:  
</P>
<P>
	--$8.4 million for schools to teach parents and children the  
importance of asthma medication and how to identify and avoid 
materials that trigger attacks. The administration estimates this 
initiative will reach more than 2 million children. 
</P>
<P>
	--$2 million for new research into the role chemicals, pesticides  
and cigarette smoke play in the onset of asthma. Another $1 million 
would be used by EPA to monitor air pollution in two communities to 
examine its relation to asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5.2 million for a public information campaign, including  
posters, flyers and brochures, to reduce children's exposure to 
tobacco smoke and other asthma triggers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Lewinsky Lawyer in Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In trying to enforce what he said was an  
immunity agreement with his client, former Monica Lewinsky attorney 
William Ginsburg was confronted with his own statements to the 
press that conflicted with the position he was taking in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg's dilemma was disclosed Wednesday when a federal court  
released the record of a closed March 5 hearing where Ginsburg 
argued that prosecutor Kenneth Starr's office had already agreed to 
grant Ms. Lewinsky immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors, who prevailed in the case, said there was  
no agreement. Ms. Lewinsky replaced Ginsburg with new lawyers who 
negotiated an immunity agreement with Starr's office in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by one of Starr's prosecutors last March,  
Ginsburg said he was simply fulfilling a promise to Starr's office 
when he told the news media on Feb. 3 and 4 that there was no 
immunity agreement with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ginsburg, just so we're clear here, it's your testimony  
that ... you stated to various reporters, including, for example, 
AP, things to the effect of `We would like immunity,''' the 
prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did everything to keep my word, including deflect all  
questions of any kind about the immunity agreement,'' Ginsburg 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``You consider it a necessary part of your function to say  
something other than what is true to protect the secrecy of this 
agreement. Is that right?'' the prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir, I did at the time,'' Ginsburg replied. ``I never  
lie. I do what is necessary to protect my client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg could not be reached immediately Wednesday for comment.

<HEADLINE> Mobil, Unocal, Conoco Report Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sharply lower prices for crude oil are continuing to take their  
toll on U.S. oil companies. Mobil, Unocal and Conoco all reported 
fourth-quarter losses Wednesday. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Mobil Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest oil company, which is in the midst  
of a merger with No. 1 Exxon Corp., said its loss of $152 million 
during the fourth quarter came as a one-third drop in crude oil 
prices led it to write down the value of its oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss at the Fairfax, Va.-based was the equivalent of 21  
cents a share, compared with earnings of $704 million, or 86 cents 
a share, in the same 1997 period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue tumbled 20 percent to $13.22 billion from $16.57  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil's stock closed down 87 1/2 cents to $87.68 3/4 a share in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Exxon reported a 38 percent drop in fourth-quarter  
earnings, also citing falling oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mobil remains focused on improving performance in this  
difficult environment,'' said Mobil chairman Lucio Noto. ``Business 
fundamentals, as evidenced by the uncertain outlook for prices and 
margins in the near term, continue to be unpredictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil's exploration and producing division lost $135 million in  
the quarter because of the reduced value of its reserves and lower 
oil and natural gas prices. A year earlier, it earned $546 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing and refining operations lost $67 million in the  
quarter vs. earnings of $147 million a year earlier. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cost of Microsoft Browser a Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For all the perilous questions the government  
threw at a Microsoft senior executive on the witness stand of his 
company's antitrust trial, he never got to answer the one he seemed 
most eager to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	How much money has Microsoft spent developing its Internet  
browser software, which it declared in December 1995 will be 
``forever free?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The figure, which has been hinted at but never publicly  
disclosed, is important for the government, which alleges that 
Microsoft invested enormous resources developing its browser but 
decided to give it away free to consumers to undermine Netscape 
Communications Corp., which made popular rival software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government maintains that Microsoft's financial sacrifice  
illustrates what it describes as illegal, predatory behavior toward 
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Paul Maritz surprised the government's lead lawyer,  
David Boies, by offering Tuesday to volunteer ``some rough 
figures.'' Maritz said they included ``salaries of both full-time 
and temporary employees, any money that we paid outside firms who 
work under contract for us, capital equipment and the corporate 
overhead in terms of buildings and facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I could give you a general ballpark figure,'' offered Maritz,  
the highest-ranking Microsoft executive expected to testify at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boies clearly didn't want to hear Maritz's answer -- yet. He  
challenged Maritz over how the company arrived at its estimate. And 
he noted that Maritz answered ``not to my knowledge'' when asked 
during his deposition last April whether Microsoft kept track of 
how much it spent developing its browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, still avoiding the figure Maritz offered, Boies pressed  
the executive to hand over to the government whatever financial 
documents the company had used for its estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will come back to this subject,'' Boies promised Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Boies said today that Microsoft gave him one document it  
prepared in June, after the government filed its lawsuit. Boies 
said he wants to study it but was unsure whether he'll question 
Maritz about the figure until after the company's lawyer brings it 
up in court first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't figure it out,'' Boies said outside court. ``I'm no  
sure what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has suggested previously it gives away its browser  
because it recognized it could earn profits through advertising and 
promotional fees rather than selling its software. 
</P>
<P>
	If it identifies a sufficiently low cost, Microsoft could argue  
that it reasonably expected to recoup its investments and that its 
decision was legally justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier witnesses have only hinted at the cost Microsoft  
incurred. Boies suggested earlier this month, for example, that it 
has spent $500 million since 1994, which an economist testifying 
for Microsoft agreed ``would not strike me as unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Microsoft lawyer Bill Neukom called Tuesday's  
episode ``a very strange exchange.'' But Boies explained that he 
didn't know what number Maritz might produce and didn't want to 
hear his answer ``because I'd rather have the documents so I can 
cross-examine him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He did seem awfully eager to say it, didn't he?'' Boies said.  
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic exchanges inside the courtroom Tuesday marked an  
abrupt turn from the recent dry testimony of economists from both 
sides who focused on legal distinctions of monopoly power, profits 
and price discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies sometimes grabbed his lectern Tuesday and leaned toward  
Maritz in his most aggressive questioning in more than 12 weeks of 
trial. He accused Maritz of promising to ``smother'' Netscape by 
discouraging others from distributing its software and trying 
illegally to drive down its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to compete with them in every way we could,''  
Maritz said. ``If that had an effect on them, it was an inevitable 
consequence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Maritz rarely gave an inch under questioning, frequently  
offering calm but lengthy responses and entirely different 
interpretations of e-mails the government is using as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of Tuesday, even U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield  
Jackson appeared frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This witness is awfully difficult to get an answer from,'' the  
judge said.

<HEADLINE> Lott: Trial May End in 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are ready to make Monica  
Lewinsky a witness in President Clinton's impeachment trial, 
dashing even some GOP hopes for ending the case this week. But the 
Senate's Republican leader suggested today the end is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were expected to muster party-line majorities today  
to defeat a Democratic motion to dismiss the impeachment case and 
approve witness depositions. At the same time, Democrats were ready 
to demonstrate the strength to block the two-thirds majority that 
eventually would be needed to oust Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks before today's votes, Majority Leader Trent Lott  
said, ``There is a point when we will complete the work we are 
involved in and I believe it could be within the next 10 days, two 
weeks at the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who commented in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  
said he and other senators were searching for a bipartisan approach 
to ending the trial. Some of those talks have focused on setting a 
timetable for a vote on the articles of impeachment after witnesses 
are questioned in private. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott won over some wavering Republicans on the issue of deposing  
witnesses after House prosecutors Tuesday restricted their list to 
Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center of the 
sex and cover-up scandal; Vernon Jordan, a Washington attorney and 
longtime Clinton friend, and Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
	The three would face private questioning in sessions likely to  
be videotaped, so that all senators could watch the depositions and 
determine whether to bring the witnesses in for live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the remainder of the trial, Senators from both parties  
emerged from three hours of closed-door deliberations Tuesday, 
confirming that revived negotiations were under way on a bipartisan 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors on Tuesday asked the Senate to invite Clinton  
to testify, but the White House has rejected the idea and Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle called the proposal ``a red herring. 
It is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle warned the trial would plod on indefinitely if witnesses  
were approved, and Clinton lawyer David Kendall said the White 
House would be ``faced with a critical need'' to review mountains 
of previous testimony before deciding whether to seek rebuttal 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, sensing the Senate will not remove Clinton, is considering  
a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to end the trial with 
two votes: the first on whether Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction and the second on whether he should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, interviewed today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''  
said, ``It is well-grounded both in the Constitution and precedents 
to have separate findings of fact, separate from the decision on 
whether or not the offenses ... justify removing him from office. 
Many of us are concerned about whether an acquittal vote -- what 
kind of message that would send to the White House and the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., scoffed at that proposal. ``Our  
vote is whether or not to remove the president,'' he said on ABC. 
``We can admit to the fact the president has not been truthful. ... 
But the question is a judgment question: Do we believe it is 
grounds for overturning an election.The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate, proposed  
ground rules for the witness depositions that would set a four-hour 
maximum for each sworn interrogation -- two hours of questioning by 
the House team and two hours for the president's lawyers. Witnesses 
could be questioned only about areas of factual dispute, and the 
sessions would be videotaped for senators to view. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said on CNN's ``Larry King Live''  
program Tuesday that he, along with GOP Reps. Bill McCollum of 
Florida, James Rogan of California and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas 
most likely would depose the witnesses for the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the depositions, the Senate would decide whether to  
approve live testimony in the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan about his efforts to find  
Ms. Lewinsky a job at the same time she had been subpoenaed in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal is one of the White House aides to whom the president  
falsely denied having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The article of impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says 
Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors, who once talked of seeking up to 15  
witnesses, argued in the trial's public session Tuesday that 
senators should not decide the case just by reading thousands of 
pages of testimony and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demeanor, manner, truthfulness'' must sometimes be determined  
by live testimony, McCollum said, predicting that Ms. Lewinsky 
``will convey this story to you in a way that it cannot be conveyed 
off a piece of paper; it just cannot be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum also promised: ``At no point will we ask any questions  
of Monica Lewinsky about her explicit sexual relations with the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant asked: ``As triers of fact, wouldn't you want to observe  
the demeanor of Ms. Lewinsky and test her credibility? And 
remember, the president's attorneys ... have challenged Ms. 
Lewinsky's version of the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kendall questioned why the Republican team of managers  
didn't call witnesses in the House but rather ``rushed this through 
... because they had the votes. And now they want to delay in the 
Senate because they're afraid they don't have the votes. There is 
no reason ... to drag out these proceedings and defer doing the 
business of the American people.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Limits Gun Buying to 1 a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The City Council unanimously approved an  
ordinance Wednesday limiting people to one handgun purchase each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important stride in preventing gun violence,'' said  
Councilman Mike Feuer, who sponsored the bill. ``We'll take 
whatever steps we need to take locally. It's the real key to 
preventing violent crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modeled after laws in Virginia, Maryland and South Carolina, the  
ordinance prohibits gun dealers from selling more than one handgun 
to a single buyer within a 30-day period. The move is expected to 
create momentum for similar action by county and state leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick O'Malley, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association,  
said the ordinance is a knee-jerk reaction to a recent decision by 
the California Supreme Court regarding West Hollywood's ban on 
cheap handguns, known as Saturday night specials. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling last month essentially gives local  
governments the power to ban gun sales.

<HEADLINE> IOC Bribe Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The worst scandal in the history of the Olympics broke after  
allegations of bribery in Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee says Salt Lake 
City's bid committee spent millions of dollars on 14 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members have been recommended for expulsion and three  
others have resigned. The committee has said it will look into the 
selection process for the Games from 1996 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	In related developments Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Rome's Mayor Francesco Rutelli demanded a new vote for the 2004  
Games, contending the choice of Athens, Greece, was tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	``A panel of IOC experts and athletes gave Rome the No. 1 spot  
on the list of candidates,'' he said. ``Until 24 hours before the 
vote we were in the lead. And then -- who knows what happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--In Greece, the president of Hellenic Olympic Committee, Lambis  
Nikolaou, defended his city's victory. ``The vote is closed,'' 
Nikolaou said. ``The games were given cleanly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Greens faction in Berlin's Senate sent files to the IOC  
from the city's 1993 campaign to win the 2000 Games, which 
eventually went to Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Greens leader Judith Demba called the IOC a ``club of corrupt  
old men'' and said its attempts to clean up its act were not 
credible. She said Berlin bidders spent $1.53 million on travel, 
lodging, car rental, gifts and other expenses for 56 IOC members 
who visited the city. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A police official in Nagano, Japan, said IOC members visiting  
his city received free rides on police helicopters during the 
city's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games. Nagano officials 
already said voters were given free trips to Kyoto and entertained 
by geisha girls. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch himself 
received an expensive painting and a Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In England, the head of Manchester's failed bid for the 2000  
Games said IOC members were taken to tennis matches at Wimbledon 
and soccer games as part of a $9 million campaign. ``Gross 
hospitality is the phrase that I think we can be accused of,'' Bob 
Scott said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Ride Out Currency Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency resumed its  
roller-coaster ride today, with the country losing more dollars and 
showing little sign of calming its economic jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The government raised interest rates to try to stem the outflow  
of dollars and again said it won't step in to prop up the real. But 
even good news on budget-cutting reforms failed to reassure 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The volatility in Latin America's largest economy has worried  
its neighbors and even the United States, which has some 2,000 
corporations and banks operating here. 
</P>
<P>
	When trading opened, the real plunged to 1.93 to the dollar from  
1.82 at Tuesday's closing, before strengthened to 1.90 at 
Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency dealers blamed the morning's downturn on an  
unexpectedly heavy outflow from Brazil initially reported at $538 
million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank later revised Tuesday's dollar outflow to $339  
million, claiming they had mistakenly counted $199 million in 
canceled operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised outflow figures helped the market regain some its  
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's hard currency reserves now stand at about $36 billion,  
including $9 billion in loans led by the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The government expects the real's wild swings will diminish  
within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank removed all restrictions on dollar trading on Jan. 15,  
abandoning its policy of spending reserves to prop up the currency. 
In two weeks, the real has lost about 36 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan said Brazil won't ``burn up'' its  
reserves trying to support the real. 
</P>
<P>
	To stem the outflow, the Central Bank raised it lending rate for  
banks to 34 percent from 32.5 percent. The increase makes it more 
costly for speculators to buy dollars and also gives investors here 
a better return on their money. On Thursday, the rate jumps to 35.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The tension rose despite a victory for the government in its  
efforts to cut the budget deficit this year by about $14.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, the Senate passed a bill that cuts pensions  
for some 300,000 retired federal workers. The bill, which should 
take effect in May, should yield savings of some $2.1 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange closed up only 0.5 percent  
Wednesday after rising 6.3 percent a day earlier.

<HEADLINE> NFL Players `Build' Better Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- No matter who takes the Super Bowl, Ilianne  
Similien is destined to come out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old mother of five was chosen to get one of the 10  
homes to be built by the NFL and the Travel Industry Association of 
America. The two organizations pledged $250,000 to Habitat for 
Humanity to finance the project in Miami's Little Haiti 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Four NFL players managed to peel themselves away from the  
activities of Super Bowl week to help families build the 
foundations to new homes in Little Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	``Owning a home is the one main goal you have in life,'' said  
Shawn Wooden, a safety with the Miami Dolphins. ``I remember what I 
felt like when I first walked into my first house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wooden and Twan Russel of the Washington Redskins, Lawrence  
Wright of the Cincinnati Bengals and retired Atlanta Falcons wide 
receiver Michael Haynes put on tool belts and work gloves to work 
with Georgia-based Habitat for Humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The players built door frames and tore down an abandoned shack.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of players like doing this,'' said Jim Steege, vice  
president of special events for the NFL. ``They're used to 
sweating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results are definitely worth the investment, said Russell, a  
backup linebacker for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't get to own their own home,'' he said.  
``We are giving them a chance to finally reach that goal.''

	Rodman talked about retirement last week, then said he would  
play for the league minimum in Miami or Orlando. The Magic have 
said they're not interested in the 37-year-old cross-dressing

	``I do not mind the clothes he packs in his baggage,'' Riley

win,'' Riley said. ``That could be a legacy of his.''

his individuality.

	``If he wanted to come and be a part of this and be equal, what  
he does away from the court and what his personality is is 
irrelevant to me,'' Riley said. ``But it would have to be on equal 
terms. That's the only way it would work. It could not be any 
double standard in terms of work ethic and practices. It would be 
on the team's terms -- team first, team last.''

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Chief Blasts FAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new chairman of American Airlines urged  
his competitors Wednesday to drop petty differences and work 
together to improve U.S. airports and the nation's air traffic 
control system. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Carty, who succeeded Robert Crandall at American in May,  
was particularly critical of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the International Aviation Club, Carty said over the  
last 20 years the airlines ``continuously reinvented ourselves to 
meet the ever-changing needs of our customers, (but) the FAA has 
never really gone through that exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result is an air traffic control system recently described  
as a `vacuum-tube relic in a microchip world.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Carty said major airlines must unite behind plans to restructure  
how the U.S. air traffic control system operates, as well as behind 
proposals to ensure that airline ticket tax money or other revenue 
streams are devoted to airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have talked about privatizing air traffic control, others  
simply about making the existing system more businesslike. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can marry these two reform proposals -- structural and  
budget -- we're going to be able to achieve the kind of monumental 
change that will have an impact for decades,'' said Carty. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said Carty's remarks ``in totality  
make a constructive contribution to the debate about reaching 
consensus in the aviation industry (and) preparing for growth in 
the next century.'' He said Carty acknowledged ``that not all the 
problems lay with the FAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brenner noted the agency has a major modernization program under  
way and has worked for several years to obtain a stable source of 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and FAA  
Administrator Jane Garvey were in Auburn, Wash., to dedicate the 
first in a new system of replacement screens for air traffic 
controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is also forging ahead with plans to replace  
antiquated air traffic control equipment with devices that work off 
the Global Positioning System satellite network. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first major public appearance in Washington since  
becoming American's chairman and chief executive officer, Carty 
also said: 
</P>
<P>
	--American will continue to pursue its planned alliance with  
British Airways, although government care to avoid antitrust 
problems may limit the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty said the two airlines are exchanging frequent flier miles  
and access to each other's travel lounges, but ``how intimate 
partners we can be'' will be defined by reviews under way by the 
U.S. Justice Department and European Union transportation 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	--American is confident that its computer systems is shielded  
from Year 2000 problems and is sending envoys to its Latin American 
destinations to ensure they, too, will have no computer 
malfunctions when the calendar changes to Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline plans to share its findings with its competitors.  
</P>
<P>
	--American has no plans to acquire America West, the subject of  
recent takeover speculation, but is focusing on plans to 
incorporate into its network its recent acquisition, Reno Air.

<HEADLINE>  Divac Shows Change for Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- His voice rising above the practice  
chatter, Vlade Divac ran up and down the floor, directing and 
encouraging his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac's voice was one of change for the Sacramento Kings.  
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center, signed last week as a free agent to a  
six-year, $62.5 million contract, is part of a wave of newcomers to 
the Kings, who head into the lockout-shortened campaign trying to 
snap their dubious record of 15 straight sub-.500 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of reasons I came here,'' said Divac, who played  
the past two seasons for Charlotte after spending his first six 
with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the contract I wanted and Sacramento is a lot closer to  
my home and my family in Los Angeles. A lot of people told me, 
`Hey, you know, the Sacramento Kings have never been good.' I said, 
`Hey, I'll go there and I'll help make'em good.' 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows it may take some time.  
</P>
<P>
	Of the 19 players in the Kings' training camp, only Corliss  
Williamson was with the team two years ago. He'll fill out the 
front line with Divac and Webber, obtained last summer shortly 
before the lockout was imposed in the trade that sent Mitch 
Richmond to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Divac has already seen some encouraging signs in  
the first few days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you this: this is an unselfish team and that's very  
good,' Divac said. ``I think we do have a chance, just because of 
the short season, to surprise some other teams. With the talent we 
have here now, maybe we can jump on some teams early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the more versatile centers in the league, Divac begins  
the year as one of only five active NBA players with at least 8,000 
career points, 5,000 rebounds, 1,500 blocked shots and 1,000 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a very good all-around player for the center spot.  
You just don't find very many guys like him,'' first-year Kings 
coach Rick Adelman said. ``But what I've really been impressed with 
is his leadership out there. He's very vocal. He really wants the 
team to do well and he's very excited about being here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, Divac missed six weeks of his personal  
workouts after an appendectomy in late October. But he worked his 
way back into shape and even played three weeks for the Red Star 
basketball club in Belgrade before returning to the United States 
earlier this month, when the lockout was settled. The Kings open 
exhibition play Thursday night against Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said it was a stupid thing on the part of players and  
owners,'' Divac said. ``Nobody won, everybody lost and I felt bad 
for the fans.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Prepares Response to IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Andrew Young is a man of integrity, former  
Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne says. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne angrily denied charges that the former Atlanta mayor made  
promises to International Olympic Committee members from Africa in 
order to secure the Games for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask me has Andy always been supportive of the needs of  
Africans in need for almost 40 years, the answer is yes,'' Payne 
said Tuesday. ``But if you ask whether Andy has done or would do 
anything in Africa to direct support to our bid, the answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a great and wonderful man to the core and would not do  
anything on a quid pro quo basis in exchange for votes or 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the state radio station in the Republic of Congo  
reported that Young, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations under President Carter, traveled to Brazzaville in 
1984 to promote Atlanta's bid. According to the report, Young 
promised to build a sports stadium in the capital in exchange for 
the country's support for Atlanta's campaign to host the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were worried about raising enough money for our own  
stadium,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The republic's IOC representative, Jean-Claude Ganga, was one of  
those expelled after an IOC investigation into a bribery scandal 
involving Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games found 
Ganga received more than $216,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he didn't even get the idea to pursue the Olympics  
until 1987, three years after the alleged promise by Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Young may have been in the Congo in 1984 ... but that  
report is clearly false,'' Young spokesman Lee Echols said. ``Andy 
Young never made promises to build facilities nor to provide aid to 
build facilities in relation to the Atlanta Olympic bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Payne and other former Olympic organizers in Atlanta  
were preparing answers to an anticipated inquiry into their bid for 
the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading the investigation  
into the rapidly broadening bribery scandal, recently said he wants 
the IOC to look at the Olympic bids of all cities dating back to 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members have been expelled and another three have  
resigned as a result of the revelations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a sudden rash, as we did in this case, everyone  
assumes everybody did it,'' Payne said. ``That's something the 
opportunity of a formal request will put to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta organizers have not received an official request, and  
U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz said it 
would probably go straight to Atlanta and not through the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trying to make Atlanta look bad,'' Schultz said.  
``This is more of an internal thing inside the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Payne: ``It's kind of, once again, 'rack your brain, rack  
your brain. We're not getting together in a room or anything, but 
we're all glad for the chance to respond in this formal way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne and others involved with the Atlanta bid have continuously  
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our bid would stand a pretty rigorous scrutiny by the  
rules that existed at time,'' said A.D. Frazier, former chief 
operating officer of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. 
``Not only that, but we had six years from 1991 of clean audits by 
Price-Waterhouse. And the AOC (the Atlanta Olympic Committee, which 
handled the bid) had a clean audit.''

<HEADLINE> Workman Trying for Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The old man still has a few springs left in  
his legs. As long as his knee doesn't give out again, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been more than two years since Haywoode Workman last  
played with the Indiana Pacers. Two surgeries and inevitable age -- 
he turned 33 Saturday -- are working against him. But experience and 
desire are in his favor as he tries to keep his spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here for some big games, I played when the team was  
doing well, when we turned it around in '93-94, so right now I've 
just got to find myself on the squad and try to find a place where 
I can help out,'' Workman said after Tuesday's practice. ``There 
are eight or nine guys that are going to play, and I want to be one 
of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 guard, who signed with Indiana as a free agent in  
1993, started 52 games that first season, but mainly came off the 
bench after the Pacers acquired Mark Jackson the next year. Workman 
tore a ligament in his left knee in the fourth game of the 1996-97 
season and missed the rest of that season and all of 1997-98 while 
he recuperated. 
</P>
<P>
	He had another operation last spring to repair damaged  
cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	His first game with the Pacers since the original injury was in  
Sunday's exhibition victory in Chicago. Workman missed his only 
shot, but had two rebounds and four assists in nine minutes off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's fine,'' he said of the knee.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be hard, but I don't think it's that difficult. I've  
been working out for the whole two years, and the past couple days 
in training camp I've just been trying to get a feel. I just have 
to get out here and run and get stronger and get used to running 
and jumping around again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Bird said Workman's return would mean a lot for the  
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to have him healthy and playing for us, because he  
gives us a little more depth and some toughness this team needs at 
times,'' Bird said. ``It's unfortunate he had to sit out two years. 
One year is hard enough, but to come back after two is going to be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he played very well in Chicago. Now he just has to get his  
confidence back, not only in his game but in his knee, and 
hopefully he can go from there and improve. We know we need him 
back in practice now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said most of the players stayed in ``decent shape'' during  
the six-month lockout, when many of the Pacers worked out together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt good. We've always felt good,'' Reggie Miller said.  
``We've been at it a lot longer than a lot of other teams, so we've 
had an advantage that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's still difficult trying to make up for time lost during  
the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's almost like cramming for an exam. You're  
trying to put everything in your offense in, trying to get your 
defensive philosophies down,'' Miller said. ``We've got a veteran 
ball club that can pick up most of the stuff quickly, but it's 
still a long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final exhibition game is Monday night at home against the  
Bulls. The Pacers open the regular season Feb. 5 at home against 
Washington.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Says Farewell to St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A stooped and weary Pope John Paul II bade  
farewell to St. Louis after a six-day journey to the Americas, 
during which he challenged the United States to use its political 
might to make the world a better place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic faithful wept, cheered and waved  
handkerchiefs Wednesday night as the 78-year-old pontiff walked 
hand-in-hand with Vice President Al Gore along the tarmac at 
Lambert Airport before boarding the TWA Boeing 767 for Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Touch me, Holy Father! Touch me!'' a man in a wheelchair  
pleaded over and over. The pope turned from the line of dignitaries 
to bless the man. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's voice was hoarse and his hands were unsteady, but  
during his five-day journey to Mexico City and his 31-hour stay in 
St. Louis, he led worship services for tens of thousands and met 
with presidents and prelates on a schedule that would have 
exhausted a far younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radical changes in world politics leave America with a  
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a 
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he said 
Wednesday evening during a prayer service at the Cathedral 
Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	Power is ``service, not privilege,'' he said. ``Its exercise is  
morally justifiable when it is used for the good of all, when it is 
sensitive to the needs of the poor and defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, making his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland, arrived  
in St. Louis on Tuesday and met with President Clinton, avoiding 
what could have been a supremely awkward moment by making no 
mention of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he warned that the United States faces a moral test  
over abortion and euthanasia, just as it did over slavery on the 
eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	He also attended a youth rally where he got rock-star treatment  
from a crowd of 20,000, and celebrated a Mass for 100,000 
worshippers at the Trans World Dome, where he condemned the death 
penalty in some of his strongest terms yet, saying even those who 
commit ``great evil'' must be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform,'' he said. He 
called the death penalty ``cruel and unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message may have had particular relevance in Missouri, where  
the state Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an 
execution that was to have taken place during the pope's visit. 
Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the delay of Darrell 
Mease's exectuion ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mel Carnahan is reportedly considering a request by the  
pope to commute Mease's death sentence. His execution is scheduled 
for Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's condemnation of the death penalty brought uncertain  
reactions from some of those at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic, it's easy to be against abortion,'' said  
Douglas Marshall of St. Louis. But as for sparing the life of 
somewhat who commits a heinous offense, ``that's the thing. It all 
boils down to a matter of forgiveness. Are you willing to forgive 
an evil person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's prayer service, the pope welcomed Muslims and  
Jews to the Romanesque cathedral that houses the world's largest 
collection of mosaics. For the first time, a rabbi participated in 
a papal prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this prayer signify our shared commitment to ever greater  
understanding and cooperation,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his triumphant visit to Mexico, John Paul celebrated Mass  
before 1 million people at an auto raceway; held a private Mass for 
a select group of 250 bankers, politicians and church patrons; and 
signed a declaration setting out the church's goals in the Americas 
for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration condemned unbridled capitalism, drug  
trafficking, corruption and ``the culture of death'' -- abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. The pope also said the church 
must try harder to reach the rich and powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting for the pope to go back and start his  
pilgrimage in Mexico, to close the gap between Mexico and the 
United States,'' Rosalia Vazquez, 21, said in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Witnesses for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led Senate voted today to  
summon Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses for testimony in the 
impeachment trial after refusing to dismiss the perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Both decisions were along party lines with a single exception,  
Wisconsin Democrat Russell Feingold who voted with the Republicans. 
Though the Democrats lost, the ballots showed the Republicans were 
still well short of the two-thirds majority, 67 votes, that would 
be needed to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will not be removed from office,'' Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle said moments after the votes. ``It is 
time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The identical 56-44 votes authorized subpoenas to summon the  
three witnesses for videotaped depositions and rejected a motion by 
Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia that would have 
dismissed the case brought by the House against the nation's 42nd 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators immediately recessed the trial to discuss among  
themselves how to proceed next. Republicans were pressing a plan 
that could end the proceeding within 10 days if the White House 
does not seek witnesses. Democrats, who are pressing for a censure 
alternative, have offered their own plan and Daschle predicted ``we 
can achieve some compromise procedurally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House pleaded for a quick end. ``Today's events make  
clear that the votes are not there to convict and remove the 
president from office,'' special counsel Gregory Craig said. ``Any 
proceedings from this day forward only serve to delay the final 
resolution of this matter and run counter to the best interests of 
the Congress, the presidency and the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said he believed ``the impeachment  
process would have been abused'' if the case had been dismissed 
today. ``What we're trying to seek out in this trial is the truth 
and to prematurely dismiss that would have been extremely 
disappointing to me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes authorized House prosecutors to question Ms. Lewinsky,  
White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal and presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan about the president's efforts to conceal his affair 
with the former White House intern. After the depositions, House 
prosecutors conceded they didn't have the votes to convict but 
hoped the witnesses' testimony might change minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present time there are not the two-thirds votes  
necessary, but I think it shows that on both sides they're looking 
at the facts, they're stating the facts,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, 
R-Ark., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold said he joined Republicans on the votes today because  
he believed dismissing the case would ``improperly short-circuit 
the case'' before House prosecutors could examine witnesses. But he 
also said his votes should not be construed as a sign he had 
decided to convict Clinton. ``I have not reached a decision on that 
question,'' the Wisconsin Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators stood, one-by-one, as their names were called to  
announce their votes to the packed, hushed, chamber. House 
prosecutors and presidential lawyers sat at their desks keeping 
their own tallies of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP plan, the depositions of the three witnesses would  
begin as early as Thursday and would be videotaped. Each deposition 
would last six hours, equally divided between the White House and 
House prosecutors with two senators sitting in as mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotaped sessions and transcripts would be distributed  
Monday to senators, who would then vote Tuesday on whether to 
permit live testimony. The timetable would allow for that testimony 
and then closing statements from the House managers and White House 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla.,  
acknowledged that ``we kind of need to get a little bit closer on 
some details'' before any bipartisan agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today that if prosecution witnesses are  
allowed the president's lawyers deserve a chance to review some 
56,000 pages in still-secret evidence the House collected during 
the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're now trying to put a blindfold on us,'' press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said, declining to say whether the White House would 
demand to slow things down or call its own witnesses. ``We believe 
we ought to have an adequate chance to get prepared and to present 
a defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After days of being blamed for considering extending the trial,  
Senate Republicans suggested their plan would turn the tables on 
the White House. ``The longer it is prolonged, the more risk to 
their client. If another shoe drops, it's their fault, not ours,'' 
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks before today's votes, Senate Republican leader Trent  
Lott said, ``There is a point when we will complete the work we are 
involved in and I believe it could be within the next 10 days, two 
weeks at the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott won over some wavering Republicans on the issue of deposing  
witnesses after House prosecutors Tuesday restricted their list to 
Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center of the 
sex and cover-up scandal, and then two presidential confidants. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors on Tuesday asked the Senate to invite Clinton  
to testify, but the White House has rejected the idea and Daschle 
called the proposal ``a red herring. It is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle warned the trial would plod on indefinitely if witnesses  
were approved, and Clinton lawyer David Kendall said the White 
House would be ``faced with a critical need'' to review mountains 
of previous testimony before deciding whether to seek rebuttal 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, sensing the Senate will not remove Clinton, is considering  
a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to end the trial with 
two votes: the first on whether Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction and the second on whether he should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., scoffed at that proposal. ``Our  
vote is whether or not to remove the president,'' he said on ABC. 
``We can admit to the fact the president has not been truthful. ... 
But the question is a judgment question: Do we believe it is 
grounds for overturning an election.The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan about his efforts to find  
Ms. Lewinsky a job at the same time she had been subpoenaed in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal is one of the White House aides to whom the president  
falsely denied having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The article of impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says 
Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Says Farewell to St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A stooped and weary Pope John Paul II bade  
farewell to St. Louis after a six-day journey to the Americas, 
during which he challenged the United States to use its political 
might to make the world a better place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic faithful wept, cheered and waved  
handkerchiefs Wednesday night as the 78-year-old pontiff walked 
hand-in-hand with Vice President Al Gore along the tarmac at 
Lambert Airport before boarding the TWA Boeing 767 for Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Touch me, Holy Father! Touch me!'' a man in a wheelchair  
pleaded over and over. The pope turned from the line of dignitaries 
to bless the man. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's voice was hoarse and his hands were unsteady, but  
during his five-day journey to Mexico City and his 31-hour stay in 
St. Louis, he led worship services for tens of thousands and met 
with presidents and prelates on a schedule that would have 
exhausted a far younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radical changes in world politics leave America with a  
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a 
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he said 
Wednesday evening during a prayer service at the Cathedral 
Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	Power is ``service, not privilege,'' he said. ``Its exercise is  
morally justifiable when it is used for the good of all, when it is 
sensitive to the needs of the poor and defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, making his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland, arrived  
in St. Louis on Tuesday and met with President Clinton, avoiding 
what could have been a supremely awkward moment by making no 
mention of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he warned that the United States faces a moral test  
over abortion and euthanasia, just as it did over slavery on the 
eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	He also attended a youth rally where he got rock-star treatment  
from a crowd of 20,000, and celebrated a Mass for 100,000 
worshippers at the Trans World Dome, where he condemned the death 
penalty in some of his strongest terms yet, saying even those who 
commit ``great evil'' must be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform,'' he said. He 
called the death penalty ``cruel and unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message may have had particular relevance in Missouri, where  
the state Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an 
execution that was to have taken place during the pope's visit. 
Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the delay of Darrell 
Mease's exectuion ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mel Carnahan is reportedly considering a request by the  
pope to commute Mease's death sentence. His execution is scheduled 
for Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's condemnation of the death penalty brought uncertain  
reactions from some of those at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic, it's easy to be against abortion,'' said  
Douglas Marshall of St. Louis. But as for sparing the life of 
somewhat who commits a heinous offense, ``that's the thing. It all 
boils down to a matter of forgiveness. Are you willing to forgive 
an evil person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's prayer service, the pope welcomed Muslims and  
Jews to the Romanesque cathedral that houses the world's largest 
collection of mosaics. For the first time, a rabbi participated in 
a papal prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this prayer signify our shared commitment to ever greater  
understanding and cooperation,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his triumphant visit to Mexico, John Paul celebrated Mass  
before 1 million people at an auto raceway; held a private Mass for 
a select group of 250 bankers, politicians and church patrons; and 
signed a declaration setting out the church's goals in the Americas 
for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration condemned unbridled capitalism, drug  
trafficking, corruption and ``the culture of death'' -- abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. The pope also said the church 
must try harder to reach the rich and powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting for the pope to go back and start his  
pilgrimage in Mexico, to close the gap between Mexico and the 
United States,'' Rosalia Vazquez, 21, said in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Rome Offers Few Great Outfits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Rome couture threw some great parties for fashion  
week, but offered little on the runway to wear to them. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring-summer 1999 presentations, which ended in Rome on  
Tuesday night, confirmed Rome's ``dolce vita'' spirit but also 
unmasked the sorry state of Italian high fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sit-down dinners in Renaissance palaces and after-show disco  
events might be the delight of ``paparazzi,'' who were chasing 
television personality Jenny McCarthy and top model Elle 
MacPherson, in town for the baptism of her baby boy. But parties 
can't make up for the absence of big designer names -- and the lack 
of truly new fashion ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact the best party of all -- under a circus tent complete  
with clowns and acrobats -- was about sunglasses, not clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Mattiolo, at 36 the youngest Italian label designer,  
launched his first eyewear collection in his hometown. But when it 
came to clothes, he packed his bags, showing his latest warm 
weather collection in Paris at the couture presentations earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart is Roman, but I need to go where I can promote my  
fashion,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian fashion emigration started with Valentino, who  
abandoned the Rome runway for Paris in the 198O's. The reason was 
the same: Paris is a better launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, after a 1960's heyday when fashion and filmmaking went  
hand-in-hand on the banks of the Tiber, the Romans slowly lost 
their grip on couture. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time Milan, became the center of Italian ready to  
wear and its designers the new favorites of the fashion-conscious 
glitterati. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris saw the writing on the wall and stepped up its couture  
image. Rome fell by the side of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli has tried to revive past glory,  
setting up a fashion agency for the Rome shows and naming actress 
Sophia Loren as its sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the fact that the actress was nowhere to be seen this  
time around, the underlying problem is on -- not off -- the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	A live parrot or dead iguana as integral parts of a dress, or  
five male models who move around the ample skirt of a ball gown to 
bring it to `life', might make fashion headlines, but they'll be 
hard sells even to the most eccentric of private clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately some designers didn't just stop at the bizarre,  
but went on to the bad taste department, showing nude models, 
prints with sacred images wrapped around the body, and madonnas who 
were more sinner than saint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to share the runway with parrots and nudes,'' said  
Rocco Barrocco, a mainstay of the couture scene who is also 
threatening to take his wares to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrocco's Saturday night presentation in a Renaissance palace  
in the center of Rome was one of the week's few moments of true 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	Models in breathtaking silk chiffon sequined gowns slowly walked  
through frescoed halls accompanied by courtiers and fauns, 
compliments of British mime and choreographer Lindsay Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	Also to be commended for good taste were Andre Laug, with the  
perfect spring dress -- a short-sleeved, belted sheath straight from 
the 1960's -- and Renato Balestra, for the exquisite workmanship of 
his floral, hand-embroidered and sequined gowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, this year's warm weather wear promises to be a story  
book garden of delicately sequined gowns in bright floral prints. 
</P>
<P>
	The silhouette is soft and unfussy, with silk chiffon the  
favorite fabric. Heels are generally high. Hairstyles tend to be 
romantic and so does the make-up. 
</P>
<P>
	This round of Roman couture is comfortably old-fashioned.

<HEADLINE> Investors Wonder About '99 Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- As we head toward a new millennium, U.S. investors  
find themselves finishing the century on an uneasy note. Following 
four straight excellent years, 1999 looks a little less clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy remains strong, but markets around the rest of the  
world, from Asia to Russia to Latin America, are shaky, and 
investors worry about what impact the decline will have on the U.S. 
markets. Investors nearing retirement or already retired, who have 
less time to overcome declines, are especially concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where the market is going to go in 1999 is anybody's guess,''  
says Hal Lenhart, an academic associate at the College for 
Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one characteristic about the market that investors can be  
pretty sure about is that it is going to be very volatile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason the market is likely to be volatile in 1999,  
according to Lenhart, is due to a word many of today's investors 
have never heard before -- deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time that word was commonly spoken in this country was  
during the Great Depression. Lenhart does not see a Great 
Depression in 1999, or in the next decade for that matter. But he 
does see declining prices, or certainly an extremely low inflation 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deflation reflects a lack of liquidity in the market,''  
Lenhart says. ``People are holding on to their money. They're not 
doing much with it from a consumer standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve tried to flush liquidity into the economy by  
lowering interest rates last fall, and that has helped, Lenhart 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, investment experts remain concerned that there is  
still not sufficient liquidity. Financial institutions tend to 
clamp down on lending in a deflationary market, so it's harder for 
businesses to borrow to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, businesses have a more difficult time passing along  
costs in a deflationary environment, such as the higher labor costs 
they're incurring due to the tight labor market. Consequently, 
deflation affects corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing extreme volatility because the market doesn't  
know where to go,'' Lenhart says. ``Any minor blip in earnings 
forecast sends market prices plummeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this puts retirees and those nearing retirement in a  
tight spot. With minuscule inflation and interest rates, bond 
yields and stock dividends -- two sources of relatively steady 
income for retirees -- are at or near record lows. That will force 
retirees to look at selling some of their investments for cash, but 
that may not be as bad as it sounds, Lenhart says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to back up and look at what your investments have  
done over the past several years,'' Lenhart says. ``Don't look back 
just to recent highs and feel disappointed about how poorly the 
market has done since then. Look at the value your investments have 
accumulated over the last ten years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in their late 50s or early 60s may not need to be too  
concerned about selling stocks at this point since they've got 10 
to 15 years before they may need to start seriously drawing on 
their retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But retirees who will need funds in the next five to 10 years  
may need to liquidate some of their stock holdings and invest the 
money in Treasury securities, shorter-term bonds and other forms of 
low-risk cash-oriented investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologically, that can be tough, Lenhart admits. ``Investors  
don't like to sell their seed corn, their principal. Yet if their 
investment planning was good, they accumulated this principal with 
the idea that it would provide them income to live on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This doesn't mean even investors well into retirement should  
bail out of stocks entirely, Lenhart cautions. You need to weigh 
your future income needs and what other sources of retirement 
income you have. But any money you need within the next five years 
should not be tied up in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenhart fears that people who have accumulated substantial  
wealth in the market the last few years may be reluctant to cash in 
some of their winnings. For one thing, they will have to face 
capital gains taxes on the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they shouldn't get greedy,'' he says. He doubts the market  
is going to repeat the 20 percent or better returns it has averaged 
over the past four years. In a deflationary environment, returns 
will likely be much lower. 
</P>
<P>
	He also warns against trying to time the market. Much of the  
market activity today is due not to traditional institutional 
activity, which tended to keep the market on a more even keel, but 
to retail day traders who flit in and out of the market.

<HEADLINE> A Gardener's Look at Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Some of my house pipes froze in  
January, something that hasn't happened in years. Where's that 
global warming everybody's been talking about? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, some authorities say you shouldn't think of climate  
changes in terms of years, but of eras, of centuries, and the jury 
is still out on global warming. But others say the 1990s have had 
six of 10 record heat years and last July set records for a month. 
Something's happening out there, they think. 
</P>
<P>
	A gardener looking for signs takes note of frozen plumbing.  
Hardly a warming indicator, what does it mean for my young fig tree 
out there? Has bitter, wind-driven cold penetrated its layers of 
wrapping? 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the tree put out leaves in spring and went on to a  
fine harvest, but the winter had been so gentle hereabouts that 
amateur global warming sleuths got really excited. 
</P>
<P>
	But was it the relatively mild weather or the tree's thick  
wrapping of house insulation that saved it? I won't be able to deal 
with that question this year until I unwrap the tree in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Another thing about last year. The first nippy frost in my  
garden didn't strike until late October instead of early in the 
month. That meant I was able to eat more fresh tomatoes, beans and 
peppers. In 50 years of my gardening here, that's happened only a 
couple of times before. Had it something to do now with global 
warming? 
</P>
<P>
	Emission gases like carbon dioxide spewed into the atmosphere  
get cited for a warming trend, also known as the ``greenhouse 
effect.'' Whether it's here to stay or not, the concept is getting 
a lot of attention from horticulturists. So, it's natural for 
gardeners to wonder how it will affect them, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
	One example of concern is the American Horticultural Society's  
newly-created ``heat zone'' map. It divides the United States into 
12 zones based on the number of heat days (over 86 degrees 
Fahrenheit) each zone gets annually. Relying on that map, a 
gardener can avoid planting things likely to suffer from heat 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The map contrasts with and complements the venerable Plant  
Hardiness Zone Map of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That map, 
dividing the country into 11 zones, serves to warn you which plants 
can't make it in certain degrees of cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Monrovia, one of the country's largest growers of container  
plants, sponsored development of the heat zone map and put it into 
immediate commercial application. All its plants this year will 
carry heat zone labels to assist gardeners. Monrovia, headquartered 
in Azusa, Calif., has nurseries in Visalia, Calif., and Dayton, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	James Page, president of International Plant Food of Evergreen,  
Colo., maker of Nutura, a leaf-misting plant and flower food, 
suggests watching the behavior of house plants as an early signal 
of an increase of carbon dioxide in the environment. Since they 
thrive on it, look for an unusual spurt in their growth. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Page says it will take a century to get the world  
picture. If global warming does occur, he thinks it could mean a 
longer growing season for some home gardens, but plants with low 
heat tolerance would suffer in the North. In his view, commercial 
growing would move northward into Canada, to the detriment of 
current agricultural giants like California, south Texas and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cornell University crop biologist, David Wolfe, says a warmer  
climate might bring bigger tomatoes and watermelons to some home 
gardens, but it could also cause wider temperature swings, making 
frost dates a bigger gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Smith, a University of Cincinnati horticulturist, agrees  
with that and says the best practice will be to continue to bide 
your time before planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith believes genetic manipulation of plants will affect home  
gardeners far more than any climate changes. Genetically improved 
dwarf turf, for example, would reduce the need to mow the lawn. And 
annuals could be altered to become more heat resistant, thus 
tolerating torrid Julys and Augusts. 
</P>
<P>
	With all these ideas around, what's a home gardener to think  
about global warming? Well, it could eventually be a much bigger 
concern for commercial farmers than gardeners, whose first worry 
remains the unique microclimate of their own gardens. I figure 
we'll see a lot of cold and mild winters, hot and cool summers 
before the verdict is in. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, with an electric heater I thawed my frozen pipes  
myself, thus saving $50-plus on a plumber's visit.

	Stocks Fall; Dow Ends Down 124.35  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell sharply today on concerns  
about some less-than-stellar domestic earnings reports and Brazil's 
fragile economy. Broad market indexes gave up moderate gains in the 
final hour of trading to end significantly lower. At the close of 
trading today, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 124.35 to 
9,200.23. The Dow was dragged lower by IBM, as investors sold the 
stock to book profits following big gains Monday and yesterday on 
the company's announcement that it would split its stock 
two-for-one.

	SEC Warns on Internet Trading  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare public statement to individual  
investors, the government's top securities regulator warned people 
to use as much caution trading over the Internet as when going 
through a broker. The remarks today by Arthur Levitt, chairman of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, came amid regulators' 
concern over the recent wild swings of the Nasdaq Stock Market, 
especially among the hot Internet stocks. People trading online 
should ``remember the investment basics, and not allow the ease and 
speed with which they can trade to lull them either into a false 
sense of security or encourage them to trade too quickly or too 
often,'' he said. An estimated 5 million amateur investors now do 
at least occasional trading over the Internet.

	Venezuela Sues U.S. Tobacco Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Venezuelan government sued the leading U.S.  
tobacco companies, becoming the second foreign country to try to 
recover the public health-care costs of treating sick smokers. The 
suit seeks billions of dollars in damages, said attorney Steven 
Marks, who is representing Venezuela in the claim. He said the 
lawyers have hired economists to help calculate the damages. 
Venezuela claims it suffered economic losses because of decreased 
productivity of its labor force, lost taxes and lost gross national 
product. Guatemala is also suing tobacco companies.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos.'s profit skidded 79 percent  
in the fourth quarter of 1998 as the world's biggest tobacco 
company absorbed a big charge for settling lawsuits with states 
that demanded reimbursement for treating sick smokers. The company 
behind Marlboro cigarettes, Kraft foods and Miller beer earned $274 
million, or 11 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, 
down from $1.3 billion, or 53 cents a share a year earlier. Philip 
Morris stock was down 1 13/16 today to 46 7/16.

	Quake Shouldn't Hurt Coffee Production  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The deadly earthquake that shook western  
Colombia this week probably will not take much of a toll on its 
coffee production, even though half the country's coffee growing 
land was affected, a coffee official said today. ``The risk is that 
the coffee not be of a quality that distinguishes Colombia,'' said 
Mario Gomez Estrada, a member of the National Committee of Coffee 
Growers. Colombia is the world's second largest coffee exporter, 
behind Brazil, and accounts for 14 percent of world coffee exports. 
Nearly half of the 2.2 million acres dedicated to coffee in 
Colombia are located in the five states hit by Monday's magnitude 6 
quake.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc.'s stock surged more than 20  
percent in early trading today on news that the Internet giant's 
fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. A 
rise in online holiday shopping lifted sales to $252.89 million in 
the fourth quarter, up from $66.04 million a year ago. Excluding 
the charges, Amazon.com lost $22.18 million, or 14 cents a share, 
in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected 
its operating losses to be 18 cents a share. Amazon.com's shares 
were up 10 17/32 to 125 5/8.

	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Slumping sales and restructuring costs  
at Nabisco Holdings Corp. pushed fourth-quarter net income down 87 
percent, the company reported today. The international manufacturer 
of cookies, snacks and other grocery products said earnings for the 
October-December quarter fell to $19 million, or 7 cents per share, 
from $146 million, or 54 cents a share, in the same period a year 
earlier. Without any extraordinary charges, net income was 50 
cents, beating a First Call Corp. estimate of 49 cents a share. 
Nabisco stock was up 1 7/16 to 39 7/8.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp., the East Coast regional

on growing demand for high-speed data and mobile-phone services. 
The results matched Wall Street's expectations. Bell Atlantic 
reported today it earned $1.06 billion, or 65 cents per share, in 
the October-December quarter, up from $940 million, or 60 cents per 
share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to

	U.S. Encourages IMF Modernization  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund has to change  
the way it operates to keep pace with an increasingly globalized 
economy, a senior Clinton administration official told a Senate 
panel today. But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers also 
said the financial turmoil that swept Asia, Russia and Brazil in 
the past 18 months would have been much worse without the IMF. The 
IMF must be more accountable in its use of public funds, provide 
aid at market-based rates and get the private sector more involved 
in burden sharing, Summers said.

	Auction Web Site in Fraud Probe

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online auction service eBay Inc. is being  
investigated for fraud. The city's Department of Consumer Affairs 
is looking into whether people who use eBay to sell items falsely 
labeled some sports memorabilia as ``one-of-a-kind,'' a source 
said. eBay reported it earned $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 
1998, sharply above the $189,000 of a year earlier. For the 
quarter, revenue came to $19.5 million, more than seven times the 
$2.6 million of a year earlier. For all of 1998, the company earned 
$2.4 million on revenue of $47.4 million, against $874,000 in 
earnings on revenue of $5.7 million in 1997. Shares of eBay were up 
82 5/8 today to 303 1/2.

share, compared to $667 million, or 42 cents a share, in last 
year's fourth quarter. Sales rose 48 percent, to $10.9 billion from 
$7.32 billion. Stocks slipped 1 3/4 today to 47 1/2.

	Disney Earnings Fall 18 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co.'s earnings fell 18  
percent during the company's first quarter, reflecting slow home 
video sales and the impact of higher costs in its broadcasting and 
movie businesses. Disney reported today it earned $622 million, or 
30 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, including a 
one-time gain from its acquisition of a 43 percent share of 
Infoseek, the popular Internet search service. Minus the Infoseek 
gain, Disney's earnings fell 37 percent to $470 million, or 23 
cents per share, compared to $755 million, or 37 cents per share, a 
year earlier. The results were slightly below Wall Street estimates 
of 24 cents per share, according to a survey of analysts by First 
Call Corp. Disney stocks dropped 1 7/16 today to 33 1/8.

<HEADLINE> Family Sues State Over Foster Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The case began nearly 10 years ago when the  
suburban couple who had taken in kids before was asked by the state 
to care for a 15-year-old girl who needed a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is now suing the state, saying the girl's troubled  
past was hidden, and that she lured their 11-year-old boy into bed 
and eventually bore his child. 
</P>
<P>
	Traver Clinton Smith, lawyer for the foster family, said no one  
disputes that the boy fathered the baby, but the family maintains 
the girl forced their son, now 20, to have sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is also worried the state could make him reimburse  
Massachusetts for aid given the mother since the baby girl's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager was placed with the family, then living in  
Duxbury, in 1990, and the seductions allegedly took place that year 
and the next, until the boy's mother found the two children 
embracing in June 1991. Smith said the family then ended its care 
of the girl, but did not learn she was pregnant until after she was 
moved from the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't consensual sex. He didn't even know anything about  
sex,'' the boy's mother told jurors during a trial of the lawsuit 
Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 23, was never charged with a crime. The boy's  
family reportedly has had some contact with her and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The child is now 6 and living with her mother in Revere, just  
north of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Murphy, a Department of Revenue spokeswoman, said the agency  
had not issued an order seeking reimbursement of money paid by the 
state for the care of the child. But she conceded it had moved for 
an order to establish paternity in the case, a preliminary step in 
seeking child support and back payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts have been suspended pending the outcome of the  
civil lawsuit case, said Murphy, who declined to say if the efforts 
would resume after the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The family says in its suit against the Department of Social  
Services and Mentor Inc., a private agency that placed the girl 
with the family, that it was not told the teen was promiscuous and 
had a possible history of sexual abuse on young boys. 
</P>
<P>
	The family said DSS and Mentor knew of the teen's sexual  
history, and it discovered that a previous social worker had 
recommended she be placed only in homes with no young men. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fitzgerald, the Mentor caseworker who placed the teen-ager  
with the family, testified Wednesday that he had told the family 
the girl had a history of ``sexual aggressiveness,'' and that she 
may have been abused herself. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he didn't know she had a history of acting out her  
aggressions on younger boys, an observation that was apparently in 
social workers' files about the girl, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Social Services noted in court documents that  
a social worker at a group home recommended that she be placed in a 
home ``where there are no young males residing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave (the foster mother) the information that she needed --  
that she was sexually aggressive and they needed to supervise 
her,'' Fitzgerald testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The foster parents shook their heads during Fitzgerald's  
testimony, and their 20-year-old son hung his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentor said in court documents any intercourse was ``a result of  
improper supervision by the plaintiffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Mentor learned the foster mother had caught the two  
children embracing, the agency filed a child abuse neglect 
petition, claiming the two had not been properly supervised. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's lawyer, Michael Giunta, suggested the move was a  
ruse to cover the agency's inappropriate foster-care placement.

<HEADLINE>  Senate OKs Witnesses for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate blocked  
dismissal of the impeachment case against President Clinton on 
Wednesday and then voted for new testimony from Monica Lewinsky and 
two other witnesses -- but by margins well short of the two-thirds 
that would be needed to oust the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of roll calls in a hushed Senate chamber, all 55  
Republicans voted against dismissal and for the witnesses opposed 
by the White House. They were joined by a single Democrat, Russell 
Feingold of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will not be removed from office,'' Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle declared moments later in comments 
swiftly seconded by the White House. ``For the good of the country 
and in keeping with the Constitution it is now time to end this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the votes, Daschle and Majority Leader Trent Lott  
were at work trying to fashion a bipartisan agreement for the 
balance of the trial, including videotaped depositions of Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Lott floated a timetable that envisioned six-hour  
depositions, a Senate vote next week on whether to proceed with 
live testimony and a final vote on the articles of impeachment -- 
all within nine days. The only difficulty, he suggested, would be 
if the White House wanted witnesses of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats scoffed, noting that Republicans had forced the trial  
on a party line vote in the House, then had voted to keep it alive 
in the Senate when it was clear Clinton would be acquitted in the 
end. By their votes on the floor of the Senate, said Sen. Carl 
Levin of Michigan, the GOP is ``pushing us deeper and longer'' into 
a trial now in its third week. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers have warned repeatedly that calling any  
witnesses would mean protracted delays to allow for time for a 
review of documents thus far withheld from the president's team. 
But in a prepared statement he read to reporters in a Senate 
corridor, Special Counsel Gregory Craig omitted any mention of a 
drawn out process consuming many months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's events made clear that the votes are not there to  
convict and remove the president from office,'' he said. 
Sixty-seven votes would be needed. Any further proceedings, ``run 
counter to the best interests of the Congress, the presidency and 
the American people,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
that under one course of action under discussion the White House 
would not seek to delay the depositions with a demand for extensive 
preparation time. Only if one of the witnesses made a new 
disclosure that was potentially harmful to the president's case 
would they insist on a review of evidence thus far kept from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's trial proceedings, with Supreme Court Justice  
William Rehnquist presiding, began with the customary prayer from 
the chaplain, Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie. ``Leadership has its defining 
days in which critical decisions must be made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The roll calls that followed within moments were somber -- if  
utterly lacking in suspense -- as 100 senators sat quietly at their 
seats until called on alphabetically to announce their votes. There 
was one light moment, when Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski of 
Maryland mistakenly sided with the Republicans against dismissal, 
then swiftly won permission from Rehnquist to correct herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold was the only lawmaker of either side to cross party  
lines. He swiftly left the chamber when the proceedings were over, 
and issued a statement saying his vote against dismissal ``should 
not be interpreted as a signal that I intend to vote to convict the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, several Democrats predicted that on the final vote some  
Republicans would reject one or both of the articles of 
impeachment, which allege perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes on Wednesday capped days of maneuvering over the  
volatile witness issue. House prosecutors, who originally had hoped 
to depose a dozen or more key figures in the sex and cover-up 
scandal reduced their list to a ``pitiful three,'' in the words of 
their leader, Rep. Henry Hyde. That was to allow Lott to hold 
Republicans in line at a time when many are eager to end a trial 
that remains unpopular with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side of the aisle, Daschle and numerous other  
lawmakers resurrected their calls for censure of Clinton instead of 
impeachment conviction. ``The president should and will receive 
sanctions and rebuke. I will strongly support a resolution of 
censure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But like everything else in the trial, agreement on censure  
could be difficult to achieve, given the tricky constitutional 
issues involved and the disagreement among lawmakers about the 
extent of Clinton's transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Republicans was at work on ``findings of fact'' that  
would conclude that Clinton had lied and obstructed justice. 
Several Democrats said they would have a hard time supporting that. 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California was drafting a 
resolution to ``state the feelings of the Senate with respect to 
misconduct'' by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	By calling witnesses, House prosecutors hope to obtain evidence  
relating to their charges that Clinton sought to obstruct justice 
by persuading Ms. Lewinsky to sign a false affidavit in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and by giving his aides false 
information about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to take to the 
grand jury and about efforts to arrange a job for the former White 
House intern.

<HEADLINE> Seven Excused From Dragging Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A potential juror in the trial of a white  
man accused of dragging a black man to his death last summer was 
excused after saying he had read racist letters from the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Halmon, a white construction worker, said Tuesday that he  
had read the letters by John King addressed to Halmon's teen-age 
step-granddaughter, Michelle Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Chapman is one of several girls King, 24, contacted by  
letter while he was imprisoned in Tennessee Colony from 1995 to 
1997 for violating terms of his probation for a 1992 burglary, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the letters, which were romantic in nature, also  
included anti-black comments and were turned over to investigators 
by the girls' parents shortly after King's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Chapman is one of 53 people subpoenaed as potential  
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	King, Shawn Berry, 23, and Lawrence Brewer, 31, are accused of  
killing James Byrd Jr. because he was black. The men allegedly beat 
the 49-year-old Byrd, chained him to a pickup truck and dragged him 
for 2 1/2 miles, tearing his body apart. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who has pleaded innocent to the charges, could face the  
death penalty if convicted. His co-defendants will be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the first 10 people interviewed by prosecutors and  
defense attorneys were dismissed Tuesday, including four who 
expressed opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think God is the only one to take a human life,'' said one  
woman. Said another: ``I just don't believe in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another 12 people were scheduled to be interviewed today.

<HEADLINE> Highway May Be Named After Autry </HEADLINE>

	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Gene Autry's legacy as America's original

may get a highway interchange named after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few offramps east of Bob Hope Drive and 110 miles from

Interchange would unite Interstate 5 and Highway 134. The location

	The idea was announced Tuesday by state Sen. Adam Schiff, who  
said he plans to introduce a resolution to name the interchange 
after Autry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene Autry was a pioneering star in the early days of music,  
radio, film, television and rodeo performances. I am proud to 
posthumously honor such an inspiring role model,'' said Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Autry died Oct. 2 after a long illness, three days after his  
91st birthday.

<HEADLINE>  100,000 Attend Papal Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II took his campaign against  
capital punishment to the heartland today, urging 100,000 
worshippers on the final day of his journey to the Americas to 
spare even those who commit heinous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the largest crowd of his 30-hour visit to the United  
States, his fifth to the U.S. mainland, the pope also lashed out 
against abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide, declaring that 
``the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the 
case of someone who has done great evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his Christmas Day appeal for a worldwide ban on the  
death penalty, saying capital punishment is ``both cruel and 
unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul has intervened in several death penalty cases in the  
United States, but his words had a particular relevance in St. 
Louis. The pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, called a 
``mockery'' the Missouri Supreme Court's postponement of an 
execution that was to have taken place while John Paul was 
visiting. Twelve days before the pope arrived, a convicted murderer 
was put to death by injection in the Potosi, Mo., prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope's voice was hoarse and he slurred his  
words. Running captions of his homily were flashed on giant 
television screens throughout the Trans World Dome and adjacent 
convention center as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew sustained applause when he appealed to Catholics who  
have drifted away from the church to return, although he 
acknowledged some face obstacles to full participation, a reference 
to divorced and remarried Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	On a pilgrimage that began in Mexico last Friday, John Paul has  
been rallying his flock against a ``culture of death'' as the 
church heads into a new millennium. He was to return to Rome 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd attending today's Mass burst into prolonged applause  
when John Paul, in glistening yellow robes, reached the altar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Viva Il Papa!'' -- Italian for ``Long live the pope!'' -- rang  
out from a man in the lower boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass was beamed throughout the temporary cathedral while  
hundreds of priests and deacons were prepared to distribute 
communion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new evangelization calls for followers of Christ who are  
unconditionally pro-life: who will proclaim, celebrate the Gospel 
of life in every situation,'' he said in his homily at Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged his flock to put an end to all forms of racism, quoting  
the American bishops as calling it ``one of the most persistent and 
destructive evils of the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, worshippers filed through metal detectors into  
the dome, normally home of the St. Louis Rams, carrying rosaries 
and crucifixes. Many had waited hours in the early morning 
darkness, but even that didn't guarantee a good seat for what the 
St. Louis Archdiocese believed would be the largest indoor 
gathering ever in the United States.	   ``We're in the nose-bleed seats, but I figure that means we're 
closer to heaven,'' said Carol Houska of south St. Louis County, 
who headed downtown at about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul was welcomed Tuesday night like a rock star by a crowd  
of 20,000, young people, whom he warned against drifting into a 
world ``filled with darkness'' and rife with violence, drugs and 
easy sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports were a metaphor for his message, and the youths presented  
him with a hockey jersey that read: ``John Paul II No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At an airport arrival ceremony Tuesday, John Paul avoided  
certain sources of tension with the United States and dropped from 
the advance text of his speech any mention of land mines, drug 
trafficking or U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, something the Vatican 
has assailed as ``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and  
the pope, abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica 
Lewinsky affair not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley 
said. The two did discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said.

<HEADLINE> $100M Sought for Child Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants to spend more  
than $100 million helping children's hospitals and fighting 
childhood asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Both initiatives will be included in the budget President  
Clinton submits to Congress next week for the fiscal year starting 
Oct. 1, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The $68 million asthma plan, which first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton is announcing this afternoon at the White House, was billed 
as the ``first-ever comprehensive, administration-wide strategy'' 
to fight the disease. Most of the money -- $50 million -- would be 
used for competitive state grants to identify and treat poor 
children served by Medicaid who have asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also was scheduled to unveil proposed new subsidies  
for training pediatricians in speech at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now helps pay for training doctors by reimbursing  
hospitals through the Medicare program for the elderly. But that 
system is based on the number of Medicare patients a hospital sees, 
which creates a disadvantage for hospitals that treat mainly 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's hospitals lose money each year, more than other  
teaching hospitals, partly because of this inequity, the 
administration contends. The $40 million would come through an 
existing grant programs and amount to about $9,380 per resident. 
The average hospital would see $689,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The asthma initiative would help schools educate children and  
parents on how to avoid attacks, support research into 
environmental hazards and pay for a public information campaign. It 
would be administered by the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Environmental Protection Agency and was developed 
in part by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 15 years, the number of children with asthma has  
doubled to about 6 million, with an even steeper increase -- about 
160 percent -- among children under age 5. More than 100,000 
children are hospitalized with the ailment each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Black children suffer the most. Their risk of contracting the  
disease is only slightly higher than it is for other children, but 
they are more than four times as likely to die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative would provide:  
</P>
<P>
	--$8.4 million for schools to teach parents and children the  
importance of asthma medication and how to identify and avoid 
materials that trigger attacks. The administration estimates this 
initiative will reach more than 2 million children. 
</P>
<P>
	--$2 million for new research into the role chemicals, pesticides  
and cigarette smoke play in the onset of asthma. Another $1 million 
would be used by EPA to monitor air pollution in two communities to 
examine its relation to asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5.2 million for a public information campaign, including  
posters, flyers and brochures, to reduce children's exposure to 
tobacco smoke and other asthma triggers.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 22  
</P>
<P>
	Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, on tax relief:  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 48 million Americans will pay zero income taxes for 1998,  
thanks in large part to the new $400-a-child tax credit. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The child tax credit is designed to lessen the tax burden on  
families, and it is obviously succeeding. The number of families 
paying no income tax will likely increase next year. ... 
</P>
<P>
	All of this is good, but more needs to be done. The average 1998  
income-tax liability for those earning between $100,000 and 
$200,000 is $19,688. The 52.4 million taxpayers earning more than 
$40,000 will pay 95.5 percent of the nation's 1998 income taxes. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Are these people rich? No, they are mostly middle-class and  
highly taxed and increasingly dissatisfied. ... They are right to 
demand a reduction in taxes, and Congress should make that a 
priority. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Congress can no longer be accused of giving tax breaks to the  
rich ... and it has done much to ease the tax burden on the working 
poor. But there are still millions of struggling middle Americans 
in need of relief. ... 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton wants to use budget surpluses in spectral ways  
to save Social Security. Most taxpayers want to keep more of their 
money so they might spend or invest it themselves. After all, it is 
their money. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 15  
</P>
<P>
	Argus Observer, Ontario, Ore., on the GI Bill:  
</P>
<P>
	The GI Bill revolutionized America to some extent and it is one  
of the bright, shining examples of a government reimbursing the 
veterans who gave up their lives for one, two, three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a bipartisan panel is pushing a wide increase of military  
veterans benefits, including a new and updated version of the GI 
Bill. This effort is a good one and long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	While the $3 billion price tag appears steep, Congress has  
already sent various messages it likes the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the context of the massive federal budget, $3 billion is a  
mere drop in the bucket. While many, including President Clinton, 
are rushing to find ways to add money to the current defense budget 
during a time of peace, it is fitting that there is an effort to 
reward the many who sacrificed their time, their boyhood and 
sometimes their sanity for a work in progress called the United 
States. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 22  
</P>
<P>
	The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, on English-only law:  
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court decision ... not to reinstate an English-only  
law in Arizona is only a brief interruption in the ongoing march 
toward making English the official language in states across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact the court's ruling can be seen in a positive light in  
that it allows some perimeters to be discerned within which 
proponents of English-only should operate. 
</P>
<P>
	There are English-only laws in effect in 25 states right now,  
and proponents of such measures are pushing to add Utah to the 
list. A new proposal also is under consideration for Arizona. So 
the issue isn't going to go away. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo is an example of how the diversity of citizens' cultural  
and ethnic backgrounds is not adversely impacted by the conducting 
of all public business in English. The rich tapestry of languages 
spoken in homes around the city and region, from Spanish to 
Hungarian, is not harmed or demeaned by the use of English in 
official interaction.

<P>
	The Sun News, Myrtle Beach, S.C., on possible female candidates  
for president in the year 2000: 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole vs. Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2000? Is that  
possible? Might that be the way this nation politically turns the 
millennium? 
</P>
<P>
	Might we finally acknowledge that men have done a simply  
terrible job, especially lately, of running this country and turn 
to two bright women to appeal to the electorate to chose between 
them? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, we know Dole is at least somewhat interested; she has  
resigned her Red Cross presidency to run, if she decides to do so. 
...
</P>
<P>
	And we know that Clinton has already sat at the right hand of  
presidential power, despite all the ups and downs of that public 
couple and of their private marriage. But is she presidential 
material? 
</P>
<P>
	Move over, Vice President Al Gore. Move over, Gov. George W.  
Bush. Let the women show all of us how it should be done.

<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on Olympic reforms:  
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee has taken some positive  
steps to limit the opportunity for corruption in selection of sites 
for Summer and Winter Games, but its leaders need to consider even 
more reforms before it can hope to restore public faith in the 
Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Salt Lake City's blatant payoffs in its successful  
bid to win the 2002 Winter Games, the IOC board moved last weekend 
to expel six of its 115 members for accepting cash or other gifts 
from Salt Lake officials. Three resigned and three others remain 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether this action will rid the committee of all its rotten  
apples is uncertain. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, (IOC) members pick the president, who, in turn,  
appoints members to fill seats as they become vacant. ... 
</P>
<P>
	For all the criticism he has received, Samaranch has achieved  
considerable good during his 19-year tenure. He added the first 
women to the IOC and brought in more members from outside Europe, 
which had dominated the Olympic hierarchy. But Samaranch also 
tolerated an atmosphere in which cities like Salt Lake felt 
compelled to shower gifts on IOC members if they hoped to win the 
Games. ... But if the IOC really wants to put this scandal behind 
it, now is the time to thank Samaranch for his long service and 
choose a younger, reform-minded successor. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 22  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on the Olympics and Salt Lake City:  
</P>
<P>
	Three years shy of the opening of the 2002 Winter Olympics, Salt  
Lake City ought to be basking in the glow of Olympic Gold. Instead, 
it's Olympic mud. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City is mired in an old-fashioned scandal marked by  
bribes, corruptions and a swarm of investigators. Seattle did not 
opt out of the 2012 Summer Olympics because of concerns about 
scandal. Yet, this becomes another reason Seattle was smart to pass 
on this event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hosting an international extravaganza is always a gamble, based  
on a set of assumptions and expectations. Promoters create an 
organizing committee, sign on corporate sponsors, hire construction 
crews. They then bring the whole thing together in a dazzling, 
heavily choreographed opening event beamed via satellite to a 
waiting world. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake may yet turn things around, but now everyone is  
scrambling to get away from the stench. Some sponsors are 
withholding payment. The mayor, who long dreamed of presiding over 
the Olympics, announced she would not seek a third term. Several 
local Olympic officials resigned. Several investigations are under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning lights for other communities are obvious. When  
promoters come peddling big events, they pitch the rosiest 
scenario. Each element of the plan rests precariously on another. 
If one thing goes wrong, a lot of things might follow. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 25  
</P>
<P>
	The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La., on urban sprawl:  
</P>
<P>
	The presidency, it's said among the experts, is a diminished  
office. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Though an issue identified with Vice President Al Gore, as  
environmentalist in chief the last few years, both the president 
and vice president have used their pre-budget speeches to talk 
about America's problems with sprawling suburbia and urban decline. 
...
</P>
<P>
	The grab-bag of proposals includes some redirection of existing  
spending, a few new tax credits for purchasing open land for 
preservation or for parks, and similar -- if limited -- spending on 
urban development. A 16 percent increase is called for on public 
transportation, to ease gridlock and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	These proposals will be sent to Congress in the federal budget.  
Some or all might be enacted. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If the dollars involved aren't huge in the context of the  
federal budget, the emphasis is important, if only because federal 
spending on highways and transportation has been heavily weighted 
toward expansion of city boundaries. Denser development and more 
sensible planning is the only practical antidote to longer 
commutes, more air and water pollution and rising highway and sewer 
construction costs.

<P>
	Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times on teen-agers' driving  
privileges: 
</P>
<P>
	These are words that make any parent nervous: ``Dad, can I have  
the car?'' Now the thought is growing that perhaps teen-agers' 
driving experiences ought to be graduated, rather than simply 
giving drivers under 18 years of age full privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	Several eastern states have done this and the evidence is  
growing that there is much to be said for the so-called graduated 
licenses. Teen-age drivers have the quickest reactions, best 
eyesight and best hand and eye coordination, but often the worst 
judgment, particularly when their buddies are in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states keep teen drivers off the road at night, others  
prohibit fellow teen passengers. Florida, for one, has seen teen 
motor death numbers fall with graduated licenses. Texas legislators 
ought to watch these developments carefully. 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on President Clinton and Pope John Paul  
II: 
</P>
<P>
	(U.S. President Bill) Clinton has been weakened in his spirit by  
allowing too much to his body. Pope John Paul II has become frail, 
despite the strength of his spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting in St. Louis was an opportunity to show once again  
their incompatibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff and the American president try to control the world  
following two opposite principles. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul II calls for the end of violence as a way to solve the  
conflicts and looks forward to the birth of an alternative power to 
the United States. Clinton continues bombing each continent to 
reaffirm the American supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes them look alike is their ability to raise enthusiasm,  
more than a real consensus. ...

	Jan. 24  
</P>
<P>
	Liberation, Paris, on corruption in sports:  
</P>
<P>
	A doping scandal dominated sports headlines in 1998. And 1999  
has started with a bang: the Olympics, the symbol of sports, is in 
the hot seat. After the health of the athletes, the health of the 
organizations is at stake. Dodgy intermediaries, lost files, empty 
purses, shadow companies, manipulation, all come at the taxpayer's 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	The moral virtues of amateur sports were renounced a long time  
ago in exchange for an explosion of commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
	But never before has there been so much money involved in  
sports. ``Jordan Inc.'' brings in more than the gross national 
product of a Third World country, the soccer market rivals France's 
national budget and the Olympic games have seen their television 
rights multiply by 2000 over the past thirty years. 
</P>
<P>
	Who controls sports? Governments, teams, the federations or the  
television magnates? 
</P>
<P>
	The fall of Samaranch wouldn't solve anything if the Olympic  
organization is not thoroughly cleaned from top to bottom. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 27  
</P>
<P>
	The New Paper, Singapore, on the Olympic Games scandal:  
</P>
<P>
	This whole Olympics bribery scandal isn't shocking. No, we all  
know how crooked the world is, how money talks in every field of 
activity. The International Olympics Committee members who took 
bribes to vote for a certain country to be host have done no worse 
than many politicians and business leaders, right? But we prosecute 
crooked politicians, so we should also not forgive these crooked 
IOC members. Sack them all. ... Those easily-influenced guys are 
two things: crooked and untrustworthy, and a bunch of lazy slobs. 
... It's natural to want more money (we all do) but hello, welcome 
to the real world! Just work for it! 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 26  
</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on the Olympic scandal:  
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic Games are facing their most shameful moment in more  
than a century of idealism and record-breaking achievement. Yet 
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic 
Committee, refuses to resign. Shrugging off responsibility for the 
latest corruption scandal, he has called for a vote of confidence 
at an extraordinary IOC meeting next month. His move is a cynical 
attempt to save his career while sacrificing the six members most 
implicated in the corrupt awarding of the Summer and Winter Games 
to the winning cities. The affair, however, is far from over, and 
goes beyond squalid bribery. It has exposed the jealousies, power 
struggles and abuse of authority that lead directly to Samaranch 
himself. Until he goes, the Olympic movement will remain blighted. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 26  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on the Olympic scandal:  
</P>
<P>
	The flame is fading. The Olympic ideal is a laughing stock.  
Certainly, the Olympic charter makes for humorous reading. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... Confidence in the institution is gone. It will not return  
until Samaranch and his crony culture have gone and the IOC has 
been reduced and overhauled, with a greater say given to national 
Olympic committees. Until then Britain should abandon any thoughts 
of staging the tarnished circus on our shores.

<P>
	Aftonbladet, Stockholm, on the Olympic Games:  
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee has long looked like a  
fraternal order: closed, self-renewing, secretive, often completely 
male. The ideological superstructure is feudalism. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this conservatism, the Olympic Games have had an  
exceptional common-man popularity, by virtue of the magnificent 
athletics and the national prestige that victories create. 
Politicians -- not the least of them dictators -- have long used the 
Olympics in their own propaganda campaigns. Hitler and Ulbricht 
with pleasure placed themselves in the light glancing off gold 
medals. In recent years, the United States and the old Soviet Union 
used the Olympics with political boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics' character in recent decades has changed drastically:  
the ideal of amatuerism has drowned in the flood of prize money. 
...
</P>
<P>
	The combination of fraternalism and economic power have made the  
IOC especially receptive to corruption.

	Die Welt, Berlin, on miners' march on Bucharest:  
</P>
<P>
	Romania's leadership considers the miners' retreat a victory.  
But in truth it won nothing. After an almost one-week march on 
Bucharest and three victorious battles with police, the miners 
disappeared within an hour of a meeting between their leader, Miron 
Cozma, and Prime Minister Vasile. There was no haggling. Vasile 
gave in to all Cozma's demands and has left the closing of 
unprofitable mines to the next government. But there seems to be 
another reason for the miners' demands being met: Government 
negotiators got cold feet when they realized their leaders were 
about to sanction the use of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	For investors this means that Romania is at the best of times a  
country in which workers can dictate economic policy. At worst, 
Romania is an unstable country where extremists threaten it with 
collapse. In other words, a country to avoid.

	Tribune de Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland, on nuclear power:  
</P>
<P>
	The arrival in power in Germany of the new coalition has speeded  
up the nuclear debate. A day doesn't go by when it isn't talked 
about in various European countries. ... 
</P>
<P>
	As a source of energy, nuclear power has lost its attraction.  
... Its economic success is far from great, the handling of waste 
is still an unknown factor with no convincing answers, and the 
industry is not under democratic control. 
</P>
<P>
	But the size of the industry and the colossal investment it has  
required give it a considerable inertia. ... 
</P>
<P>
	An end to nuclear power will remain uncertain as long as there  
are no practical and efficient solutions. The ecologists insist 
that these exist and are operational, but their conviction is not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Only proving it through action, and on a large scale, will be  
enough to attract the support of a public which is opposed to 
nuclear power but attached to the way of life.

	The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on missionary murders in  
India: 
</P>
<P>
	The murders of the Australian missionary Graham Staines and his  
sons Philip, 10, and Tim, 6, in rural India are a reminder of the 
hazards missionaries face in many places. But their deaths were not 
the result of sheer chance. They occurred in a climate of sectarian 
hatred in India. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 
encouraged this climate for its political advantage and, in power, 
has allowed the hatred to grow when a responsible national 
government would have acted long ago to curb it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	One interpretation of the increased boldness of the criminal  
associates of Hindu extremists is that it reflects the extremists' 
frustration with the failure of the BJP, after 10 months in power, 
to deliver on promises of economic nationalism and cultural 
promotion of ``Hindutva'' or ``Hinduness.'' That may explain the 
increasing violence, but it cannot excuse it. ...

<HEADLINE>  100,000 Attend Papal Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II took his campaign against  
capital punishment to the heartland today, urging 100,000 
worshippers on the final day of his journey to the Americas to 
spare even those who commit heinous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the largest crowd of his 30-hour visit to the United  
States, his fifth to the U.S. mainland, the pope also lashed out 
against abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide, declaring that 
``the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the 
case of someone who has done great evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his Christmas Day appeal for a worldwide ban on the  
death penalty, saying capital punishment is ``both cruel and 
unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul has intervened in several death penalty cases in the  
United States, but his words had a particular relevance in St. 
Louis. The pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, called a 
``mockery'' the Missouri Supreme Court's postponement of an 
execution that was to have taken place while John Paul was 
visiting. Twelve days before the pope arrived, a convicted murderer 
was put to death by injection in the Potosi, Mo., prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope's voice was hoarse and he slurred his  
words. Running captions of his homily were flashed on giant 
television screens throughout the Trans World Dome and adjacent 
convention center as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew sustained applause when he appealed to Catholics who  
have drifted away from the church to return, although he 
acknowledged some face obstacles to full participation, a reference 
to divorced and remarried Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	On a pilgrimage that began in Mexico last Friday, John Paul has  
been rallying his flock against a ``culture of death'' as the 
church heads into a new millennium. He was to return to Rome 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd attending today's Mass burst into prolonged applause  
when John Paul, in glistening yellow robes, reached the altar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Viva Il Papa!'' -- Italian for ``Long live the pope!'' -- rang  
out from a man in the lower boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass was beamed throughout the temporary cathedral while  
hundreds of priests and deacons were prepared to distribute 
communion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new evangelization calls for followers of Christ who are  
unconditionally pro-life: who will proclaim, celebrate the Gospel 
of life in every situation,'' he said in his homily at Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged his flock to put an end to all forms of racism, quoting  
the American bishops as calling it ``one of the most persistent and 
destructive evils of the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, worshippers filed through metal detectors into  
the dome, normally home of the St. Louis Rams, carrying rosaries 
and crucifixes. Many had waited hours in the early morning 
darkness, but even that didn't guarantee a good seat for what the 
St. Louis Archdiocese believed would be the largest indoor 
gathering ever in the United States.	   ``We're in the nose-bleed seats, but I figure that means we're 
closer to heaven,'' said Carol Houska of south St. Louis County, 
who headed downtown at about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul was welcomed Tuesday night like a rock star by a crowd  
of 20,000, young people, whom he warned against drifting into a 
world ``filled with darkness'' and rife with violence, drugs and 
easy sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports were a metaphor for his message, and the youths presented  
him with a hockey jersey that read: ``John Paul II No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At an airport arrival ceremony Tuesday, John Paul avoided  
certain sources of tension with the United States and dropped from 
the advance text of his speech any mention of land mines, drug 
trafficking or U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, something the Vatican 
has assailed as ``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and  
the pope, abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica 
Lewinsky affair not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley 
said. The two did discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Celebrates Pope's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The 630-foot Gateway Arch glowed like a massive  
halo in the night sky as Pope John Paul II left the first rally of 
his U.S. visit, a jubilant celebration of youth and song. 
</P>
<P>
	The hometown of Scott Joplin and Miles Davis, of Chuck Berry and  
Tina Turner, serenaded the music-loving pope Tuesday with a 
high-volume medley of soul, gospel, reggae, rock, country, Polish 
hymns and Irish ballads. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the 78-year-old pontiff arrived in the Gateway City  
of the West, even before he left Mexico, the party had begun -- a 
frenzied foot-stomping, hand-clapping, steel guitar-twanging youth 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw so many kids in my life,'' said St. Louis bus  
driver Reginald Davis. ``And they're so well-behaved. Some came 
from as far away as Chicago and Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the thousands, teen-agers arrived in school buses and  
sightseeing charters. They bunked down in sleeping bags and 
bedrolls in church halls, school cafeterias and gyms around the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Youth really dig him,'' said Jason Divona, who came from  
Louisville, Ky., and spent the night on the gym floor at St. Mary's 
school. ``He speaks our language. When he's with kids, he really 
lights up. You can see it in his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of young people snaked two miles from the Gateway Arch  
on the banks of the Mississippi River to the Kiel Center, site of 
Tuesday night's rally for some 20,000 teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to renew our spirituality,'' said Marie DeWolf,  
a teen-ager who took part in the parade. ``And to actually get the 
chance to see him!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the city seemed abandoned, as businesses shut and  
people heeded warnings not to drive into town. 
</P>
<P>
	At the city's Plaza Square -- renamed Papal Plaza for the day --  
the faithful who had traveled all night to be in St. Louis for the 
pope's 30-hour visit sprawled out on the grass, hoping to catch a 
few hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Many said the town hadn't been this excited since St. Louis  
Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire's 70-home run season ended a few 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``First we had McGwire hitting all those home runs. Now we have  
the pope,'' said 81-year-old Margaret Wilson, sitting in a folding 
chair along the parade route. ``I don't know what we're going to do 
for excitement after this.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq's 4th-Quarter Earnings Leap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday its  
fourth-quarter profits rose 14 percent, topping Wall Street's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, the world's largest maker of personal computers, said it  
earned a record $758 million, or 43 cents a share, compared to $667 
million, or 42 cents a share, in last year's fourth quarter. Sales 
rose 48 percent, to $10.9 billion from $7.32 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expected Compaq to earn 37  
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company credited sales growth at three times the industry  
rate and the continued successful absorption of Digital Equipment 
Corp., which Compaq bought last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the majority of the Digital integration now successfully  
behind us, we enter the new year ready to completely unfold and 
deply the strategy we have been working towards for the past year 
and a half,'' said Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-quarter charge of $3.63 billion, mostly to account for  
the Digital merger, caused a net loss for the full year. In 1998, 
Compaq lost $2.74 billion, or $1.71 a diluted share, compared to a 
profit of $1.86 billion, or $1.19 a diluted share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $31.17 billion from $24.58 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq slipped $1.75 to $47.50 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Compaq was the most heavily traded stock on the NYSE 
Wednesday, with more than 38.3 million shares trading hands.

<HEADLINE> Sony's Profits Rise; Sales Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp.'s profits rose 2 percent in its fiscal  
third quarter on a special accounting gain, but operating profits 
tumbled as global economic weakness hammered its main electronics 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony reported Wednesday it earned 112.31 billion yen, or $968.3  
million, in the three months ended Dec. 31, aided by a special gain 
of 58.7 billion yen related to an employee benefits plan. Sony 
earned 110.37 billion yen in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time accounting boost in the recent quarter,  
Sony's operating profits dropped 20 percent. Sales fell 3 percent 
to 1.95 trillion yen, or $16.79 billion, from 2.01 trillion yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic problems hurt electronics sales in Latin America,  
Russia, Eastern Europe and other parts of Asia. Sony also suffered 
from intense price competition in the United States and Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Best known for TVs and its Walkman stereos, Sony has branched  
out in recent years and now makes computers, cellular phones and 
semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from electronics dropped 49 percent in the  
quarter, offsetting gains in Sony's other divisions -- films, music, 
video games and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Pictures improved profits despite lower revenue, as strong  
home-video sales offset a lack of strong box-office releases. Music 
profits were boosted by releases from Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and 
George Michael. The games division benefited from strong sales of 
the PlayStation video game machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak electronics market caused Sony to further cut its  
profit forecast for the full year ending March 31. Sony expects 
profits to drop 28 percent to 160 billion yen, which is down from 
the forecast of 170 billion yen Sony released three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Sony's profits  
fell nearly 2 percent to 198.37 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, while 
sales climbed 5 percent to 5.32 trillion yen, or $45.83 billion.

<HEADLINE> J. Peterman Granted Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The J. Peterman Co., the upscale retailer  
parodied on ``Seinfeld,'' will be allowed to operate through Feb. 
12 under a $1.96 million loan from a primary creditor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for J. Peterman sealed the deal Tuesday, a day after  
filing for U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Under motions granted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William Howard,  
the company will be able to pay its approximately 500 employees, 
pay $235,000 owed to United Parcel Service and process returned and 
exchanged merchandise which has been backing up since the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Peterman, which earned notoriety as the target of satire on  
the top-rated television comedy, filed Monday for protection under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which enables a company to 
keep operating under a court's supervision while it develops a plan 
for returning to solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers submitted to the court as part of the filing, founder  
John Peterman listed assets of $35 million and liabilities of $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The next hearing in the case was scheduled for Feb. 8.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterman, 57, portrayed the bankruptcy as an opportunity for the  
company to seek new financing and ownership after setbacks in an 
effort to expand into 70 retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Slow catalog sales and delays in opening new stores, including  
one in New York's Grand Central Terminal, combined to create 
inventory overstocks and push the privately held company into debt, 
Peterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman, a 57-year-old former minor league baseball player and  
marketing consultant, first started selling vintage duster coats in 
1987 through ads in the back of The New Yorker and The Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	When Peterman published his first catalogs in 1988, they were  
something new: consciously upscale, with color sketches of the 
merchandise instead of photographs and lyrical copy that invested 
the merchandise with a romantic, exotic history. Printed on heavy 
paper and dubbed an ``Owner's Manual,'' Peterman's book of what he 
called ``factual romance'' was meant to be kept. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, shortly before ``Seinfeld'' went off the air,  
Peterman announced an expansion into retail that included plans for 
50 stores and 20 catalog outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company raised $10 million from outside investors, recruited  
executives from J. Crew, Calvin Klein and The Gap, and opened 12 
stores in addition to its Lexington flagship.

	Thousands Attending Pope Mass  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tens of thousands filed through metal detectors  
today to hear Pope John Paul II celebrate the only public Mass of 
his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland. Lines several deep wrapped 
around the Trans World Dome, normally home of the St. Louis Rams. 
The dome and the adjoining convention center were turned into a 
temporary cathedral for what the St. Louis Archdiocese believed 
would be the largest indoor gathering ever in the United States 
with more than 100,000 people expected to attend. 

</P>

	Rain Slows Search for Quake Victims  
</P>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- A night of heavy rains has slowed the  
search for earthquake victims and worsened the suffering of 
survivors of one of the worst disasters in Colombia's history. 
Relief efforts resumed under gray skies today with reports of 
looting and coffin shortages. At least 700 people are confirmed 
dead from Monday's magnitude-6 quake in western Colombia but 
officials say the final toll will surely rise. 

</P>
<P>
	Renewed Fighting Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A new outbreak of fighting in Kosovo  
added urgency to international efforts today to enlist ethnic 
Albanian rebels in talks on the future of the Serb province. U.S. 
envoy Christopher Hill was meeting with representatives of the 
Kosovo Liberation Army. He has been trying to enlist rebel support 
for a U.S. plan envisaging autonomy for Kosovo that falls short of 
the rebels' demand for independence.

<P>
	McMURDO BASE, Antarctica (AP) -- Officials from 24 countries  
meeting in the Antarctic said today that the region faces several 
serious threats, including illegal fishing. But they stopped short 
of taking any specific steps to protect it. Environmental groups 
such as Greenpeace had urged the delegates at the first meeting of 
Antarctic Treaty nations ever held on its frozen tundra to achieve 
more than a photo opportunity.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are expected to muster  
party-line majorities today in their effort to defeat a Democratic 
motion to dismiss the impeachment case against President Clinton. 
Majority Leader Trent Lott won over some wavering Republicans on

their witness list to Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan 
and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott today  
promised a ``burst of activity'' after the impeachment trial to 
impress on Americans that Congress is working on their behalf. 
Lott, in a breakfast speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, listed 
education, military pay and the year 2000 computer problem as among 
the first areas the Senate will address when the trial is over.

	LONDON (AP) -- The hearing on the arrest of former Chilean  
dictator Augusto Pinochet resumes today in the House of Lords. At 
issue is an international convention prohibiting torture, which 
Chile, Spain and Britain have all signed. But Pinochet's lawyers 
argued yesterday that the International Convention Against Torture 
doesn't give outside nations the automatic right to prosecute 
officials accused of torture. Lawyers for Spain, Amnesty 
International and other human rights groups contend it does.

for the 2002 Winter Olympics. The IOC said Mukora received $34,650

also chairman of the Kenya Olympics Association and first vice 
chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation, denied receiving any 
money.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Abortion Web Site Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Plaintiffs call the anti-abortion  
activists terrorists who use wanted-style posters and Web sites to 
threaten and intimidate abortion providers. The defense likens them 
to civil rights crusaders, engaged in political debate protected 
under the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-person jury is being asked to decide which is true in a  
$200 million federal lawsuit that accuses the ``Nuremberg Files'' 
Web site and ``Deadly Dozen'' poster of being subtle hit lists 
against abortion doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliberations were to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Tuesday, plaintiffs' lawyers called on the  
panel to end the thinly veiled tactics of intimidation, such as the 
practice on the Web site of marking through the names of slain 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about using tactics to intimidate so these doctors will  
stop performing abortion because they are afraid that just like 
other doctors who have been murdered, it will happen to them,'' 
attorney Maria Vullo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember the pattern: Poster, murder. Poster, murder. Poster,  
murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs, including Planned Parenthood and several abortion  
providers, claim the posters violate a 1994 federal law that makes 
it illegal to incite violence against abortion doctors and their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys portrayed their 14 clients as honest,  
God-fearing people who have a constitutionally protected right to 
express their belief that abortion is the murder of innocent 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case involving words and only words,'' defense  
attorney Christopher Ferrara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's about threatening words,'' Vullo countered. ``The  
message is, `Stop performing abortion or wear a bulletproof 
vest.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On the site, under the heading ``ABORTIONISTS: the baby  
butchers,'' readers are asked to send in personal details about 
abortion doctors, including their license plate numbers and the 
names of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The site attracted national attention last October after Dr.  
Barnett Slepian was killed by sniper fire in his home outside 
Buffalo, N.Y. On the site, his name was crossed through. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrorism,'' Vullo said, pointing to an enlarged time  
line of the four doctors and two clinic workers killed by 
anti-abortion activists since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued that there are no threats.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no threat on the front, there is no threat on the  
back,'' said attorney Denis Brenan, pointing to the ``Deadly 
Dozen'' poster. ``The question is, where is the threat to do bodily 
harm or to kill?''

<HEADLINE> Record Year for Coal Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coal demand will remain high for several more  
years but could dampen if electric utilities turn to cleaner fuels, 
the Commerce Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, part of Commerce's annual ``U.S. Industry and Trade  
Outlook,'' said production is expected to continue rising about 1 
percent each year, reaching 1.24 billion tons in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the increase results from a ``modest though steady rise  
in coal consumption for the generation of electricity,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's report said environmental factors could cloud the  
industry's long-term outlook. Carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas 
that many scientists say is contributing to a warming of the earth, 
is produced from burning fossil fuels, especially coal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States agreed in worldwide negotiations in Kyoto,  
Japan, a year ago to reduce carbon emissions to below 1990 levels 
by 2008-2012. The agreement still needs Senate ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many answers will arrive in the next few years as electric  
utilities, the traditional market for steam coal in the United 
States, decide whether to invest in expensive and in some cases 
still experimental clean-coal technologies to comply with 
government air-quality regulations,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released the same day the National Mining  
Association, an industry trade group, projected that demand for 
coal will remain strong this year, pushing past the record high of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The group forecast that total domestic consumption and exports  
of coal will be 1.14 billion tons in 1999, a slight increase from 
the 1.131 billion tons a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric utilities seeking a low-cost fuel are driving much of  
the demand, the group said. Its analysis concluded that utilities 
will use 935 million tons of coal to generate 56.8 percent of 
electricity produced by public utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's coal mining companies are alive and well and  
producing more coal than they have at any time in history,'' said 
Richard L. Lawson, president of the mining trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the National Mining Association study found that coal  
use for electricity will increase in all regions except New 
England, where some nuclear generators are returning to service 
following years of dormancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall the Midwest and the South represent areas of greatest  
growth. Production east of the Mississippi River will be slightly 
higher than in the West, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of weak economies abroad, exports are projected to  
continue a decline that began in 1995. The report estimates that 
exports will total 76 million tons, down slightly from 78 million 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal use in coking operations is estimated to remain at 28  
million tons, while industrial and retail coal consumption is 
expected to drop to 74 million tons, from 76 million in 1998, 
because of low natural gas and oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Nation's Mayors Mull Gun Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scott King called it the most difficult duty  
he's had to perform as mayor of Gary Ind. -- bidding farewell to a 
police officer cut down in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's only one reason King is among the 280 city leaders  
gathered this week in the nation's capital seeking to reduce gun 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, you got in a fight and went home with a  
bloody lip. These days, the kids have guns, and we have to do 
something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What exactly can be done is a hot topic at the annual U.S.  
Conference of Mayors winter meeting that concludes Friday. Over the 
past year, mayors have explored the possibility of a large 
multi-city lawsuit against gun makers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mayors said the complexities of dealing with a maze of  
jurisdictions and differing state laws made it unlikely they will 
join in a unified lawsuit. In their successful effort against the 
tobacco industry, states wound up filing individual suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see any large-scale suits because you  
have 50 sets of state laws to deal with,'' said Mayor Paul Helmke 
of Fort Wayne, Ind. ``But we have to do something to deal with the 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer said the impact of several mayors  
unifying against the gun industry in a class action-style suit 
``would have a serious impact'' but agreed it probably wouldn't 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different cities have to examine their own circumstances,''  
Archer said. ``But the bottom line is every mayor wants to make 
their city safer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Topics such as education, strengthening welfare-to-work programs  
and preparing for the 2000 census and community development also 
will be addressed by the mayors during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, New Orleans and Chicago became the first major cities  
to sue gun makers seeking to recover the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago suit, which seeks $433 million from the gun  
industry, accuses gun makers of ``flooding' the city with illegal 
guns, said Mayor Richard M. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mayors will also explore alternatives, such as  
negotiating with the industry to increase funding to develop guns 
that can be fired only by their owners, providing gun locks and 
reducing the number of guns manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't closing the door on anything,'' King said. ``Some  
cities might use lawsuits, others can negotiate with the 
manufacturers and others could look at new laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government statistics show guns were used in 13,262 homicides  
and 18,232 suicides in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridgeport, Conn., and the unified Miami-Dade County government  
in Florida Wednesday announced they will sue gun makers in an 
attempt to recover the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell, leader of a mayors' gun  
violence task force, has threatened for more than a year to sue gun 
makers while opening negotiations for voluntary concessions to 
limit gun production. He accused gun makers of stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we hear is the usual stuff about, 'We need more time to  
examine your proposals,''' Rendell said. ``That's why we need to 
fight this battle on different fronts. We can't put all our eggs in 
the lawsuit basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Adkins, a spokesman for the American Shooting Sports  
Council Inc., which represents gun makers, blamed the mayors, 
saying they were dragging out negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we thought we had some issues settled, we got a new list  
of demands,'' Adkins said in a telephone interview. ``It's the 
mayors who are playing games here.''

<HEADLINE> America Online Profits Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- Profits at America Online Inc. more than  
tripled in the latest quarter, as the nation's largest online 
service signed up another 1.6 million new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said Wednesday that it earned $121 million, or 22 cents per  
share, compared with $33 million, or 6 cents per share, for the 
same quarter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31, its fiscal second  
quarter, was up 62 percent to $960 million, compared with $592 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The net earnings figures include an accounting adjustment that  
allowed the company to deduct past losses from its tax bill, which 
raised net income. 
</P>
<P>
	Not including the adjustment, AOL earned $88 million, or 17  
cents per share. That was well above expectations of analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. who had predicted AOL would earn 14 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, which has more than 15 million subscribers, plus 2 million  
with its subsidiary CompuServe, is planning to buy Netscape 
Communications Corp. for $4.2 billion in a deal expected to close 
this spring. The Netscape browser site draws 20 million visitors 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1998, the Internet truly came of age and became even more  
integral to people's everyday lives,'' said Steve Case, chairman 
and chief executive officer. ``We're excited about the 
opportunities presented by our pending combination with Netscape as 
well as our alliance with Sun Microsystems to drive the growth of 
this new medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the company launched AOL in Australia in a  
joint venture with Bertelsmann AG and announced a joint venture 
with the Cisneros Group to develop and market AOL services for 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from customers' online fees grew 61 percent to $779  
million. Revenues from advertising and online transactions rose 66 
percent to $181 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended Dec. 31, earnings rose 356 percent to  
$228 million, or 41 cents per share, from $64 million, or 13 cents 
per share, in the last half of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Wednesday a 2-for-1 stock split to  
take effect on Feb. 22. It is the sixth split since the company 
went public in March 1992. The most recent split was Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL released its earnings after the market closed. Its shares  
rose $10.50, or 7 percent, to close at $165.50 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, and was higher in after-hours trading.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- General Dynamics Corp., a leading  
defense contractor, posted a 15.6 percent increase in profit for 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer of nuclear submarines, warships and the M1  
Abrams battle tank earned $96 million, or 75 cents per share, for 
the three months ended Dec. 31, 1998, up from $83 million, or 65 
cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. Sales were $1.47 
billion, a 33 percent increase over fourth-quarter 1997 sales of 
$1.10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected General  
Dynamics to earn 73 cents a share. In trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, shares fell 31 1/4 cents to close at $56. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, profits were $364 million, or $2.86 per  
share, up 15.2 percent over 1997 net earnings of $316 million, or 
$2.50 per share. Sales for the year were $4.97 billion, a 22 
percent increase over 1997 sales of $4.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and CEO Nicholas D. Chabraja said all of the company's  
programs continue to receive strong support in Congress, including 
the DDG-51 destroyers, LPD-17 amphibious ships, the Virginia-class 
attack submarine and system-enhanced M1-A2 Abrams tanks.

<P>
	NEW ULM, Minn. (AP) -- 3M Co. is closing its manufacturing plant  
in West Deptford, N.J., and move production operations from that 
plant to southern Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Deptford facility makes electrical crimp terminals,

</P>
<P>
	The action is part of 3M's overall effort to trim costs in  
response to global economic conditions, a company statement said 
Tuesday. 3M plans to reduce employment by 4,500 by the end of 1999, 
consolidate some manufacturing operations around the world and

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Cheered in Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The greeting for Spree was one of unabashed  
glee. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell received a roar of approval in pregame  
introductions at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night as he 
prepared to play his first game in almost 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	If the fans haven't forgiven him for his attack on Golden State  
coach P.J. Carlesimo, they didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, introduced fourth among the Knicks' five starters,  
received the warmest response of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there were more boos for Patrick Ewing, the president  
of the players' union, than there were for the league's so-called 
poster child for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll be fine regardless of what the response is,''  
Sprewell said Wednesday morning at the Knicks' shootaround. ``I'm 
going to go out to compete and play and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the response is, I'm not going to worry too much  
about it. If it's good, I'm happy with that. If it's bad, I'm going 
to try to change that by working hard. But I can't let it affect 
the way I play on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was on the court practicing more than two hours before  
the game, his hair tied in cornrows and flapping in the breeze 
whenever he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said he was operating at about 80-85 percent of peak  
efficiency, although the range on his jumper, he said, was not much 
better than college 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to even touch the ball in the first three minutes  
of the game, there was no way Sprewell could have ignored the noise 
the first time the ball came his way. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first touch, the crowd roared as he went one-on-one  
against Kendall Gill and drew a foul. His first shot came some 30 
seconds later, a clean jumper from 17 feet that hit nothing but 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, the decibel level of the crowd's approval was somewhat  
stunning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell later missed his first 3-point attempt and shot a layup  
on an uncontested breakaway rather than unleashing one of his 
trademark screaming dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand any emotion anybody has,'' Knicks coach Jeff  
Van Gundy said before the game. ``But from my dealings with him 
over the first eight days, he's going to be a fan favorite at some 
point because of how hard he plays. The bottom line with our crowd 
is that they expect hard work, and Latrell plays extremely hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell started for New York in a three-guard alignment  
alongside Charlie Ward and Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time All-Star is being counted on to lift New York out  
of a four-year slump of not having made it past the second round of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks took a large amount of public criticism for their  
decision to trade for Sprewell, and it remains to be seen whether 
he'll be able to flourish in the spotlight of the nation's largest 
media market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable with the team, it's just a matter of getting  
the terminology down and feeling better about my legs,'' Sprewell 
said. ``It's a little different for me, but I'm going to try to get 
to the basket, defend guys, make open shots and create for other 
people. So I'm still doing the same things offensively and 
defensively.''

<HEADLINE> Text of Homily by Pope John Paul II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The prepared text of Pope John Paul II's homily Wednesday at the  
Trans World Dome as provided by the Archdiocese of St. Louis: 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Dear Brothers and Sisters,  
</P>
<P>
	In the Incarnation, God fully reveals himself in the Son who  
came into the world (cf. Tertio Millennio Adveniente, 9). Our faith 
is not simply the result of our searching for God. In Jesus Christ, 
it is God who comes in person to speak to us and to show us the way 
to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Incarnation also reveals the truth about man. In Jesus  
Christ, the Father has spoken the definitive word about our true 
destiny and the meaning of human history (cf. ibid., 5). ``In this 
is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent 
his Son as an expiation for our sins'' (1 Jn 4:10). The Apostle is 
speaking of the love that inspired the Son to become man and to 
dwell among us. Through Jesus Christ we know how much the Father 
loves us. In Jesus Christ, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, each one 
of us can share in the love that is the life of the Blessed 
Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint John goes on: ``Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son  
of God, God remains in him and he in God'' (1 Jn 4:15). Through 
faith in the Son of God made man we abide in the very heart of God: 
``God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God 
in him'' (1 Jn 4:16). These words open to us the mystery of the 
Sacred Heart of Jesus: the love and compassion of Jesus is the door 
through which the eternal love of the Father is poured out on the 
world. In celebrating this Mass of the Sacred Heart, let us open 
wide our own hearts to Gods saving mercy! 
</P>
<P>
	In the Gospel reading which we have just heard, Saint Luke uses  
the figure of the Good Shepherd to speak of this divine love. The 
Good Shepherd is an image dear to Jesus in the Gospels. Answering 
the Pharisees who complained that he welcomed sinners by eating 
with them, the Lord asks them a question: Which of you, having a 
hundred sheep and losing one of them, would not leave the 
ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds 
it? ``And when he does find it, he sets it on his shoulders with 
great joy and, upon his arrival home, he calls together his friends 
and neighbors and says to them: Rejoice with me because I have 
found my lost sheep'' (Lk 15:5-6). 
</P>
<P>
	This parable highlights the joy of Christ and of our heavenly  
Father at every sinner who repents. God's love is a love that 
searches us out. It is a love that saves. This is the love that we 
find in the Heart of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Once we know the love that is in the Heart of Christ, we know  
that every individual, every family, every people on the face of 
the earth can place their trust in that Heart. We have heard Moses 
say: ``You are a people sacred to the Lord, your God . . . the Lord 
set his heart on you and chose you . . . because the Lord loved 
you'' (Deut 7:6-8). From Old Testament times, the core of salvation 
history is Gods unfailing love and election, and our human answer 
to that love. Our faith is our response to Gods love and election. 
</P>
<P>
	Three hundred years have passed since December 8, 1698, when the  
Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was offered for the first time in what 
is now the City of St. Louis. It was the Feast of the Immaculate 
Conception of our Blessed Mother, and Father Montigny, Father 
Davion and Father St. Cosme set up a stone altar on the banks of 
the Mississippi River and offered Mass. These three centuries have 
been a history of God's love poured out in this part of the United 
States, and a history of generous response to that love. 
</P>
<P>
	In this Archdiocese, the commandment of love has called forth an  
endless series of activities for which today we give thanks to our 
heavenly Father. St. Louis has been the Gateway to the West, but it 
has also been the gateway of great Christian witness and 
evangelical service. In fidelity to Christ's command to evangelize, 
the first pastor of this local Church, Bishop Joseph Rosati who 
came from the town of Sora, very near Rome promoted outstanding 
missionary activity from the beginning. In fact, today we can count 
forty-six different Dioceses in the area which Bishop Rosati 
served. 
</P>
<P>
	In this area, numerous Religious Congregations of men and women  
have labored for the Gospel with exemplary dedication, generation 
after generation. Here can be found the American roots of the 
evangelizing efforts of the Legion of Mary and other associations 
of the lay apostolate. The work of the Society for the Propagation 
of the Faith, made possible by the generous support of the people 
of this Archdiocese, is a real sharing in the Church's response to 
command to evangelize. From St. Louis, Cardinal Ritter sent the 
first Fidei Donum priests to Latin America in 1956, giving 
practical expression to the exchange of gifts which should always 
be a part of the communion between the Churches. This solidarity 
within the Church was the central theme of last year's Special 
Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops, and it is the central 
idea of the Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in America -- the Church 
in America -- which I have just signed and issued at the Shrine of 
Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, by the grace of God, charitable activities of every kind  
have been a vibrant part of Catholic life. The Saint Vincent de 
Paul Society has had a privileged place in the Archdiocese from the 
beginning. Catholic Charities have for years performed exceptional 
work in the name of Jesus Christ. Outstanding Catholic health care 
services have shown the human face of the loving and compassionate 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic schools have proven to be of priceless value to  
generations of children, teaching them to know, love and serve God, 
and preparing them to take their place with responsibility in the 
community. Parents, teachers, pastors, administrators and entire 
parishes have sacrificed enormously to maintain the essential 
character of Catholic education as an authentic ministry of the 
Church and an evangelical service to the young. The goals of the 
Strategic Pastoral Plan of the Archdiocese evangelization, 
conversion, stewardship, Catholic education, service to those in 
need have a long tradition here.

<HEADLINE> Apple Settles FTC Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. has agreed to settle  
federal charges that it broke promises to offer consumers free 
technical support, the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple agreed to reimburse thousands of customers -- who were  
charged $35 each time they needed help starting in October 1997 -- 
and to provide the free assistance that it once promised for 
products bought between 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC didn't specify how much the move will cost Apple, but  
it's unlikely products purchased in that duration would still 
require technical support because technology becomes obsolete so 
quickly. It did not specify exactly how many customers can expect 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Apple Computer couldn't be reached immediately  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement didn't hurt Apple stock, which rose 2.9 percent  
Tuesday, or by $1.12 1/2, to close at $40.50 a share on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Apple's promises were part of its ``Apple  
Assurance'' program, which guaranteed free access to technical 
support workers for as long as they owned their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``For prospective purchasers of computer products, free access  
to live technical support is especially enticing,'' said Jodie 
Bernstein, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
``Companies that make such offers have to live up to their 
promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple told the FTC it will send a refund check or credit a  
customer's bank account for any amount paid for technical support 
under the Apple Assurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners approved the settlement 4-0.

<HEADLINE> Riley Wants Rodman on His Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pat Riley says he wants to sign Dennis Rodman if  
the NBA bad boy will follow team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But those rules include showing up for practice, and it's  
unclear whether Rodman is willing to do that for the Miami Heat on 
a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would issue a challenge to Dennis in this way: I think  
Dennis is a winner, a rebounder, a defender, and he may still have 
enough in him to help a young team win a championship,'' Riley said 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman talked about retirement last week, then said he would  
play for the league minimum in Miami or Orlando. The Magic have 
said they're not interested in the 37-year-old cross-dressing 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not mind the clothes he packs in his baggage,'' Riley  
said. ``I respect him as a basketball player, and I respect him as 
a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heat general manager Randy Pfund has been in contact with a  
representative of Rodman's, Riley said. The Heat could offer Rodman 
only $1 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think he has what it takes to teach a team how to  
win,'' Riley said. ``That could be a legacy of his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Riley cautioned that Rodman would have to sacrifice some of  
his individuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to come and be a part of this and be equal, what  
he does away from the court and what his personality is is 
irrelevant to me,'' Riley said. ``But it would have to be on equal 
terms. That's the only way it would work. It could not be any 
double standard in terms of work ethic and practices. It would be 
on the team's terms -- team first, team last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman and his wife, Carmen Electra, are in Miami for the Super  
Bowl this week and will host a party Thursday night on South Beach. 
The Heat open their season Feb. 5.

 *Super Bowl Special    	
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Stars, superstars, has-beens and all kinds of  
wannabes can't escape The Gauntlet, and most of them don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gauntlet, officially known as Radio Row, includes 47 radio  
networks and stations on two floors of Miami's Hyatt Regency during 
Super Bowl Week. During the day, night and even after midnight, 
they're jawing and guffawing live to every corner of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Guys like Fred Biletnikoff and Garo Yepremian, former NFL  
players doing promotional work this week, could give interviews 12 
hours a day all week and still not get to every station with a 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Albom, 11-time Associated Press Sports Editors columnist  
of the year for the Detroit Free Press, does double duty as a talk 
show host for three hours in the afternoon on WJR. It's hectic, 
interviewing Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos in the morning, 
schmoozing with guests on the radio in the afternoon and writing 
for the newspaper at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many people available that the problem is fitting  
in all the guests,'' Albom said. ``It's loud with all the other 
stations close by. Sometimes you're interviewing a guy and there 
are four producers from other shows hanging over him, trying to get 
him on their show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The on-air time champions this week are ESPN Radio, with a total  
of 100 hours; CBS SportsLine from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through 
Friday; and The Score, 1160 in Chicago, which is on 12 1/2 hours a 
day, with a host doing the show solo from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't hear the other tables talking and laughing,''  
said afternoon co-host Terry Boers, a former Chicago Sun-Times 
columnist. ``Actually, it's nice that the guys at one table come 
over and talk to us, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, most of the stations engage in the time-honored Super  
Bowl tradition of media interviewing media. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Wilbon, a Washington Post sports columnist, and George  
Michael, host of TV's weekly Sports Machine, exchanged barbs with 
Boers and co-host Dan McNeil on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Murray, media relations director for the Detroit Lions for  
51 weeks a year, is the Super Bowl's electronic media coordinator 
for this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1986, we had five stations on radio row, five years ago it  
was 18 and this week it's 47,'' Murray said. ``I can say with 
certainty that the top 100 markets in the country are covered by 
these stations and networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Denver has five of its station broadcasting live,  
and Atlanta has three. From NFL cities, only Philadelphia, 
Minnesota, Indianapolis and Kansas City don't have local stations 
here, although they are getting network radio coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	WJFK-AM in Baltimore, flagship station for the Ravens, is  
represented from 7:30-10:30 p.m. by Stan Charles, known as ``Stan 
the Fan'' to his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles said this year's broadcasts have been routine compared  
to last year in San Diego, when zoo celebrity Joan Embry brought 
animals along for her radio interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	KIRO in Seattle, the Seahawks' flagship station, is on for just  
two hours at night, plus some short daytime reports, but host Paul 
Moyer, a former player and coach, said he and producer-engineer Ian 
Henry have stayed busy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've interviewed Mike Holmgren, Anthony Munoz and Howie Long,  
but you don't really come all this way for that,'' Moyer said. 
``You do it for the presence, being able to say `Live from the 
Super Bowl.' That makes it worthwhile.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Urge Saudi, Kuwait Coups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's parliament today urged the people of  
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to overthrow their rulers for supporting 
last month's U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued at the end of a two-day session of the  
250-member house called the two countries ``lackeys of the United 
States and Britain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in Iraq generally echo the official thinking, and  
parliamentary debates are seen as an outlet for government opinion. 
Today's parliamentary statement will be sent to President Saddam 
Hussein for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Iraq has given up hopes of support from Arab  
governments after their foreign ministers, who met in Cairo on 
Sunday, failed to denounce the Dec. 16-19 bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq will now focus on ``Arab masses who stood against the  
December aggression and shook thrones and chairs'' across the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Iraq demonstrations swept the streets in many Arab capitals  
during the bombing, which followed Iraq's refusal to cooperate with 
a U.N. commission overseeing the dismantling of its weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the commission certifies that Iraq is free of such  
weapons, the U.N. Security Council refuses to lift trade sanctions 
imposed in wake of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the 
1991 Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's parliament also asked the government to formally demand  
compensation from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for aiding the United 
States and Britain in their attacks on Iraq since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the ``Arab masses are called upon to stage a revolution  
against these agent regimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam made a similar call for overthrowing pro-American Arab  
governments early this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 30 lawmakers who gave speeches also demanded that  
the government withdraw its recognition of Kuwait and stop all 
forms of cooperation with the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kuwaiti and Saudi rulers are traitors and we have to topple  
them,'' said one lawmaker, Fadhil Saleh. 
</P>
<P>
	Another, Sadeeq Muhammad, said ``we have to urge Arab masses to  
hit the Saudi and Kuwaiti regimes with everything at their 
disposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one member counseled caution, urging his colleagues to  
``try to be more sensible and practical'' in their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Youssef Hamdan, a former communist, told the parliament to stop  
thinking ``of rescinding the recognition of Kuwait'' and to put a 
halt to the jabs at Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need for this smear campaign,'' he said and warned  
that failing to abide by international obligations may throw Iraq 
``into another war of grave consequences.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Police Ready if Falcons Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta will have all its police officers on duty  
Sunday night and early Monday in anticipation of a win by the 
Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect a celebratory mood after the game ends, and we pride  
ourselves on being a nonviolent city,'' Nick Gold, spokesman for 
Mayor Bill Campbell, said Wednesday. ``Keep in mind that this is 
the birthplace of civil rights and the nonviolent movement in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city's most popular restaurant and bar district will be  
closed to traffic from 4 p.m. Sunday through dawn Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are hoping go avoid the kind of violence Denver  
experienced after the Broncos won their first Super Bowl last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some rioting and setting of fires ... and we just  
want to make sure everyone is safe,'' Atlanta police Lt. Darryl 
Tolleson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago also was plagued with unrest after the Bulls won their  
recent NBA championships. Players Dennis Rodman and Michael Jordan 
and coach Phil Jackson appeared on television urging the city to 
stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold said no such TV announcements are planned in Atlanta, but  
police will be on hand to ensure ``law and order in the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city plans a parade for the Falcons Monday, whether they win  
or lose against the Broncos.

<HEADLINE> Starr: White House May Have Leaked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In newly unsealed court papers in the Monica  
Lewinsky investigation, Kenneth Starr says the White House and 
defense lawyers -- not the prosecutor's office -- were the prime 
suspects in a flood of leaks to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's court papers focus on the sharing of sensitive  
information between attorneys for key witnesses and the Clinton 
White House starting in the initial stages of the Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attorneys scoffed at the suggestion the White House  
was the source of the leaks, accusing the prosecutor's office of 
``trying to deflect attention from itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the inquiry, Clinton lawyer David Kendall kicked off a  
behind-the-scenes court battle by accusing Starr's office of 
leaking damaging information about the president to the news media. 
The result is an investigation in which an appointee of U.S. 
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson is trying to determine 
whether Starr's office fed grand jury information to reporters in 
24 different news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kendall publicly suggested Feb. 6 that the source for a  
New York Times story was Starr's office, prosecutor Robert Bittman 
responded with a two-page document filed in federal court pointing 
to the White House and the lawyer for presidential secretary Betty 
Currie as the likely sources. Mrs. Currie's lawyer, Lawrence 
Wechsler, says he wasn't the source of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper revealed Clinton's Jan. 18 discussion with Mrs.  
Currie about Ms. Lewinsky, a central piece of the perjury and 
obstruction impeachment charges against Clinton. In the Jan. 18 
discussion and a second conversation a few days later, the 
president made comments to his secretary such as ``Monica came on 
to me, and I never touched her, right?'' and ``We were never really 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bittman's newly unsealed declaration from last February says  
that ``Lawrence H. Wechsler, private counsel to Ms. Currie, told 
me'' he is ``a longtime friend of Charles F.C. Ruff, White House 
counsel'' and that ``Mr. Ruff referred Ms. Currie to Mr. Wechsler 
when she ``consulted with Mr. Ruff about getting an attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bittman said Wechsler ``confirmed to me that the president's  
defense attorneys had been provided the substance of Ms. Currie's 
information in advance of the publication'' of the Times article. 
</P>
<P>
	In the newly unsealed court papers, Starr asserted that ``this  
White House previously has employed a concentrated strategy of 
leaking harmful material to the media at an early stage to reduce 
long-term damage. ... There is a strong prima facie case that the 
president and his agents ... are responsible for many of the 
alleged `leaks.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Starr has this habit of pointing fingers at other people to  
masquerade his own wrongdoing, and this is just another example of 
that sleight of hand,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the newly unsealed court papers, Kendall stated that  
``assuming only for the present that the White House was privy to 
the Currie information in the (New York Times) article, the White 
House had no interest in early disclosure of the information.''

<HEADLINE> Duke-FSU Game Will Be in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Duke is expected to make about $1  
million for agreeing to move its 1999 home football game against 
Florida State to Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will meet Oct. 2 at Alltel Stadium, the home of the  
Gator Bowl, the annual Florida-Georgia game and the Jacksonville 
Jaguars. Jacksonville is about three hours away from Florida 
State's home in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the move came Tuesday, two months after  
former Duke Coach Fred Goldsmith was fired and replaced by former 
Florida assistant Carl Franks. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke earned $1 million to play its 1995 game against the  
Seminoles in Orlando. Afterward, Goldsmith said the Blue Devils 
would never move another home game. 
</P>
<P>
	But Franks and Duke athletic director Joe Alleva quickly began  
considering another move after Franks arrived in Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about this opportunity and certainly encouraged  
our athletic director to schedule this game in an important area 
for our alumni and fans,'' Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Home of Florida State's second-largest alumni club, Jacksonville  
has been trying for years to bring the Seminoles to the 73,000-seat 
Alltel Stadium. Their last appearance came in 1989, when they lost 
30-26 to a Southern Mississippi team led by Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know as a former college football player that there is  
nothing like the thrill of playing in a pro stadium,'' Alleva said. 
``This game will allow our kids to experience that next year. The 
game is also good for the ACC in expanding our presence in the 
state of Florida and in solidifying our recruiting base in the 
Jacksonville area.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Recommend Mayday Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Investigators examining a 1997 sailboat  
sinking that claimed four lives have recommended that the U.S. 
Coast Guard treat all mayday signals as legitimate until thoroughly 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
	The report issued Tuesday said ``search planners must engage in  
aggressive detective work'' if they can't tell where a signal is 
coming from. Following the report, Commandant James Loy ordered a 
review of Coast Guard rules on responding to distress calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued a week before the National Transportation  
Safety Board holds hearings into the wreck of the 34-foot Morning 
Dew. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard did not launch a search for the stricken boat  
off the South Carolina coast despite a radio distress call and a 
subsequent report from another boat of voices in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB is also looking into the whether the Coast Guard  
botched the handling of a distress call from a clamming boat that 
went down off Barnegat Light, N.J., last week. The four crewmen are 
presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the Coast Guard said the mayday message was  
unintelligible and did not contain enough information to launch a 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning Dew had radioed a brief distress message. The Coast  
Guard tried three times to radio back but got no response. No 
search was launched because there was not enough information about 
the vessel's location. 
</P>
<P>
	About four hours later, a crewman on a passing ship reported  
calls for help from the water. A harbor pilot boat searched, but 
the Coast Guard did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer on watch who received the radio message said he did  
not hear the word ``mayday.''

<HEADLINE> Remembering the Night Miami Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Everyone told Dick Anderson how well things were  
going when he headed the Super Bowl host committee 10 years ago, 
planning all the parties that accompany the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I saw what was happening on television,'' the ex-Pro Bowl  
defensive back said, ``and I almost broke into tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Anderson saw in Miami were fires burning in the Overtown  
and Liberty City neighborhoods, set by rioters angry that a 
Hispanic police officer fatally shot an unarmed black motorcyclist 
who was speeding. A passenger on the motorcycle died when the 
driver crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, the festive mood of the Super Bowl evaporated. And  
Anderson knew the three days of riots would endanger what he had 
worked so hard to create. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought people would become apprehensive,'' he said. ``Super  
Bowl crowds usually come in on Thursday for the weekend. If you're 
sitting at home on Monday or Tuesday and there are riots in the 
city you're going to visit, you become concerned. Anytime there's a 
disturbance, whether it's Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago or Miami, 
people are going to think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those thinking about it were the Cincinnati Bengals and  
San Francisco 49ers, who hardly needed the disruption before the 
biggest game of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Wilcots was a reserve defensive back for the Bengals,  
who lost the game 20-16, and uttered one of the most memorable 
quotes about the riots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out to watch a movie, `Mississippi Burning,''' he said,  
``and when I came out of the movie, Miami was burning. This was 
1989. You don't think you're going to have riots in urban areas. We 
were 30 years removed from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Munoz, Cincinnati's Hall of Fame offensive lineman,  
could see the smoke from his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember looking out my window and staring at it,'' he said.  
``I saw this fire and I was thinking, `What's going on?' Here I am 
in my second Super Bowl. The first one, in Detroit, it was too cold 
to go outside. And now this. I couldn't go outside again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals were concerned because wide receiver Eddie Brown, a  
Miami native, was believed to be visiting friends in the troubled 
area. The team called the police to go in after him, but Brown had 
left before the trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed in the racial violence, 11 were wounded by  
gunfire and nearly 400 were arrested. Thirteen buildings were 
torched and others looted, causing about $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer William Lozano was convicted of manslaughter but won a  
new trial and was acquitted in 1993. He was later fired, but a 
federal arbitrator ordered the city to reinstate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems the riots caused for Overtown residents and  
the city, Anderson thought Miami came through the crisis very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd have been better off if it hadn't happened,'' he said.  
``But every Super Bowl activity the committee planned went off 
extremely well, without a hitch. We got another Super Bowl in 1995 
and a second one this year. So the people who make the choices 
weren't affected by the riot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, perhaps they were.  
</P>
<P>
	Under commissioner Paul Tagliabue, the NFL began a community  
outreach program, sponsoring Youth Education Towns in the last six 
Super Bowl cities. One center opened in Liberty City in 1995 and 
ground was broken Wednesday for another in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul felt we had to pay more attention to the cities in which  
we play Super Bowls and leave more of a legacy than we did in the 
early years,'' NFL vice president Joe Browne said. ``The YET 
centers are a bricks-and-mortar legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the league is sponsoring construction of 10 Habitat  
for Humanity homes that will provide housing for low-income 
families in the Little Haiti area. The NFL has also funded projects 
in Carol City, next to Pro Player Stadium, and a scholarship 
program for southern Florida minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the riots left scars.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray Buck, then a reporter with the Houston Post, had decided to  
spend the evening at a dog track with his wife, Mary. They had the 
misfortune of making a wrong turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were eight guys on the street and they had stopped the  
car in front of us,'' he said. ``My wife was driving and I said, 
`Be careful. It looks like a drug deal.' Then they started throwing 
stuff. A brick or a rock broke the windshield and glass got on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife sped away. We couldn't get out of there fast enough.  
Finally, we got back to the hotel and stayed in the room all 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now relocated in southern Florida with CBS SportsLine, Buck  
occasionally covers basketball games in the Miami Arena, on the 
fringe of the Overtown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still get paranoid going to Heat games,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Foster Steals Show Since Childhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Ben Foster loves his Nana Lucille, but  
sometimes she really makes him mad. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he was a 2-year-old marching around the kitchen with a top  
hat and cane, Mrs. Foster knew Ben would be some kind of performer. 
But whenever Ben talked about hitting it big, his Nana would always 
say, ``I'll be watching you from the stars. I won't be here, but 
I'll be with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That talk about not being around angers Foster, who isn't quite  
ready to lose his beloved grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	By next fall, though, Mrs. Foster should be watching the lanky  
youth with the stand-up blond hair WITH the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old actor has invited his grandmother to be his date  
at the premiere of ``Liberty Heights,'' the latest in director 
Barry Levinson's string of semi-autobiographical ``Baltimore 
films.'' In his first feature film role, Foster plays the younger 
son of a Jewish couple during the tumultuous integration of 
Baltimore's schools in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud of him, not because of his acting but because  
Ben is Ben,'' says Mrs. Foster, 82, of Newton, Mass. ``He's a 
wonderful, gentle, marvelous young man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster plays Ben Kurtzman. The role is based on Levinson's  
beloved late cousin, Eddie, a wisecracking prankster immortalized 
in the 1982 movie ``Diner'' as the guy who refused to marry his 
fiancee unless she passed a football quiz. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie Ben is a complex, idiosyncratic character. In a scene  
right out of Eddie's life, Ben dresses up as Adolf Hitler for 
Halloween. He is shocked when his Old World grandmother is 
offended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bub,'' he says, ``the war was forever ago.''  
</P>
<P>
	His attraction to a black girl transferred to his high school  
class is a focal point of the movie. When the girl's father gives 
him a ride home after catching him hiding in the girl's bedroom 
closet, Ben refuses to leave the car until the Sinatra ballad on 
the radio is finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't walk out on Frank,'' he tells the incredulous adult.  
``It would be too disrespectful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, who starred in the Disney Television series ``Flash  
Forward,'' says playing someone so close to Levinson's heart is a 
huge honor. The part is also close to Foster's heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster's grandmother fled Russia with her family in 1923 to  
escape the pogroms. Growing up in Boston, his father Steven was the 
target of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the single Jewish kid,'' Foster says. ``I mean, his  
nickname was Mouse, and he got beat up every day for being 
Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster and his brother, Jon, 14, were raised in Fairfield, Iowa,  
an eclectic community of 10,000 with no fewer than four community 
theater groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster has been stealing the show since second grade, when he  
played a starfish in the Iowa Theater Co.'s production of ``The 
Enchanted Pig,'' says artistic director Rodney Franz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been mature beyond his years,'' says Franz, who  
once kicked Foster out of class for refusing to work on a technique 
he didn't agree with. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting has made Foster grow up quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	He quit school in 11th grade and had his own apartment in Los  
Angeles by age 17. He is already up to a pack of Marlboro Reds a 
day. He celebrated his last three birthdays on one set or another. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's confident he has found his niche, and says he can't  
wait for the film's release. Neither can his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to be my age, you know no one can say whose next  
minute it is,'' she says. ``I'm certainly looking forward to it. If 
God is good, I shall be there.''

<HEADLINE> Daredevil Receives Liver Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel was in  
stable condition after receiving a long-awaited liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	At the family's request, no further details were being released,  
including when the transplant was performed, Tampa General Hospital 
spokesman John Dunn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 60, has hepatitis C, which he believes he contracted  
from one of the many blood transfusions he needed following 
spectacular crashes on the daredevil circuit in the 1960s and 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease destroyed his liver. Knievel announced in April that  
he needed a transplant, and he was hospitalized earlier this month 
with dehydration while awaiting a donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel broke at least 35 bones and underwent surgery 14 times  
during his stunt career, which included a jump over the 35-foot 
fountain at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in 1967 when he flew 
head-over-handlebars, was knocked unconscious and crushed his 
pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his most famous stunts failed when the parachute opened  
as he was zooming over Idaho's Snake River Canyon in 1974. The 
following year, a crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in London 
watched as he soared over 13 double-tiered buses and then crashed, 
again fracturing his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended his stunt career in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Sign One-Handed Pitcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jim Abbott will take his comeback to the  
National League, where the one-handed pitcher will have to bat for 
the first time since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about it,'' said Abbott, who agreed  
Wednesday to a $600,000, one-year contract with the Milwaukee 
Brewers. ``I'm looking forward to swinging the bat. I hope I can 
hold my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, a 31-year-old left-hander, was 5-0 with a 4.55 ERA for  
the Chicago White Sox last year in five late-season starts after a 
successful stint in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Sal Bando said Abbott would have a spot in the  
Brewers rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's his spot to lose. I mean, someone's going to have  
to beat him out because we're penciling him in as one of the 
starters,'' said Bando, who is hoping Abbott's experience and work 
ethic will aid his young pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Abbott is sure won't be an inspiration to his  
teammates is the way he's conquered his disability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, not in '96 they sure weren't inspired,'' Abbott cracked  
about his 2-18 season in Anaheim. ``No, you know, I think it comes 
down to pitching well. The novelty of my playing I think has long 
since passed, and I'm as accountable as the next guy down the line. 
I have to go out there and do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if I can go out there and give my team a chance to win,  
pick up the innings, that's how you gain respect, not by my 
switching the glove and all that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selected by the California Angels in the first round of the 1988  
amateur draft out of the University of Michigan, Abbott has an 
85-100 career record and 4.12 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who retired after a poor spring training in 1997, gets a  
$400,000 base salary and the chance to earn $200,000 in performance 
bonuses: $40,000 each for 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 starts. The pitcher 
and the team have a $1.5 million mutual option for 2000 with a 
$200,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said his goals are 30 starts and 200 innings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think any pitcher that does that as a starter has really  
given his contribution to the team,'' he said. ``That's the kind of 
pitcher I prided myself on being earlier in my career. And that's 
the pitcher I would like to get back to being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott credited his comeback to changing speeds, location and  
release points on his fastball, adjustments he failed to make in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really explain '96,'' Abbott said. ``I got off to a  
bad start and I just didn't pitch with confidence. I became awful 
tentative on the mound and it just became a downward spiral, a bad 
year personally and it was a tough year for the Angels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his release in spring training the next season, Abbott  
didn't know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I wanted to keep playing. I agonized over it.  
I thought about it a lot. I spent time with my family and I just 
found myself drawn back to the game quite a bit,'' he said. ``I 
figured I was young enough. The White Sox were kind enough to give 
me that opportunity, and it worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott felt he'd found a new home with the White Sox, but they  
called him over the winter to tell him they'd rather give innings 
to young pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I wanted to stay with Chicago,'' Abbott  
said. ``I felt they gave me a great opportunity and I was very 
thankful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But now he'll see if he can not only pitch in the NL, but hit,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm not going to make any brash predictions,'' Abbott  
said. ``We'll see. I'm going to pick up a bat and work hard at it 
and hopefully I'll be able to bunt with success and I'll hopefully 
get to face the Arizona Diamondbacks and Randy Johnson.''

<HEADLINE> Loose Tiger Shot, Killed in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, N.J. (AP) -- A 600- to 800-pound tiger that was on the  
loose in a densely wooded area was shot and killed by authorities 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife officials  
had tried to tranquilize the animal with drug-filled darts, said 
Sgt. Rick Ferrarelli. When that didn't work, they shot the tiger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just impossible to contain it,'' Ferrarelli said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police received a call Wednesday afternoon from a resident who  
said she saw what she thought was a tiger in her yard. 
</P>
<P>
	While the search was on, a radio station notified residents to  
stay inside and not let their children or animals outside. Police 
cars also drove up and down some roads advising people to stay 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still trying to determine who owned the tiger.  
</P>
<P>
	Ferrarelli said officials at Six Flags Great Adventure &AMP; Safari  
Park, a nearby tourist attraction, ``believe they have all 
theirs.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Vote May Haunt GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the 19 Republican senators up for  
re-election in 2000 are vulnerable enough to make their votes in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial politically perilous. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of voters want their senators to end the trial and  
keep Clinton in office, polls show. At the same time, the party's 
most conservative activists want the president tried and ousted, 
though their zeal has shown signs of ebbing. 
</P>
<P>
	This clash of political currents hobbled Republicans in the 1998  
midterm elections, when they lost five House seats and failed to 
make expected gains in the Senate. With each passing day, an 
increasing number of Republicans fear the damage could be far 
greater in 2000 -- when the House, Senate and White House are up for 
grabs -- unless the trial is stopped without angering the GOP base. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no easy answer if you're a Republican senator,'' said  
GOP strategist Ed Brookover. 
</P>
<P>
	That's especially true for the 13 GOP senators from states that  
Clinton won in 1996, such as Slade Gorton of Washington, John 
Chafee of Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of those 13 are freshmen, elected in the unusually pro-GOP  
atmosphere of 1994. Among the freshmen elected in pro-Clinton 
states: John Ashcroft of Missouri, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Olympia 
Snowe of Maine. For them, impeachment poses double trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The math is especially tough for freshmen senators from  
pro-Clinton states who won by the slightest of margins five years 
ago: Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Rod Grams of Minnesota 
earned less than 50 percent of the vote in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vote to convict identifies a Republican with the kooky wing  
of his party and puts him way out the mainstream of his state, 
especially if he comes from a state that elected Clinton,'' argued 
Democratic consultant Geoffrey Garin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without impeachment, 2000 promised to be a tough year for  
GOP senators. Democrats need to protect just 14 seats, with no more 
than two of them in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Most GOP senators running for re-election are taking a similar  
approach: Say little about the trial but promise a fair, quick 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee proposed ground rules for witness depositions that would  
limit their interrogation. Gorton tried to forge a no-witnesses 
compromise. Snowe had publicly raised concerns about calling 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pushed for a plan Monday to interview three  
witnesses and end the trial within 10 days. Though the proposal 
could yet unravel, the mere suggestion of a truncated trial 
suggests that GOP leaders sense a change in the political 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the Republican base is petering out on impeachment,''  
said consultant Ed Gillespie, who advises GOP Senate leaders. 
``Increasingly, they just want peace with honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Democrats holding enough votes to avoid conviction, some  
Republicans sense a willingness among conservatives to bow to the 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The best evidence of that is Christian Coalition founder Pat  
Robertson saying out of frustration that Clinton has won the public 
relations war and that the case ``might as well be dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question remains: What will conservatives settle for? Some  
Republicans want to cast two votes, one finding Clinton guilty on 
the facts to appease the GOP base and the second to keep him in 
office anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the senators aren't worried about politics, their  
advisers are. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams' consultant, Dave Carney, said his client will survive his  
vote -- for or against Clinton -- because Minnesota voters will 
quickly put the trial behind them and look for legislative results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even for people who want Clinton to be hung out to dry,  
they'll want to move on to other things, too,'' Carney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft was a leading voice for Clinton's resignation when he  
was courting conservatives to run for president. After popular 
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan said he would seek the Senate seat, 
Ashcroft abandoned his presidential ambitions and softened his 
anti-Clinton rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats plan to make him a top 2000 target, largely on the  
impeachment issue. Ashcroft said it won't be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Missouri sent me to the United States Senate to  
do my duty under the Constitution, and my duty is to seek the truth 
and be as fair as I possibly can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum toned down his anti-Clinton rhetoric, hoping to avoid  
turning the impeachment trial into an issue that dominates his 
campaign. In 1992, Sen. Arlen Specter's questioning of Anita Hill 
during Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court hearings became the singular 
issue of the Pennsylvania campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum's challengers would love to turn impeachment into a  
defining issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be important how he handles himself,'' said state Sen.  
Allyson Schwartz, who is seeking Santorum's seat. ``The degree to 
which he plays into that right-wing, get-rid-of-this-president 
mentality, that will be harmful for him.''

<HEADLINE> Handgun Wholesalers Case Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed charges against 15  
handgun wholesale distributors, leaving only manufacturers as 
defendants in a landmark trial seeking to hold the firearms 
industry responsible for guns falling into the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein made the ruling Tuesday after  
expressing doubts about the wholesalers' liability. Attorneys for 
the plaintiffs agreed that accusing both makers and distributors of 
the same guns could be perceived as ``double-dipping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cleaner case and more technically a correct case as far  
as liability is concerned without them in it, and we've made a 
decision to release the distributors,'' said plaintiff's attorney 
Denise Dunleavy. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- brought in 1995 by Freddie Hamilton, a Brooklyn  
woman whose son was gunned down two years earlier -- is viewed as a 
precursor to upcoming legal challenges by cities hoping to recover 
the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit's central claim is that about 30 gun manufacturers  
``oversupply'' certain markets where gun laws are lax, knowing that 
the extra guns end up in the hands of criminals in states with 
stricter controls -- like New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Beretta USA Corp., Ruger &AMP;  
Co., Accu-Tek and the other defendants say the plaintiffs have 
never conclusively linked the weapons used to harm their relatives 
to specific gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weinstein has allowed the plaintiffs to argue the ``chain of  
title'' is irrelevant. What matters, they argue, is that the 
industry creates a widespread risk with indiscriminate marketing -- 
a concept know as collective liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley used similar logic in filing a  
$433 million lawsuit against the firearms industry late last year. 
That suit accuses gun makers of saturating his city with more 
weapons than could ever be sold to law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans is pursuing a similar suit, while other cities,  
including Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, are also 
considering taking gun makers to court.

<HEADLINE> Gran Turismo: Cardigans' Darker Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A photograph of the Swedish band The Cardigans  
taken several years ago shows five fresh-faced, smiling friends and 
musicians hanging from a jungle gym dressed in bright outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	The band members, dressed in dark attire, take on a more serious  
tone for a photo session at a dimly lit velvety New York City bar 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``What? No smiles?'' the photographer asks in vain.  
</P>
<P>
	The expressions are typical of the lyrical melancholia that  
rises to the top on The Cardigans' latest record, ``Gran Turismo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Nina Persson's crass musings on abandonment and betrayal  
in the band's darkest songs underscore a bleak perspective that is 
maintained throughout the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you really think that love is gonna save your soul. ... I  
really, really hope so, but I don't think so,'' broods Persson in 
``Do You Believe?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The lyrics have always been kind of crass and kind of dark,''  
Persson says. ``I think they've just become more obvious now that 
the music is also illustrating that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardigans will return to Manhattan to perform at Irving  
Plaza on Feb 4. The tour will continue through February with shows 
scheduled in Detroit, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and other U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Persson and guitarist Peter Svensson, bassist Magnus  
Sveningsson, drummer Bengt Lagerberg and keyboardist Lasse 
Johansson were still in their late teens when they formed the band 
in their hometown of Jonkoping, Sweden, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	While the band's first two records, ``Emmerdale'' and ``Life,''  
were big hits in Europe and Asia, they were virtually ignored in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1996, The Cardigans released their third record,  
``First Band on the Moon,'' featuring the kitschy pop gem, 
``Lovefool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Baz Luhrmann featured the sticky sweet song in his  
film, ``William Shakespeare's Romeo &AMP; Juliet,'' which starred 
Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lovefool'' received an additional marketing boost when The  
Cardigans performed it during an episode of ``Beverly Hills, 
90210.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, ``Lovefool'' became the fourth most played song on  
the radio in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardigans toured nonstop for about two years in support of  
``First Band on the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't die or become drug addicts,'' Persson says. ``We  
just had a couple of months where we were not really sure we loved 
it any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After spending several months apart, the band met at producer  
Tore Johansson's countryside home outside Malmo. The provincial 
surrounding, located on the southern tip of Sweden, was a fitting 
place to relax and work on the new record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sveningsson insists the heavier sound on ``Gran Turismo'' is not  
an attempt by The Cardigans to distance themselves from the success 
of ``Lovefool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the new record, they abandoned the '60s retro production of  
``First Band on the Moon,'' opting for a more postmodern atmosphere 
with plenty of synthesized beats and distortion layered on top of 
guitar-driven songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we wanted to do was develop the darker side that has  
always been present on our records,'' Sveningsson says. 
</P>
<P>
	This new direction is also evident in the video for the band's  
new single, ``My Favourite Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The video was directed by Jonas Akerlund, who directed Madonna's  
``Ray of Light.'' It features Persson driving recklessly into 
oncoming traffic down a stretch of desert highway, inattentive to 
the cars crashing around her. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV rejected the initial version. Several crashes were edited  
out before it was finally allowed to air, Sveningsson says.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Accuses Feds of Tinkering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's next witness at its antitrust  
trial says government efforts to modify the company's popular 
Windows software slowed some functions sevenfold and prevented some 
programs from running at all. 
</P>
<P>
	James Allchin, a senior vice president expected to take the  
stand Monday, derided government efforts as a ``Rube Goldberg 
mechanism'' that made Windows ``effectively useless in a commercial 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft released Allchin's 139 pages of written testimony  
Wednesday, even as the government ended its initial questioning of 
Paul Maritz, the senior executive responsible for Microsoft's most 
important consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sought to show that, over Microsoft's protests,  
Internet browser software was illegally built into newer versions 
of the Windows operating system and can be safely removed. 
</P>
<P>
	A software expert, Edward Felten of Princeton University, who  
wrote a removal program, testified previously that his procedure 
``does not prevent Windows 98 from (starting) properly, nor does it 
affect the stability of Windows 98 under ordinary use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Allchin said Felten's methods ``seriously degrade'' Windows,  
making parts of it run seven times slower and preventing consumers 
from using popular software by IBM Corp., America Online Inc. and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies, in a second day of  
aggressive cross-examination, pressed Maritz about Microsoft's 
efforts in 1995 to discourage Intel Corp. from developing new 
technology, called Native Signal Processing, that could compete 
with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has used the episode to support its charge that  
Microsoft illegally used its influence in the high-tech industry to 
stifle potential competition against its lucrative Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to give Intel reason to feel they needed to go  
and develop system software,'' Maritz said, adding that Microsoft 
believed the new technology ``was not in Intel's own interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz later conceded, ``We did think it was a bad thing for  
Microsoft. ... I hope we got our point across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, a senior computer scientist for the company, rejected  
in his written testimony claims that Microsoft chose to include its 
browser software within Windows to try to ``crush'' Netscape 
Communications Corp., whose own browser earned tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin accused the government of trying ``to cast such  
integration in a bad light, suggesting that it occurs only for 
improper purposes, namely, to force customers to take things they 
do not want. That is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand, Maritz said of Internet software that it was  
``inevitable we would integrate it into the Windows environment.'' 
But he also acknowledged that Nescape's success proved ``an added 
incentive to make as fast as progress as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin warned it would be a ``recipe for disaster'' for courts  
to impose limits on what could be added to Windows, adding that 
``this beneficial process is under attack in this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked  
Maritz how far Microsoft might go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you think of any application that could not be integrated  
into Windows?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't boundaries, your honor,'' Maritz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to question Maritz further today, and the  
judge said he will decide whether the company must turn over a 
controversial e-mail that could undermine one of its defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail from Microsoft software engineer David D'Souza  
analyzed Felten's efforts to strip the company's browser software 
from Windows, which Microsoft contends is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents said the message could be used to identify which  
parts of some shared software code relate to Windows and which 
parts relate to the Internet browser.

<HEADLINE> Anonymous Club at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Meet the men of the Anonymous Open.  
</P>
<P>
	The Australian semifinalists hail from Ecuador, Russia, Sweden  
and Germany, and even in those countries they are not household 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby-faced kid from Ecuador, Nicolas Lapentti, is ranked No.  
91, and the closest he ever came to a Grand Slam trophy is gazing 
at one in the house of his neighbor and hero in Guayaquil, 1990 
French Open champ Andres Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti, 22, plays Thomas Enqvist, a 24-year-old Swedish  
journeyman who will never be confused with Stefan Edberg, Mats 
Wilander or Bjorn Borg. In seven years on the tour, Enqvist lost in 
the first round of majors seven times, the second round five times 
and the third round four times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian is Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the only player with a Grand  
Slam credential -- on the French red clay in 1996 -- and the only 
semifinalist who was seeded, coming in at No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The title, he figures, is his for the taking, though he knows as  
well as anyone that the men's draw and the prestige of the 
championship were diminished the moment Pete Sampras announced he 
was too tired to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt not only the tournament but the fans that Pete Sampras  
was not able to play,'' Kafelnikov said Wednesday night after 
dispatching the last American man, an injured No. 15 Todd Martin, 
6-2, 7-6 (1), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knew that (Sampras) would be the favorite. As soon  
as I found out, I knew it would be the perfect opportunity to win 
the slam. Once the best player in the world is not competing, it 
really opened up the field for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so, it seemed, everybody who showed up had a chance.  
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov will play Tommy Haas, a 20-year-old German who has  
spent half his life in Florida, slugging balls under the tutelage 
of coach Nick Bollettieri. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas was a special project for Bollettieri, who wanted to prove  
he could develop a champion with an all-court game -- not just a 
baseliner like Andre Agassi, Jim Courier or Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	But Haas is hardly of that caliber yet, and in seven previous  
majors has fallen in the first round three times, and the second 
and third rounds twice each. Suddenly, in Australia, he's in the 
semis. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov would appear to have the road clear to a second major  
title. A superstitious fellow, he has not shaved since the 
tournament began, and he makes sure he gets in a round of golf on 
days off ``just to stay away from the tennis center, because 
sometimes it drives you crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov had an easy time against Martin, whose serve was  
restricted by an abdominal muscle strain that he called ``painful 
and inhibiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lost cause from the start for Martin, but he tried his  
best and took the loss lightly and with a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 0-2 in the third set, Martin saw Kafelnikov looking up  
into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``A mobile phone was ringing. I thought he was looking up at the  
statistics (on the scoreboard), at all my backhand errors,'' said 
Martin, who ended with 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said there a guy was wearing sunglasses at night.''  
</P>
<P>
	Then as Martin served at 15-30, he hit what he thought was an  
ace but was called a fault. Martin turned in a praying gesture to 
the umpire, then asked Kafelnikov: ``At two sets to love, would you 
give me that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Second serve,'' said the umpire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather have just had the point,'' Martin joked, though  
Kafelnikov did oblige him by slapping the serve long. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very friendly fellow,'' Martin said. ``I don't feel bad  
about asking him for a call once in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the levity was too much for one spectator.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a comedy show,'' a voice from the crowd called.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not. But the way this tournament has gone for the men,  
it's awfully close.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Have Fun in Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For two hours on Wednesday, the Denver Broncos  
focused intently on football. They found time for some fun, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A traditional calisthenics drill kicked off the practice, led by  
defensive coordinator Greg Robinson and pass-rush specialist John 
Teerlinck. 
</P>
<P>
	The portly Teerlinck got the bigger reaction from the players,  
swiveling his hips in hula-hoop fashion. With the players whooping, 
he put up a finger on each hand and said, ``Scooby dooby doo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Keith Burns was the recipient of some good-natured  
razzing when a light plane flew over practice trailing the message: 
``Broncos Keith Burns at Beachplace today 7-10 p.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players laughed and one yelled, ``You da man.'' In unison,  
defensive linemen responded, ``Hell, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rod Smith, who wears No. 80, wore No. 2 in  
practice. He has worn other single digits in practice this season, 
saying he feels faster wearing single-digit numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Working in helmets and sweats, the Broncos continued to refine  
the game plan that was installed in Denver last week. The practice 
included 30 minutes of special teams work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good practice, real spirited,'' coach Mike Shanahan  
said. ``We got lots of work done, and the concentration level was 
where you're hoping it would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked on isolating the game plan down from last week to  
work on things we know we're going to do in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it was noted that quarterback John Elway looked  
particularly sharp, Shanahan said, ``Everybody was pretty sharp. 
There were no offsides, very few mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Many Asian stock markets surged Wednesday,  
reversing big recent losses, as investors were encouraged by strong 
gains on Wall Street and China's fresh pledge to keep its currency 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the region's biggest market, the gains were moderate.  
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 68.05  
points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 14,450.06. On Tuesday, the 
average had risen 173.20 points, or 1.22 percent, on top of 
Monday's 54.41-point rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, the Kospi index jumped 6.4 percent, or 33.97  
points, to 565.20, snapping a six-day losing streak that had shaved 
15 percent off the index. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 209.83 points,  
or 2.2 percent, to 9,719.66, boosted by falling local interbank 
interest rates. The index had lost a total of 8.6 percent in the 
previous six sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the Straits Times Index jumped 2.8 percent, or  
40.30 points, to close at 1,457.44, as hedge funds bought back 
shares they had previously sold on concerns that Brazil's financial 
crisis would hit the Singapore market. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in Hong Kong and Singapore helped lift Indonesian  
share prices, which got an additional boost from strong rises in 
local cement company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakarta's benchmark JSX Composite Index rose 12.098 points, or 3  
percent, to 410.250, crossing the psychologically important 
400-point level. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, Bangkok's SET index joined the rally, rising 6.48  
points, or 1.7 percent, to 373.25. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, shares across the region had fallen dramatically  
in reaction to Brazil's ongoing troubles and a vague suggestion in 
a state-controlled mainland Chinese paper Sunday that China would 
consider devaluating its currency, the yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Dai Xianglong, the Chinese central bank chief,  
joined Premier Zhu Rongji and a host of other senior officials in 
denying the report. China long has pledged to maintain the yuan's 
value, and Dai said that stance had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar drifted slightly higher against the Japanese yen  
following the Chinese comments. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 113.82 yen, up 0.26 yen from  
its level late Tuesday in Tokyo and unchanged from its late New 
York level overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Prices fell as investors continued to await news  
on a possible exit tax to replace the current one-year freeze on 
repatriation of foreign funds. The benchmark Composite Index closed 
at 605.18 points, down 5.70 points, or 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose slightly, led by index  
heavyweight Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. The key PSE 
Index closed up 11.74 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,994.00. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares rose, lifted by gains in two  
heavyweight stocks, National Australia Bank Ltd. and News Corp. The 
key All Ordinaries index closed at 2851.4, up 23.5 points, or 0.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares rose as concerns on renewed support-buying  
by the government's stock stabilization fund. The Weighted Price 
Index closed 23.23 points, or 0.38 percent, higher at 6,138.87. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Share prices in New Zealand slipped as a fall in  
market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. sparked a 
round of selling. The benchmark NZSE-40 capital index fell 13.72 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,165.58.

	Senate To Hear Lewinsky Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate today voted  
to hear testimony from Monica Lewinsky, White House adviser Sidney 
Blumenthal and presidential friend Vernon Jordan. The Senate 
earlier blocked dismissal of the impeachment case against President 
Clinton. But the margins on the two 56-44 votes were well short of 
the two-thirds that would be needed to oust the president. All 55 
Republicans voted against dismissal and for the witnesses opposed 
by the White House. They were joined by a single Democrat, Russell 
Feingold of Wisconsin.

	Hungry Colombians Loot After Quake  
</P>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Driven by hunger, survivors of a deadly  
earthquake dashed into supermarkets to strip their shelves clean 
today after one of Colombia's worst disasters. The toll from 
Monday's magnitude-6 earthquake in western Colombia reached 878 
dead and more than 3,410 injured, a Red Cross spokeswoman said. 
Rescue teams arrived from Britain and the United States to help 
find survivors and pull bodies from hundreds of downed buildings. 
Armenia's hungry residents broke down the gates of a downtown 
supermarket and stealing rice, cooking oil, flour and rum.

<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Hundreds of Jordanians crowded into a  
hilltop palace to pay respect to their new crown prince today as 
anxiety grew over the health of King Hussein, who has suffered a 
relapse of cancer. The demonstration of support for Prince Abdullah 
underlined Jordanians' hopes that any transition of power will be 
smooth in the kingdom. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
decided to stop in Jordan tomorrow to meet the new crown prince. 
The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., announced today that King 
Hussein, who had returned as a patient, was in ``stable 
condition,'' but had suffered a relapse of lymphatic cancer after 
undergoing six months of chemotherapy.

NATO allies are ready to issue a serious warning to Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to settle with ethnic Albanians in the 
Serbian province, Albright is meeting Friday in London with five 
foreign ministers ``to help implement this strategy,'' her 
spokesman announced. Meanwhile, government troops backed by tanks 
pounded ethnic Albanian strongholds in Kosovo today.

Pope John Paul II urged 100,000 worshippers to spare even those who 
commit ``great evil'' from the death-penalty. The message may have 
had particular relevance in Missouri, where the state Supreme 
Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was to have

in the fourth quarter of 1998 as the world's biggest tobacco 
company absorbed a big charge for settling lawsuits with states 
that demanded reimbursement for treating sick smokers. 
Nevertheless, Philip Morris increased its share of the U.S. 
cigarette market. Philip Morris and three other top tobacco makers 
will be paying $206 billion to the states over 25 years under that 
settlement. They had previously settled with four states for about

surprisingly fast clip, a new study says. Every newborn over that 
time span has had an average of two or three new harmful mutations, 
researchers calculated. Such flaws don't cause disease, though they

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines Soc. Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today his proposal to  
earmark more than 60 percent of the projected budget surplus for 
Social Security would ``actually grow the American economy while 
preparing for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, along with Vice President Al Gore, played host to  
a panel of economists and other experts to discuss ways to ensure 
that both Social Security and Medicare remain solvent well into the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
	He explained his State of the Union address plan to transfer 62  
percent of the projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years, 
more than $2.7 trillion, to Social Security. Once Social Security 
is secure, he said, he wants 15 percent of surpluses to go to 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he did not  
object to the idea of using 62 percent of surpluses for Social 
Security, but he would like to see the rest go back to taxpayers in 
the form of a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president hasn't gone far enough, but he tiptoed out in  
the water,'' Lott said in a Chamber of Commerce speech today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton argued that, just as the nation worked carefully to  
erase its fat budget deficits, it must be cautious in crafting a 
plan to shore up Social Security and Medicare so that it won't 
buckle under the weight of baby-boomer retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current prosperity in this country was created not by rash  
actions in Washington, but by ... getting the deficit down, getting 
into balance, bringing the interest rates down and bringing the 
economy back,'' Clinton said. ``We also should face the challenge 
of the aging of America in the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called preserving Social Security and Medicare ``profoundly  
moral responsibilities,'' and said Clinton was correct to try to 
defuse the political charge around those two programs in order to 
do what is necessary to ensure their survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has transformed what used to be called a third  
rail into a second chance for America's senior citizens,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton released letters from government accountants backing his  
assertion that if his proposals are accepted, Social Security would 
gain more than 20 years of financial health and Medicare more than 
a decade. Social Security would not run short of cash until 2055, 
instead of 2032 as now projected, and Medicare would be able to pay 
its bills until 2020, instead of 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without his proposal to invest some Social Security money  
in the stock market, the accountants said, Social Security's 
viability would be significantly extended -- until 2049. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan that would actually grow the American economy  
while preparing for the future,'' Clinton said. ``From my point of 
view, this is a very good thing for Americans of all ages, without 
regard to their political party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, some Republican lawmakers have charged that Clinton's  
proposal is little more than an accounting gimmick, instead of real 
reform that would help control the two retirement programs' drain 
on national resources in the future.

<HEADLINE> Starr: White House May Have Leaked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In newly unsealed court papers in the Monica  
Lewinsky investigation, Kenneth Starr says the White House and 
defense lawyers -- not the prosecutor's office -- were the prime 
suspects in a flood of leaks to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's court papers focus on the sharing of sensitive  
information between attorneys for key witnesses and the Clinton 
White House starting in the initial stages of the Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attorneys scoffed at the suggestion the White House  
was the source of the leaks, accusing the prosecutor's office of 
``trying to deflect attention from itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the inquiry, Clinton lawyer David Kendall kicked off a  
behind-the-scenes court battle by accusing Starr's office of 
leaking damaging information about the president to the news media. 
The result is an investigation in which an appointee of U.S. 
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson is trying to determine 
whether Starr's office fed grand jury information to reporters in 
24 different news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kendall publicly suggested Feb. 6 that the source for a  
New York Times story was Starr's office, prosecutor Robert Bittman 
responded with a two-page document filed in federal court pointing 
to the White House and the lawyer for presidential secretary Betty 
Currie as the likely sources. Mrs. Currie's lawyer, Lawrence 
Wechsler, says he wasn't the source of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper revealed Clinton's Jan. 18 discussion with Mrs.  
Currie about Ms. Lewinsky, a central piece of the perjury and 
obstruction impeachment charges against Clinton. In the Jan. 18 
discussion and a second conversation a few days later, the 
president made comments to his secretary such as ``Monica came on 
to me, and I never touched her, right?'' and ``We were never really 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bittman's newly unsealed declaration from last February says  
that ``Lawrence H. Wechsler, private counsel to Ms. Currie, told 
me'' he is ``a longtime friend of Charles F.C. Ruff, White House 
counsel'' and that ``Mr. Ruff referred Ms. Currie to Mr. Wechsler 
when she ``consulted with Mr. Ruff about getting an attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bittman said Wechsler ``confirmed to me that the president's  
defense attorneys had been provided the substance of Ms. Currie's 
information in advance of the publication'' of the Times article. 
</P>
<P>
	In the newly unsealed court papers, Starr asserted that ``this  
White House previously has employed a concentrated strategy of 
leaking harmful material to the media at an early stage to reduce 
long-term damage. ... There is a strong prima facie case that the 
president and his agents ... are responsible for many of the 
alleged `leaks.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Starr has this habit of pointing fingers at other people to  
masquerade his own wrongdoing, and this is just another example of 
that sleight of hand,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the newly unsealed court papers, Kendall stated that  
``assuming only for the present that the White House was privy to 
the Currie information in the (New York Times) article, the White 
House had no interest in early disclosure of the information.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Panel Working on Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of a Medicare advisory commission say  
they are working to solidify support for a proposal to make the 
system more like those offered to working people. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea: Change Medicare to help elderly and disabled Americans  
buy health insurance so the government can begin to shift away from 
paying individual medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is where we really need to start making a deal,'' said  
Sen. John Breaux, D-La., chairman of the National Bipartisan 
Commission on the Future of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Most commission members offered general -- if qualified -- support  
for a draft of the proposal that Breaux presented at a meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, sometimes called ``premium support,'' a retiree  
could choose from a menu of health insurance policies and receive a 
Medicare subsidy to help cover the enrollment fee or premium. 
That's similar to the health benefits many companies and the 
federal government offer to workers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, serious concerns were raised about how to guarantee  
adequate benefits and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to know how the senior citizens ... are going to come  
out,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is due to make recommendations to Congress and  
President Clinton on March 1. But first, 11 of its 17 members must 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Without changes, Medicare is expected to run short of cash in  
2008, just as the huge baby boom generation starts to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his State of the Union address, suggested using part  
of the government surpluses expected over the next 15 years to keep 
Medicare solvent to 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	Most on the commission welcomed the idea but agreed additional  
steps would be needed to modernize and bolster Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan being considered, private health insurers would  
compete to enroll senior citizens who would have new Medicare 
subsidies to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare insurance provided directly by the government, as most  
retirees now have, would likely remain as an option. However, 
out-of-pocket costs could rise if that's not as efficient as the 
private plans -- and some commissioners say it should eventually be 
phased out. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Medicare subsidies for retirees would be set annually,  
as a percentage of the average premium price for all the health 
plans offered. Breaux is suggesting that the portion the elderly 
pay be kept near what their Medicare premiums are now -- about 12 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But some commissioners say lawmakers in the future might be  
tempted to shift more costs to the elderly -- so that taxpayers pay 
less per retiree as the number of retirees grows, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at issue: how closely to control the benefits that health  
plans would offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux has advocated requiring broad categories of basic  
benefits but allowing variation on details. A government board 
would make sure all plans met minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Some commissioners say that's a step down, however, from what  
Medicare guarantees now. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, ``you are entitled by law to a very specified package  
of benefits,'' said former Medicare administrator Bruce Vladeck. 
``That is an entitlement this proposal takes away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and commission co-chairman, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif.,  
said they will consult with members between now and their next 
meeting Feb. 9 to find out how to satisfy concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other proposals on the narrowed list of options the  
commission is considering: 
</P>
<P>
	--Gradually raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65.  
</P>
<P>
	--Providing prescription drug coverage, which is not now offered  
by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	--Asking senior citizens with higher incomes to pay a greater  
share of health insurance costs, while exempting the poorest from 
some out-of-pocket fees.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Murder Defendant Takes Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The defendant in one of California's  
longest and costliest murder cases made a surprise appearance on 
the stand Wednesday and blamed the torture killings of 12 people on 
a friend who committed suicide in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ng was granted a last-minute request to reopen his  
defense after prosecutors had made closing arguments and his 
lawyers were about to begin theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, 38, is charged with killing seven men, three women and two  
baby boys in 1984 and 1985. Prosecutors say Ng and his survivalist 
friend Leonard Lake lured victims to a cabin in the Sierra Nevada 
foothills and forced women into sex slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors on Tuesday played a tape Ng and Lake made of Ng  
cutting away a female victim's shirt and bra with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking calmly, in a heavily accented voice, the Hong Kong-born  
Ng supported his lawyers' contention that Lake was solely to blame 
for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng said he depended on Lake for transportation and food and that  
they would stay together at each other's homes. Ng testified that 
many items belonging to victims that were found in his apartment 
were brought there by Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng acknowledged that Lake had showed him pictures of a bunker  
where prosecutors say sex slaves were kept. But Ng said he thought 
the bunker was just part of Lake's survivalist obsession, ``to 
protect him and his valuables from fallout and things like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Lewis Clapp asked whether Lake had ever told  
him about a secret chamber where women were imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he said that was a secret chamber, but that was his  
domain. ... He basically told me that was his privacy area. He 
didn't want me to go inside,'' Ng said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, arrested in Canada in 1985, fought extradition for six  
years. The case has been estimated to have cost taxpayers about $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He could face the death penalty if convicted.

<HEADLINE> DA Explores Saints' Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Jefferson Parish district attorney's  
office hopes to decide by the end of the week if New Orleans Saints 
offensive lineman Keno Hills will be charged in connection with an 
arrest on heroin charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still waiting for the lab reports to confirm the  
substance confiscated is heroin,'' assistant district attorney Bob 
Long said Wednesday. ``We've asked them to take it out of order so 
I hope we'll have it by the end of the week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hills was booked in December with possession with intent to  
distribute seven small packages of heroin after deputies saw Hills 
and another man peering into a pouch containing the drug. If 
convicted on the charges, he could face life in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab test of the substance is the final information needed to  
decide if Hills should be prosecuted on charges of possession and 
possession with intent to distribute and possession of a gun in 
commission of a drug crime, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Field tests indicated the material was heroin. The lab tests  
will definitely confirm or disprove it, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hills, 25, and 27-year-old James Davis of Materiel, were  
arrested in an area known for drug deals. In addition to the 
substance believed to be heroin, a 9 mm pistol equipped with a 
laser was found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saints spokesman said Hills would have no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The arrest occurred less than 48 hours after the Saints had  
completed their 6-10 season with a loss to the Buffalo Bills, a 
game in which Hills, a backup most of the season, had started. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest gave Hills the distinction of facing the most serious  
criminal charge of eight Saints players who have been arrested in 
the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Hills played college football at the University of Southwestern  
Louisiana in Lafayette and was a sixth-round choice of the Saints 
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Court Clears Solstice Celebrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge who said his Celtic pre-Christian  
ancestors considered the winter solstice a sacred celebration 
dismissed charges against solstice revelers arrested for building a 
bonfire and dancing on a beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some occasions and situations where it is  
appropriate for the government to step back and allow special 
things to happen,'' Criminal Court Judge Michael Brennan said in a 
written ruling Tuesday in dismissing trespassing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23 solstice revelers were cited Dec. 21 for dancing around a  
bonfire on a closed Staten Island beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelers, commemorating a pagan holiday that marks the  
shortest day of the year, ran afoul of a city crackdown on 
so-called quality-of-life offenses, the city's term for minor 
infractions that contribute to a lack of urban civility. They were 
issued summons for using a city park after dark. 
</P>
<P>
	The solstice celebration, organized by Brooklyn resident Donna  
Henes, had been held for the previous 24 years without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commemoration of this occasion for religious, historical or  
educational purposes is to be commended, not sanctioned,'' Brennan 
wrote in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine celebrants still face $50 fines because their summonses  
were issued by the city's Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The police and mayor's office referred inquiries to the  
department, whose spokesman said the celebrants had committed 
serious violations of park rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a special event held without notification of the Parks  
Department and with no regard for fire safety regulations,'' said 
Edward Skyler. 
</P>
<P>
	One reveler, Heather Abramson, wrote a song about her arrest,  
including the line: ``We're taking you down, we won't say where. 
You say it's religious; well, we don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she would like to take part in future celebrations,  
though ``I don't think I would want to go if we got arrested every 
year.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules in Silent Movie Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jurors ruled the 74-year-old owner of a  
silent movie theater was killed during a sham robbery masterminded 
by the elderly man's live-in companion. 
</P>
<P>
	James Leslie Vansickle was convicted Tuesday of hiring a hitman  
to shoot Lawrence Austin, the owner of Hollywood's Silent Movie 
Showcase, the nation's only theater devoted solely to silent films. 
</P>
<P>
	Vansickle, 38, had been Austin's live-in companion and was the  
sole beneficiary of his $1 million-plus estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors found Vansickle guilty of hiring Christian Rodriguez, 22,  
to kill Austin. Rodriguez was found guilty last week of murder, and 
both men face the death penalty at sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Vansickle was running the film projector during a showing of the  
movie short ``School Days'' at the time of the killing two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez entered the theater, demanded money from Austin and  
then shot him in the head. Rodriguez also shot a 19-year-old 
concession worker who survived and testified at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said Vansickle gave him a handgun, promising him  
$25,000 to kill Austin and $5,000 to kill the concession worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The theater was closed after Austin's death.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Output Down 6.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan said Thursday its industrial production  
declined 6.9 percent in 1998 -- the first drop in five years and the 
sharpest fall in more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Hit by sagging demand amid the worst recession since World War  
II, industrial production posted its biggest contraction since an 
11 percent plunge in 1975 due to the shock of surging global oil 
prices, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. 
</P>
<P>
	MITI said a drop of 0.4 percent in the final quarter helped push  
down the annual figure. But in a sign of improvement, it also 
reported output in December rose a larger-than-expected 1.3 percent 
compared to the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.1  
percent gain in the seasonally-adjusted monthly production figure. 
The government had projected a 0.3 percent increase from November, 
when output fell 2.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the December rise, MITI left unchanged its overall  
assessment that the situation at Japan's factories and mines 
remains ``stagnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade ministry forecast a 1.0 percent gain in output for  
this month and a 0.9 decline in February.

<HEADLINE> Low-Tech Treatment Best for Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers say heart attack patients fare best in the nation's  
top-rated hospitals because of a surprisingly low-tech treatment -- 
aspirin and beta blockers -- that could be duplicated in small, 
rural hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Several studies have shown the benefits of beta blockers, which  
reduce the heart's work load, and aspirin, which thins blood. 
Although medical groups encourage use of the drugs, many hospitals 
and doctors still aren't routinely giving them to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could save a lot of patients' lives if ... that knowledge  
was fully translated to the bedside,'' said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, 
director of the Yale-New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes 
Research and Evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yale center study, reported in Thursday's New England  
Journal of Medicine, tracked the cases of 149,177 Medicare patients 
hospitalized for heart attacks in 1994 or 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The center looked at 60 hospitals that made U.S. News &AMP; World  
Report's list of the best places for cardiac care from 1995-97. At 
those hospitals, 15.6 percent of the Medicare heart attack patients 
died within 30 days, Yale medical student Jersey Chen concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen also studied the results at 766 hospitals that, like the  
top 60 hospitals, had equipment for high-tech surgery to unclog or 
bypass clogged arteries. At those hospitals, 18.3 percent of the 
heart attack patients died in the first month. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 3,846 hospitals without that equipment, mostly rural or  
community hospitals, the rate was 18.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers stressed they were not endorsing the magazine's  
A-list because it weighs hospitals' reputations too heavily. They 
said their study is about how hospitals can improve care, not where 
heart attack patients should seek it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're having a heart attack, you should go to the closest  
hospital'' because prompt treatment is crucial, Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference among hospitals came not from high-tech  
equipment, but the use of everyday drugs, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top-ranked hospitals, 96.2 percent of patients considered  
prime candidates for the blood-thinning abilities of aspirin were 
given the drug. The rate was 88.6 percent at similarly equipped 
hospitals and 83.4 percent at the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of beta blockers followed a similar pattern. At the  
top-ranked hospitals, 75 percent of patients eligible for beta 
blockers, which slow the heart rate, got them. The rate was 61.8 
percent in the next tier and 58.7 percent at the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Marc Klapholz, a cardiologist at the University of Medicine  
and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, said other 
factors may be that the top hospitals have more specialists or have 
more rigid policies regarding use of aspirin and beta blockers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of the American Heart  
Association, said all hospitals should take heed of the study 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hospitals that have less (patient) volume, less  
technology, they should be able to follow these guidelines,'' he 
said. ``This is simple, cheap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A related study, also in Thursday's Journal, compared the  
quality of care for Medicare patients at teaching hospitals with 
the care at hospitals not affiliated with medical schools. The 
study found that treatment at teaching hospitals was more 
expensive, but the survival rate was higher. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the 60 hospitals on the U.S. News &AMP; World Report  
lists were teaching hospitals.

	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells only had  
a short stay on the Chicago Bulls' roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls waived the two forwards and guard Curtis Staples on  
Wednesday and signed 7-4, 325-pound center Priest Lauderdale. 
Chicago now has 18 players on its roster, which must be pared to 14

<HEADLINE>  Divac Shows Change for Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- His voice rising above the practice  
chatter, Vlade Divac ran up and down the floor, directing and 
encouraging his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac's voice was one of change for the Sacramento Kings.  
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center, signed last week as a free agent to a  
six-year, $62.5 million contract, is part of a wave of newcomers to 
the Kings, who head into the lockout-shortened campaign trying to 
snap their dubious record of 15 straight sub-.500 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of reasons I came here,'' said Divac, who played  
the past two seasons for Charlotte after spending his first six 
with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the contract I wanted and Sacramento is a lot closer to  
my home and my family in Los Angeles. A lot of people told me, 
`Hey, you know, the Sacramento Kings have never been good.' I said, 
`Hey, I'll go there and I'll help make'em good.' 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows it may take some time.  
</P>
<P>
	Of the 19 players in the Kings' training camp, only Corliss  
Williamson was with the team two years ago. He'll fill out the 
front line with Divac and Webber, obtained last summer shortly 
before the lockout was imposed in the trade that sent Mitch 
Richmond to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Divac has already seen some encouraging signs in  
the first few days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you this: this is an unselfish team and that's very  
good,' Divac said. ``I think we do have a chance, just because of 
the short season, to surprise some other teams. With the talent we 
have here now, maybe we can jump on some teams early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the more versatile centers in the league, Divac begins  
the year as one of only five active NBA players with at least 8,000 
career points, 5,000 rebounds, 1,500 blocked shots and 1,000 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a very good all-around player for the center spot.  
You just don't find very many guys like him,'' first-year Kings 
coach Rick Adelman said. ``But what I've really been impressed with 
is his leadership out there. He's very vocal. He really wants the 
team to do well and he's very excited about being here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, Divac missed six weeks of his personal  
workouts after an appendectomy in late October. But he worked his 
way back into shape and even played three weeks for the Red Star 
basketball club in Belgrade before returning to the United States 
earlier this month, when the lockout was settled. The Kings open 
exhibition play Thursday night against Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said it was a stupid thing on the part of players and  
owners,'' Divac said. ``Nobody won, everybody lost and I felt bad 
for the fans.''

<HEADLINE> Family Sues State Over Foster Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The case began nearly 10 years ago when the  
suburban couple who had taken in kids before was asked by the state 
to care for a 15-year-old girl who needed a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is now suing the state, saying the girl's troubled  
past was hidden, and that she lured their 11-year-old boy into bed 
and eventually bore his child. 
</P>
<P>
	Traver Clinton Smith, lawyer for the foster family, said no one  
disputes that the boy fathered the baby, but the family maintains 
the girl forced their son, now 20, to have sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is also worried the state could make him reimburse  
Massachusetts for aid given the mother since the baby girl's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager was placed with the family, then living in  
Duxbury, in 1990, and the seductions allegedly took place that year 
and the next, until the boy's mother found the two children 
embracing in June 1991. Smith said the family then ended its care 
of the girl, but did not learn she was pregnant until after she was 
moved from the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't consensual sex. He didn't even know anything about  
sex,'' the boy's mother told jurors during a trial of the lawsuit 
Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 23, was never charged with a crime. The boy's  
family reportedly has had some contact with her and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The child is now 6 and living with her mother in Revere, just  
north of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Murphy, a Department of Revenue spokeswoman, said the agency  
had not issued an order seeking reimbursement of money paid by the 
state for the care of the child. But she conceded it had moved for 
an order to establish paternity in the case, a preliminary step in 
seeking child support and back payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts have been suspended pending the outcome of the  
civil lawsuit case, said Murphy, who declined to say if the efforts 
would resume after the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The family says in its suit against the Department of Social  
Services and Mentor Inc., a private agency that placed the girl 
with the family, that it was not told the teen was promiscuous and 
had a possible history of sexual abuse on young boys. 
</P>
<P>
	The family said DSS and Mentor knew of the teen's sexual  
history, and it discovered that a previous social worker had 
recommended she be placed only in homes with no young men. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fitzgerald, the Mentor caseworker who placed the teen-ager  
with the family, testified Wednesday that he had told the family 
the girl had a history of ``sexual aggressiveness,'' and that she 
may have been abused herself. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he didn't know she had a history of acting out her  
aggressions on younger boys, an observation that was apparently in 
social workers' files about the girl, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Social Services noted in court documents that  
a social worker at a group home recommended that she be placed in a 
home ``where there are no young males residing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave (the foster mother) the information that she needed --  
that she was sexually aggressive and they needed to supervise 
her,'' Fitzgerald testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The foster parents shook their heads during Fitzgerald's  
testimony, and their 20-year-old son hung his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentor said in court documents any intercourse was ``a result of  
improper supervision by the plaintiffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Mentor learned the foster mother had caught the two  
children embracing, the agency filed a child abuse neglect 
petition, claiming the two had not been properly supervised. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's lawyer, Michael Giunta, suggested the move was a  
ruse to cover the agency's inappropriate foster-care placement.

<HEADLINE>  Outspoken Ex-IRA Member Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The author of an unflinching  
expose of life inside the Irish Republican Army was found dead by a 
roadside Wednesday, the victim of a savage beating that inevitably 
suggested revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The battered body of Eamon Collins was found at dawn near the  
town of Newry, 40 miles south of Belfast. His head was so badly 
damaged that police weren't immediately sure whether he had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the IRA's former intelligence officer in Newry from  
1980 to 1985, had returned to the border town four years ago 
despite making lasting enemies in the outlawed group. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, IRA supporters torched his car. Last year, they knocked  
him over with a car. Two months ago, they torched his new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to be with his family and refused to be intimidated  
out of his home area,'' said Neil Belton of Granta publishers, 
which issued Collins' 1997 book. ``He was almost a recklessly 
courageous individual who seemed to have found some way of publicly 
atoning for what he had done through the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA issued no statement about Collins' death, and the Royal  
Ulster Constabulary declined to say whether it had any firm 
evidence to suggest whether the IRA or an individual was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Protestant politician David Trimble, designated leader of  
Northern Ireland's unformed government, said it appeared Collins 
was killed because he was ``a member of the IRA who gave evidence 
against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Eamon Collins, I'm sure, had many enemies,'' responded Gerry  
Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 45, first offended his IRA associates by privately  
questioning the group's right to kill people, particularly local 
unarmed Protestants who happened to work part-time for the police 
or British army. 
</P>
<P>
	His second offense was to confess his crimes -- and implicate  
other IRA members -- during a police interrogation in 1985. Though 
he retracted his evidence in court, the ``informer'' label made him 
a likely target for eventual IRA execution despite the group's July 
1997 cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Most grievously, he wrote about his change of heart in ``Killing  
Rage,'' a work that infuriated top members of the IRA and Sinn 
Fein, who are alternately praised and ridiculed in the book. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of Collins' body came hours before lawmakers in  
London began debate on a motion demanding the Labor government halt 
the release of terrorist prisoners under terms of last April's 
peace accord, because of the rising number of shootings and 
beatings. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Mackay, the Northern Ireland spokesman for the opposition  
Conservative Party, held up a copy of Collins' book in the House of 
Commons as he began his argument that the IRA and outlawed 
pro-British groups must be punished for violating their 
cease-fires. The motion failed 343-141. 
</P>
<P>
	By eliminating Collins, whoever was responsible silenced someone  
who learned to defy the tribal instincts that underpin Catholic 
support for the IRA and Protestant support for Northern Ireland's 
union with Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Killing Rage,'' he dismissed as ``an almost meaningless  
abstraction'' the IRA's stated goal of uniting Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The violence has isolated us from the people with whom we have  
most in common -- northern Protestants -- and deepened the gulf 
between us and our southern neighbors,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounted his growing sense of disgust that the IRA, which he  
had joined in hopes of sparking working-class revolution, was 
concentrating instead on killing unarmed Protestants and in turn 
provoking Protestant retaliation against innocent Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	He characterized some of his IRA colleagues as ``brave,'' others  
as ``scum of the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have blackened the IRA's name, I have done so with the  
heat of truth,'' he wrote, condemning his own past mindset as 
``fanatical, full of anger and contempt, and ready to connive at 
the deaths of enemies when they are unarmed and vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins admitted he gathered the information used to kill more  
than a dozen people, and wrote about plotting to murder an off-duty 
Protestant soldier in the Newry hospital's maternity ward, where 
both men were visiting their wives and newborn children. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin McGartland, an IRA informer who now lives in England  
under a false identity, was quoted Wednesday as saying ``there's no 
way anybody can tell me this murder has got nothing to do with the 
IRA. ... The IRA murdered this man plain and simple.''

<HEADLINE>  Remembering the Night Miami Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Everyone told Dick Anderson how well things were  
going when he headed the Super Bowl host committee 10 years ago, 
planning all the parties that accompany the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I saw what was happening on television,'' the ex-Pro Bowl  
defensive back said, ``and I almost broke into tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Anderson saw in Miami were fires burning in the Overtown  
and Liberty City neighborhoods, set by rioters angry that a 
Hispanic police officer fatally shot an unarmed black motorcyclist 
who was speeding. A passenger on the motorcycle died when the 
driver crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, the festive mood of the Super Bowl evaporated. And  
Anderson knew the three days of riots would endanger what he had 
worked so hard to create. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought people would become apprehensive,'' he said. ``Super  
Bowl crowds usually come in on Thursday for the weekend. If you're 
sitting at home on Monday or Tuesday and there are riots in the 
city you're going to visit, you become concerned. Anytime there's a 
disturbance, whether it's Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago or Miami, 
people are going to think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those thinking about it were the Cincinnati Bengals and  
San Francisco 49ers, who hardly needed the disruption before the 
biggest game of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Wilcots was a reserve defensive back for the Bengals,  
who lost the game 20-16, and uttered one of the most memorable 
quotes about the riots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out to watch a movie, `Mississippi Burning,''' he said,  
``and when I came out of the movie, Miami was burning. This was 
1989. You don't think you're going to have riots in urban areas. We 
were 30 years removed from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Munoz, Cincinnati's Hall of Fame offensive lineman,  
could see the smoke from his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember looking out my window and staring at it,'' he said.  
``I saw this fire and I was thinking, `What's going on?' Here I am 
in my second Super Bowl. The first one, in Detroit, it was too cold 
to go outside. And now this. I couldn't go outside again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals were concerned because wide receiver Eddie Brown, a  
Miami native, was believed to be visiting friends in the troubled 
area. The team called the police to go in after him, but Brown had 
left before the trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed in the racial violence, 11 were wounded by  
gunfire and nearly 400 were arrested. Thirteen buildings were 
torched and others looted, causing about $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer William Lozano was convicted of manslaughter but won a  
new trial and was acquitted in 1993. He was later fired, but a 
federal arbitrator ordered the city to reinstate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems the riots caused for Overtown residents and  
the city, Anderson thought Miami came through the crisis very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd have been better off if it hadn't happened,'' he said.  
``But every Super Bowl activity the committee planned went off 
extremely well, without a hitch. We got another Super Bowl in 1995 
and a second one this year. So the people who make the choices 
weren't affected by the riot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, perhaps they were.  
</P>
<P>
	Under commissioner Paul Tagliabue, the NFL began a community  
outreach program, sponsoring Youth Education Towns in the last six 
Super Bowl cities. One center opened in Liberty City in 1995 and 
ground was broken Wednesday for another in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul felt we had to pay more attention to the cities in which  
we play Super Bowls and leave more of a legacy than we did in the 
early years,'' NFL vice president Joe Browne said. ``The YET 
centers are a bricks-and-mortar legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the league is sponsoring construction of 10 Habitat  
for Humanity homes that will provide housing for low-income 
families in the Little Haiti area. The NFL has also funded projects 
in Carol City, next to Pro Player Stadium, and a scholarship 
program for southern Florida minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the riots left scars.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray Buck, then a reporter with the Houston Post, had decided to  
spend the evening at a dog track with his wife, Mary. They had the 
misfortune of making a wrong turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were eight guys on the street and they had stopped the  
car in front of us,'' he said. ``My wife was driving and I said, 
`Be careful. It looks like a drug deal.' Then they started throwing 
stuff. A brick or a rock broke the windshield and glass got on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife sped away. We couldn't get out of there fast enough.  
Finally, we got back to the hotel and stayed in the room all 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now relocated in southern Florida with CBS SportsLine, Buck  
occasionally covers basketball games in the Miami Arena, on the 
fringe of the Overtown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still get paranoid going to Heat games,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Quirks Plague House Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott cast a  
sheepish look toward Chief Justice William Rehnquist as the Senate 
got snarled yet again in one of the parliamentary tangles to which 
it is so accustomed -- but which can bewilder the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice,'' the Mississippi Republican sighed.  
``Welcome to the operations of the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That caused a bump in the impeachment-trial road: Lott thought  
he'd obtained unanimous consent to move ahead, but suddenly an 
objection from the Democratic side brought things to a grinding, if 
temporary, halt. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trial of President Clinton now midway through its third  
week, the Senate rules -- and sometimes lack thereof -- and its 
clubbish atmosphere have become a constant source of bafflement and 
frustration to the House prosecutors as they attempt to make their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Rehnquist -- always so sure and precise in presiding over  
the court -- has at times seemed a little uncertain about how to 
deal with those unpredictable senators. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Lott told Rehnquist he wanted to erase several  
already granted requests because Minority Leader Tom Daschle, 
D-S.D., hadn't had a chance to weigh in on them. ``So I'm going to 
assume that that was all null and void, we're going to start over 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist: ``The request -- what?''  
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings have lurched forward and stopped abruptly, have  
gone in and out of secret sessions, have been interrupted by 
lengthy quorum calls. Senators have been forced to ask questions in 
writing, barred ``on pain of imprisonment'' from speaking out; but 
they have talked freely in scores of impromptu news conferences 
just off the Senate floor and on television news shows. 
</P>
<P>
	And while nearly all 100 senators have paid serious attention to  
the proceedings, there does not seem to be much appetite for 
dragging out the process much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions by White House counsel David Kendall on Tuesday that  
the calling of witnesses could drag out the case drew howls of 
protest from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Few have expressed as much pique with the process as House  
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``These proceedings are archaic in many ways,'' Hyde told the  
Senate. ``The question period was something out of Old Bailey, I 
guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presiding officer and legal teams don't wear wigs in the  
Senate as they do in the Old Bailey criminal court in London. But 
many of the customs and rules date from the 19th century and 
earlier and may seem equally arcane. 
</P>
<P>
	One need remember two things about the Senate, Lott recently  
tutored reporters during a break: When the going gets complicated, 
the Senate often falls back on its ancient rules and customs; but 
the Senate can change those rules at the drop of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll clarify as we go along,'' he said at one point.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are not many places in the world where you can do  
business with a handshake, but you can still do this in the United 
States Senate,'' former President Bush told senators last week 
during a lecture-series appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, such handshake improvisation almost always requires  
unanimous consent. In fact, much of the day-to-day functioning of 
the Senate relies on unanimous bipartisan consensus. A 
strategically placed objection by a single senator can bring things 
to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, by contrast, legislation is debated for a  
specified time and a Rules Committee sets terms of that debate, 
including what nature of amendments or motions might be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a format that is not particularly helpful to the trial  
managers,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of those 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly three weeks of presiding, Rehnquist seems to be  
getting more comfortable with the relatively unstructured process. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., brother of Asa Hutchinson,  
rose on Tuesday to object to White House lawyer Kendall's 
``continual reference to comments made on television programs 
outside the record,'' Rehnquist was quick to issue a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This on a motion to call additional witnesses and the argument  
has been very freeform and kind of far-ranging,'' he said. ``I 
think this is permissible comment and so I overrule the 
objection.''

<HEADLINE> Crude, Products Rise on Inventories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures advanced Wednesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after inventory data revealed an unexpected decline in 
heating oil stockpiles last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures fell sharply, as did pork  
futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude was pulled along after both the Department of Energy and  
the American Petroleum Institute reported unleaded gasoline and 
heating oil inventories declined, despite expected increases due to 
unseasonable weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline inventories fell 2.43 million barrels, or 1.1  
percent, to 221.94 million barrels, according to the API. Analysts 
had expected a rise of between 500,000 and 1.1 million barrels. The 
decline nearly halved the year-over-year gasoline surplus, to 4.4 
million barrels from 8.2 million last week. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. distillate supplies, which include heating oil, fell 2.4  
million barrels, or 1.6 percent, to 150.5 million barrels, the API 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts noted much of the declines came as refinery output fell  
sharply in the past week, to 92 percent of capacity as low crude 
prices bring in low profit margins. The inventory declines boosted 
hopes an inventory surplus that has lingered for the better part of 
a year might finally be easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose 26 cents to $12.32 a  
barrel; the active March heating oil contract rose .72 cent to 
32.52 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline rose 1.22 cents to 
36.66 cents a gallon; March natural gas rose 9.6 cents to $1.810 
for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures gave back their gains from a day earlier and more  
on the Board of Trade of the City of New York amid reports of heavy 
producer selling. Coffee and sugar prices in particular have been 
pressured in recent weeks by the sharp decline in the value of the 
Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials devalued the real in an attempt to stem  
investor flight from the nation and add stability to weak 
underlying economic markets, but Brazil's troubles have yet to show 
signs of recovery. The South America nation is the largest grower 
of coffee and vies with Russia as the largest grower of sugar, 
making its decline a significant factor in the commodities market. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been concerned that Brazilian producers will  
become heavy sellers of their products on the export market since 
the devalued real would allow them to receive higher local currency 
prices. Most commodities are priced in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices also retreated amid eased concern about earthquake  
damage in Colombia, the world's largest grower of the quality 
arabica beans favored by American consumers. Analysts say much of 
Colombia's crop already should have been picked and sent to port 
for export. 
</P>
<P>
	March gourmet arabica coffee fell 3.05 cents to $1.038 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures slumped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid  
concern that consumer demand is slipping at a time when there will 
be more slaughter-ready hogs. Asking prices for pork have been 
slipping on the cash market, a sign that slaughterhouse demand also 
is slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	That could force producers to continue feeding their animals,  
adding to already high tonnage levels. 
</P>
<P>
	February lean hogs fell the limit 2 cents to 40.80 cents a  
pound, while February pork bellies tumbled 1.23 cents to 54.12 
cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> US, Aussie Artists Matched in Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like Americans, Australian painters ventured  
out from their east coast nearly 200 years ago into a little known 
continent. Now Washington's oldest art museum has helped put 
together the first major show in the United States of what they 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit portrays how Europeans first saw the mountains,  
forests, deserts, settlements and native peoples of both 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corcoran Gallery of Art showcased the exhibit Tuesday on  
Australia Day, the anniversary of the first British colony at Fort 
Jackson, now the city of Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, ``New Worlds from Old,'' emphasizes the differences  
and similarities between artists half a world away and largely 
unknown to one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were defining our national mission as God's chosen people,  
destined to succeed as we coursed across our vast land and laid 
claim to it,'' said chief curator Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Australia that kind of grand myth was not in place. The  
convicts were settled by their British military officers, hugging 
the coastline around Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kornhauser is curator at the Wadsworth Athenaeum in  
Hartford, Conn., where the exhibit was shown before it came to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizers matched many similar scenes.  
</P>
<P>
	There's Frederic Church's 1857 painting of Niagara Falls,  
admired by Britain's classic art theorist John Ruskin, and called 
by a critic of its time ``perhaps the finest picture yet done by an 
American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not far away hangs J.H. Carse's 1873 view of Weatherboard Falls  
-- now known as Wentworth Falls, a tourist attraction within easy 
commuting distance of Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Sabine, director of the Tasmanian Museum and Art  
Gallery at Hobart, said that although Australian and American 
landscapes of the period may look alike, expert Australians can 
usually spot the difference by the trees and foliage. 
</P>
<P>
	Eucalyptus is native to Australia.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Tasmania there's a special variety that often has a twisted  
trunk,'' Sabine said, pointing to one work from her own island. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciduous trees, those with leaves that fall in winter, are  
mostly imported varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	Tasmania, roughly the size of Ireland, lies off Australia's  
southeast corner. Its museum owns many of Australia's best 
paintings and lent some to the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	------------	 
</P>
<P>
	``New Worlds from Old: 19th-Century Australian and American  
Landscapes,'' opens to the public Wednesday and will be there 
through April 19.

<HEADLINE> Ovitz in Hollywood Tug of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A top Hollywood talent agency is warning  
celebrities -- including Robin Williams and Marisa Tomei -- that it 
won't work with them if they remain with a new management company 
founded by the agency's one-time chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Creative Artists Agency has told clients it will refuse  
services, for which it takes a hefty percentage of a star's pay, if 
the actors remain with the Artists Management Group -- created by 
former superagent and ex-CAA chief, Michael Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having met with Ovitz on several occasions over the past  
several months to discuss the nature of our collaboration, he 
agreed not to raid our agents or clients, and he has violated his 
word,'' said Richard Lovett, CAA president and partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The message went to those jointly represented by CAA and Ovitz's  
new firm, including directors Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese. 
Among CAA's other big-name clients are Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise and 
Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz was unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The feud between CAA and Ovitz's company erupted after Ovitz  
last week hired away leading CAA agent Michael Menchel. Menchel's 
clients include box-office superstar Robin Williams (``Patch 
Adams,'' ``Good Will Hunting''), who left CAA with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is clearly acting as a competitor and cannot collaborate,  
and we're not going to share any clients with him,'' Lovett said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Hollywood veteran said CAA's action was understandable.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think CAA management made the only decision they could under  
the circumstances,'' said Roland Perkins, an original member of the 
William Morris Agency and CAA, and now head of Double Eagle 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	CAA contends that Ovitz's firm is acting less like a manager and  
more like an unlicensed agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents, who get jobs and negotiate deals for clients for a  
maximum 10 percent commission, are licensed by the state and 
regulated by industry guilds. 
</P>
<P>
	Such compensation limits do not apply to managers, although they  
are legally barred from seeking work for clients. Instead, their 
role has been to offer career guidance, with agents handling 
contract negotiations. Increasingly, though, managers are using 
lawyers to handle contract talks while they orchestrate the overall 
deal, legally circumventing agents altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz is used to controversy. At CAA, he was a leading  
practitioner of packaging, in which an agency delivers the 
principal creative and acting talent for a movie or TV project as a 
client block. 
</P>
<P>
	These all-or-nothing deals can include A-list clientele along  
with the agency's less-stellar talent. Some producers liken the 
practice to extortion.

<HEADLINE> Schedule for Next Mir Crew Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian space officials have set Feb. 20 as the  
date for the next crew to travel to the Mir space station, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian cosmonaut Viktor Afanasyev, French astronaut Jean-Pierre  
Heignere and Slovak Ivan Bella will blast off to the Mir atop a 
Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet 
republic of Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	They will reach the Mir in two days, and after a week-long stint  
on the orbiting station, Bella will return to Earth with the Mir's 
current commander, Gennady Padalka. 
</P>
<P>
	Padalka's crewmate Sergei Avdeyev will stay aboard with  
Afanasyev and Heignere through August, said Valery Ryumin, deputy 
chief of the state-controlled RKK Energia company that operates the 
Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	Avdeyev and Heignere had originally been scheduled to return in  
June, when the Mir was to be abandoned. But their mission was 
extended after Russia decided to keep the Mir in orbit for an extra 
three years, Ryumin said, according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	At American urging, Russia had earlier agreed to decommission  
the Mir and concentrate its meager resources on the international 
space station, which has already suffered delays because of 
Russia's financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov ordered that Mir stay in  
orbit through 2002 -- but only if private investors pay all its 
expenses, estimated at $250 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Energia said last fall that a backer had been found, but  
ITAR-Tass reported Wednesday that funding was not yet guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Grand Ole Opry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Grand Ole Opry is getting creaky  
with age. 
</P>
<P>
	America's longest continuously running radio program has changed  
little in 73 years, and with attendance down, it's time for a 
reality check. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, the show might consider moving from the suburbs  
back to its original home, the historic Ryman Auditorium in 
downtown Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	It also should be televised in its entirety on The Nashville  
Network. And how about finding new talent outside normal channels, 
or at least making sure the biggest stars do more than a cameo each 
year? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that unfortunately the tendency out there is for  
everybody to embrace it when they need it,'' said Vince Gill, one 
of the few big stars who performs often on the show. ``As soon as 
everybody's records stop flying up the charts, and nobody wants to 
give them a zillion dollars to (perform), then they'll go do the 
Opry ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't always that way. For many years, the Opry was THE  
place for a country artist to be. Before videos and country-pop 
crossover artists came along, the Opry could single-handedly fuel 
record sales and up the earning power of its stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That is now a thing of the past. The Opry needs big stars like  
Gill more than he needs it. And Grand Ole Opry cast members like 
Clint Black and Garth Brooks rarely perform there, sometimes not 
even meeting their obligation to show up four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception in November 1925, the show has been  
broadcast every weekend on Nashville's 50,000-watt WSM-AM. 
</P>
<P>
	The Opry is where Porter Wagoner still struts in rhinestones,  
where the great Connie Smith belts out tunes, and where the Melvin 
Sloan Dancers square dance. 
</P>
<P>
	It's deliberately unsophisticated, using a barn as a stage  
backdrop. One of the sponsors is a drink called ``Jogging in a 
Jug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fun tradition that connects us to our parents and  
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	It's worth preserving.  
</P>
<P>
	But change is needed.  
</P>
<P>
	Grand Ole Opry stalwarts like Minnie Pearl and Roy Acuff have  
died. Cast members who appear regularly, like Wagoner and Little 
Jimmy Dickens, are aging. 
</P>
<P>
	To thrive rather than just survive, the Opry should take some  
chances. Here are four suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
	1. Move back downtown to the Ryman Auditorium, at least  
part-time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4,400-seat Grand Ole Opry House, home of the Opry since  
1974, is set in suburban north Nashville. That made sense as long 
as downtown, and the Ryman, were in decay. But downtown has been 
revitalized and the intimate 2,100-seat Ryman reopened in 1994 
after renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Opry's well-received return visit to the Ryman on Jan. 15-16  
-- its first show there in 25 years -- underscored the point: The 
Opry would benefit from being back in the hustle-bustle of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such drawbacks as a shortage of dressing rooms and  
parking spaces, the idea should be considered, said singer Lorrie 
Morgan, whose late father, George Morgan, was an Opry star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be all for it,'' Morgan said. ``But I just know that my  
dad and some of the other members ... were so happy about the new 
Opry House. They were so proud that finally we were recognized as 
an industry and we got a great building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say switch back and forth -- six months do it here, next six  
months do it there, and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	2. Televise one of the two Saturday night shows in its entirety  
on TNN. 
</P>
<P>
	TNN airs only an hour from the Saturday night show. Carrying the  
whole show would give artists more exposure, increasing the Opry's 
booking clout. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the Grand Ole Opry and TNN no longer are owned by the same  
company (the Opry is owned by Gaylord Entertainment, which sold TNN 
to CBS). But TNN is supposed to be the cable channel of record for 
country music fans, and the Opry should be their can't-miss show. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Mix it up musically.  
</P>
<P>
	Wouldn't it be great if the Grand Ole Opry became a musical  
leader again? 
</P>
<P>
	It could happen by tapping the talent that's always bubbling  
under the country music mainstream. Buddy and Julie Miller, Iris 
DeMent, R.B. Morris, Gillian Welch and Don Walser are all talents 
worthy of the Opry. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, why not seek out non-country artists who come through  
town? A Bob Dylan or Yo-Yo Ma may very well appreciate the history 
of the show enough to want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Require country stars to do their bit.  
</P>
<P>
	In the old days, the Opry had the muscle to insist its cast  
members appear 26 weekends a year. Now it's down to four and some 
don't do even that. So why not part ways with singers who rarely 
perform, so spots open for those who want in? 
</P>
<P>
	``Our audience attendance is way down,'' said Morgan, a cast  
member since 1984. ``I don't know how to get it back but I do know 
it's going to take an effort on a lot of people's parts and it's 
hard to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard when you're out promoting a record to say `No, I  
can't go make $40,000 this week, I need to ... do the Opry.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But you got to do it.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in country music...  
</P>
<P>
	SALES: ``Garth Brooks Double Live'' has sold an amazing 12  
million copies, according to the Recording Industry Association of 
America. The RIAA also says ``Wide Open Spaces'' by the Dixie 
Chicks has sold 3 million and Alabama sold 2 million of its 
greatest hits compilation ``For the Record.''

<HEADLINE>  200-CD Piano Series Is Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the world hurtling toward mega-everything,  
even the once reserved arena of classical music is pulling out all 
its stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips Music Group has produced the largest recording project  
in the history of the industry: a 200-compact disc collection of 
the finest pianists of this century, playing at their best. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips is presenting the piano series to the Guinness Book as a  
new record, beating the company's issue of 180 CDs of all Mozart 
ever wrote, as registered in the 1998 edition of Guinness. 
</P>
<P>
	But quantity was not a factor in how the works were chosen by  
Philips' director of repertoire, Tom Deacon, for ``Great Pianists 
of the 20th Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to include recordings that changed how we thought  
about the music each pianist was playing,'' said Deacon in an 
interview from Amsterdam, where he's based. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Vladimir Horowitz recorded Tchaikovsky's Piano  
Concerto No. 1 in the 1940s with conductor Arturo Toscanini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horowitz played it hell-bent for leather, with tremendous  
gusto,'' said Deacon. ``For a whole generation, his version, his 
reading, changed the way in which people thought about that piece 
of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then along came Van Cliburn, winning the Tchaikovsky competition  
in Moscow in 1958 and recording the concerto at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``His performance was more winsome, graceful, gentle,'' said  
Deacon. ``That interpretation changed the way another generation 
thought about this piece of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in our time, Argentinian Martha Argerich put her stamp on  
the same piece, ``lighter, faster, more like Horowitz,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74 artists in the series range from Ignace Paderewski, the  
19th-century Polish virtuoso who died in 1941, to New York resident 
Evgeny Kissin, born in Russia in 1971. They are the oldest and 
youngest in the series. In between are Spaniard Alicia De Larrocha 
and British Dame Myra Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with household names like Horowitz and Artur Rubinstein,  
the series presents electrifying performances by less popular, but 
equally brilliant, pianists like Romanian-born Dinu Lipatti, 
Italian native Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and German-born Artur 
Schnabel. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting last October and continuing for a year, the work of 10  
pianists is being released each month, with one to three CDs for 
each artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Rave reviews have greeted the collection. For London's  
Independent, it's ``piano heaven.'' Newsweek called it 
``monumental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collection was presented recently across from Carnegie Hall  
under the domed frescoes of Steinway Hall, the showcase 
headquarters for pianos used by most of the featured artists. (An 
exception is Earl Wild, who apologized for being ``the infidel''; 
he plays his virtuoso transcriptions and showpieces on a Baldwin.) 
</P>
<P>
	No matter the instrument's name, the real keys to a century of  
musical fireworks lie in the hands and hearts of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	And in this lineup, one hears ``playing with long-ago rubatos or  
up-to-date precision, according to the era,'' says composer Ned 
Rorem. His Sonata No. 2 is played by New Jersey native Julius 
Katchen. The pianist had made the first piano LP record, of Brahms' 
Opus 5 Sonata in F minor, heard again on the new CD. 
</P>
<P>
	With Katchen at the keyboard, the Brahms ``is hurled at the  
listener, one of the most exciting performances of music,'' says 
Deacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rorem's 3 Barcarolles are performed by Leon Fleisher, who now

Paganini, as well as Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand.

piano experts.

that some of these points of view will clash heads and maybe result

especially from one featured pianist, Alfred Brendel, who dipped 
into old recordings of Alfred Cortot, Edwin Fischer and Wilhelm

though there are some wrong notes.

notes of many of my colleagues,'' the Austrian-born pianist said

<HEADLINE>  200-CD Piano Series Is Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the world hurtling toward mega-everything,  
even the once reserved arena of classical music is pulling out all 
its stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips Music Group has produced the largest recording project  
in the history of the industry: a 200-compact disc collection of 
the finest pianists of this century, playing at their best. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips is presenting the piano series to the Guinness Book as a  
new record, beating the company's issue of 180 CDs of all Mozart 
ever wrote, as registered in the 1998 edition of Guinness. 
</P>
<P>
	But quantity was not a factor in how the works were chosen by  
Philips' director of repertoire, Tom Deacon, for ``Great Pianists 
of the 20th Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to include recordings that changed how we thought  
about the music each pianist was playing,'' said Deacon in an 
interview from Amsterdam, where he's based. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Vladimir Horowitz recorded Tchaikovsky's Piano  
Concerto No. 1 in the 1940s with conductor Arturo Toscanini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horowitz played it hell-bent for leather, with tremendous  
gusto,'' said Deacon. ``For a whole generation, his version, his 
reading, changed the way in which people thought about that piece 
of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then along came Van Cliburn, winning the Tchaikovsky competition  
in Moscow in 1958 and recording the concerto at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``His performance was more winsome, graceful, gentle,'' said  
Deacon. ``That interpretation changed the way another generation 
thought about this piece of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in our time, Argentinian Martha Argerich put her stamp on  
the same piece, ``lighter, faster, more like Horowitz,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74 artists in the series range from Ignace Paderewski, the  
19th-century Polish virtuoso who died in 1941, to New York resident 
Evgeny Kissin, born in Russia in 1971. They are the oldest and 
youngest in the series. In between are Spaniard Alicia De Larrocha 
and British Dame Myra Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with household names like Horowitz and Artur Rubinstein,  
the series presents electrifying performances by less popular, but 
equally brilliant, pianists like Romanian-born Dinu Lipatti, 
Italian native Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and German-born Artur 
Schnabel. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting last October and continuing for a year, the work of 10  
pianists is being released each month, with one to three CDs for 
each artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Rave reviews have greeted the collection. For London's  
Independent, it's ``piano heaven.'' Newsweek called it 
``monumental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collection was presented recently across from Carnegie Hall  
under the domed frescoes of Steinway Hall, the showcase 
headquarters for pianos used by most of the featured artists. (An 
exception is Earl Wild, who apologized for being ``the infidel''; 
he plays his virtuoso transcriptions and showpieces on a Baldwin.) 
</P>
<P>
	No matter the instrument's name, the real keys to a century of  
musical fireworks lie in the hands and hearts of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	And in this lineup, one hears ``playing with long-ago rubatos or  
up-to-date precision, according to the era,'' says composer Ned 
Rorem. His Sonata No. 2 is played by New Jersey native Julius 
Katchen. The pianist had made the first piano LP record, of Brahms' 
Opus 5 Sonata in F minor, heard again on the new CD. 
</P>
<P>
	With Katchen at the keyboard, the Brahms ``is hurled at the  
listener, one of the most exciting performances of music,'' says 
Deacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rorem's 3 Barcarolles are performed by Leon Fleisher, who now  
specializes in left-hand repertoire after an incurable neuritis 
robbed him of the pianistic use of his right hand. Once considered 
an American heir to his mentor, Schnabel, Fleisher is heard here in 
two-hand classics, including Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of 
Paganini, as well as Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand. 
</P>
<P>
	As with all lists so popular today, one might argue with the  
choice of artists, compiled by a panel of a dozen pianists and 
piano experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hooray for points of view!'' said Fleisher. ``Let's just hope  
that some of these points of view will clash heads and maybe result 
in other new lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deacon made the final selection of repertoire. He got help  
especially from one featured pianist, Alfred Brendel, who dipped 
into old recordings of Alfred Cortot, Edwin Fischer and Wilhelm 
Kempff.

<HEADLINE> $240M in Cocaine Seized in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOTOWA, N.J. (AP) -- A 2,500-pound shipment of pure cocaine with  
a street value of $240 million was seized from boxes of frozen 
cauliflower, state police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven men arrested this week in New Jersey, New York and Texas  
remained in custody, said Col. Carl A. Williams, state police 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Law officers got information on Jan. 19 that a Texas man would  
be receiving a large shipment of cocaine and began 24-hour 
surveillance of him as he traveled between New Jersey and New York, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe the cocaine is from Colombia but would not  
speculate on the producing cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	The cauliflower was in a shipment of other frozen vegetables  
that was brought from a warehouse in Hidalgo, Texas, to Secaucus by 
an independent trucker who was not aware of what was in his cargo, 
Williams said.

	SEC Warns on Internet Trading  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare public statement to individual  
investors, the government's top securities regulator warned people 
to use as much caution trading over the Internet as when going 
through a broker. The remarks today by Arthur Levitt, chairman of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, came amid regulators' 
concern over the recent wild swings of the Nasdaq Stock Market, 
especially among the hot Internet stocks. People trading online 
should ``remember the investment basics, and not allow the ease and 
speed with which they can trade to lull them either into a false 
sense of security or encourage them to trade too quickly or too 
often,'' he said. An estimated 5 million amateur investors now do 
at least occasional trading over the Internet.

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Venezuelan government sued the leading U.S.  
tobacco companies today in the hopes of recovering the public 
health-care costs of treating sick smokers. The suit seeks billions 
of dollars in damages, said attorney Steven Marks, who is 
representing Venezuela in the claim. He said the lawyers have hired 
economists to help calculate the damages. Venezuela claims it 
suffered economic losses because of decreased productivity of its 
labor force, lost taxes and lost gross national product.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos.'s profit skidded 79 percent  
in the fourth quarter of 1998 as the world's biggest tobacco 
company absorbed a big charge for settling lawsuits with states 
that demanded reimbursement for treating sick smokers. The company 
behind Marlboro cigarettes, Kraft foods and Miller beer earned $274 
million, or 11 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, 
down from $1.3 billion, or 53 cents a share a year earlier. Philip 
Morris stock was down 1 13/16 today to 46 7/16.

	Quake Shouldn't Hurt Coffee Production

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The deadly earthquake that shook western  
Colombia this week probably will not take much of a toll on its 
coffee production, even though half the country's coffee growing 
land was affected, a coffee official said today. ``The risk is that 
the coffee not be of a quality that distinguishes Colombia,'' said 
Mario Gomez Estrada, a member of the National Committee of Coffee 
Growers. Colombia is the world's second largest coffee exporter, 
behind Brazil, and accounts for 14 percent of world coffee exports. 
Nearly half of the 2.2 million acres dedicated to coffee in 
Colombia are located in the five states hit by Monday's magnitude 6 
quake.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc.'s stock surged more than 20  
percent in early trading today on news that the Internet giant's 
fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. A 
rise in online holiday shopping lifted sales to $252.89 million in 
the fourth quarter, up from $66.04 million a year ago. Excluding 
the charges, Amazon.com lost $22.18 million, or 14 cents a share, 
in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected 
its operating losses to be 18 cents a share. Amazon.com's shares 
were up 10 17/32 to 125 5/8.

	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Slumping sales and restructuring costs

percent, the company reported today. The international manufacturer 
of cookies, snacks and other grocery products said earnings for the 
October-December quarter fell to $19 million, or 7 cents per share, 
from $146 million, or 54 cents a share, in the same period a year 
earlier. Without any extraordinary charges, net income was 50 
cents, beating a First Call Corp. estimate of 49 cents a share. 
Nabisco stock was up 1 7/16 to 39 7/8.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp., the East Coast regional  
phone giant, recorded a 13 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits 
on growing demand for high-speed data and mobile-phone services. 
The results matched Wall Street's expectations. Bell Atlantic 
reported today it earned $1.06 billion, or 65 cents per share, in 
the October-December quarter, up from $940 million, or 60 cents per 
share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to 
$8.08 billion from $7.70 billion. Bell Atlantic stock was up 3/16

	U.S. Encourages IMF Modernization  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund has to change  
the way it operates to keep pace with an increasingly globalized 
economy, a senior Clinton administration official told a Senate 
panel today. But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers also 
said the financial turmoil that swept Asia, Russia and Brazil in 
the past 18 months would have been much worse without the IMF. The 
IMF must be more accountable in its use of public funds, provide 
aid at market-based rates and get the private sector more involved 
in burden sharing, Summers said.

labeled some sports memorabilia as ``one-of-a-kind,'' a source 
said. eBay reported it earned $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 
1998, sharply above the $189,000 of a year earlier. For the 
quarter, revenue came to $19.5 million, more than seven times the 
$2.6 million of a year earlier. For all of 1998, the company earned 
$2.4 million on revenue of $47.4 million, against $874,000 in 
earnings on revenue of $5.7 million in 1997. Shares of eBay were up 
82 5/8 today to 303 1/2.

computers, said it earned a record $758 million, or 43 cents a 
share, compared to $667 million, or 42 cents a share, in last

	Disney Earnings Fall 18 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co.'s earnings fell 18  
percent during the company's first quarter, reflecting slow home 
video sales and the impact of higher costs in its broadcasting and 
movie businesses. Disney reported today it earned $622 million, or 
30 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, including a 
one-time gain from its acquisition of a 43 percent share of 
Infoseek, the popular Internet search service. Minus the Infoseek 
gain, Disney's earnings fell 37 percent to $470 million, or 23 
cents per share, compared to $755 million, or 37 cents per share, a 
year earlier. The results were slightly below Wall Street estimates 
of 24 cents per share, according to a survey of analysts by First 
Call Corp. Disney stocks dropped 1 7/16 today to 33 1/8.

<HEADLINE> Steelworkers Warn of Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 100,000 workers could be jobless  
this summer if the government doesn't do something soon to stop 
cheap foreign imports, the head of the United Steelworkers warned 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 10,000 steel workers that are out of work now. We've  
got 100,000 that are on the edge,'' union president George Becker 
told senators. 
</P>
<P>
	If the barrage of imports isn't curbed, ``it's going to destroy,  
it's going to eliminate the steel industry as we know it today,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry is awaiting a Feb. 12 preliminary ruling on  
its complaints alleging that Japan, Brazil and Russia dumped steel 
on the U.S. market for less than it cost them to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	Those countries and others dramatically increased their steel  
exports last year, in some instances quintupling them over 1997 
levels, after economic crises dried up foreign demand for steel and 
left manufacturers with a choice between halting production or 
selling in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Once steel was offered in the United States at substantially  
lower prices than domestic companies charged, American steel buyers 
started ordering more of the cheaper imported product. 
</P>
<P>
	That has triggered layoffs, and Becker predicted additional  
layoffs after July, when a United Steelworkers contract with a 
no-layoff clause expires. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling in February against the exporting countries would be a  
significant step toward retaliatory tariffs, which are designed to 
discourage the exports. But Becker and two steel company executives 
told the Senate Finance Committee that illegal dumping should be 
thwarted in advance rather than punished after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Steel Caucus chairman Jay Rockefeller said senators may  
have to consider invoking a never-used provision of federal trade 
law if President Clinton doesn't act soon to help the steel 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so many steel workers suffering, I am not satisfied to  
wait,'' the West Virginia Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee has never used its power to invoke  
a clause in U.S. and international trade law allowing the United 
States to temporarily protect an entire industry, rather than 
examining complaints one product and one country at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller said the committee should consider its options under  
that provision, known as Section 201, but he would prefer to see 
presidential action, because it wouldn't take as long. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can do that in five minutes, he can do that in five hours,  
he could do that tomorrow morning,'' said Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Congressional Steel Caucus sent Clinton a letter  
Wednesday urging that the administration make its own Section 201 
case ``as soon as the import data demonstrating serious injury to 
the American steel industry becomes available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department was to publish data on December steel  
imports on Thursday. Those figures were expected to show a decline 
in imports from Japan, but Commerce Secretary William Daley took 
pains earlier in the week to say a small, one-month drop would not 
be enough to end the possibility of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky have  
promised quick decisions on the steel companies' dumping 
complaints.

<HEADLINE> Light Linked to Gamma Ray Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, astronomers have recorded  
visible light from the source of a gamma ray burst, a mysterious 
deep space eruption more powerful than the energy of 10 million 
billion stars, researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst was detected at 4:47 a.m. EST Saturday and  
was detected by two orbiting observatories. News of the event was 
relayed through a network to astronomers. Ground-based telescopes 
were able to capture optical light from the fading afterglow that 
followed the 110-second peak of the burst. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamma ray bursts are common, happening several times a week. But  
they come and go so swiftly that astronomers have never before been 
able to link optical observations with the gamma ray detection. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the stellar eruption originated about 10 billion  
light years away but was so powerful in visible light that it could 
have been sighted from the ground with binoculars if, by chance, 
someone had been looking. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the burst had occurred somewhere in our galactic  
neighborhood, it would have been so bright that night would've 
turned into day,'' said Chryssa Kouveliotou of the Universities 
Space Research Association, a contract science group at the 
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said that the burst appeared to originate from near the  
constellation Corona Borealis, visible in the predawn northern sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst phenomenon was discovered in 1967, but the  
bursts remain mysterious. They occur randomly across the sky 
several hundred times a year, with the peak of each burst lasting 
from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Astronomers do not know 
their origin or precise cause. Some speculate that bursts originate 
from black holes. Since gamma rays are invisible to the eye, the 
eruptions were unknown until the development of gamma ray 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The burst last Saturday was detected by NASA's Compton Gamma Ray  
Observatory and by the Italian-Dutch satellite BeppoSAX. Both 
satellite observatories regularly monitor the sky in search of such 
stellar events. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites pinpointed the sky location of the burst, and the  
data were relayed quickly to other observers. Visible light was 
then detected by teams from the California Institute of Technology 
using a telescope at the Mount Palomar Observatory in California 
and by observers from Washington's Carnegie Institute, using the 
Keck II telescope in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the measured intensities of the light and the gamma  
rays, experts estimated energy released from the explosion could 
have been equal to the energy of 10 million billion stars like the 
sun -- that's one followed by 16 zeroes. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy estimate, however, could have been affected by at  
least two factors, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Cal Tech and Carnegie later determined that a  
foreground galaxy may have been between Earth and the origin of the 
gamma ray burst. Gravity from the foreground galaxy could have bent 
the light from the burst and caused what is known as gravitation 
lensing. This could cause the light to appear brighter than it 
actually was, rather as a lens magnifies light. 
</P>
<P>
	Also researchers said the energy burst may have been in a beam,  
like a focused flashlight, instead of going out in all directions, 
as from an uncovered light bulb. A beamed burst also would appear 
to be more powerful than a burst that spewed energy in all 
directions at once.

	``We need to get a burst of activity to show that we are  
attending to the people's business,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott said in a breakfast speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do something quickly about the military,'' he  
said. ``We've got to pay attention to the fact that morale is down, 
we are losing ground in readiness and on pay and pensions we are 
shortchanging (members of the armed forces) and they are getting 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., also predicted early Senate debate on education  
legislation and on bills on the Federal Aviation Administration, 
juvenile crime, bankruptcy reform, financial services reform, a 
second round of changes in welfare programs and fast-track trade 
authority for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, the Armed Services Committee met and endorsed  
the military pay measure, which also would restructure the military 
retirement program and expand terms of the GI bill. The measure is 
now ready for a vote by the full Senate. The House is expected to 
consider a similar measure soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee leaders said the bill, a top GOP priority, could be  
the first piece of legislation passed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., who held a  
news conference with other committee members to highlight the 
military spending issue, said it would contribute to the 
``desperate need to stop, for the 14th year, a decline in defense 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has asked for a $12 billion increase in  
defense spending, including a 4.4 percent salary increase. Warner 
called that amount inadequate but praised Clinton for recognizing 
the need to turn around the decline in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay raise in both Clinton's proposal and in the Senate  
committee version would take effect next January. 
</P>
<P>
	The military pay and retirement bill starts out with a 4.8  
percent pay increase for everyone, but after July 1, 2000 allows 
additional increases of up to 10.3 percent on the basis of merit 
and ``at specific promotion points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also overhaul the retirement system,  
restoring the 50 percent basic retirement pay -- after 20 years of 
service -- that was in force before 1986, when the level was lowered 
to 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also adopted a proposal by Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.,  
that would eliminate the $1,200 contribution required of military 
members who elect to participate in the GI Bill, which provides 
subsidies for college education. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidy levels would also be increased, from $528 a month to  
$600 a month, for members who serve at least three years; and from 
$429 to $488 for members who serve less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	These benefits could, at the Defense Department's discretion, be  
transferred to another member of a service person's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also predicted early Senate consideration of measures to  
help ease Year-2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 10 days after the trial, ``we're are going to make the  
senators all come to the Senate chamber and sit down and we are 
going to get a report'' about the status of efforts to correct 
computer glitches that could cause serious disruptions in basic 
services with the arrival of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he thought the trial would be over in ``two weeks at  
the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first bills on the Senate floor, Lott said, would be  
an ``education flexibility'' bill, which would extend a program 
giving state and local governments more freedom to try innovative 
approaches to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Republicans would press for an across-the-board tax  
rate cut and would oppose administration plans to raise tobacco 
taxes and spend the budget surplus on Medicare and other programs.

<HEADLINE> FDA To Curbs Animal Antibiotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government plans to impose strict new  
rules on antibiotics given to farm animals to combat concerns that 
the medicines are creating drug-resistant germs that wind up in the 
meat people eat. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibiotics are fast losing their ability to fight infections,  
mostly because people misuse the vital drugs: Doctors often 
overprescribe them and patients often don't take them properly. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists say antibiotics used on the farm now are causing  
foodborne bacteria to mutate into treatment-resistant forms -- so 
the Food and Drug Administration is preparing rules to try to curb 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that won't go away and can no longer be  
ignored,'' said Michigan veterinarian Keith Sterner, who chaired a 
panel of FDA's advisers that backed most of the agency's plans 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory committee said FDA's plan to force antibiotic  
manufacturers to conduct on-the-farm testing of drug resistance 
probably would never work. But overall, the FDA has proposed ``a 
sound framework'' of more strict animal drug regulation, Sterner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-day meeting to deliberate the FDA's proposals highlighted  
how bitter a controversy the issue is. On one side, the animal drug 
industry denies there is any serious risk to consumers, noting that 
no one has died from eating meat tainted with untreatable germs. On 
the other side, public health experts say they must act to protect 
consumers from that ever happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics ``never stood at the bedside of a critically ill patient  
... hoping the antibiotics will work and having to deal with the 
consequences when they don't,'' said Dr. David Bell of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. He pleaded with the industry to 
find a compromise that protects consumers while still providing 
farmers with drugs vital for animal health. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers adamantly oppose many of FDA's plans, saying the  
rules would make it too difficult -- and expensive -- to create new 
antibiotics for animals. They argued that the government instead 
should study whether on-the-farm antibiotics really pose an 
imminent threat, and educate farmers and veterinarians to more 
prudently use the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the agency is overreacting,'' said Dr. Brendan Fox,  
president of Elanco Animal Health. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted a fierce reaction from one of FDA's advisors: ``If  
there is no risk, you shouldn't be afraid of'' the FDA's rules, 
said CDC's Dr. Frederick Angulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half the 50 million pounds of U.S.-produced antibiotics  
is used in animals. Eighty percent is used, not to treat sick 
animals, but to promote animals' growth by adding small doses into 
their feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Europe has drawn the ire of the animal health industry  
by banning six antibiotics used as animal growth promoters, 
including one closely related to the vital human antibiotic 
vancomycin. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the FDA's proposals to tackle the issue:  
</P>
<P>
	--Companies seeking to sell a new animal antibiotic would have to  
prove it is not expected to cause significant resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	--The government would test today's level of foodborne drug  
resistance, and then set limits on how much resistance could 
increase before an implicated animal antibiotic would be 
restricted, even banned. 
</P>
<P>
	--FDA would rank animal drugs, giving those most closely related  
to vital human antibiotics extra scrutiny. Some companies might be 
ordered to conduct on-the-farm animal tests. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA advisers said Tuesday that on-the-farm testing may be too  
complicated to ever work, but agreed with most of FDA's approach. 
Sterner stressed that animal antibiotics closely related to vital 
human drugs would have ``a zero threshold'' for increasing 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA will decide which rules to adopt after a public comment  
period ends in April.

<HEADLINE> FCC Puts Off Decision on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are postponing two major  
decisions, one aimed at easing Internet congestion, the other 
dealing with how local telephone companies compensate each other 
for customers' calls to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's deletion Wednesday of  
the two agenda for Thursday's monthly meeting was expected in light 
of two Supreme Court rulings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court upheld the FCC's right to make rules opening to  
competition the $110 billion local phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the FCC is expected to make minor revisions to an  
order that would phase out the fees totaling $600 million that 
regional Bell telephone companies pay smaller local phone companies 
to connect Internet calls. It's likely to be left to states to 
decide how companies compensate each other in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices also vacated an FCC rule that forces local phone  
companies to give rivals blanket access to any piece of the local 
network. The court said the FCC didn't adequately consider whether 
rivals, such as long-distance companies, could obtain these pieces 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, the FCC will put off and revise another  
proposal that would have required big local phone companies to 
provide rivals with access to new high-speed services and pieces of 
their networks. 
</P>
<P>
	That proposal, designed to ease Internet congestion, would have  
given regional Bell telephone companies and other major local phone 
providers, such as GTE, would eliminate some of the rules governing 
their delivery of high-speed data services. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thursday's meeting, the FCC is expected to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Release an audit of the five Bell telephone companies showing  
that billions of dollars in equipment can't be accounted for. The 
results -- contested by the Bells -- could have an indirect effect on 
long-distance rates by enticing consumer groups to press for lower 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	--Propose that long-distance companies compensate pay phone  
owners 24 cents for each calling card or access code call -- when a 
caller dials an 11-digit code to reach a long-distance company, 
bypassing the company providing service to the phone. The action, 
which lowers the fee by 4 cents, responds to a federal court ruling 
that the agency hadn't justified the previous fee. Pay phone owners 
say the lower fee won't cover their costs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Release a report on availability of high-speed Internet and  
data connections. Consumer groups want the agency to force cable TV 
companies with high-speed lines to make them available to other 
companies to offer competing services. America Online also wants 
regulators to do this.

<HEADLINE> Low-Power Radio Stations Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For disc jockey wannabes, it's a ticket to the  
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of low-tech, low-cost radio stations sprouting up  
across the country airing church services, city council meetings 
and high school basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission today was expected to take  
the first step toward creating a very local radio service that 
would help community and regional interest groups get on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will offer proposals to create thousands of new  
low-power FM radio stations. These ``micro'' radio broadcasters 
would operate with low power levels from 1 watt to 1,000 watts and 
would be licensed by the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an opportunity to create new alternative voices on the  
airwaves,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on the height of the antenna and the terrain, a 1-watt  
station typically serves an area with a diameter of about two miles 
-- and a 1,000-watt station an area with a diameter of up to 18 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals also address the issue of consolidation in the  
radio industry, which has made it increasingly difficult for the 
voices of minorities and community groups to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 law triggered rapid consolidation in the industry by  
relaxing limits on the number of radio stations held by any one 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would bring radio back to the neighborhood,'' said Cheryl  
Leanza, an attorney with the Media Access Project, a public 
interest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilmer Urgelles wants to start a low-powered station to air  
Sunday services, Bible studies and Christian music in Spanish, 
something he says would be useful to the many elderly members who 
have trouble getting around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in such need of a station like this,'' said Urgelles of  
the Iglesia Cristiana El Buen Samaritano in Princeton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to help regular FM stations grow and become  
financially solid, the FCC stopped licensing low-powered FM radio 
stations around 1978. As a result, just 133 mostly educational, 
low-powered FM stations now exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Some city governments have expressed interest in starting a  
low-power FM station to air transportation and weather information 
in the mornings, plus community news and city council meetings 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	But the radio industry opposes the idea, saying it would create  
interference with other radio stations, said National Association 
of Broadcasters' spokesman John Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, a strong supporter of the new licenses, countered  
broadcasters' predictions, saying his agency will protect existing 
radio services. ``We don't want to do anything that is going to 
prevent consumers from getting good, interference-free radio,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are subject to revision, public comment and  
another vote before they would take effect. The FCC is supposed to 
seek public comment on whether the stations should be 
noncommercial, commercial or a mix. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also unclear what standards any group -- including  
special-interest groups -- would have to meet to get a low-power 
license. Right now to get a higher-power license, companies 
generally must show they want to serve a particular area -- plus 
provide information about any past criminal record or 
discrimination dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-powered stations are cheaper to build because the equipment  
isn't as expensive. In addition to avoiding the big expense of 
building a tower for antennas, stations likely will have an easier 
time getting zoning approval for smaller rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs can be as low as $2,500 for a 1-watt station to $100,000  
and up for a 1,000-watt station, FCC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the FCC is considering postponing a vote today to  
release an audit of the five Bell telephone companies showing that 
billions of dollars in equipment can't be accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, however, is expected to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Propose that long-distance companies compensate pay phone  
owners 24 cents for each calling card or access code call. 
</P>
<P>
	--Release a report on availability of high-speed Internet and  
data connections.

<HEADLINE>  Senate OKs Witnesses for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate blocked  
dismissal of the impeachment case against President Clinton on 
Wednesday and then voted for new testimony from Monica Lewinsky and 
two other witnesses -- but by margins well short of the two-thirds 
that would be needed to oust the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of roll calls in the hushed Senate chamber, all 55  
Republicans voted against dismissal and for the witnesses opposed 
by the White House. They were joined by a single Democrat, Russell 
Feingold of Wisconsin, leaving them far below the 67 needed for 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will not be removed from office,'' Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle declared moments later in comments 
swiftly seconded by the White House. ``For the good of the country 
and in keeping with the Constitution it is now time to end this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the votes, Daschle and Majority Leader Trent Lott  
were at work trying to fashion a bipartisan agreement for the 
balance of the trial, including videotaped depositions of Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon, Lott told reporters the two parties had  
exchanged offers and he said he was hopeful for agreement by 
Thursday on a timetable for a final vote on the articles of 
impeachment by mid-February. He suggested the witness depositions -- 
possibly videotaped -- could take place over the weekend or Monday, 
and left open the question of whether the White House might then 
decide it wanted witnesses of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no debate on the Senate floor before Wednesday's two  
votes, but numerous senators issued written statements afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is premature to dismiss this case at the present  
time,'' said Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican who had 
previously expressed misgivings about witnesses. He said he 
believed the prosecution ``should be allowed the opportunity to 
demonstrate whether there is new and significant information that 
would justify live testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Feingold, Democrats were unanimous that whatever  
Clinton's wrongs, they weren't impeachable offenses. ``However 
reprehensible that conduct was, I do not believe it is 
constitutional grounds for removing from office a president elected 
by the people,'' said North Dakota's Byron Dorgan. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers have warned repeatedly that calling any  
witnesses would mean protracted delays to allow for time for a 
review of documents thus far withheld from the president's team. 
But in a prepared statement he read to reporters in a Senate 
corridor, Special Counsel Gregory Craig omitted any mention of a 
drawn out process consuming many months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's events made clear that the votes are not there to  
convict and remove the president from office,'' he said. 
Sixty-seven votes would be needed. Any further proceedings, ``run 
counter to the best interests of the Congress, the presidency and 
the American people,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
that under one course of action under discussion the White House 
would not seek to delay the depositions with a demand for extensive 
preparation time. Only if one of the witnesses made a new 
disclosure that was potentially harmful to the president's case 
would they insist on a review of evidence thus far kept from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's trial proceedings, with Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist presiding, began with the customary prayer from the 
chaplain, Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie. ``Leadership has its defining days in 
which critical decisions must be made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The roll calls that followed within moments were somber -- if  
utterly lacking in suspense -- as 100 senators sat quietly at their 
seats until called on alphabetically to announce their votes. There 
was one light moment, when Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski of 
Maryland mistakenly sided with the Republicans against dismissal, 
then swiftly won permission from Rehnquist to correct herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold was the only lawmaker of either side to cross party  
lines. He swiftly left the chamber when the proceedings were over, 
and issued a statement saying his vote against dismissal ``should 
not be interpreted as a signal that I intend to vote to convict the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, several Democrats predicted that on the final vote some  
Republicans would reject one or both of the articles of 
impeachment, which allege perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes on Wednesday capped days of maneuvering over the  
volatile witness issue. House prosecutors, who originally had hoped 
to depose a dozen or more key figures in the sex and cover-up 
scandal reduced their list to a ``pitiful three,'' in the words of 
their leader, Rep. Henry Hyde. That was to allow Lott to hold 
Republicans in line at a time when many are eager to end a trial 
that remains unpopular with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side of the aisle, Daschle and numerous other  
lawmakers resurrected their calls for censure of Clinton instead of 
impeachment conviction. ``The president should and will receive 
sanctions and rebuke. I will strongly support a resolution of 
censure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But like everything else in the trial, agreement on censure  
could be difficult to achieve, given the tricky constitutional 
issues involved and the disagreement among lawmakers about the 
extent of Clinton's transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Republicans was at work on ``findings of fact'' that  
would conclude that Clinton had lied and obstructed justice. 
Several Democrats said they would have a hard time supporting that. 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California was drafting a 
resolution to ``state the feelings of the Senate with respect to 
misconduct'' by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	By calling witnesses, House prosecutors hope to obtain evidence  
relating to their charges that Clinton sought to obstruct justice 
by persuading Ms. Lewinsky to sign a false affidavit in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and by giving his aides false 
information about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to take to the 
grand jury and about efforts to arrange a job for the former White 
House intern.

<HEADLINE> Race Suit Coach Inducted Into Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A former basketball coach who sued  
Spartanburg Methodist College over his team's racial makeup has 
been inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame as part of a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Rigot was head coach from 1990-1996 and compiled a 158-35  
record, the highest winning percentage of any coach in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the success, the private junior college fired Rigot in  
June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigot, who is white, argued in his federal lawsuit that  
Spartanburg Methodist fired him because he opposed a new school 
policy that required him to recruit white basketball players for 
his all-black team. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials denied the allegations, saying Rigot was fired  
because he did not recruit enough and spent too much time in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1996, the school adopted an objective to  
recruit with a diversity makeup that represented the overall 
student body. Spartanburg Methodist is a two-year college with 
about 1,600 students -- most of them white. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigot, now an assistant coach at the University of  
Alabama-Birmingham, sued school President George D. Fields, vice 
president for advancement C. Sterling Case and vice president for 
academic affairs John W. Anderson. Fields and Anderson have since 
left the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Spartanburg Methodist spokesman Hugh Mathis said school  
officials would not comment, as mandated by terms of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigot's attorney, John Earl Duncan of Lexington, confirmed his  
client could not speak about the details, The (Columbia) State 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his suit, Rigot said the college president and vice president  
called the basketball team ``too black'' and came up with a policy 
change that required him to recruit and sign more white players 
regardless of ability. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, the policy required Rigot to recruit  
players based solely on race to keep a quota of 60 percent white 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The college denied the allegations in its court answer.  
</P>
<P>
	Rigot sued for compensatory damages, back pay with interest,  
lost benefits, front pay and attorney's fees and costs, and other 
actual damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the Hall of Fame induction, new school president  
Charles P. Teague praised Rigot for his accomplishments at 
Spartanburg Methodist and wished him future coaching success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really impressed with the sincerity,'' Duncan said.  
``Dr. Teague said he wanted meaningful, non-monetary compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school offered to put Scott into its Hall of Fame,  
something Scott richly deserves,'' he said. ``The school had 
discussed it with Scott before implementing its new racial policy 
because they knew they couldn't keep Scott forever and wanted to 
honor him.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Mayor's Aide Resigns Over Word </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The city's new mayor accepted the resignation  
of a member of his staff because of complaints he used a racial 
epithet. But even as he stepped down, David Howard, who is white, 
said the word he used -- ``niggardly'' -- does not have any racial 
connotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Howard's resignation was prompted by reports that he made  
an inappropriate racial comment,'' Mayor Anthony Williams said in a 
statement Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything that was in itself racist,'' Williams  
told reports, but he added that what Howard said showed poor 
judgment. ``Good judgment is required in executive positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement, Howard identified the word he used as  
``niggardly'' and said he was referring to a fund he administers. 
Howard said it means ``miserly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webster's Tenth Edition concurs, defining it as ``grudgingly  
mean about spending or granting.'' The dictionary dates its use to 
the late 16th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the word sounds like a racial epithet, Howard said, he  
realized other members of the mayor's staff present when he made 
the remark were offended. He said he quickly apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that since he made the remark on Jan. 15, he has  
received many angry phone calls from people who thought he made a 
racist remark. About two-thirds of the capital city's half million 
population is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never think of making a racist remark,'' said Howard,  
whose job was to hear the concerns of district residents and bring 
them to the attention of the mayor and his staff. ``I realize that 
this rumor has severely compromised my effectiveness as the 
district's public advocate and, in the best interest of my office, 
I resigned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In accepting Howard's resignation, Williams said, ``We're trying  
to bring our city together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, who is black, said he is ``troubled by recent news  
stories about race -- questions about whether I'm black enough or 
have too many advisors who are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said the issue reflects a ``hurt'' and ``great divide''  
within the city and that race relations must be talked about openly 
in the nation's capital.

<HEADLINE> Official Allegedly Stole for Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The former supervisor of Indiana's child  
support program was charged Wednesday with stealing more than 
$680,000 for allegedly creating phony child support accounts to 
finance sexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County Prosecutor Scott Newman said David Scott took  
advantage of his position at the Family and Social Services 
Administration to create phony child support accounts, then erased 
the evidence from the agency's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who had worked for the agency since 1985 and earned a  
$26,287 annual salary, lived in a modest home in the Indianapolis 
suburb of Greenwood with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
	He used the embezzled funds to finance sexual relationships with  
three of four women who also were involved in the scheme, Newman 
said. One woman told investigators he paid for her breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 36, resigned Nov. 18 as agency officials prepared to fire  
him. Authorities were seeking him late Wednesday on charges of 
forgery, theft, computer tampering, official misconduct and 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's number in Greenwood was unlisted.  
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said Scott took advantage of inadequate  
safeguards and his position of trust as one of only three employees 
with full access to computerized records of the state's 
approximately 300,000 active child support cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said Scott allegedly issued 360 false checks totaling  
$684,516 to himself and four female acquaintances over an 
eight-year period starting in January 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He said investigators uncovered the scheme after the mother of  
an exotic dancer with whom Scott allegedly had a sexual 
relationship asked authorities to check on her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The dancer told investigators she had been receiving phony  
child-support checks from Scott, including one used to pay for her 
breast implants.

<HEADLINE> Man Caught With Knife Near Capitol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Maryland man with tickets to the Senate  
impeachment trial was arrested last week when he tried to bring a 
bag containing an 18-inch knife and two explosives into the 
Capitol, The Washington Post reported in its Thursday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Wilson Johnson, 36, of Capitol Heights, Md., was stopped  
by Capitol Police at 2 p.m. Jan. 20 when they checked the bag on an 
X-ray machine. At the time, President Clinton's lawyers, led by 
special counsel Gregory B. Craig, were presenting their second day 
of opening arguments before a crowded Senate chamber. Johnson told 
police he kept the knife for ``protection,'' authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol Police said a search of Johnson's bag also turned up two  
M-60 explosive devices, a ``terrorist handbook,'' weapons price 
lists, an article on the Oklahoma City bombing, survivalist 
materials and a Soldier of Fortune magazine. One law enforcement 
source likened the M-60 devices to bottle rockets and said Johnson 
had no match or lighter that day to ignite them. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was jailed without bond on charges of carrying a  
dangerous weapon and illegal explosives. On Monday, a federal judge 
ordered he be held pending a psychiatric evaluation and set a 
follow-up hearing for March 17 after citing reports that Johnson 
has a bipolar disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Johnson's arrest marked the first such incident  
during the impeachment trial. He was stopped at the entrance to the 
Capitol's law library, the area being used for admission to the 
Senate gallery. If he had gotten past that entrance, police said, 
he would have faced another search before gaining entrance to the 
Senate gallery overlooking the Senate floor. There, all bags must 
be checked. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode came six months after a mental patient, Russell  
Eugene Weston Jr., allegedly charged past a checkpoint, entered the 
Capitol with gun in hand and opened fire, killing two police 
officers. Russell Eugene Weston Jr. has been charged with murdering 
a federal officer in that case.

<HEADLINE> Knight Ridder Exec To Direct ASNE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scott Bosley, who just ended a 33-year career  
with Knight Ridder, has been named executive director of the 
American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosley, 55, of Bethesda, Md., will begin working as a consultant  
at the society's headquarters in Reston, Va., in March. He will 
assume his new post when the present executive, Lee Stinnett, 
retires July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosley will be only the fourth person to head the staff of the  
ASNE, which was founded in 1922 and has 875 members from the United 
States, Canada and throughout the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're managing an association that represents 800 editors. I  
want to help them have as strong a voice as they can in the future 
of the industry,'' Bosley said. ``The society has several major 
projects. One is credibility with readers. Another is having staffs 
of newspapers that are more diverse and reflect their 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bosley graduated from West Virginia University in 1965 and  
started his career as a reporter on the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal 
and later became its managing editor. He also was managing editor 
of Detroit Free Press for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1987 and 1991, Bosley worked in Washington at Knight  
Ridder Tribune Information Services, a news service that 
redistributes stories from Knight Ridder and Tribune Co. papers. 
</P>
<P>
	He later was a news executive for The Journal of Commerce. From  
1995 to 1998, Bosley was publisher of the Post-Tribune in Gary, 
Ind. When Knight Ridder sold the paper last February, Bosley joined 
Knight Ridder's corporate staff in Washington, working on new 
product development.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Sign Cedric Ceballos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Forward Cedric Ceballos, who failed to land a  
big-money contract in the free-agent market, returned to the Dallas 
Mavericks with a one-year contract Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceballos had said after last season that he wanted to test the  
market. But the flurry of free-agent signings last week did not 
leave much open for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the market spoke and he didn't receive first of all one of  
the big free-agent contracts ... pretty soon we were back in the 
ball game,'' said Mavericks coach-general manager Don Nelson, who 
only last week rejected the notion of Ceballos returning to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it got to a point where again, you know, the number was  
right and we jumped on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Ceballos' one-year contract weren't released.  
</P>
<P>
	Nelson had penciled in rookie Dirk Nowitzki as his starting  
small forward after Ceballos turned down a three-year offer worth 
$6.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 Nowitzki will now split playing time with  
Ceballos. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceballos, 29, was acquired in a trade with Phoenix last season.  
He averaged 16.9 points and six rebounds in 12 games with Dallas 
before sustaining a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nine-game stretch in March, Ceballos combined with  
Mavericks guard Michael Finley for an average of 41.6 points a 
game. The two led Dallas to a 4-5 mark during those nine games, 
giving the team it's best run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceballos has averaged 14.6 points per game and 51.5 percent  
shooting for his career. He was an All-Star in 1992 and was 
selected as a reserve in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	His return to Dallas rounds out the Mavericks' roster. Also this  
week, center Hot Rod Williams agreed to a three-year deal, forward 
Gary Trent signed a one-year deal, and guard Steve Nash agreed to 
extend his contract for six years.

<HEADLINE> Housing Wishes of Elderly Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Millions of older Americans have been shuffled off  
to adult day care and assisted living facilities at the wishes of 
their children, their doctors, or their insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But in too many cases, no one bothered to ask the elders what  
they wanted, according to a new Brandeis University study. 
</P>
<P>
	Even older people with full mental capacities aren't being  
consulted often enough, said John Capitman, a professor at 
Brandeis' Institute for Health Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom is still an adult, and an adult with a whole life of  
experience,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult children who are sending their parents to long-term  
care programs ``wouldn't want somebody else to tell them, `No, you 
can't live at home.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With funding from the federal Department of Health and Human  
Services' Administration on Aging, Capitman spent four years 
interviewing more than 1,000 elderly people around the country, as 
well as their relatives. His staff also interviewed doctors and 
facility administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	His research focused primarily on adult day care centers -- where  
seniors are sent for several hours each day -- and assisted living 
facilities, which are similar to nursing homes but offer less 
intensive nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
	In his interviews, Capitman heard a familiar refrain.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we visited people in assisted living, consistently they  
said: `My child made the decision. I didn't choose to be here,''' 
he said Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Most seniors seemed to have adjusted to their new circumstances.  
But then there were people he interviewed like the 80-something 
woman in New Haven, Conn., whose family had placed her in assisted 
living against her wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what terrible sin I must have done that I'm still  
alive and living like this,'' she told Capitman. 
</P>
<P>
	By ignoring their parents' wishes, adult children are placing  
seniors in programs that often don't meet their needs, the 
researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of potential for an older person's expression of  
their own needs to get lost in the shuffle,'' said Jane Tilly, 
associate director for long-term care policy research at the 
American Association of Retired Persons' Public Policy Institute, 
which did not participate in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, some 6.5 million people over age 65 have  
disabilities and are receiving care ranging from home health 
services to 24-hour nursing home assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The health care system contributes to the problem by refusing to  
pay for lengthy hospital stays, forcing many elders to move to 
nursing homes or other facilities when they'd rather return to 
their own houses or apartments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has recently proposed tax breaks and other  
steps to ease the financial strain on families caring for 
chronically ill or disabled relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans, Capitman said, need to do a better job of preparing  
elders to make difficult living decisions. And their children, he 
said, need to pay closer attention to what aging parents really 
want. 
</P>
<P>
	But the AARP's Tilly warned that too often, caregivers --  
including adult children and elderly spouses -- try to keep a 
disabled relative at home, placing too heavy a burden on family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is only going to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	The 65-to-74 year-old set is expected to nearly double, from 18  
million Americans in 2000 to 35 million in 2050, according to 
census projections. The population between ages 75 and 84 will 
likely more than double, from 12 million in 2000 to 26 million in 
2050.

<HEADLINE> Prinze Gives Daily News Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Freddie Prinze Jr. savors his fledgling star  
status with a generous amount of awe at his good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think things would happen this quickly,'' says  
Prinze, 22, star of the new romantic comedy ``She's All That'' with 
Rachael Leigh Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	Prinze landed the part of leading man after playing smaller  
roles in a handful of movies, including a supporting role in the 
1997 teen slasher hit, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where I wanted to be, but this isn't where I thought I  
would be,'' Prinze said in Wednesday's Daily News. ``I saw it 
taking a bit more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prinze, who was 10 months old when his father committed suicide  
in 1977, is determined to make it on his own, despite his name 
recognition. His father, the comic who starred in ``Chico and the 
Man,'' was 22 when he shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's All That'' opens this Friday, Jan. 29 -- the same day his  
father died 22 years ago. The irony wasn't lost on Prinze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was like, ``What?' Is this some kind of sick joke? Now that  
was kind of trippy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Remembering the Night Miami Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Everyone told Dick Anderson how well things were  
going when he headed the Super Bowl host committee 10 years ago, 
planning all the parties that accompany the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I saw what was happening on television,'' the ex-Pro Bowl  
defensive back said, ``and I almost broke into tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Anderson saw in Miami were fires burning in the Overtown  
and Liberty City neighborhoods, set by rioters angry that a 
Hispanic police officer fatally shot an unarmed black motorcyclist 
who was speeding. A passenger on the motorcycle died when the 
driver crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, the festive mood of the Super Bowl evaporated. And  
Anderson knew the three days of riots would endanger what he had 
worked so hard to create. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought people would become apprehensive,'' he said. ``Super  
Bowl crowds usually come in on Thursday for the weekend. If you're 
sitting at home on Monday or Tuesday and there are riots in the 
city you're going to visit, you become concerned. Anytime there's a 
disturbance, whether it's Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago or Miami, 
people are going to think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those thinking about it were the Cincinnati Bengals and  
San Francisco 49ers, who hardly needed the disruption before the 
biggest game of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Wilcots was a reserve defensive back for the Bengals,  
who lost the game 20-16, and uttered one of the most memorable 
quotes about the riots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out to watch a movie, `Mississippi Burning,''' he said,  
``and when I came out of the movie, Miami was burning. This was 
1989. You don't think you're going to have riots in urban areas. We 
were 30 years removed from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Munoz, Cincinnati's Hall of Fame offensive lineman,  
could see the smoke from his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember looking out my window and staring at it,'' he said.  
``I saw this fire and I was thinking, `What's going on?' Here I am 
in my second Super Bowl. The first one, in Detroit, it was too cold 
to go outside. And now this. I couldn't go outside again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals were concerned because wide receiver Eddie Brown, a  
Miami native, was believed to be visiting friends in the troubled 
area. The team called the police to go in after him, but Brown had 
left before the trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed in the racial violence, 11 were wounded by  
gunfire and nearly 400 were arrested. Thirteen buildings were 
torched and others looted, causing about $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer William Lozano was convicted of manslaughter but won a  
new trial and was acquitted in 1993. He was later fired, but a 
federal arbitrator ordered the city to reinstate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems the riots caused for Overtown residents and  
the city, Anderson thought Miami came through the crisis very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd have been better off if it hadn't happened,'' he said.  
``But every Super Bowl activity the committee planned went off 
extremely well, without a hitch. We got another Super Bowl in 1995 
and a second one this year. So the people who make the choices 
weren't affected by the riot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, perhaps they were.  
</P>
<P>
	Under commissioner Paul Tagliabue, the NFL began a community  
outreach program, sponsoring Youth Education Towns in the last six 
Super Bowl cities. One center opened in Liberty City in 1995 and 
ground was broken Wednesday for another in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul felt we had to pay more attention to the cities in which  
we play Super Bowls and leave more of a legacy than we did in the 
early years,'' NFL vice president Joe Browne said. ``The YET 
centers are a bricks-and-mortar legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the league is sponsoring construction of 10 Habitat  
for Humanity homes that will provide housing for low-income 
families in the Little Haiti area. The NFL has also funded projects 
in Carol City, next to Pro Player Stadium, and a scholarship 
program for southern Florida minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the riots left scars.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray Buck, then a reporter with the Houston Post, had decided to  
spend the evening at a dog track with his wife, Mary. They had the 
misfortune of making a wrong turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were eight guys on the street and they had stopped the  
car in front of us,'' he said. ``My wife was driving and I said, 
`Be careful. It looks like a drug deal.' Then they started throwing 
stuff. A brick or a rock broke the windshield and glass got on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife sped away. We couldn't get out of there fast enough.  
Finally, we got back to the hotel and stayed in the room all 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now relocated in southern Florida with CBS SportsLine, Buck  
occasionally covers basketball games in the Miami Arena, on the 
fringe of the Overtown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still get paranoid going to Heat games,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Wants Monetary Union With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The head of the Mexican Bankers Association  
said Wednesday the country should consider stabilizing its currency 
through a monetary union with the United States -- a move that could 
make the dollar the national currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``A first step could be the setting up of a currency board, and  
afterwards the establishment of monetary union,'' association 
president Carlos Gomez y Gomez said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez y Gomez said the Mexican peso's current free-floating  
foreign exchange regime has been very useful, but that monetary 
union would provide additional stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The peso traded Wednesday at about 10.18 to the U.S. dollar.  
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a currency board or a dollarization Mexican economy  
has been widely aired among private sector organizations, but 
Mexican officials have said they are not considering such a move at 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions on the issue increased after Argentina said last  
week it was mulling whether to make its economy dollar-based.

<HEADLINE> New Arthritis Treatment Touted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The standard medicine for rheumatoid arthritis appears to ease  
pain and swelling significantly better when combined with a newly 
approved, genetically engineered drug, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last decade, methotrexate has been the first-choice drug  
because it relieves symptoms quickly and more effectively than 
other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it doesn't help many patients enough, so researchers  
compared using methotrexate alone and using it with an injectable 
drug called Enbrel, the first genetically engineered medication 
sold for arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 study of 89 patients, reported in Thursday's New  
England Journal of Medicine, doctors found pain and swelling 
decreased noticeably in 71 percent of patients who got both drugs 
for six weeks. The rate was 27 percent for patients who got 
methotrexate and a dummy shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms decreased as much as 70 percent for 15 percent of the  
patients who got Enbrel and methotrexate, compared with none who 
only took methotrexate. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead researcher of the study was Dr. Michael E. Weinblatt,  
director of clinical rheumatology at Brigham and Women's Hospital 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which rogue  
immune cells attack the tissue cushioning joints, eventually 
disabling many patients. It affects 2 million Americans, mostly 
women, and usually develops between age 25 and 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Enbrel, chemically known as etanercept, caused few adverse  
effects in the study besides itching and rashes at the injection 
site, but it has one big drawback -- it costs $12,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in the journal, Dr. James R. O'Dell of  
University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha also noted the 
success of infliximab, a genetically engineered drug approved for a 
digestive tract disorder and being tested for rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A new era has begun,'' he wrote. ``For the first time,  
clinicians can target a specific aspect of the pathologic process'' 
in rheumatoid arthritis, rather than just reducing inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Enbrel is made by Immunex Corp. of Seattle, which funded the  
study and retained Weinblatt as a consultant.

	Senate OKs Witnesses for Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led Senate voted today to  
summon Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses for testimony in the 
impeachment trial of President Clinton. They did so after refusing 
to dismiss the perjury and obstruction of justice charges against 
the president. Both 56-44 votes were along party lines with a 
single exception, Wisconsin Democrat Russell Feingold who voted 
with the Republican majority.

	Pope Condemns Death Penalty  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II brought his campaign against  
capital punishment to a death-penalty state in America's heartland 
today. During a mass at the Trans World Dome, he urged 100,000 
worshippers to spare even those who commit ``great evil.'' The 
message may have had particular relevance in Missouri, where the 
state Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution 
that was to have taken place while the pope was in town. 

</P>
<P>
	Renewed Fighting Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Government troops backed by tanks  
pounded ethnic Albanian strongholds along a strategic highway 
today, while U.S. and European envoys urged Kosovo rebels to accept 
talks on a plan for self-rule that falls short of the full 
independence they seek. At least 150 villagers fled their homes as 
fighting flared along the Pristina-Belgrade highway, peace monitors 
reported. Dozens piled into tractor-pulled trailers to escape. The 
fighting came as major powers were preparing to call a peace 
conference to bring together Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government and the separatists who oppose it.

	Albright Discusses Iraq in Riyadh  
</P>
<P>
	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright sought Saudi Arabia's support today for U.S. efforts to 
topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein by assisting opposition 
groups. Spokesman James P. Rubin acknowledged the secretary's 
intention to try to enlist the backing of this conservative 
monarchy in a growing U.S. campaign to oust Saddam. Albright will 
also discuss ways to try to protect Iraq's neighbors. The plea for 
Saudi support follows a U.S. decision to provide selective 
opposition groups in Iraq with $97 million in surplus U.S. military 
equipment.

	Clinton Outlines Soc. Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton summoned approving academics  
and economists to the White House today to endorse his Social 
Security rescue plan, push for Medicare reforms and argue against 
tax cuts. In order to shore up Social Security and Medicare for 
retiring baby boomers, Clinton said it will take a bipartisan 
process. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott made clear that 
Republicans, who want a 10 percent income tax cut, will not just 
hand over the budget surplus to Clinton, no matter how much assent 
he collected in the East Room of the White House.

	Web Site eBay Under Investigation  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's Department of Consumer Affairs is  
investigating online auction site eBay Inc. for fraud. The 
department is looking into whether people who use eBay to sell 
items falsely labeled some sports memorabilia as ``one-of-a-kind,'' 
a source close to the investigation told The Associated Press. 
Specifically, the agency is investigating whether baseballs 
supposedly signed by Babe Ruth, Roberto Clemente and Christy 
Mathewson are authentic, the source said.

	Outspoken Ex-IRA Member Found Dead  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A recklessly honest former  
member of the Irish Republican Army was found dead on a rural 
roadside today. Relatives of Eamon Collins -- who wrote about his 
work as an IRA intelligence agent in the 1997 book, ``Killing 
Rage'' -- identified his battered body. Police said they could not 
immediately tell whether he had been shot. There was no claim of 
responsibility. But Collins, 45, had made many enemies by 
confessing his crimes -- and implicating other IRA members -- to 
police interrogators in 1985.

member resigned today, the fourth to quit in the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal. On Sunday, the IOC identified Charles Mukora as

<HEADLINE> Barry Levinson Shares More of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- It's Friday night, and Pennsylvania Avenue is  
jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the blue neon marquee of the Royal Theater, a small circle  
of men break into song, snapping their fingers and bobbing in and 
out in a curbside jam session. The excited screams from a young 
woman pierce the cold night air as huge, eight-cylinder ``boats'' 
motor down the wet street, the heart of Baltimore's black 
entertainment strip. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Royal's bill that night: James Brown and his Orchestra.  
Sharing the stage: Sugar Pie DeSanto and The Famous Flames, and Six 
Beautiful Dancing Girls. But this is long before Brown was ``the 
hardest-working man in show business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is 1954, when Elmer Liepman's Smart Clothing sold two-tone  
wingtip shoes for $10 and charge accounts were personal, not 
plastic; when Maryland's license plates were a dull 
orange-and-black and women wore socks with high heels. 
</P>
<P>
	In an alley across the street, a television monitor shows the  
scene from a camera suspended on a crane high above the street. 
Director Barry Levinson points to a bit of blue neon in the upper 
left-hand corner. It's just a small piece, but it gives the 
illusion of the marquee of some grand hotel. A little trick of the 
trade; saves money and looks good. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a child marveling at his diorama of a Civil War  
battlefield, Levinson is impressed by the ``establishing shot'' for 
a scene in his new movie, ``Liberty Heights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't here,'' he says, sucking on a root beer barrel  
candy in the warmth of a 4-foot-high heat lamp. ``These poles 
aren't there, you know what I mean? Nothing. The hotel's not. 
Nothing that you see exists today. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make this Pennsylvania Avenue because Pennsylvania  
Avenue is really no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrienne Townes, an extra, stands in front of the theater in a  
beige beret, red heels and a tartan cloak. Big pearl and rhinestone 
earrings glitter from her lobes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother graduated from Douglas High School in 1954, and she  
used to tell me stories about the Royal Theater and going there and 
going to James Brown concerts and the women screaming, and how she 
used to look around in awe because she didn't see what this big 
thing was about this man,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``She passed away three years ago, and I feel like I'm living a  
part of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a part of Levinson's.  
</P>
<P>
	``Liberty Heights'' is the fourth in a series of  
semi-autobiographical movies he's made that have come to be known 
as ``the Baltimore films,'' for the city of his childhood, for the 
city of his dreams. As he did with ``Diner,'' ``Tin Men'' and 
``Avalon,'' the 56-year-old writer-director has left his home in 
Los Angeles to cannibalize his family and childhood friends for the 
stories and characters that come to life in his latest creation. 
</P>
<P>
	And with this new film, Levinson advances his work by  
confronting bigotry and anti-Semitism more directly than he has in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Disclosure,'' ``Bugsy,''  
``Young Sherlock Holmes,'' ``Wag the Dog'' or ``Rain Man,'' which 
won Levinson an Academy Award, the Baltimore films are not star 
vehicles that will gross hundreds of millions of dollars. They are 
heartwarming, character-driven, slice-of-life movies that glory in 
how ordinary people fit into extraordinary times. 
</P>
<P>
	They are made by a man who, in three decades of writing, acting  
and directing in television and film, has made a living at trusting 
his instincts -- and teaching others to trust them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only go by what I know and the stories I tell, and then  
you hope that you connect in some way,'' Levinson says. ``I mean, 
the rhythms, characters, the atmosphere ... 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where I'm the most comfortable for that kind of  
piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Heights is the former Jewish section of Baltimore, where  
Levinson grew up. To hear Levinson describe it, his life has been a 
series of fortunate accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson took it for granted that he'd follow his father into  
the appliance and carpet business, and he never set any clear 
ambitions for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I kind of blundered into various things along the  
way without any kind of real plan,'' says Levinson, clad all in 
black, his mane of gray hair topped by a Baltimore Ravens cap with 
the word ``Fight'' embroidered on the back. ``But I'd go with 
instincts that catch my eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson was not a remarkable student. He stayed up until all  
hours playing cards and hanging out at the Hill Top Diner. He was 
crowned fraternity king two years running at Forest Park High 
School because of his Ricky Nelson good looks and quiet James Dean 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry was just another of the guys who went out with as many  
girls as he possibly could -- trying to get as much off of them as 
he possibly could,'' says Richard Sher, a Baltimore TV newsman who 
hung out at the Hill Top. ``He wasn't a jock. All he was was 
cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sher was co-host of ``People Are Talking,'' a TV show that also  
featured Oprah Winfrey. It was easier to see potential in Winfrey 
than in Levinson, a guy who watched movies on television all night 
and sat around making sex noises into a tape recorder and calling 
it ``adult films for the blind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to say to me when I was working with Oprah, `Did  
you think Oprah was going to go on to do all of this?' I would say, 
`Sure,''' he says. ``But Barry? No. Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Saiontz, another diner rat who went on to become one of  
the city's most successful attorneys, says Levinson didn't appear 
to be serious about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry was so laid back, I used to wonder what he was ever  
going to do with his life,'' says Saiontz, whose experiences were 
the basis for ``... And Justice for All,'' an outrageous satire 
about the judicial system starring Al Pacino. ``I used to worry 
about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He needn't have, says mom Vi Levinson. Mrs. Levinson says her  
son always had his own way of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we moved to Liberty Heights he was, what, first grade I  
think, and I wanted to take him to school. And he's, `No way! No 
way!''' she says, breaking into a throaty chuckle. ``He went by 
himself -- and he found it! Got lost coming home but. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson was always quiet, preferring to sit back and watch  
(``The greatest observer I've ever come across,'' says Mom). But 
when he had something to say, he had the means to say it. 
</P>
<P>
	``One time Barry had to go into the hospital,'' she recalls.  
``He made a painting. I took one look at that painting, I almost 
died. ... You could tell what he was feeling. ... It was all in the 
picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After high school, Levinson enrolled in Baltimore Junior College  
but dropped out after five months. He sold cars and encyclopedias 
for a while, before Paul Newman's ``The Young Philadelphians'' gave 
him the idea that being a lawyer might be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	He cut classes and spent most of his time reading about radio,  
television and film. So he transferred to American University in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then, by accident, I got a job at the television station  
(WTOP in Washington) because a professor took a liking to me in a 
television course that I had,'' he says. ``There was a final and we 
had to do a show and at the last minute I ended up changing 
everything around to make it something completely different. And I 
think he liked the idea that I was willing to kind of gamble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of learning rudimentary editing and watching a  
lot of late-night movies, Levinson gambled again. In 1967, at age 
25, he headed for Hollywood. His mother says he gave himself two 
years to succeed or come home. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson took some acting classes, where he hooked up with  
comedian Craig T. Nelson, who later starred in the TV series 
``Coach.'' They graduated from standup to TV's ``Lohman and Barkley 
Show,'' writing and performing such skits as ``The Lawyers and the 
Pigs'' -- which featured actors deadpanning legalese while holding 
pigs under their arms. 
</P>
<P>
	When his career was just starting to take off, Levinson passed  
up a chance to write for TV's No. 1 ``The Dean Martin Show'' and 
opted to work for ``The Carol Burnett Show,'' No. 19. It paid off. 
Martin was off the air within a year; Levinson went on to win two 
Emmy Awards with Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, it wasn't really gambling. Levinson was following his  
gut. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, Levinson graduated to film writing. He had a  
string of hits with funny man Mel Brooks before collaborating on 
``... And Justice for All'' with Valerie Curtin, who later became 
his first wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Saiontz says Levinson decided to become a director after writing  
1982's ``Best of Friends,'' Levinson's and Curtin's take on the 
union of his Baltimore Jewish background and her Boston upbringing. 
The settings were changed to northern Virginia and Buffalo, and 
none of the jokes between Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn worked the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson's directing debut came with ``Diner,'' the story of a  
bunch of guys who, in spite of their attempts to stay immature and 
irresponsible, learn that life is more than just eating gravy fries 
and trading stories of sexual conquests. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Mason, an old Baltimore buddy who was the inspiration for  
the character in ``Diner'' who was obsessed with music and could 
name the ``B'' side of any 45 record, says ``Diner'' first showed 
Levinson's genius at taking a throwaway memory and weaving it into 
a story that makes you laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being dumb, immature and silly, if you can get through that  
part of your life and move on and reflect back to that and grow out 
of that and yet remember that, what great memories!'' Mason says in 
the hyperbolic screech captured so well in ``Diner'' by actor 
Daniel Stern. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It's a cold November day on the set of ``Liberty Heights.'' Joe  
Mantegna, the biggest name in the ensemble cast for this $20 
million production, is wearing black long johns under his dapper 
blue, self-check silk suit. A drop of condensation clings to the 
tip of Levinson's nose as he watches the crew push-start one of the 
vintage automobiles for the umpteenth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things about doing a period movie -- cars don't  
start,'' he says, chewing on a stick of Juicy Fruit from a 
well-stocked bowl on the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The story is a year in the life of a Jewish family, the year  
Brown v. Board of Education forced the integration of public 
schools. It follows three members of the family and their social 
circles: father Nate (Mantegna), who runs a burlesque as a front 
for a numbers racket; his college-student son, Van (Adrien Brody); 
and his 17-year-old boy, Ben (Ben Foster). 
</P>
<P>
	Ben is based on Levinson's late cousin, Eddie, a wiseacre who  
once dressed up as Hitler for Halloween -- a scene played to great 
hilarity in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie has three parallel story lines. Ben falls in love with  
a black girl at school and finds everyone questioning his motives; 
Van and his buddies try to cross over into the WASP ``promised 
land'' and find it's not as glamorous and cool as they thought; 
Nate and his partners learn that while the law ignores gambling, it 
frowns on blacks and whites doing business together. 
</P>
<P>
	As with ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Levinson uses humor to deal  
with some very serious issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening scene, Ben and his friends are found ogling a  
bikini-clad girl through the fence at the Turkey Point Swim Club. 
But when they reach the gate, they're confronted with a sign that 
says, ``NO JEWS, DOGS OR COLOREDS ALLOWED.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BEN: ``How do you think they decided the order? ... That Jews  
should be first?'' 
</P>
<P>
	SHELDON: ``Yeah. I would have thought it would have been, `Dogs,  
Coloreds, Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BEN: ``That must have been some meeting to come up with that.  
Someone had to say, `No, I have to tell you, the Jews bother me 
more than the dogs.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson says what triggered the story was a review of his  
movie, ``Sphere,'' last year's science-fiction thriller that 
starred Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman 
played a psychologist, but a critic somehow decided that Hoffman 
was playing a ``Jewish psychologist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie `Sphere' has nothing to do with religion and faith  
or anything, so why would you say that?'' he says, the incredulity 
still ringing in his voice. ``And all of a sudden, it very quickly 
made sense to me in terms of what I could do for one of the 
Baltimore stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message of the film is clear -- but subtle.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I love about Barry's script is the fact that without  
hitting people over the head, without proselytizing, he's dealing 
with two major, major issues of the time -- one being anti-Semitism 
and one being racism,'' says actor Richard Kline, a Levinson friend 
who plays Nate's partner, Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
	The film begins and ends with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New  
Year, and the time when the new Cadillac always hit the showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson got the idea after speaking with one of his father's  
friends at Irv Levinson's funeral in 1990. Irv Levinson would get a 
new Caddy every two years, and the friend said he would always 
sneak out of services to check out the new model. 
</P>
<P>
	The script flows like buttermilk, dense and tangy. But Levinson  
hardly takes any credit. He says he just follows the characters 
where they lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think of myself as less of a writer and more of like  
I'm taking dictation. Because the characters, once they come alive 
in my head, they're just carrying on conversations, and I'm just 
trying to keep up with them,'' he says between shots. 
</P>
<P>
	As with ``Diner,'' Levinson took just three weeks to write the  
script for ``Liberty Heights.'' And unlike many directors, Levinson 
knows exactly what he wants by the time he gets to the set. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem you run into is you end up overproducing for  
someone who doesn't know exactly what they want to do,'' says 
executive producer Patrick McCormick, who is working with Levinson 
for the first time. ``(Levinson) doesn't spin a lot of wheels. He 
doesn't overprepare or make people crazy getting things ready that 
then become irrelevant or unused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean the script is a sacred scroll. After a  
scripted scene is over, Levinson will often allow improvisation 
among the actors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't rule with an iron hand,'' says Vince Guastaferro,  
who plays Nate's buddy and numbers partner, Pete. ``He gives the 
actors freedom with the dialogue. He gives us freedom with our 
characters. He even gives us some freedom with the actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the actors are very conscious that this is a piece of  
Levinson's life -- and they respect that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the artist; we're the paint,'' says Charlie Scalies

<HEADLINE> N.H. Teen Charged in Baby's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A 17-year-old girl was charged with  
negligent homicide Wednesday, six days after her newborn daughter 
suffocated shortly after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Philip McLaughlin described the baby girl as  
``substantially full-term.'' She weighed slightly more than 6 
pounds and died a few minutes after birth early Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized the infant's death was not intentional, but said  
``air passages need to be cleared'' in newborns, and that 
apparently did not happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother, Charley Cobb, could face up to seven years in prison  
if convicted. She is scheduled to be arraigned next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miss Cobb was alone when the birth occurred,'' McLaughlin  
said. ``She sought no help and made no noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cobb was staying with her boyfriend's family at the time.  
Her boyfriend and his parents were asleep at the time and did not 
know what was going on, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In explaining the charge, McLaughlin noted that Ms. Cobb  
repeatedly denied being pregnant, never sought prenatal care or 
counseling and gave birth outside a hospital.

<HEADLINE> PGA's Duval Goes for Third Straight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tiger Woods is No. 1 with fans at the  
Phoenix Open, not to mention the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, a scorching round of 59 now on his resume, is  
content with being No. 1 on the money list and golf's hottest 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it's a good thing right now that there's some  
discrepancy between the sentiment of the writers and players and 
the actual rankings because it will focus attention on it to try to 
solve the problem,'' Duval said of this week's list that rates him 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval has won six of his last 25 tournaments since 1997,  
including both times he's played this season. Woods has won one of 
21 PGA events in the same span but retains the top ranking because 
the system is based, among other things, on performances covering 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval closed the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic on Sunday with a 59 --  
a score achieved by only two other players in the history of the 
PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense to me for anybody else other than David  
to be on top,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``I know that's the first name 
I'm going to be looking at to see what score was shot this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval topped last year's money list at $2,591,031 and has earned  
$1,008,000 this year. He has the lowest 1999 scores for nine, 18, 
36, 54, 72 and 90 holes, the widest margin of victory (nine strokes 
in the Mercedes Championships), low start by a winner (67 at the 
Mercedes) and high start by a winner (70 at the Hope). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got all the length, accuracy, irons play, driver,'' Paul  
Stankowski said. ``He has an unbelievable short game, and he's a 
good putter. And now he's got the confidence. He doesn't think 
anybody can beat him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson thinks Woods and Duval have set a standard for  
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to have to compete with that, we're going to  
have to find a way to shoot lower scores,'' Mickelson said. ``How 
do you do that? There's ways besides just ball-striking that you 
have to look at. One of them is conditioning. One would be mentally 
-- how you approach a course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every Phoenix winner of the 1990s will be at the TPC of  
Scottsdale course, although defending champion Jesper Parnevik is 
ailing with a sore neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent champions -- Steve Jones (1997), Mickelson (1996),  
Vijay Singh (1995) and Lee Janzen (1993) -- seem more than capable 
of repeating. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen has won the U.S. Open twice and Jones, who won the U.S.  
Open in 1996, took this event with a 26-under 258 to tie the 
second-lowest, 72-hole score in PGA Tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is in a drought for a player who won twice in his first  
six tries. Duval can relate to that -- he waited 87 tournaments for 
his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
	But he won his last three starts in 1997, four titles last year  
and two this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's flattering towards me as a player to try to be  
anointed as the one who is going to try to challenge Tiger in the 
future years,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, I've played long enough to realize that there's many  
players who are just as able as I am or Tiger Woods is to play and 
win golf tournaments.''

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Papers Get New Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The president and general manager of The  
Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News has been named 
publisher of the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of Dale A. Duncan as publisher was announced  
Tuesday. He has been president and general manager of the papers 
for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeds Eugene S. Pulliam, who died last Wednesday at age  
84. Pulliam had become the publisher when his father, Eugene C. 
Pulliam, died in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dale has the experience and the enthusiasm necessary to lead  
these newsgroups,'' said Louis A. Weil III, chairman, president and 
chief executive officer of Central Newspapers Inc., parent of the 
Star and the News. ``He also has a talented team of managers and 
employees who are dedicated to readers, advertisers and to 
community service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, 44, joined the papers last January after spending 21  
years at Capital Cities/ABC, where he worked his way up from a 
reporter to become a publisher and group executive in the company's 
publishing division. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really going to need to lean on a lot of people,  
particularly in the newsroom, but also throughout the rest of the 
papers and in the community,'' Duncan said of his new role. ``This 
is not a job you can do by closeting yourself in your office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He met with editorial staff members Tuesday before the  
announcement of his promotion. He told them there are no plans 
shutter the News, the afternoon paper, which has been suffering 
declining sales.

<HEADLINE> IOC Bribes Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- More than a year after his city lost its bid to hold  
the 2004 Summer Olympics, the mayor of Rome wants another vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Francesco Rutelli contends that the choice of Athens,  
Greece, is now under a cloud because of the Olympic bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``A panel of IOC experts and athletes gave Rome the No. 1 spot  
on the list of candidates. Until 24 hours before the vote, we were 
in the lead,'' Rutelli said Tuesday. ``And then -- who knows what 
happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the International Olympic Committee ousted six  
members following revelations of corruption in the bidding process, 
Rutelli called for a committee of experts to review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens beat Rome 66-41 in September 1997 in the final round of  
voting for the 2004 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to remove every shadow of doubt  
about the decision,'' he said. ``That would be a move to make clear 
what now is not clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses, scholarships for 
their children and cash payments. In addition to the expulsions, 
three IOC members quit. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials have said Salt Lake City will not be stripped of  
the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Athens has not been specifically targeted by the  
corruption inquiries, the IOC has said it will examine the 
selection process for the games from 1996 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athens won, and I hope Athens won by fair play, but ... if  
there is an independent committee, perhaps the decision could be 
changed and shifted to another city,'' Rutelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Italian members of the IOC told him at the time of  
the 1997 vote that ``many African and Latin American delegates 
changed their votes in the very last hours.'' But the head of 
Rome's bid, Raffaele Ranucci, told the ANSA news agency he didn't 
think the 2004 decision was affected by what he called ``those 
little games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always figured that the Greek capital was being paid  
back for not getting the 1996 Olympics,'' Ranucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy is now trying to land the 2006 Winter Games, with Turin  
considered a notch behind Swiss front-runner Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greece, the president of Hellenic Olympic Committee, Lambis  
Nikolaou, defended his city's 2004 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote is closed,'' Nikolaou said. ``The games were given  
cleanly. The doors are open, the dogs are tied up and they can come 
and examine whatever they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos: ``Nothing can reverse  
the vote taken by the International Olympic Committee. The things 
said by the otherwise thoroughly likable mayor of Rome, I must say, 
are groundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--African sports authorities complained their IOC members were  
unfairly made the focus of the bribery scandal. Six Africans are 
among the nine members expelled or forced to resign and a seventh 
delegate is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lavish gifts were presented at midnight, instead of being  
rolled on a trolley through a hotel lobby at noon,'' said Robert 
Magagula, vice president of Swaziland's Olympic committee. ``That 
happened to all IOC members, not just African members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The opposition faction in Berlin's Senate sent the IOC files  
from the city's 1993 bid for the 2000 Games. Greens leader Judith 
Demba, who called the IOC a ``club of corrupt old men,'' said 
Berlin bidders spent $1.53 million on travel, lodging, car rental, 
gifts and other expenses for 56 IOC members who visited the city. 
</P>
<P>
	She claimed scores of presents exceeded the IOC limit of $150.  
Demba also said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch charged the 
bid committee $3,724 for a domestic air ticket between Stuttgart 
and Berlin that normally would cost one-tenth the sum. 
</P>
<P>
	--Canadian swimmer Mark Tewksbury left his Olympic gold medal on  
a table at a news conference, saying it had lost its meaning 
because of the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an Olympic gold medal, if anyone wants it,'' said  
Tewksbury, who won the 100-meter backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juan Antonio Samaranch should resign ... the entire IOC needs  
to be restructured. I'm here to defend Olympism, to defend the 
movement, not to defend the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Nagano police said IOC visitors received free rides on police  
helicopters during the city's successful bid for the 1998 Games. 
Nagano officials already have said IOC voters were given free trips 
to Kyoto, some IOC officials were entertained by geisha and 
Samaranch received an expensive painting and Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was offered was definitely not excessive -- it was  
normal,'' said Japanese Olympic Committee executive board member 
Chiharu Igaya, also an IOC executive board member. ``In business, 
entertainment is far more extravagant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne angrily denied charges  
that mayor Andrew Young made promises to African IOC members to 
secure the 1996 Summer Games.

<HEADLINE> Poor Kids Not Screened for Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An estimated 400,000 poor children with  
elevated lead levels in their blood were not screened under 
Medicaid and other federal health programs despite federal law that 
requires such testing, congressional investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, about 890,000 children have elevated lead levels,  
and most do not know it, the General Accounting Office concluded in 
a report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a health tragedy. Lead poisoning is a preventable  
disease,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who requested the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that 82 percent of children ages 1 to 5 in federal  
programs were not screened for lead. And high blood levels were 
five times as common for children served by Medicaid, federally 
supported health centers and the Women, Infants and Children 
program. Lower-income children have a greater risk of lead 
poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	The report from the research arm of Congress echoes a similar  
GAO study a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At high levels, lead can cause a variety of debilitating health  
problems, including seizure, coma and even death. At lower levels, 
lead can affect a child's intelligence and ability to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Screening is a critical element in eliminating childhood lead  
poisoning because in most cases there are no obvious symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Screening rates ranged from less 1 percent of Medicaid children  
in Washington state to about 46 percent in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Congress passed legislation requiring lead screening as  
part of Medicaid's special preventive health program for poor 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said Tuesday he would  
reintroduce legislation requiring states to provide a minimum 
number of screenings and establishing penalties for failure.

<HEADLINE> Nation's Mayors Mull Gun Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's big city mayors are rethinking the  
idea of filing a joint, multicity lawsuit to force gun 
manufacturers to reimburse cities for law enforcement and medical 
costs resulting from shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	But they said Wednesday they are pursuing other options --  
including continued negotiations with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Bridgeport, Conn., and the unified Miami-Dade County  
government in Florida on Wednesday joined the growing ranks of 
local governments announcing they will sue gun makers in an attempt 
to recover the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting, mayors  
said the complexities of dealing with a maze of jurisdictions and 
differing state laws made it unlikely they will join in a unified 
lawsuit. When states pressed their successful effort against the 
tobacco industry, each one wound up filing suit individually. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you'll see any large-scale suits because you  
have 50 sets of state laws to deal with,'' Mayor Paul Helmke of 
Fort Wayne, Ind., told a news conference. ``But we have to do 
something to deal with the violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer said several mayors joining in a  
class-action suit against the gun industry ``would have a serious 
impact,'' but he agreed it probably wouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different cities have to examine their own circumstances,''  
Archer said. ``But the bottom line is every mayor wants to make 
their city safer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 280 mayors gathered to discuss hot-button topics such  
as education, strengthening welfare-to-work programs and preparing 
for the 2000 census. But guns took center stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Government statistics show guns were used in 13,262 homicides  
and 18,232 suicides in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, New Orleans and Chicago became the first two major  
cities to sue gun makers seeking to recover the costs of gun 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago suit, which seeks $433 million from the gun  
industry, accuses gunmakers of ``flooding' the city with illegal 
guns, said Mayor Richard M. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	Though crime rates are falling nationwide, Mayor Scott King of  
Gary, Ind., said guns are responsible for nearly 90 percent of the 
homicides in his city. Easy access to the weapons is the problem, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had to bury a police officer and it was the most  
difficult job I've ever had as mayor,'' King said. ``Too many of us 
here have had to bury officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing avenues other than lawsuits, King said, ``We aren't  
closing the door on anything. Some cities might use lawsuits, 
others can negotiate with the manufacturers and others could look 
at new laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the alternatives, mayors said, would be negotiating with  
the industry to take such steps as developing guns that can be 
fired only by their owners, providing gun locks and reducing the 
number of guns manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell, leader of a mayors' gun  
violence task force, has threatened for more than a year to sue gun 
makers while opening negotiations for voluntary concessions to 
limit gun production. He accused gun makers of stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we hear is the usual stuff about, `We need more time to  
examine your proposals,''' Rendell said. ``That's why we need to 
fight this battle on different fronts. We can't put all our eggs in 
the lawsuit basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Adkins, a spokesman for the American Shooting Sports  
Council, Inc., which represents gun makers, blamed the mayors, 
saying they were dragging out negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we thought we had some issues settled, we got a new list  
of demands,'' Adkins said in a telephone interview. ``It's the 
mayors who are playing games here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Bridgeport, Conn., on Wednesday, Mayor Joseph P. Ganim  
announced his city's intention to sue gun makers for more than $100 
million in damages under Connecticut's product liability law. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time in Miami, Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade  
County, Fla., announced a lawsuit demanding that gun makers produce 
childproof weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a $1.5 million federal program to use federal law to  
prosecute all gun cases, dubbed ``Operation Cease Fire,'' will be 
tested in Philadelphia, Rendell announced Monday. All criminals 
convicted of federal gun violations will go to prison for a 
mandatory five years with no possibility of parole. State law 
prosecutions of gun violations usually lead to four-month 
sentences, Rendell said.

<HEADLINE> Torture Laws Focus of Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An international convention prohibiting torture --  
which Chile, Spain and Britain have all signed -- is becoming the 
focal point of arguments in the House of Lords over whether Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet's arrest should stand. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Chilean dictator's lawyers argued Tuesday that the  
International Convention Against Torture doesn't give outside 
nations the automatic right to step in and prosecute officials 
accused of torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Spain, Amnesty International and other human rights  
groups contend it does. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing, which is in its second week, resumes today.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this case will turn on the torture convention almost  
alone,'' said Chief Lord Justice Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords, Britain's highest court, is deciding for the  
second time the fate of the 83-year-old general, who was arrested 
Oct. 16 in London at the request of a Spanish magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Baltasar Garzon wants Pinochet extradited to Spain to face  
charges of murder, torture and kidnapping carried out during his 
17-year-regime. He says Spaniards were among the victims slain 
after Pinochet toppled elected Marxist Salvador Allende in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for Pinochet, contended that Spain  
was acting only under its own national jurisdiction -- and not under 
the auspices of international law. She said that means Pinochet's 
immunity as a former head of state cannot be taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spain must assert it is prosecuting an international crime  
under the rights of international law,'' to strip Pinochet of his 
immunity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She contends that the international convention would make it  
difficult for Spain to do that. While the convention forces nations 
to take a stand against torture, she said the task of prosecuting 
the crime falls to the accused person's home country or an 
international court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Spain argued last week, however, that the convention  
not only gives outside nations the right to intervene, but also the 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous hearing before the House of Lords, the judges  
ruled 3-2 against Pinochet's claim of immunity. But the court 
vacated that ruling after discovering that one of the judges who 
voted against Pinochet had close ties to Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet loses again, an extradition battle will ensue. But  
if the lords uphold a Nov. 25 High Court decision giving him 
immunity, he would be free to return to Chile, where he is 
protected under an amnesty law he passed before relinquishing power 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santiago, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said  
Tuesday that the government is studying the possibility of 
supporting 11 lawsuits filed against Pinochet by relatives of 
victims of repression by his regime, human rights groups and the 
Communist Party.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Takes Custody of 5 Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERETT, Mass. (AP) -- Police who quelled a domestic dispute by  
arresting a husband and wife outside the couple's house said they 
discovered an even more troubling scene inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Five young children were found shivering in the basement of a  
home littered with beer cans, animal feces, rotting food and 
cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The stench -- which could be detected from the street -- was  
overwhelming, said the police officers who first entered the 
building Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just unbelievable,'' said Sgt. Jim Gabriel.  
</P>
<P>
	Two girls and three boys, who range in age from 22 months to 13  
years, were placed with relatives and in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents, Frank and Lorraine Trombetta, face unrelated  
charges in court. Their converted two-family home in a suburb north 
of Boston has been declared unfit for human habitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that the people who were here weren't able to care  
for themselves or for the kids,'' said City Solicitor Bob Jordan, 
who inspected the house Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The house had no electricity, and a kerosene heater was used to  
warm the upstairs rooms. There were no beds, mattresses or toys, 
and the refrigerator contained only moldy condiments, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorraine Carli, a Department of Social Services spokeswoman,  
said the Trombettas had been investigated periodically by the state 
for over a decade, but there were never any allegations of physical 
abuse.

	``It was a family that had a long on-and-off involvement for  
various kinds of neglect issues, but never ones that rose to the 
level that we saw on Friday,'' Carli said.

<P>
	Social workers will conduct an investigation before authorities  
decide whether to file charges related to any alleged neglect.

<HEADLINE> Children's Charity Changes Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A charity that raises money for  
disadvantaged children has agreed to major changes in its 
fund-raising methods following a report that criticized deceptive 
practices at the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of a deal reached Tuesday with the Missouri attorney  
general's office, Children International promised not to use the 
image of a child in advertising when that child's circumstances had 
changed dramatically and he or she was no longer available for 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization, one of the nation's largest child sponsorship  
groups, also agreed to give sponsors greater detail about what a 
child actually receives in exchange for the sponsor's donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office found the emotional appeals of  
Kansas City, Mo.-based Children International were often 
``deceptive'' in nature, inaccurately portraying the plight of 
children assisted by the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's undeniable that there are children all over the world who  
are in great need of charitable help,'' said Attorney General Jay 
Nixon. ``Their circumstances, however, should not be distorted or 
deliberately misconstrued to obtain donations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by Missouri authorities was prompted by an  
extensive Chicago Tribune report published last March that exposed 
problems within child sponsorship charities that raise millions of 
dollars. In some instances, children featured in appeals to donors 
had died and their sponsors were never told. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no concerns raised about the integrity of Children  
International's programs or the benefits provided to our sponsored 
children,'' Children International's president, James Cook, said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon said he never questioned the agency's intentions.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they learned their lesson,'' Nixon said. ``It's a  
group that can do real and substantial good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its investigation, the Tribune also reported on widespread  
problems in three other child sponsorship agencies: Save the 
Children Federation, Childreach and the Christian Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in several other states launched their own inquiries  
into some of the charities' advertising claims and operations, and 
InterAction, an umbrella group of 162 children's charities, adopted 
a new set of tougher standards to make sure that contributions to 
the charities were used as promised.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Seeks To Warm Colorado River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Federal officials are considering a proposal to  
raise the temperature of a stretch of the Colorado River to help a 
fish endangered by cold water releases from a dam near the 
Arizona-Utah state line. 
</P>
<P>
	The humpback chub, named for a hump that helps it navigate river  
rapids, has been endangered since 1967, four years after Glen 
Canyon Dam was built. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has proposed a $15 million  
modification that would draw warmer water from the top of the lake 
created by the dam. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say raising the temperature in the Colorado  
River may benefit the native Arizona fish but should be monitored 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good idea if they pay attention to the equipment and  
shut it down if is not working,'' said Rob Smith, a Southwest 
representative for the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Wirth, spokesman for the Reclamation Bureau in Salt Lake  
City, said the modifications to Glen Canyon would be comparable to 
those installed at the Flaming Gorge Dam in Utah in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	After modifying the Flaming Gorge to raise the temperature in  
the Green River, the bureau documented increases in the numbers of 
endangered and native fish, Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fish are very sensitive to changes in temperature and if we  
can narrow that range, we can increase their survival 
capabilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Water released from Glen Canyon has stayed about 46 degrees, and  
although it warms as it flows downstream, it is considerably colder 
than before the dam was built, Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The humpback chub has been relegated to the warmer Little  
Colorado River, while the non-native rainbow trout has flourished 
in the cold, clear water. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, construction of the new intake structures at Glen  
Canyon could begin next year with completion by 2002, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he is concerned that warmer temperatures may  
encourage non-native species of fish to come upstream. ``They could 
ride a highway that they didn't have before and eat the endangered 
fish,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Storms Should Help Farm's Crops / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- One of the nation's top farm regions  
should be spared serious crop damage by the freaky storm that 
cloaked some regions with snow for the first time in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the winter splash is just the type of weather that  
bodes well for farmers, who had been warned they might get only 
half their 1999 water supply after an unusually long dry spell in 
the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The mix of snow, slush and rain in the southern Central Valley  
early this week was the latest in a spurt of deluges to shower the 
mountains and surrounding foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, which dumped as much as 3 inches of snow in some  
areas of the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley, arrived a 
little more than a month after a mixture of snow and bone-chilling 
temperatures led to a costly crop-killing citrus freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Chilton, supervising manager for the Tulare County  
agricultural commissioner's office, said the damage there was 
limited to some minor limb breakage, mainly in olive trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the citrus freeze last month, no dangerously bitter  
temperatures accompanied this storm, which Chilton characterized as 
``more of a visual event than it is an actual catastrophic event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just nice and pretty, and there's no sign of it today,  
except an occasional snowman,'' he said. ``In the grand scheme of 
things, the damage is minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More important, meteorologists and water gatekeepers say, is  
that such storms continue so that there will be enough water to 
slake the agricultural thirst in the heart of California farm 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went a whole month with zip of precipitation,'' said  
Jeffrey McCracken, spokesman for the U.S. Reclamation Bureau. ``We 
were below normal. But we're catching up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An unusual four weeks of bone-dry weather in the Sierra Nevada  
from mid-December to mid-January left alarmingly low snowpack 
readings. A few areas in the southern Sierras reported no snow as 
recently as a week ago, said Frank Gehrke, chief of snow surveys 
for the state Department of Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until the past week, it was not looking all that good,''  
Gehrke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Basing its projections on those early readings, the U.S. Bureau  
of Reclamation had gloomily projected last week that farmers north 
and south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta might get only 50 
percent of their 1999 water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dry year, the bureau must give fish and wildlife first  
crack at any water banked in reservoirs, as stipulated under the 
federal government's 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement Act. 
That leaves the water allocations to farmers more heavily dependent 
on annual precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pretty much live year-to-year now,'' said Dave Kranz, a  
spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation, the state's 
largest farming lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	But the spate of storms that began Jan. 16 has been pushing  
readings toward and even past normal levels, indicating farmers are 
more likely to get the water they need during the coming growing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, in the northern Sierras, where run-off is critical  
to water supplies, January's index was pushed to 9.4 inches in 12 
days, climbing to 104 percent of the normal monthly reading. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been catching up big time,'' said state meteorologist  
Bill Mork.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise, Halting Two-Day Retreat / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose slightly Wednesday, halting a  
two-day retreat, as new worries about Brazil's economy sent traders 
once more looking to the relative safety of U.S. government 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/16  
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.12 percent from 5.13 percent 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Brazil's currency falling again, worries were renewed that  
the financial crises that have plagued Asia and Russia will spread 
through the Western Hemisphere. As U.S. stock markets also sank, 
edgy traders moved cash back into Treasury bonds, which reversed 
early losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds also gained ground after a smooth auction of two-year  
Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to up 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities rose 
between 1/8 point and 5/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 9.13 
points to 1328.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.46 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.36 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.41 percent, as the discount fell 0.03 
percentage point to 4.27 percent. One-year yields were 4.48 percent 
as the discount was unchanged at 4.29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent from 4.88 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 1/2 Wednesday from 125 3/8. The 
average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Low-Tech Treatment Best for Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Heart attack patients fare best in top-rated U.S. hospitals  
because of a few cheap pills, according to researchers who say all 
clinics should offer prompt treatment with beta blockers and 
aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
	Several studies have shown the benefits of beta blockers, which  
reduce the heart's work load, and aspirin, which thins blood. 
Although medical groups encourage use of the drugs, many hospitals 
and doctors still aren't routinely giving them to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could save a lot of patients' lives if ... that knowledge  
was fully translated to the bedside,'' said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, 
director of the Yale-New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes 
Research and Evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yale center study, reported in today's New England Journal  
of Medicine, tracked the cases of 149,177 Medicare patients 
hospitalized for heart attacks in 1994 or 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The center looked at 60 hospitals that made U.S. News &AMP; World  
Report's list of the best places for cardiac care from 1995-97. At 
those hospitals, 15.6 percent of the Medicare heart attack patients 
died within 30 days, Yale medical student Jersey Chen concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen also studied the results at 766 hospitals that, like the  
top 60 hospitals, had equipment for high-tech surgery to unclog or 
bypass clogged arteries. At those hospitals, 18.3 percent of the 
heart attack patients died in the first month. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 3,846 hospitals without that equipment, mostly rural or  
community hospitals, the rate was 18.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said they were not endorsing the magazine's A-list  
because it weighs hospitals' reputations too heavily. They said 
their study is about how hospitals can improve care, not where 
heart attack patients should seek it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're having a heart attack, you should go to the closest  
hospital'' because prompt treatment is crucial, Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference among hospitals came not from high-tech  
equipment, but the use of everyday drugs, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top-ranked hospitals, 96.2 percent of patients considered  
prime candidates for the blood-thinning abilities of aspirin were 
given the drug. The rate was 88.6 percent at similarly equipped 
hospitals and 83.4 percent at the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of beta blockers followed a similar pattern. At the  
top-ranked hospitals, 75 percent of patients eligible for beta 
blockers, which slow the heart rate, got them. The rate was 61.8 
percent in the next tier and 58.7 percent at the others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hospitals that have less (patient) volume, less  
technology, they should be able to follow these guidelines,'' said 
Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of the American Heart Association. 
``This is simple, cheap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. Marc Klapholz, a cardiologist at the University of  
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, 
said the top hospitals may have more specialists or have more rigid 
policies regarding use of aspirin and beta blockers. 
</P>
<P>
	A related study in today's Journal compared the quality of care  
for Medicare patients at teaching hospitals with the care at 
hospitals not affiliated with medical schools. The study found that 
treatment at teaching hospitals was more expensive, but the 
survival rate was higher. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the 60 hospitals on the U.S. News &AMP; World Report  
lists were teaching hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Clemency Rejected for Okla. Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- The state Pardon and Parole Board  
unanimously rejected clemency Wednesday for a death row inmate 
scheduled to be executed next week for three slayings he committed 
as a 16-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	The board voted 5-0 against clemency for Sean Sellers, 29, who  
is scheduled to die Feb. 4 for the murders of his mother, 
stepfather and a convenience store clerk in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot imagine what I could say today that would cause you  
to have mercy on me,'' he told the board members. ``The only thing 
I know to do is try to show you my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers was four months past his 16th birthday when he shot and  
killed store clerk Robert Bower, 32, on Sept. 8, 1985. Sellers had 
told a companion, ``I want to see what it feels like to kill 
somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 5, 1986, Sellers shot and killed his mother, Vonda  
Bellofatto, 32, and stepfather, Paul Bellofatto, 43, in their 
bedroom shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers, now a Christian involved in outreach ministries from  
his death row cell, once worshipped the occult. At his trial, the 
defense said Sellers was addicted to the game ``Dungeons &AMP; 
Dragons'' and it dictated his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time anyone died for crimes committed at the age of 16  
was April 10, 1959, when Maryland executed Leonard M. Shockley. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, 12 people have  
been put to death for crimes committed at age 17, said Richard 
Deiter, executive director of the National Death Penalty 
Information Center, an anti-capital punishment organization in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, death rows now hold 16 offenders who murdered when  
they were 16 years old and 54 more who committed their crimes at 
age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	No family members spoke in support of Sellers at the three-hour  
clemency hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point as he spoke, Sellers' uncle, Steve Bellofatto, told  
him: ``Stop begging. Take the punishment.''

<HEADLINE> Annual World Economic Forum Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Top finance officials from the United  
States, Europe, Latin America and Asia will grapple with global 
economic issues in the six-day annual World Economic Forum 
beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Brazil crisis continuing, financial markets are  
expected to be watching discussions on the global and regional 
economic problems involving key officials from the Group of 7 
industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday will feature global economic forecasts by U.S. Deputy  
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers; French Finance Minister 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn; Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the 
exchequer; and Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister of finance. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will appear at the forum,  
as will U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who is to meet with Russian 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. South African President Nelson 
Mandela also is among the speakers, as are actress Jane Fonda and 
media mogul Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the meeting, which attracted 1,600 leaders in  
government, business and other fields, have titled this year's 
session, ``Responsible Globality: Managing the Impact of 
Globalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Participants'' -- companies pay thousands of dollars for the  
privilege of sending their top brass -- can choose from an array of 
simultaneous discussions day and night. 
</P>
<P>
	Davos' top restaurants have laid in heaps of lobster, caviar and  
champagne for the meetings in and around the 29th annual gathering. 
The event is a windfall for the resort, bringing in an estimated $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers will talk about the ``Outlook for the U.S. Economy'' and  
there will be similar sessions on the impact of the new European 
currency or prospects for Asia and other regions. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union central bankers and finance ministers will  
discuss the operation of the European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has been given pride of place this year, with President  
Roman Herzog to be the keynote speaker Thursday. Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder has his own session on an unannounced topic Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad is appearing,  
although he has said he won't meet with financier George Soros or 
Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, with whom he has public disagreement 
over the causes of the financial problems of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists and academics will also hold forth on topics ranging  
from fighting jet lag or ``building the creative workplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chairman Bill Gates will be back to talk about ``best  
practices in going global.'' Turner is to speak on ``You can't take 
it with you: making philanthropy more effective.'' And Fonda is 
down for a discussion on whether nation states can solve global 
problems like drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jim Abbott found a new home Wednesday with the  
Milwaukee Brewers and Carlos Baerga signed with the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott agreed to a $600,000, one-year contract and will take his  
comeback to the National League, where the one-handed pitcher will 
have to bat for the first time since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, whose career slumped the last three years, agreed to a  
$1.25 million, one-year deal with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, left-hander Mike Magnante agreed to a one-year contract  
with the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Among players in arbitration, left-hander Sterling Hitchcock and  
the San Diego Padres agreed to a $15.5 million, three-year 
contract, and left-hander Omar Daal and the Arizona Diamondbacks 
settled on a $6.75 million, two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, a 31-year-old left-hander, was 5-0 with a 4.55 ERA for  
the Chicago White Sox last year in five late-season starts after a 
successful stint in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about it,'' Abbott said. ``I'm looking  
forward to swinging the bat. I hope I can hold my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott was 2-18 with the Angels in 1996, then retired after a  
poor spring training the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The novelty of my playing I think has long since passed, and  
I'm as accountable as the next guy down the line. I have to go out 
there and do well,'' Abbott said. ``And if I can go out there and 
give my team a chance to win, pick up the innings, that's how you 
gain respect, not by my switching the glove and all that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who retired after a poor spring training in 1997, gets a  
$400,000 base salary and the chance to earn $200,000 in performance 
bonuses. The pitcher and the team have a $1.5 million mutual option 
for 2000 with a $200,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, coming off a $21.4 million, six-year contract, gets a $1  
million salary, which will be increased to $1.25 million if he's on 
the opening day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, a switch hitter, was a three-time All-Star with  
Cleveland but his production has dropped off sharply since he was 
traded to the New York Mets in 1996. He hit .266 last year with 
seven homers and 53 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlos is an experienced, quality infielder who gives us good  
offensive potential at second base and versatility from both sides 
of the plate,'' Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis considered signing Pat Meares, let go last month by  
Minnesota, and moving him from shortstop to second base. Meares was 
seeking about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Magnante, 33, pitched for the Houston Astros last season, going  
4-7 with a 4.88 ERA and two saves in 48 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock gets a $3 million signing bonus, $2.5 million this  
year and $5 million in each of the next two seasons. He was 9-7 
with a 3.93 ERA during the regular season and 3-0 with a 1.23 ERA 
in four postseason starts with 32 strikeouts in 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a desire to play closer to home than all the  
way across the country, but I'm very comfortable in San Diego,'' 
said Hitchcock, who lives in Florida and was eligible for free 
agency after the 1999 season. ``Certainly, I think it showed what 
kind of baseball town it is with I don't know how many nights of 
60,000-plus attendance. It's a hard place to turn down to play when 
the club shows it's serious about keeping you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daal gets a $250,000 signing bonus, $2.5 million this season and  
$3.5 million in 2000. Arizona has a $5.5 million option for 2001 
with a $500,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan left-hander, who turns 27 on March 1, was 8-12  
last season with a 2.88 ERA, the fifth best in the NL. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Down Down 36.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were lower at midday after giving  
up substantial early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 36.04 at 9,288.54, after shooting as high as 9,385.60, up 61 
points, on a burst of computerized buy programs in the first 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow added 121.26 to 9,324.58, leaving it 318  
points shy of its closing record of 9,643.32 on Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes were lower but trimming their losses. The  
Nasdaq composite was down 0.77 at 2,432.64, after rising as high as 
2464.12, up 30 points, in the first hour, then dipping nearly 9 
points before swinging back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was off 1.35 at 1,250.96,  
after giving up a gain of 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks rose at the open after Amazon.com released a  
smaller-than-expected loss and eBay's earnings beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon shares were up 17 19/32 at 132 11/16, while eBay's were  
up 89 1/8 at 310. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``technology stocks have slowed down a little bit,'' said  
Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago. 
``The number one question for the bulls is, do they have the fire 
power to fulfill widespread expectations?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nie said that while volume was impressive Tuesday at over 1  
billion shares on the Big Board, he was concerned that the number 
of rising shares barely beat decliners. ``We need dynamic breadth 
in this market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today on the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues  
outnumbered decliners by a 11-to-7 margin on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume came to 408.59 million shares, up from 
Tuesday's pace of 358.36 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow components were led lower by IBM, down 3 13/16 at 181 13/16,  
and J.P. Morgan, down 1 at 103 1/4. Financial services stocks were 
generally lower on concerns about Brazil, where the currency was 
taking another big hit today. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks, however, were higher. Dow component Merck was up  
13/16 at 144 13/16.

<HEADLINE>  Bigger U.S. Balkan Role Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Pledging to step up U.S.  
intervention in the Balkans, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said Wednesday she was exploring a combination of military and 
political pressure to force a settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Assured the NATO allies are ready to issue a serious warning to  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to settle with ethnic 
Albanians in the Serbian province, Albright is meeting Friday in 
London with five foreign ministers ``to help implement this 
strategy,'' her spokesman, James P. Rubin, announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Clinton administration officials said the aim was to force  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to give ethnic Albanians in 
the Serbian province maximum control of their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	An official said Milosevic would be given no more than a matter  
of weeks to come to terms with Kosovo's ethic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having achieved agreement with our allies on a strategy aimed  
at resolving the crisis in Kosovo by combining diplomacy with a 
credible threat of force,'' Albright has agreed to meet with 
foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, 
Rubin said in a statement. The six comprise the so-called ``Contact 
Group'' dealing with problems involving republics of former 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 lives have been lost in an 11-month conflict  
between Serb forces and Albanian separatists. Last October, 
Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and to withdraw Serb troops and 
special police units from the province, which he is determined to 
keep in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the troops and police have returned to Kosovo, thousands  
of ethnic Albanians have been displaced, there are reports of 
massacres of civilians, and Belgrade refuses to allow war crimes 
investigators to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously have been concerned about the deteriorating  
situation in Kosovo and a need to act quickly,'' Albright said at a 
news conference in Cairo, Egypt, before flying to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been working to try to quicken some political solution  
there and also keep in mind what can be done through military 
pressure and the threat of the use of force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week in Moscow, Albright failed to reverse Russian  
opposition to NATO's bombardment of the Serbs without the U.N. 
Security Council's approval. But Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
joined with her in a statement demanding maximum self-rule for 
ethnic Albanians and the arrest of Serb officers near Racak, a site 
where 45 Albanian civilians were killed two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity,  
said other hurdles remain apart from Russia's resistance to a NATO 
attack. These include the need for a decision by the 16 NATO 
nations at a meeting Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, to issue a 
clear warning to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Some allies want a commitment from the United States to  
contribute ground troops for a NATO peacekeeping operation that 
would follow a cease-fire, if reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Albright and Sandy Berger, the U.S. national security  
adviser, this week held open the possibility President Clinton 
might approve a U.S. deployment if a political settlement comes 
into place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians also could pose a problem. While Albright is  
promoting an enhanced version of the self-rule that Milosevic 
nullified 10 years ago, she is not supporting secession from 
Yugoslavia that many of them seek. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Albright and other senior administration  
officials are ratcheting up their rhetoric on the military option. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more credible the threat, the more likely that we can  
succeed in the political objectives,'' State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stressed that both the United States and its allies are  
``trying to get more involved in getting a political settlement'' 
to the conflict between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	One U.S. official said Albright was driven by fear that the  
Kosovo situation will get worse when winter gives way to spring in 
the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving Washington on Sunday, Albright has had several  
telephone discussions with the British, German, French, Dutch and 
Italian foreign ministers, as well as with Ivanov directly. 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to wind up the Middle East portion of her overseas  
trip Thursday and go to London to talk to British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook and to Paris for a meeting with French Foreign Minister 
Hubert Vedrine before Friday's meeting in London.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Profits Down 87 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Slumping sales and restructuring costs  
at Nabisco Holdings Corp. pushed fourth-quarter net income down 87 
percent, the company reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The international manufacturer of cookies, snacks and other  
grocery products said earnings for the October-December quarter 
fell to $19 million, or 7 cents per share, from $146 million, or 54 
cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any extraordinary charges, net income was 50 cents,  
beating a First Call Corp. estimate of 49 cents a share. Nabisco's 
stock rose $1.56 1/4, or 4 percent, to $40 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales slipped 9.3 percent, to $2.21 billion from $2.44 billion a  
year earlier. However, the company noted that for its ongoing 
businesses, sales would have risen 3 percent after adjusting for 
foreign exchange rates and the different number of selling days in 
the two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Nabisco reported a loss of $71 million, or 27  
cents per share, compared with a 1997 profit of $405 million, or 
$1.51 per share. Sales also were down for the year, declining 3.8 
percent to $8.40 billion from $8.73 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income plunged 63 percent for the quarter and 73  
percent for the year, mainly because of $530 million in charges for 
restructuring programs begun in June and December of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We enter 1999 in a greatly strengthened position with good  
momentum,'' said president and chief executive officer James M. 
Kilts, just ending his first year at Nabisco's helm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have strengthened our core brands in biscuits, other snacks  
and most of our specialty food categories,'' while lowering costs 
and better using company assets, Kilts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biscuit company sales, including core cookie brands such as  
Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Nutter Butter, were flat at $3.54 billion for 
1998 but down 2 percent for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco said ongoing businesses in its U.S. Foods Group actually  
increased sales 3 percent to $2.05 billion in 1998 behind record 
growth for Planters nuts and snacks, as well as solid gains for A1 
steak sauce, hot cereals and pet snacks. However, the division's 
total sales fell because the company sold off its College Inn 
broths, margarine and Egg Beaters businesses in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	International sales were down 4.6 percent for the fourth  
quarter, but rose 1 percent after adjusting for unfavorable 
currency rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco also makes Ritz and Air Crisps crackers, A1 steak sauce  
and Grey Poupon mustard.

<HEADLINE> Unlikely Suspects in Calif. Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- She wore a Spice Girls T-shirt, her  
blonde hair cut in a conservative bob. His striped sweater was 
clean and neat. Detectives figured the pair who allegedly pulled 
off two armed robberies weren't run-of-the-mill criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	But even they were surprised to learn the suspects were students  
at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and their alleged 
getaway driver an elementary school teaching aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Emma Rose Freeman, 18, a National Merit Scholar, is accused of  
pointing a .380-caliber Beretta semiautomatic handgun at a 
terrified stylist while robbing a hair salon on Jan. 16 with her 
boyfriend Anthony Louis Christophani, a senior philosophy major. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days later when a security guard at a Costco warehouse  
store asked to see receipts for a boom box and Walkman-like stereo 
system, she allegedly turned to him with the gun and said: ``Back 
off. Don't do anything stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, it was Miss Freeman who shook with fear as a judge  
warned that she faces a long prison sentence if convicted of the 
two armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	Christophani and Craig Dickson, 23-year-old roommates, posted  
bail earlier on the same charges. But Judge Heather Morse raised 
Miss Freeman's bail from $25,000 to $150,000 as prosecutors filed 
additional charges of brandishing the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated,'' her mother, Linda Freeman, told the Santa  
Cruz Sentinel from their home in Southern California. ``This is a 
girl who was a National Merit Scholar. Her only offense was to 
brake for a squirrel. Then there was a total change after she went 
to college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Cruz police Sgt. Steve Clark said Miss Freeman had told  
detectives that she needed money so ``she could concentrate on her 
art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as she clutched tissues in her shaking hands, Miss Freeman  
told the judge Wednesday she had taken out student loans to pay her 
college tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were checking to see if the three match descriptions of  
suspects in crimes in neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get that many cases involving UCSC students,''  
prosecutor Gretchen Brock said. ``I imagine that's because they're 
usually busy studying instead of getting into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said officers suspected that the robbers, who had taped a  
piece of paper over the license plate of their getaway car, might 
be college students ``just because of their demeanor and their 
dress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Fox, Miss Freeman's court-appointed attorney, said he  
thought the judge brought up the prison time to scare his client. 
But he said ``there is a serious, real prospect that she will serve 
some time in state prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State law mandates prison sentences for anyone who uses a gun  
during a crime. Miss Freeman faces up to 26 years in prison if 
convicted, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers made the arrests late Friday based on sketches of the  
suspects and a description of their getaway car, which was traced 
to Dickson. The gun was registered to Christophani. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials said they are considering suspending or  
expelling Miss Freeman and Christophani, who was just months away 
from graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This girl had such great prospects,'' Fox said. ``She's  
intelligent, attractive. If you're to picture your average armed 
robber, you wouldn't picture this young woman.''

<HEADLINE> Daal Gets $6.75M Deal With D-Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- After spending tens of millions of dollars to  
sign three big-name free agent starters, the Arizona Diamondbacks 
are forking over a few more million to keep one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Omar Daal, perhaps the biggest surprise for the  
expansion Diamondbacks last season, agreed Wednesday to a $6.75 
million, two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan left-hander, who turns 27 on March 1, was 8-12  
with the Diamondbacks and had the National League's fifth-best ERA 
at 2.88. 
</P>
<P>
	``Omar is one of the players from the expansion draft who really  
made the most of the opportunity that expansion afforded him,'' 
Diamondbacks general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``Given the 
chance to start on a regular basis, he showed he was capable of 
holding his own against the better pitchers in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daal was the only Diamondback to file for salary arbitration and  
a hearing had been scheduled for next month. Garagiola was pleased 
that the franchise could avoid arbitration for the second straight 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy because it's a tough process,'' Garagiola said.  
``It's tough to go through it and have everybody come out on the 
other side without hurt feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daal, who earned $575,000 last season, receives a $250,000  
signing bonus. He will get $2.5 million in 1999 and $3.5 million in 
2000. The contract includes a third year at the club's option with 
a salary of $5.5 million and a $500,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 salary and the option year figure can go higher if Daal  
performs at a certain level next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that we offered the contract that we did and  
ultimately did the deal that we did is a good indication of the 
high regard we have for him,'' Garagiola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal is penciled in as the fourth or fifth starter in what  
potentially is one of the league's best rotations after Arizona's 
offseason signings of free agents Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre 
and Armando Reynoso. 
</P>
<P>
	With Andy Benes and Brian Anderson also back from last year's  
team, the Diamondbacks have six starters going into next month's 
start of spring training. However, Anderson is considered a likely 
candidate to be traded as Arizona looks for more offensive help. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona selected Daal with the second choice of the second round  
of the expansion draft. He had pitched for Toronto, Montreal and 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, mostly as a reliever, since 1993 with an 
overall career record in the majors of 20-23. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal began last season in the bullpen, but moved into the  
starting rotation when Joel Adamson was hurt. He went on to become 
the best Arizona pitcher for much of the season, even though he 
often was the victim of a lack of run support, losing 1-0 and 2-1 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got tremendous control. He can throw the curve ball for a  
strike pretty much anywhere in the count,'' Garagiola said. ``His 
won-loss record was certainly not indicative of how well he 
pitched. He was definitely the guy in the wrong place at the wrong 
time a lot, in terms of run support.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soccer Adds Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Defenders Carlos Llamosa and midfielder Brian  
Kamler were added Wednesday to the U.S. roster for the Feb. 6 
exhibition game against Germany, giving D.C. United seven players 
on the Americans' 20-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Arena, the former coach of D.C. United, was hired last  
fall as coach of the national team. Since his hiring, the U.S. team 
has played scoreless ties against Australia and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Also added to the roster were a pair of midfielders who play in  
Germany, Frankie Hejduk of Bayer Leverkusen and Tony Sanneh of 
Hertha Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Defender Gregg Berhalter of Cambuur Leeuwarden in the  
Netherlands and midfielder Clint Mathis of the Los Angeles Galaxy -- 
both on the roster for Sunday's game at Bolivia, were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamler is joining the national team for the first time. Llamosa  
missed the Bolivia game, serving a one-game suspension for his 
ejection against Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, the defending European champion, pounded the Americans  
2-0 last June in the World Cup opener for both teams. Following the 
Feb. 6 game at Jacksonville, the Germans play an exhibition game 
against Colombia at Miami on Feb. 9.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Archambeau Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Defensive end Lester Archambeau and  
fullback Brian Kozlowski, hampered by sprained ankles, returned to 
practice Wednesday for the Atlanta Falcons and are expected to play 
in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Archambeau (left ankle) and Kozlowski (right ankle) were held  
out of Monday's practice as a precaution. After an off day, they 
were back on the field for the 2-hour, 15-minute workout at the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Archambeau, who led the Falcons with 10 sacks, moved well along  
the defensive line in his first practice since injuring his ankle 
in the NFC championship game on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozlowski, bothered by his injury for several weeks, displayed  
no apparent problem running or carrying out his blocking 
assignments. The 6-foot-3, 255-pounder was shifted from tight end 
to fullback after Bob Christian sustained a season-ending knee 
injury with two weeks left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say, if there are no complications, Kozlowski will be  
probable,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``And if Lester doesn't have any 
(complications), we'll move him from questionable to probable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons practiced three times last week at their training  
complex in Suwanee, Ga. They will complete their preparations for 
Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos with two more workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we practiced good,'' Reeves said. ``The tempo was  
good, the communication was good, all the things you look for were 
good. I mean, you've got mistakes, but that's what practice is for. 
If you didn't have that, you could just go out and play on Sunday 
and not worry about practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some things to correct, but if we keep concentrating  
the way we did today, then I hope by Sunday we'll have them 
minimized.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of statement by presidential attorney Greg Craig outside  
the Senate, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republican managers have failed to make their case to  
remove the president, because on the basis of the law, the facts 
and the Constitution, there simply is no case. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's events make clear that the votes are not there to  
convict and remove the president from office. Any proceedings from 
this date forward only serve to delay the final resolution of this 
matter and run counter to the best interests of the Congress, the 
presidency and the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	We remain convinced that the national interest is best served by  
ending the process in a way that is fair, speedy and bipartisan, so 
all of us can return to the business, and the vital business, of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.

<HEADLINE> Incidentals of Pope's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II, who during his visit to St.  
Louis repeatedly called for racial harmony, met briefly Wednesday 
with civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff shook hands with the 85-year-old Mrs. Parks at the  
Cathedral Basilica after an evening prayer service, and the two 
exchanged a few words. John Paul patted her hand as they parted. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting had originally been scheduled to take place at the  
home of Archbishop Justin Rigali. It wasn't clear why the site was 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Mrs. Parks, a black seamstress, was arrested for  
refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus, touching off the 
Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott -- one of the earliest battles of the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks now lives in Detroit.  
</P>

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Serving Communion to nearly 100,000 people  
during the papal Mass at the Trans World Airlines Dome turned out 
to be no problem for the St. Louis Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pope John Paul II served Communion to cardinals and  
bishops, about 900 priests and deacons spread throughout the dome 
during Wednesday's Mass to offer Communion to Roman Catholics who 
waded their way through stadium seats and climbed up bleacher 
stairs to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine wasn't offered because of the crowd was too big.  
</P>
<P>
	Ushers wearing yellow aprons and holding yellow and white  
umbrellas were strategically placed to draw people to the nearest 
Communion station. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was probably the first and last time I'll ever go to  
Communion under an umbrella,'' said Larry Keshner of Godfrey, Ill. 
``But at least it was under the umbrella of the pope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Communion lasted slightly longer than the 15-minutes the Vatican  
gave organizers to complete it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloistered nuns in three St. Louis convents baked the 131,000  
Communion wafers for the event. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The evening before the papal jet landed in  
St.Louis from Mexico a pope look-alike in white flowing robes and 
skullcap arrived in a black limousine at Mike Shannon's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Waitress Rowena Taberly reported that the man ``dined with an  
entourage of pseudo-Secret Service agents in dark suits with tiny 
wires stuck in their left ears and disappearing down their 
collars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two women in a booth nearby were totally taken in by the prank.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, look,'' the waitress heard one of them say. ``The pope is  
eating french fries. Do you think that's healthy?''

<HEADLINE> Honor Student Charged in Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKLEY, Mich. (AP) -- A high school honor student and gymnast in  
this Detroit suburb has been charged with armed robbery and is a 
suspect in several others, allegedly to support a heroin habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Plumb, 16, is in a juvenile lockup, awaiting trial as an  
adult on charges that could land her a life prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of the stickups, the robber said she had a weapon but did  
not show it, police said. Michigan law requires only the threat of 
a weapon for an armed-robbery conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Howard Arnkoff said Ms. Plumb should have been  
handled as a juvenile and should have been charged with something 
less than armed robbery, since no weapon was displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she gets convicted, its a non-probational offense. She must  
be incarcerated. She must be sent to prison. And I seriously doubt 
she could get the help she needs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said she had a $200-a-day heroin habit -- a figure one  
expert said was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty chronic stage of their addiction. Generally,  
clients buy in $10 increments,'' said Bruce Goldberg, a therapist 
at Botsford General Hospital's Eastwood Clinic who said Ms. Plumb 
likely was sharing the drug with other people. 
</P>
<P>
	News of her arrest shocked the low-crime community of 16,000  
that typically only has a half dozen stickups each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very scary,'' said Berkley High School spokeswoman and  
media instructor Gwen Ahearn. ``The kids were surprised about the 
heroin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, hard drugs are few and far between,'' Detective  
Sgt. Ray Anger said Wednesday. ``Possibly a couple other kids are 
users of serious drugs, but I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though she denies committing the robberies, Ms. Plumb admits she  
is a heroin addict. She was arrested Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	She told police she began using the drug at 14 when a co-worker  
at a pizza parlor introduced her and her boyfriend to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, she got caught cashing a forged check stolen from the  
high school and confessed she was using the money to buy heroin, 
Anger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robberies began last month, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	About 6 p.m. on Dec. 2, wearing a skull Halloween face mask, she  
allegedly entered an Amoco station next to the high school and told 
the 17-year-old clerk -- a fellow student -- that she had a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plumb made off with $300, then went to her gymnastics team  
practice, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	She later tried to rob a BP station in Royal Oak on Dec. 14,  
then robbed a beer and wine store in Berkley the same day, a 
pizzeria in Clawson on Dec. 15 and another pizzeria in Southfield 
on Dec. 16, Anger said. She has not been charged in those holdups. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend tipped police to Ms. Plumb as a suspect in the first  
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest created such a buzz among Berkley High School's 1,300  
students Wednesday that the administration took to the PA system to 
discourage rumor-mongering about it.

<HEADLINE> Jack Nicklaus Has Hip Replaced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The next time Jack Nicklaus makes one of his revered runs at  
Augusta National, he'll be doing it on a ceramic left hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, had hip replacement surgery Wednesday in Boston  
and will be on crutches for the next six weeks. He will miss the 
Masters for the first time in 40 years and possibly the U.S. Open 
in June, but the doctor who operated on him said there was no 
reason to believe Nicklaus would not be competitive again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went well,'' Benjamin E. Bierbaum, head of  
orthopedic surgery at New England Baptist Hospital, said after the 
1-hour, 45-minute operation. ``No complaints. No surprises. I was 
pleased with how everything came along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 professional majors, had a  
degenerative left hip that had troubled him for years. He tried to 
avoid hip replacement surgery with a rigorous exercise routine, but 
finally yielded when the hip began to affect his quality of life as 
well as his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus was resting Wednesday afternoon and unavailable to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bierbaum said he was in good spirits after the surgery -- and  
before. Nicklaus told the doctor as the procedure was getting 
started, ``I would rather be one down walking up the 18th fairway 
in Augusta than be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery will give him that chance.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very much looking forward to what it can do for me down  
the road,'' Nicklaus told Golf.com last week. ``For the last three 
to four months ... I haven't been able to do much of anything. I'm 
not used to that. That's not the way I've lived my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing on one leg, essentially, for several  
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus agreed to use a ceramic replacement as part of a study  
directed by Bierbaum and involving 10 hospitals. Ceramic is 
smoother than materials typically used in hip implants and is 
believed to last longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will remain in the hospital for six days before  
returning home to Florida. Bierbaum said Nicklaus would be on 
crutches for six weeks so the bone and soft tissue could heal. 
After that, he would go through a strengthening, flexibility and 
agility program that could take at least six more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking around three months until he is able to hit some  
golf balls,'' Bierbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Nicklaus opted for hip surgery now was to make sure  
he could play in 2000, when the majors are played on courses that 
Nicklaus helped make famous -- Pebble Beach, where he won the U.S. 
Open in 1972; St. Andrews, where he won two of his three British 
Opens; and Valhalla outside Louisville, designed by Nicklaus and 
later bought by the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Nicklaus is not ruling out the rest of 1999. Bierbaum  
estimated the recovery would take at least six months, but Nicklaus 
has said he would like to be ready for his own tournament the first 
week in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to try to get back before the Memorial Tournament  
and try to play there,'' Nicklaus said last week in Monterrey, 
Calif., where he is designing a new course. ``If not, maybe the 
Open right after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hip problems, Nicklaus became the oldest player to  
finish in the top 10 in the Masters last April when he thrilled the 
Augusta gallery yet again with a final-round 68 to tie for sixth. 
But he was hobbling so badly in the summer that he pulled out of 
the British Open, ending his streak of 146 consecutive majors. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time Nicklaus has missed the Masters  
since 1958, four years before he turned pro and began one of the 
greatest careers in golf.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet can  
now toast him and at the same time help him pay his mounting legal 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	A new cabernet sauvignon named Capitan General -- the former  
dictator's army rank in Spanish -- went on sale Wednesday. Proceeds 
will go to Pinochet's legal defense fund in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The fundraising effort was the brainchild of the Corporation of  
Friends of the Fatherland, a right-wing group, to help Pinochet 
with legal bills which have already surpassed $1 million, according 
to press reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine is bottled by Vitivinicola Los Reyes, a local vineyard.  
Officials say production will be limited. Bottles can only be 
purchased by telephone for $22 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet has been under police guard in London since Oct. 16,  
fighting Spanish efforts to bring him to trial for human rights 
abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship.

	The temblors of 4.2 and 3.3 magnitude hit two small towns  
outside the city of Barquisimeto, 170 miles southwest of Caracas.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) - A volcano in northern Nicaragua near a  
town which President Clinton plans to visit next month is showing 
signs of turning active, a government organization said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Territorial Studies Institute said the frequency of tremors  
emitted by the Telica Volcano has increased five-fold since Sunday 
-- from around 100 miniquakes a day to some 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the miniquakes indicate activity inside the mountain,  
Telica has not emitted gases or shown any sign of erupting, the 
institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telica, 65 miles northwest of Managua, is close to the Casitas  
Volcano, the site of a massive landslide caused by Hurricane Mitch 
on Oct. 30, killing an estimated 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are near the town of Posoltega, which Clinton is scheduled  
to visit briefly Feb. 10 during a seven-hour stopover in Nicaragua 
while touring Mexico and Central America. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The U.N. World Food Program has  
announced a two-year $73 million aid program to help victims of 
Hurricane Mitch in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will start in May and supplements a six-month,  
$60-million aid program implemented in November, the agency said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Roque, the agency's regional director for Latin  
America, said it will take years for Central American nations to 
recover from the damage caused by the hurricane, which struck in 
late October and early November, killing thousands and causing 
billions in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Honduras, which suffered the worst damage, will receive $38  
million in aid and Nicaragua $25 million. El Salvador and Guatemala 
will receive $5 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency estimates the aid will help more than 2 million  
hurricane victims.

	The tourism office of Quintana Roo state is launching a $22,500  
ad campaign aimed at quelling ``improper behavior'' by students, 
the state's tourism undersecretary, Orlando Alpuche said, according 
to the government news agency Notimex. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems typically crop up when some businesses sell alcohol to  
underage tourists -- Mexico's legal drinking age is 18 -- or organize 
raucous events such as wet T-shirt contests, Notimex said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japan Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar drifted slightly higher against the yen  
today amid a fresh reiteration of China's official commitment to 
maintain the yuan's value. Tokyo stock prices rose for the third 
consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 68.05 points,  
or 0.47 percent, closing the session at 14,450.06. On Tuesday, the 
average rose 173.20 points, or 1.22 percent, on top of Monday's 
54.41-point rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 113.82 yen, up 0.26  
yen from its level late Tuesday in Tokyo and unchanged from its 
late New York level overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	China's central bank chief, Dai Xianglong, repeated today his  
government's pledge to maintain a stable yuan through the end of 
this year. Earlier this week, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said the 
yuan would remain stable in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai's comments resulted in a brief spurt of yen buying against  
the dollar, sending the greenback as low as 113.45 yen. But 
short-covering by interbank players pushed the dollar back towards 
it daily high of 113.94 yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.59 yen, down  
from 131.82 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks started moderately higher but soon turned mixed on  
a retreat of major bank issues. The market regained upward momentum 
in the afternoon on buying of high technology issues, including 
Hitachi, Kyocera and NEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been propped up in recent days by bank shares,  
which have been boosted by reports of mergers and alliances between 
Japanese banks and stepped up efforts to write off bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 416  
million shares, down from Tuesday's turnover of 499 million shares. 
Despite the Nikkei's gains, declines slightly outnumbered advances 
559 to 557, with 188 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 5.49 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,115.37. The 
TOPIX closed up 11.17 points, or 1.02 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.810 percent from 1.715 percent late 
Tuesday, driving its price down to 99.91 yen from 100.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> Another Comeback for Suns' Manning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- One severe knee injury can endanger a career. A  
second one and you're almost certainly through. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Manning is coming back from his third torn anterior  
cruciate ligament, his third reconstructive surgery, his third 
excruciating rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard of anyone that's still playing who's done  
two, let alone three,'' Phoenix Suns coach Danny Ainge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning was college basketball's player of the year while  
leading Kansas to the 1988 national championship and was the No. 1 
pick in the NBA draft. Then, in his rookie season with the Los 
Angeles Clippers, the first serious knee injury occurred, followed 
by another in 1995 and a third last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Manning, 32 years old and entering his 11th NBA season,  
refuses to feel sorry for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not jinxed,'' he said. ``If anything, I think I'm paving  
the way for other athletes who blow their knees out one or two or 
three times, showing it can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tore his right ACL in a game against Milwaukee in 1989 and  
missed 56 games. 
</P>
<P>
	In February of 1995, his first season with Phoenix, he tore his  
left ACL in practice. He played in just 46 games that year and 33 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Relegated to a reserve role in 1996-97, Manning averaged 13.5  
points a game. Last year, he averaged 13.5 points and 5.6 rebounds 
off the bench before his right ACL snapped in a game against 
Sacramento on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was finally getting back to playing the way I want to  
play,'' he said. ``That doesn't have anything to do with the leg. 
It had to do with confidence and just getting out on the court and 
getting a feel for it again. That was the most upsetting part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Sixth Man Award as the league's top reserve, and one  
day after receiving the trophy underwent surgery again. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the summer and fall, there were long hours in Manning's  
weight room at home. By late fall, he was back on the basketball 
court, but the NBA wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lockout worked wonders for me,'' he said. ``It allowed me  
to do a lot of extra work in the weight room and come out on the 
court and get a feel for it again. I played last season. I missed 
the playoffs, but I'm back for training camp. It just seems like a 
regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Manning has looked as good as ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``Danny looks wonderful,'' teammate Jason Kidd said. ``Danny  
looks like someone who hasn't had a knee injury. He's running up 
and down the floor, dunking the ball. He's doing everything Danny 
has done in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning and Kidd have been chosen team captains by a vote of  
their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning took a big pay cut to sign a one-year contract with the  
Suns in 1994, then was rewarded the following year with a six-year, 
$42 million deal that runs through the 2000-2001 season. With that 
kind of money guaranteed, retirement might have been tempting after 
his latest injury. But Manning wanted to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got great character,'' Ainge said. ``He loves to play  
basketball. I think he has a great deal of loyalty to this 
organization, has a great passion for the game, a great 
understanding of the game. He's faced his share of adversity, and 
he keeps bouncing back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ainge expects to use Manning the same way as last year -- the  
first frontline option off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Danny's on the court right now, he's playing great  
basketball for us,'' Ainge said. ``He looks as good as ever, but we 
have to be cautious with him and we can't push him along too 
fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning said he expects to play as many minutes as he did a year  
ago, and he takes quiet pride in yet another comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I blew my knee out, it was career-threatening.  
The second time there was no way someone could come back from two. 
The third time it's `He doesn't have a chance,''' Manning said. 
``Every time I've proven people wrong. Hopefully, I won't have to 
do it again, but it's the hand I've been dealt, and I just have to 
play it.''

<HEADLINE> Andre Previn's Wife Seeks Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Conductor Andre Previn's wife has filed  
for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Mary Previn cited ``irreconcilable differences'' in her  
divorce complaint as the reason for wanting to end the 17-year 
marriage, said her lawyer, Monroe Inker. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Previn, 50, is seeking custody of the couple's 15-year-old  
son, Lukas, and an unspecified amount of alimony and child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Previn, who lives on Martha's Vineyard with her son, sells  
jewelry at her Edgartown store, SQN. The complaint was filed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Previn, 69, is a composer and conductor whose work has  
earned him multiple Grammy and Academy Awards. He lives in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been married four times, including an eight-year marriage  
to actress Mia Farrow. During that marriage, the couple adopted

<HEADLINE> Man Who Threatened Plane Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man accused of threatening crew members and  
passengers aboard a Southwest Airlines flight now faces federal 
hijacking charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Luis Mendez, 34, of San Jose, was indicted Tuesday on  
charges of aircraft piracy and interfering with the duties of a 
flight crew member. If convicted, he could get up to 40 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He was held without bail. Arraignment was set for Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	According to an FBI agent's affidavit, Mendez told a flight  
attendant ``to tell the captain that he should take the plane to 
Hollywood or else he was going to start killing people.'' The Jan. 
12 flight originated in San Diego and was headed for San Jose, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	A flight attendant persuaded Mendez to let the plane land in  
Burbank because there is no airport in Hollywood, prosecutors said. 
He briefly struggled with police before he was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 74 passengers or five crew members was injured, and  
the plane resumed its flight after a 30-minute delay.

<HEADLINE> TV Junkie Takes Love for TV on Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid the soapbox speakers, street peddlers and  
hordes of tourists in Times Square, Dan Lohaus stood out. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was his 1970s blue leisure suit. Or the pickup truck  
covered with dozens of televisions and hundreds of remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ready to play `Traffic Jam' -- the game show for the true  
television fan?''' he barked into a microphone at three people 
pulled from a crowd of curiosity-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus began the half-hour street show that Lohaus, 28, proudly  
admits is a ``crazy example of bad performance art and a garage 
sale gone awry.'' The game, which tests the human brain's capacity 
to retain television trivia, combines MTV and ``Jeopardy,'' with a 
dash of ``Name That Tune'' thrown in for effect. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect to see it on your own television. For now, this  
is strictly a street show -- on wheels -- shown in Times Square and 
Union Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up watching game shows and thought they were great. I  
always wanted to be on one. Now, it's my life work,'' Lohaus said. 
``I love 70s TV, especially the Cheese Whiz stuff, the really bad 
stuff. You know, `Love American Style,' `Happy Days,' `Charlie's 
Angels' -- it was great stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the stage name Speed Whitaker, styled after coifed game  
show icons like Wink Martindale, Peter Marshall and Bob Barker, 
Lohaus' street-side game show quizzes contestants in various 
categories, including ``Rerun's Reruns,'' ``It's The Fuzz,'' and 
``Theme Songs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ``TV Truck,'' smothered with 57 donated or junkyard variety  
television sets, serves as the show's set. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the TVs are used to display the trivia questions, via a  
connection to a laptop. Several more display the games' categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buzzers'' -- three steering wheels with functioning horns --  
allow contestants to honk in their answers to questions, such as: 
</P>
<P>
	--''On Magnum P.I., who are Thomas Magnum's two buddies?''  
Answer: Rick and T.C. 
</P>
<P>
	--''What is the Beaver's given name?'' Answer: Theodore Cleaver.  
</P>
<P>
	--''What does M-A-S-H stand for? Answer: Mobile Army Surgical  
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The first contestant to answer correctly in three categories  
wins the game and a free dinner for four at one of several 
restaurants that are promoted throughout the street show. On a 
recent day, the winner got a free falafel dinner donated by Habib's 
Falafel House in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``To each his own,'' said Tim Hiles, a 21-year-old musician from  
Cranston, R.I. who was pulled out of the crowd to play. 
</P>
<P>
	In his spare time, Lohas is a member of weird wheel owners --  
people who cover their cars and trucks from end to end and top to 
bottom with items from the mundane to the outrageous. It's a 
growing phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Harrod Blank of El Cerrito, Calif., who owns the Camera  
Van, and Elmer Fleming who runs the Spoon Van in Columbia, S. C., 
covered in kitchen utensils. Then there's Kathleen Pearson who 
drives the Kitsch Car -- smothered in memorabilia from the 1960s and 
1970s -- in Brisbee, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's how a movement in art starts. People see other people  
doing things and they get turned on to it and start doing it,'' 
Blank said. ``It's very difficult for some people to buy canvas ... 
because it's so expensive. So the next best thing is a car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lohaus, who was born in Boston and raised in Brooklyn, got  
involved with his weird wheel craze in 1994 after dropping out of 
Boston University and moving to California to work for a nonprofit 
organization devoted to moving homeless people off the street and 
into jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the job fell through, he went to work gluing cameras on  
Blank's 1972 Dodge Van for $8 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like an easy way to make some money,'' Lohaus said.  
</P>
<P>
	When the van was finished, Blank and Lohaus took the creation to  
the Houston Art Car Parade, an annual gathering of weird wheel 
owners. Then at age 25, Lohaus hit the road with Blank to make 
``Wild Wheels,'' an independent film about car art and their 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to his home in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn  
last year with a plan to create his own unique vehicle, combining 
his passion for television and wild wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is ``TV Truck.'' The 57 televisions used to decorate  
his truck were either donated or bought at junk yards, and 15 of 
them work. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent at least $3,000 acquiring the televisions, 300  
remote controls and other accessories, and buying glue, paint and 
videotape equipment. He owned the truck -- a 1992 Toyota pickup -- 
and borrowed computer equipment from friends to run the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	To fund his show, Lohaus works part-time making and starring in  
independent films. But he admits his parents occasionally help him 
make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent day, Hiles, Chelsea Thaxter, 24, and Hadley  
Fitzpatrick, 24, both of Manhattan, tested their knowledge of TV 
trivia, while a rowdy crowd cheered them on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where did the roommates on Three's Company go to drink?''  
Lohaus asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting the steering wheel horn, Ms. Fitzpatrick buzzed in  
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Regal Beagle,'' she screamed.  
</P>
<P>
	As bells and sirens blared to indicate she got it, Lohaus  
yelled: ``You are right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a tough game for Ms. Fitzpatrick.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have cable ... and a lot of these questions are from  
stuff that's on cable,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She missed many of the ``Rerun's Reruns'' questions, including  
the one about the ``Happy Days'' spin-off starring Scott Baio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. Happy Days II?'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm sorry, that's incorrect,'' Lohaus said. ``Audience?''  
</P>
<P>
	``'Joanie Loves Chachi,''' a handful of people screamed.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, Lohaus, who took his show on the road in October,  
ventures out on the streets of New York about four days a month. 
His team of producer friends videotape every show, which they'll 
turn into a TV pilot that they hope will capture the interest of 
cable stations, like Comedy Central and MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Dan said he was going to do this, nobody thought he was  
crazy. He's always done stuff like this,'' said John Lanzillotta, 
30, who operates the truck's computer effects. ``If anybody can 
make this work, it would be him.''

<HEADLINE> Record Year for Coal Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coal demand will remain high for several more  
years but could dampen if electric utilities turn to cleaner fuels, 
the Commerce Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, part of Commerce's annual ``U.S. Industry and Trade  
Outlook,'' said production is expected to continue rising about 1 
percent each year, reaching 1.24 billion tons in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the increase results from a ``modest though steady rise  
in coal consumption for the generation of electricity,'' the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's report said environmental factors could cloud the  
industry's long-term outlook. Carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas 
that many scientists say is contributing to a warming of the earth, 
is produced from burning fossil fuels, especially coal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States agreed in worldwide negotiations in Kyoto,  
Japan, a year ago to reduce carbon emissions to below 1990 levels 
by 2008-2012. The agreement still needs Senate ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many answers will arrive in the next few years as electric  
utilities, the traditional market for steam coal in the United 
States, decide whether to invest in expensive and in some cases 
still experimental clean-coal technologies to comply with 
government air-quality regulations,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released the same day the National Mining  
Association, an industry trade group, projected that demand for 
coal will remain strong this year, pushing past the record high of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The group forecast that total domestic consumption and exports  
of coal will be 1.14 billion tons in 1999, a slight increase from 
the 1.131 billion tons a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric utilities seeking a low-cost fuel are driving much of  
the demand, the group said. Its analysis concluded that utilities 
will use 935 million tons of coal to generate 56.8 percent of 
electricity produced by public utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's coal mining companies are alive and well and  
producing more coal than they have at any time in history,'' said 
Richard L. Lawson, president of the mining trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the National Mining Association study found that coal  
use for electricity will increase in all regions except New 
England, where some nuclear generators are returning to service 
following years of dormancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall the Midwest and the South represent areas of greatest  
growth. Production east of the Mississippi River will be slightly 
higher than in the West, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of weak economies abroad, exports are projected to  
continue a decline that began in 1995. The report estimates that 
exports will total 76 million tons, down slightly from 78 million 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal use in coking operations is estimated to remain at 28  
million tons, while industrial and retail coal consumption is 
expected to drop to 74 million tons, from 76 million in 1998, 
because of low natural gas and oil prices.

	Death Toll in Colombia Quake at 700  
</P>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- The confirmed death toll from magnitude  
6 quake in western Colombia reached 700, but officials said the 
number was sure to rise. A heavy downpour has slowed the search for 
earthquake victims and worsened the suffering of survivors of one 
of the worst natural disasters in Colombia's history. Red Cross 
officials said about 500 bodies had been recovered in the 
provincial capital of Armenia alone, with many outlying towns yet 
to be canvassed. A Red Cross coordinator also estimated the death 
toll at 1,000. Monday's earthquake devastated cities and villages 
across western Colombia, a vast Andean terrain where much of the 
world's coffee is grown.

	GOP Set To Make Lewinsky a Witness  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to defeat a Democratic motion to  
dismiss the impeachment case against President Clinton and approve 
witness depositions, Senate Republicans were expected to muster 
party-line majorities today. Majority Leader Trent Lott won over 
some wavering Republicans on the witness issue after House 
prosecutors yesterday restricted their witness list to Monica 
Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. The three would face questioning in sessions likely to 
be videotaped, so that all senators could watch the depositions and 
determine whether to bring them in for live testimony.

	Albright Pushes Kosovo Plan  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is  
pushing a plan to end the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo province with 
a self-rule formula for the ethnic Albanian majority. Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic would have only a few weeks to agree, 
U.S. officials traveling with Albright in the Middle East said 
today. Albright discussed her initiative in Moscow with Russian 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, but was unable to persuade the 
Russians to support a NATO bombardment of Serb positions if 
Milosevic turns the plan down, the officials said.

	Pope Warns America's Young People

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II warned America's young people  
against drifting into a world ``filled with darkness'' and rife 
with violence, drugs and easy sex. ``You are each called to be a 
disciple of Christ,'' he told a jubilant youth rally last night at 
a packed sports arena, where his somber message sharply contrasted 
with his listeners' shrieks of excitement. The pope's 30-hour visit 
to the American heartland kept up a mission begun in Mexico to 
rally his flock against a ``culture of death'' as the new 
millennium nears. More than 100,000 people are expected to turn out 
today for a Mass at the Trans World Dome. The pope is to return to 
Rome tonight.

	US: Missile Attacks Affecting Iraq

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A string of almost daily U.S. missile strikes  
on Iraq's extensive air defenses is having a ``grave impact'' on 
President Saddam Hussein's ability to challenge allied enforcement 
of a flight ban in northern and southern Iraq, U.S. officials say. 
The Pentagon acknowledged, however, that a U.S. missile fired 
Monday at air defense targets near the city of Basra missed by 
miles and struck a residential area, where Iraq reported that five 
civilians were killed, 42 were injured and homes were destroyed. 
Pentagon officials declined to say what caused the missile to go 
astray.

endangered by cold water releases from a dam near the Arizona-Utah 
state line. The humpback chub, named for a hump that helps it 
navigate river rapids, has been endangered since 1967, four years

victory over No. 20 Indiana last night. Lewis, the Big Ten's 
leading scorer, had 26 points after halftime, including eight in 
the overtime, to match the career-best 36 he scored against Seton 
Hall earlier this season. Trailing 83-82, Lewis hit two free throws 
with 1:35 remaining to put the Golden Gophers ahead for good. After 
Joel Przybilla tipped in a miss by Lewis with 55 seconds remaining, 
Lewis made four more free throws in the final 30 seconds to clinch 
it.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern Player Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Northwestern football player Christopher  
Gamble pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of lying to a federal 
grand jury investigating sports betting at the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble, 26, appeared before a federal grand jury in July 1997  
and said that while he had bet on pro games, he had never bet on 
Northwestern football games, according to a plea agreement he 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plea agreement, entered before U.S. District Judge  
George Marovich, said that Gamble had bet that the Wildcats would 
fail to cover the point spread set by gamblers in a game against 
Ohio State in October 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the second quarter of the Ohio State game, when NU was  
leading the game 9-0, the defendant had a brief conversation on the 
field with NU teammate Michael Senters, who also bet against NU,'' 
the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, the defendant commented to Senters that, given  
how well NU was playing, Gamble and Senters were likely to lose 
their bet,'' it said. They did lose the bet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble could face between six months and a year in prison on the  
charge. But prosecutors said they might seek a lighter sentences if 
he cooperates in their investigation. He had earlier pleaded 
innocent to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble was indicted Dec. 3 along with former Northwestern  
players Senters, Dennis Lundy and Gregory Gill, all on perjury 
charges. The other former players have pleaded innocent.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Online Porn Statute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge is expected to decide next week  
whether a federal law designed to keep online pornography away from 
children violates free speech guarantees or is a permissible way to 
keep tabs on potentially harmful material. 
</P>
<P>
	The Child Online Protection Act would have a ``devastating  
effect on free speech,'' Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday during final arguments at a 
federal court hearing on the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU is challenging the act, which would require commercial  
Web sites to collect a credit card number or some other access code 
as proof of age before allowing users to view material deemed 
harmful to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton signed the law last year, but U.S. District  
Judge Lowell Reed Jr. issued a restraining order against its 
enforcement. Reed is expected to decide by Monday whether a 
preliminary injunction -- a more permanent delay -- should be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of Web sites dealing with issues from homosexuality to  
gynecology fear they could be punished under the act for expressing 
their views, Beeson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer Karen Stewart dismissed Beeson's  
view as ``a doomsday scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is not a private playground. It can be  
regulated,'' she said, adding that the measure is aimed only at 
pornographic sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the law is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. The ACLU, however, contends it 
violates the First Amendment and fears mainstream sites may 
inadvertently get snared in its enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The ID requirement could also result in costly technical  
upgrades for Web site owners and would discourage users from freely 
using the Web, Beeson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brian Blonder, an accountant for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  
testified Tuesday that the act would not subject commercial Web 
site operators to unreasonable costs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had analyzed financial data for seven companies  
challenging the law and found that all but one could afford to 
comply with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonder also said only a small fraction of material on the  
Internet would be covered, and that Web sites already are 
segregating objectionable material due to advertiser pressure. He 
said the concerns of non-pornographic sites were based on ``gut 
feelings'' and not evidence.

<HEADLINE>  Fourth IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A fourth IOC member implicated in the Salt  
Lake City bribery scandal resigned Wednesday, three days after he 
was accused of accepting payments arranged by the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Charles Mukora, one of six IOC members facing expulsion,  
proclaimed his innocence even as a quit. David Sibandze of 
Swaziland, Libya's Bashir Mohammed Attarabulsi and Finland's Pirjo 
Haeggman had previously quit, and five others have been essentially 
ousted pending a formal IOC vote in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora, 64, denied receiving any money personally. The IOC said  
he received $34,650, but Mukora said the cash was for ``sports 
development in Kenya'' and ``world youth sporting activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been party to any improper dealings in the last  
40 years I have been involved as a volunteer in Kenyan sports and 
sports management or as an IOC member,'' said Mukora, an IOC member 
since 1990. ``The monies that I am alleged to have received as 
regards to Salt Lake City were monies paid towards the 
establishment of high altitude training camps in Nanyuki, and I 
have not used the monies for my personal use or personal purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest. I have decided therefore to accept his advice 
on principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The others ousted are Lamine Keita of Mali, Jean-Claude Ganga of  
the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, 
Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador and Sergio Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands received a warning  
and Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of South 
Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``complimented Mr.  
Mukora for taking the honorable path'' and called for others ``to 
follow Mr. Mukora's lead and tender their resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation concluded Keita ``knowingly permitted''  
Salt Lake City bidders to make payments totaling more than $97,000 
from 1993-97 to support his son at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fighter by nature, not someone who resigns,'' Keita was  
quoted as telling the Swiss daily Le Matin. ``I'm going to defend 
myself. The statutes give us the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze, who resigned Friday, said he believed there was  
nothing wrong with his son receiving $100,000 in scholarships and 
living expenses from the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities in the United States give scholarships all the  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze told a news conference that he also received numerous  
gifts, including paintings and sculptures, from the Salt Lake City 
Olympic Committee while it was wooing IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he knew there was a $150 limit on the total amount  
of gifts an IOC member could receive from a city, but added: ``I 
never asked about the value of a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not my intent to let the IOC expel me,'' Sibandze said.  
``That's the manner in which the IOC has approached these problems. 
I resigned in the interests of my country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov maintained his innocence and said the scandal stemmed  
from increased commercialization of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more money is involved in big sports, the bigger is the  
temptation to touch them,'' the 63-year-old Russian said in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was asked by the  
investigators to explain his request for free medical treatment for 
former Soviet hockey star Alexander Ragulin and his receipt of a 
Browning rifle from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the IOC member from Ecuador facing expulsion, denied  
accepting bribes. He told the newspaper El Comercio it would be 
``cowardly'' to resign and it would be an ``admission that I had 
done something of which I am innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Officials in Turin, Italy, and Zakopane, Poland, both trying to  
win the 2006 Winter Games, oppose the rule changes in bidding for 
future sites. The IOC recommends a ban on visits by IOC members and 
wants a 15-member panel to choose the host. The Turin and Zakopane 
groups say this puts first-time bidders at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 2004 Athens Summer Games said staging the  
Olympics permanently in Greece as a scandal-stopping move ``isn't 
the answer. Constantine Bakouris, managing director of the 2004 
Games, said it would be ``very difficult to deprive the other 
countries of organizing'' the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> 'Cheap' Calls May Not Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alexander Korogodsky of Scotch Plains, N.J.,  
saw an ad promising deeply discounted long-distance rates if he 
dialed a string of numbers before making a call. Instead, he was 
billed $2.35 for a one-minute call from his home to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The total bill for three months of calls came to $720.12. ``My  
wife said, `Did they forget to put a period in the right place?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Korogodsky wasn't charged the low rate promised by  
``dial-around'' service 10-321, now 10-10-321, operated by Telecom 
USA, a subsidiary of MCI WorldCom. Instead, a technical glitch 
caused his dial-around call to be billed at MCI's highest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the problem that affected many others as well was a  
fluke, Korogodsy's experience illustrates the confusion some people 
endure when they turn to dial-around services to save money. 
Korogodsky spent days trying to reach Telecom USA to fix the 
charges, which he paid in full. Nearly a year later, he's still 
waiting for MCI to reimburse him. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a growing number of complaints, the Federal  
Communications Commission is looking into how such dial-around 
services are advertised and whether consumers get enough 
information about rates, restrictions and where to call with a 
billing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should not get the runaround on dial-around,'' said  
FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is checking into three areas, according to officials  
who spoke on condition of anonymity: 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether consumers realize that some services charge monthly  
fees, per-call fees or have minimum talk times; 
</P>
<P>
	--Confusion over the discount: for instance, 20 percent cheaper  
compared with what price? 
</P>
<P>
	--Difficulty contacting the company with problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Two big marketers of dial-around services -- MCI and AT&AMP;T -- say  
their ads are clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some criticism, but I will let our ads stand on  
their own,'' said Howard McNally, president of AT&AMP;T's Lucky Dog 
Phone Co., which runs 10-10-345. ``If you look at our TV 
advertising, look at our direct mail, we think our pricing is very, 
very clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other companies, MCI and AT&AMP;T purposefully keep their  
corporate names out of dial-around ads. That's done to create a 
separate brand identity for a service that targets customers 
looking for a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	But that means consumers should do their homework, calculating  
the math and reading the fine print -- even if it's just flashed at 
the bottom of a TV ad, said Samuel Simon of the Telecommunications 
Research &AMP; Action Center, which monitors phone rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's already a huge amount of consumer confusion out there  
about getting the best deal for phone service -- and ads for 
dial-around services have added to that,'' Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers need not switch from their current long-distance carrier  
to use a dial-around. They can just dial a seven-digit access code. 
The charges from the dial-around company usually show up on the 
customer's regular phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Navdeep Singh of Dallas said he's sworn off all dial-arounds  
after a problem with 10-10-297. Singh says he was promised one rate 
in writing, and was charged another. Although the overcharge only 
amounted to about $15 for three months, the aggravation of trying 
to get the problem fixed drove him to complain to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial-around is small but growing: It's projected to be a $3  
billion business by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard says he finds ``particularly galling'' an ad saying a  
consumer can make a 20-minute call for 99 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	That ad is for MCI's 10-10-220 service. One newspaper ad says:  
``Time can be expensive.'' It says a 20-minute cab ride costs $19 
and a 20-minute tanning session costs $20. ``Or, time can be 
cheap,'' the ads says, showing a telephone with the message 
``20-minute phone call 99 cents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said, ``Consumers know that's 5 cents a minute and  
that's a pretty good rate.'' But if the consumer is on the phone 
for less than 20 minutes, they still must pay the full amount, 
Kennard notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad does say: ``only 99 cents for all calls up to 20  
minutes,'' but Kennard doesn't think it's clear enough. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI's Burns defends the ads, saying they're clear. More than 85  
percent of MCI's dial-around users are repeat customers, he notes. 
The typical call on 10-10-220 lasts 15 minutes, he says, making the 
per-minute charge 6.6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a TV ad for AT&AMP;T's 10-10-345, viewers are told: ``It's always  
10 cents a minute.'' But small print that quickly disappears says 
there's a 10-cent connection charge. That means the first minute is 
20 cents.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Daal Gets $6.75M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Pitcher Omar Daal, perhaps biggest surprise for  
the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks last season, agreed Wednesday to 
a $6.75 million, two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan left-hander, who turns 27 on March 1, was 8-12  
with the Diamondbacks and had the National League's fifth-best ERA 
at 2.88. 
</P>
<P>
	``Omar is one of the players from the expansion draft who really  
made the most of the opportunity that expansion afforded him,'' 
Diamondbacks general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``Given the 
chance to start on a regular basis, he showed he was capable of 
holding his own against the better pitchers in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daal was the only Diamondback to file for salary arbitration and  
a hearing had been scheduled for next month. Garagiola was pleased 
that the franchise could avoid arbitration for the second straight 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy because it's a tough process,'' Garagiola said.  
``It's tough to go through it and have everybody come out on the 
other side without hurt feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daal, who earned $575,000 last season, receives a $250,000  
signing bonus. He will get $2.5 million in 1999 and $3.5 million in 
2000. The contract includes a third year at the club's option with 
a salary of $5.5 million and a $500,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 salary and the option year figure can go higher if Daal  
performs at a certain level next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that we offered the contract that we did and  
ultimately did the deal that we did is a good indication of the 
high regard we have for him,'' Garagiola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal is penciled in as the fourth or fifth starter in what  
potentially is one of the league's best rotations after Arizona's 
offseason signings of free agents Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre 
and Armando Reynoso. 
</P>
<P>
	With Andy Benes and Brian Anderson also back from last year's  
team, the Diamondbacks have six starters going into next month's 
start of spring training. However, Anderson is considered a likely 
candidate to be traded as Arizona looks for more offensive help. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona selected Daal with the second choice of the second round  
of the expansion draft. He had pitched for Toronto, Montreal and 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, mostly as a reliever, since 1993 with an 
overall career record in the majors of 20-23. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal began last season in the bullpen, but moved into the  
starting rotation when Joel Adamson was hurt. He went on to become 
the best Arizona pitcher for much of the season, even though he 
often was the victim of a lack of run support, losing 1-0 and 2-1 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got tremendous control. He can throw the curve ball for a  
strike pretty much anywhere in the count,'' Garagiola said. ``His 
won-loss record was certainly not indicative of how well he 
pitched. He was definitely the guy in the wrong place at the wrong 
time a lot, in terms of run support.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Picking on in Drag Death Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- The white ex-convict on trial for the  
dragging death of a black man claimed in a letter to a local 
newspaper he was being judged unfairly but still has ``law and 
order in my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As lawyers tried for a third day to pare down a 122-member jury  
pool, Wednesday's edition of The Jasper NewsBoy, a twice-weekly 
paper, published a letter from John William King. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, could face the death penalty if convicted of dragging  
James Byrd Jr. for nearly three miles to his death last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why you are so eager to condemn me for this man's  
murder when no testimony has yet been heard, and I don't care about 
that, either,'' King wrote. ``The system is turning against me; but 
I still have law and order in my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, King wrote a letter to The Dallas Morning News in  
which he said his co-defendants -- Lawrence Brewer, 31 and Shawn 
Berry, 23 -- dropped him off at home after picking up Byrd and 
before he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, however, have said that Byrd's blood was found on  
the shoes of all three suspects and that other physical evidence 
implicates all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer and Berry are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Ill Maryland Sen. Returns for Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski startled her  
colleagues Wednesday when she voted against a motion to dismiss the 
impeachment charges against President Clinton. Moments later, she 
interrupted the roll call to say she'd made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland senator, a Clinton supporter, had been in the  
hospital but was released in time for Wednesday's vote. When her 
name was called initially, she responded with a firm ``No'' -- a 
vote against dismissing the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing her mistake seconds later, she rose again to address  
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who is presiding over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``At an appropriate time I wish to state I made an error in my  
vote. I want to vote yes,'' Mikulski said. ``May I do that now, or 
wait until the end?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist motioned for her to proceed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I vote yes,'' Mikulski said, as laughter broke out in the  
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikulski, 62, missed Tuesday's trial session after she checked  
into Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore because she felt faint. Her 
office said doctors discovered that her flu-like symptoms were 
caused by an inflamed gall bladder, which will require routine 
surgery within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mona Miller, a Mikulski spokeswoman, said the senator was  
feeling better. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did get some much-needed rest and fluids and  
antibiotics,'' Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Divac Shows Change for Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- His voice rising above the practice  
chatter, Vlade Divac ran up and down the floor, directing and 
encouraging his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac's voice was one of change for the Sacramento Kings.  
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center, signed last week as a free agent to a  
six-year, $62.5 million contract, is part of a wave of newcomers to 
the Kings, who head into the lockout-shortened campaign trying to 
snap their dubious record of 15 straight sub-.500 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of reasons I came here,'' said Divac, who played  
the past two seasons for Charlotte after spending his first six 
with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the contract I wanted and Sacramento is a lot closer to  
my home and my family in Los Angeles. A lot of people told me, 
`Hey, you know, the Sacramento Kings have never been good.' I said, 
`Hey, I'll go there and I'll help make'em good.' 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows it may take some time.  
</P>
<P>
	Of the 19 players in the Kings' training camp, only Corliss  
Williamson was with the team two years ago. He'll fill out the 
front line with Divac and Webber, obtained last summer shortly 
before the lockout was imposed in the trade that sent Mitch 
Richmond to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Divac has already seen some encouraging signs in  
the first few days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you this: this is an unselfish team and that's very  
good,' Divac said. ``I think we do have a chance, just because of 
the short season, to surprise some other teams. With the talent we 
have here now, maybe we can jump on some teams early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the more versatile centers in the league, Divac begins  
the year as one of only five active NBA players with at least 8,000 
career points, 5,000 rebounds, 1,500 blocked shots and 1,000 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a very good all-around player for the center spot.  
You just don't find very many guys like him,'' first-year Kings 
coach Rick Adelman said. ``But what I've really been impressed with 
is his leadership out there. He's very vocal. He really wants the 
team to do well and he's very excited about being here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the lockout, Divac missed six weeks of his personal  
workouts after an appendectomy in late October. But he worked his 
way back into shape and even played three weeks for the Red Star 
basketball club in Belgrade before returning to the United States 
earlier this month, when the lockout was settled. The Kings open 
exhibition play Thursday night against Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always said it was a stupid thing on the part of players and  
owners,'' Divac said. ``Nobody won, everybody lost and I felt bad 
for the fans.''

<HEADLINE>  Flu Strikes European Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The late withdrawal of defending  
champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze didn't end 
Russian hopes to sweep the European Figure Skating Championships 
for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian silver medalists Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov  
seized the opening and extended Russia pairs' unbroken 38-year 
European medal streak with a strong, synchronized free skate at the 
European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Suidek finished second, the  
first Polish pair since 1934 to win a medal at Europeans. Sarah 
Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis of France, placed third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning Russian team wasn't as fast, or as polished as the  
Russians who had won the title before them. But skating to 
Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons,'' the pair nailed side-by-side triple toe 
loops in unison at the start of the program, then kept pace with a 
pair of throw triple moves that demonstrated their power. In each 
instance, Petrova completed the spins midair, allowing her to land 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, the pair has only been together since June 15.  
</P>
<P>
	``To become a good couple, a great couple, we need minimum one  
year,'' Tikhonov said, acknowledging that it was the absence of 
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze that provided them with the chance to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, they are the best skaters in the world, and we are  
very sorry they didn't skate. We've been very lucky, and fortune 
smiled on us tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champions and Olympic silver medalists withdrew  
just two hours before the competition after Berezhnaya was 
diagnosed with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading after the short, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze were  
virtually assured a repeat title. And even after they withdrew, 
Petrova and Tikhonov, fifth after the short, were long shots to 
leapfrog the three remaining couples to the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller, however, handed them  
the opportunity by falling early in their program. Schwarz, who won 
a bronze at the 1988 Europeans in Prague with another partner, fell 
on the side-by-side double axels, stumbled during step, then, 
collapsed on the death spiral. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrova and Tikhonov's victory puts the Russians on course to  
repeat their medal sweep for the third year running. Three Russian 
women led the qualifying round Wednesday, the Russian men are one, 
two and three going into Thursday's final, and Russian champions 
Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov topped the dance standings 
after the compulsory Ravensburger Waltz and Tango Romantica. 
</P>
<P>
	But the flu, which has forced officials to close schools in and  
around Prague to keep the virus from spreading, may turn out to be 
the real wild card in these championships. 
</P>
<P>
	A British woman and Czech pair have already dropped out of  
competition, and talk of yet more competitors and judges suffering 
flu symptoms also circulated the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	After the women's qualifying skate, Russia's Viktoria Volchkova  
said she had a fever as she left the ice, though she had skated 
strongly enough to finish second in her group, behind defending 
champion and teammate Maria Butyrskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Moskvina, coach for Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, said  
Berezhnaya's flu came on without warning Tuesday morning. ``We are 
used to competing at all cost,'' she said. ``But we didn't think it 
appropriate to put her health at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Butyrskaya opened the women's qualifying  
round, having drawn the disdained first slot from a field of 35 
skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	By 11 a.m., the Russian had completed an elegant long program in  
the qualifying round, hours before most elite skaters' circadian 
clocks are set to deliver championship performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know where I was, if I was in a dream,'' Butyrskaya  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If she had been, the six-time Russian champion would have been  
dressed for it, all in white, to complement the classic program 
emphasizing her grace and elegant spirals and spins, one with her 
arms clasped uniquely behind her back.

<HEADLINE>  Flu Strikes European Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The late withdrawal of defending  
champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze didn't end 
Russian hopes to sweep the European Figure Skating Championships 
for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian silver medalists Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov  
seized the opening and extended Russia pairs' unbroken 38-year 
European medal streak with a strong, synchronized free skate at the 
European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Suidek finished second, the  
first Polish pair since 1934 to win a medal at Europeans. Sarah 
Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis of France, placed third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning Russian team wasn't as fast, or as polished as the  
Russians who had won the title before them. But skating to 
Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons,'' the pair nailed side-by-side triple toe 
loops in unison at the start of the program, then kept pace with a 
pair of throw triple moves that demonstrated their power. In each 
instance, Petrova completed the spins midair, allowing her to land 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, the pair has only been together since June 15.  
</P>
<P>
	``To become a good couple, a great couple, we need minimum one  
year,'' Tikhonov said, acknowledging that it was the absence of 
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze that provided them with the chance to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, they are the best skaters in the world, and we are  
very sorry they didn't skate. We've been very lucky, and fortune 
smiled on us tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champions and Olympic silver medalists withdrew  
just two hours before the competition after Berezhnaya was 
diagnosed with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading after the short, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze were  
virtually assured a repeat title. And even after they withdrew, 
Petrova and Tikhonov, fifth after the short, were long shots to 
leapfrog the three remaining couples to the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller, however, handed them  
the opportunity by falling early in their program. Schwarz, who won 
a bronze at the 1988 Europeans in Prague with another partner, fell 
on the side-by-side double axels, stumbled during step, then, 
collapsed on the death spiral. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrova and Tikhonov's victory puts the Russians on course to  
repeat their medal sweep for the third year running. Three Russian 
women led the qualifying round Wednesday, the Russian men are one, 
two and three going into Thursday's final, and Russian champions 
Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov topped the dance standings 
after the compulsory Ravensburger Waltz and Tango Romantica. 
</P>
<P>
	But the flu, which has forced officials to close schools in and  
around Prague to keep the virus from spreading, may turn out to be 
the real wild card in these championships. 
</P>
<P>
	A British woman and Czech pair have already dropped out of  
competition, and talk of yet more competitors and judges suffering 
flu symptoms also circulated the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	After the women's qualifying skate, Russia's Viktoria Volchkova  
said she had a fever as she left the ice, though she had skated 
strongly enough to finish second in her group, behind defending 
champion and teammate Maria Butyrskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Moskvina, coach for Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, said  
Berezhnaya's flu came on without warning Tuesday morning. ``We are 
used to competing at all cost,'' she said. ``But we didn't think it 
appropriate to put her health at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Butyrskaya opened the women's qualifying  
round, having drawn the disdained first slot from a field of 35 
skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	By 11 a.m., the Russian had completed an elegant long program in  
the qualifying round, hours before most elite skaters' circadian 
clocks are set to deliver championship performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know where I was, if I was in a dream,'' Butyrskaya  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If she had been, the six-time Russian champion would have been  
dressed for it, all in white, to complement the classic program 
emphasizing her grace and elegant spirals and spins, one with her 
arms clasped uniquely behind her back.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Rivals Working Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The governor welcomed the new state  
comptroller to their first meeting on a public board with a 
heart-shaped box of candy. The comptroller offered flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is, how long will the harmony last between Gov.  
Parris Glendening and former Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who have 
had a testy relationship for years although both are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first session of the powerful Board of Public Works since  
Schaefer was sworn in as comptroller on Monday, the two joked about 
predictions that their meetings will erupt in fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer said he heard tickets were going for $250 each, but  
``they're down to zero now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking at the television cameras in front of them, the former  
governor said: ``Nothing's going to happen today, so you can go 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glendening started the gift giving by presenting Schaefer and  
Treasurer Richard Dixon, the third member of the board, with bright 
red boxes of chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer then produced a bouquet of red and pink flowers.  
</P>
<P>
	``You want to take a look at it?'' he asked Glendening. ``I'm  
taking it back to my office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Love prevails,'' Glendening commented.  
</P>
<P>
	The board approves all state contracts, funding for school  
construction projects, and loans and grants for economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	As governor for the maximum of eight years, Schaefer ran the  
Board of Public Works meetings. He was succeeded by Glendening four 
years ago, and was elected comptroller in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to both Glendening and Schaefer said they believe Schaefer  
is the first person to hold two positions on the panel.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Witnesses for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate refused today to dismiss the  
impeachment case against President Clinton and extended the trial 
by authorizing House prosecutors to question Monica Lewinsky and 
two other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both votes were along party lines with a single exception,  
Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold who voted with Republicans. 
Senators voted 56-44 both to subpoena the witnesses and to reject a 
motion by Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia that would 
have dismissed perjury and obstruction of justice charges brought 
by the House against the nation's 42nd president. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes demonstrated Democratic strength to block the  
two-thirds majority, 67 votes, that would be needed to convict 
Clinton and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators immediately recessed the trial to discuss among  
themselves how to proceed next. Republicans were pressing a plan 
that could end the proceeding within 10 days if the White House did 
not seek witnesses. Both presidential aides and Senate Democrats 
reacted warily. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes authorized House prosecutors to question Ms. Lewinsky,  
White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal and presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan about the president's efforts to conceal his affair 
with the former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said it was concerned that Republicans were  
trying to ``put a blindfold on us'' with an accelerated plan to end 
the trial without defense witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The country wants this over. ... As we move forward here, the  
country will understand that this trial belongs to the Senate 
Republicans and the Republican House managers and that they alone 
are responsible for extending this process,'' press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats also reacted warily to the GOP plan but left  
open the possibility of further negotiations. ``We're not going to 
rush to any conclusion,'' Minority Leader Tom Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he was concerned Republicans  
were telling the president, ``We want to have our witnesses but you 
don't need to have your witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP plan, the depositions of the three witnesses would  
begin as early as Thursday and would be videotaped. Each deposition 
would last six hours, equally divided between the White House and 
House prosecutors with two senators sitting in as mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotaped sessions and transcripts would be distributed  
Monday to senators, who would then vote Tuesday on whether to 
permit live testimony. The timetable would allow for that testimony 
and then closing statements from the House managers and White House 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla.,  
acknowledged that ``we kind of need to get a little bit closer on 
some details'' before any bipartisan agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today that if prosecution witnesses are  
allowed the president's lawyers deserve a chance to review some 
56,000 pages in still-secret evidence the House collected during 
the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're now trying to put a blindfold on us,'' press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said, declining to say whether the White House would 
demand to slow things down or call its own witnesses. ``We believe 
we ought to have an adequate chance to get prepared and to present 
a defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House remains convinced that the best course is to  
avoid calling witnesses altogether, he added. ``We don't want this 
to stay open-ended. We think there is enough testimony on the 
record now for members to make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After days of being blamed for considering extending the trial,  
Senate Republicans suggested their plan would turn the tables on 
the White House. ``The longer it is prolonged, the more risk to 
their client. If another shoe drops, it's there fault, not ours,'' 
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks before today's votes, Lott said, ``There is a point  
when we will complete the work we are involved in and I believe it 
could be within the next 10 days, two weeks at the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott won over some wavering Republicans on the issue of deposing  
witnesses after House prosecutors Tuesday restricted their list to 
Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center of the 
sex and cover-up scandal, and then two presidential confidants. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors on Tuesday asked the Senate to invite Clinton  
to testify, but the White House has rejected the idea and Daschle 
called the proposal ``a red herring. It is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle warned the trial would plod on indefinitely if witnesses  
were approved, and Clinton lawyer David Kendall said the White 
House would be ``faced with a critical need'' to review mountains 
of previous testimony before deciding whether to seek rebuttal 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, sensing the Senate will not remove Clinton, is considering  
a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to end the trial with 
two votes: the first on whether Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction and the second on whether he should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' that it  
was ``well-grounded both in the Constitution and precedents to have 
separate findings of fact, separate from the decision on whether or 
not the offenses ... justify removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us are concerned about whether an acquittal vote --  
what kind of message that would send to the White House and the 
American people,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., scoffed at that proposal. ``Our  
vote is whether or not to remove the president,'' he said on ABC. 
``We can admit to the fact the president has not been truthful. ... 
But the question is a judgment question: Do we believe it is 
grounds for overturning an election.The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan about his efforts to find  
Ms. Lewinsky a job at the same time she had been subpoenaed in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal is one of the White House aides to whom the president  
falsely denied having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The article of impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says 
Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury.

<HEADLINE> Chicago BOT Abandons Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade has voted to abandon a  
proposed alliance with its fastest-growing competitor, slowing a 
shift to electronic trading that many say is cheaper and easier. 
</P>
<P>
	In what some had called a key vote in determining the direction  
the Chicago exchange will take in coming years -- and even whether 
it will survive -- members voted 450-390 on Wednesday to place their 
bets with open outcry, in which traders stand in pits yelling and 
gesturing to set the price for everything from soybeans to Treasury 
bond futures. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, they turned their backs on an alliance with Eurex,  
the Frankfurt-based all-electronic exchange owned jointly by 
Germany's Deutsche Boerse and its Swiss counterpart, despite having 
spent millions of dollars already on pre-implementation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Trade is the world's largest futures exchange,  
dealing in contracts for future delivery of agricultural 
commodities like wheat and financial securities such as bonds. 
Eurex is No. 2 in rankings based on trading volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Tradition, money and some 150,000 Chicago-area jobs connected to  
the industry are at stake as the exchange moves forward in an era 
of uncertainty and competitive challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Large trading firms have migrated to computer-based trading,  
saying it is easier and cheaper because it saves keeping expensive 
staff at individual exchanges. Others argue open outcry is the best 
method of determining prices because face-to-face contact allows 
traders to ``feel'' the mood of a market and act accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to explore initiatives that meld the cost  
efficiencies of electronic trading with the transaction 
efficiencies of open outcry trading,'' David Brennan, the Board of 
Trade's recently elected chairman, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had urged a go-slow approach to considering the issue of  
electronic trading and apparently came down squarely against the 
deal after flying suddenly to Europe last week to seek better 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chairman had argued that Chicago's 50 percent share in  
the venture was too small and that the Board of Trade's electronic 
trading platform, Project A, should not be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chicago Board of Trade has the largest and fastest-growing  
electronic trading system in the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Eurex's system trades far more contracts daily and  
singlehandedly last year trounced exchanges in London and Paris, 
forcing them to cut jobs, attempt hurried switches to electronic 
trading and seek alliances with Eurex. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurex executives had hoped to salvage the alliance with the  
Board of Trade despite the December defeat of its largest booster, 
former chairman Patrick Arbor. But they have indicated their are 
prepared to seek alliances with other European and U.S. exchanges 
to expand their dominance of trading in lucrative currency 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of switching to an all-electronic trading platform has  
clearly divided the Board of Trade, from the floor traders and 
members all the way up to the executive offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan and his deputy earlier this month openly disagreed on  
whether an alliance with Eurex was in the best interests of the 
exchange.

<HEADLINE> Female Religious Activism Seen Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the past seven years, American women have  
moved markedly toward accepting religious activism in politics, 
according to new research from a feminist group. 
</P>
<P>
	Respondents split 50-50 when asked whether elected officials  
should be guided by religious values or whether ``religion and 
politics shouldn't mix.'' In a comparable survey done in 1992, 63 
percent of women picked the second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	On abortion, a prime topic for church politicking, 53 percent of  
those surveyed in the poll conducted last year said it should be 
illegal except for rape, incest and saving a woman's life, or else 
forbidden in all cases. 
</P>
<P>
	That's an 8 percent shift away from abortion rights in a poll  
done two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The changes on abortion are pretty dramatic,'' said Diane  
Colasanto of Princeton Survey Research Associates, which conducted 
the telephone survey for the Center for Gender Equality. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also showed that American women are becoming more  
devout, with 75 percent considering religion ``very important'' in 
their lives. That's a 6 percent increase from 1996. Women who said 
they prayed daily increased 11 percent in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Those identifying themselves as ``born-again or evangelical  
Christian'' totaled 51 percent, an increase of 6 percent since 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 poll showed 76 percent of women think religious leaders  
and groups have a ``somewhat'' or ``very positive'' effect on the 
country. Responding to a series of questions about the influence of 
such groups on government, politics and public schools, those 
surveyed showed little worry that it was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 2-to-1 ratio, respondents had a favorable attitude toward  
the Christian Coalition's impact on women's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all the women polled favored equal treatment in  
employment, promotion, pay raises, education and access to loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was conducted among 1,000 women who were 18 and over.  
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Carlos Baerga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Signing second baseman Carlos Baerga may spoil  
Tony La Russa's plan for batting St. Louis Cardinals' pitchers 
eighth again. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, who agreed to a one-year, $1.25 million deal Wednesday,  
is a .293 career hitter. La Russa batted the pitcher eighth and a 
lesser hitter ninth the second half of last season to generate more 
offense for home run king Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't hit him ninth,'' La Russa said. ``This means that  
the pitcher hits ninth or somebody else does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all along that the idea is to fit the lineup to the  
manager's personnel. The personnel doesn't match the manager's 
thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals were 43-33 with the pitcher hitting eighth last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, a switch hitter, was a three-time All-Star with  
Cleveland, but his production has dropped off sharply since he was 
traded to the New York Mets in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a premier guy who went in the opposite direction  
and he's determined to get back the respect he had,'' said La 
Russa, who managed in the American League when Baerga starred 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, 30, had his best season in 1993 when he hit .321 with 21  
homers and 114 RBIs. He hit .314 the following season, dropped to 
.254 with Cleveland in 1996, then hit .193 during the rest of the 
season with the Mets and .281 and .266 during his full seasons in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga had weight problems last season.  
</P>
<P>
	``He just gave the appearance of being a little listless  
mentally and physically,'' La Russa said. ``We've had it confirmed 
that he's really working hard. I think he's anxious to reassert 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' second baseman for the past two seasons, Delino  
DeShields, agreed in December to a $12.5 million, three-year 
contract with Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, coming off a $21.4 million, six-year contract, has a  
.293 career average with 121 homers and 676 RBIs. He gets a $1 
million salary, which will be increased to $1.25 million if he's on 
the opening day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing continues the Cardinals' makeover. First baseman  
Mark McGwire and center fielder Ray Lankford are the only remaining 
starters from last year's opening day lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of last season, St. Louis has signed outfielders  
Eric Davis and Darren Bragg and reliever Scott Radinsky, and traded 
for reliever Ricky Bottalico, starter Garrett Stephenson and 
shortstop Edgar Renteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie J.D. Drew is expected to start in left field, replacing  
Ron Gant, who was traded to Philadelphia in the Bottalico deal. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Baerga on the 40-man roster, the Cardinals sent  
outfielder Mark Little outright to Triple-A Memphis. Little, 26, 
was 1-for-12 in seven games with the Cardinals last September.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Prepares Response to IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Andrew Young is a man of integrity, former  
Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne says. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne angrily denied charges that the former Atlanta mayor made  
promises to International Olympic Committee members from Africa in 
order to secure the Games for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask me has Andy always been supportive of the needs of  
Africans in need for almost 40 years, the answer is yes,'' Payne 
said Tuesday. ``But if you ask whether Andy has done or would do 
anything in Africa to direct support to our bid, the answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a great and wonderful man to the core and would not do  
anything on a quid pro quo basis in exchange for votes or 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the state radio station in the Republic of Congo  
reported that Young, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations under President Carter, traveled to Brazzaville in 
1984 to promote Atlanta's bid. According to the report, Young 
promised to build a sports stadium in the capital in exchange for 
the country's support for Atlanta's campaign to host the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were worried about raising enough money for our own  
stadium,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The republic's IOC representative, Jean-Claude Ganga, was one of  
those expelled after an IOC investigation into a bribery scandal 
involving Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games found 
Ganga received more than $216,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he didn't even get the idea to pursue the Olympics  
until 1987, three years after the alleged promise by Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Young may have been in the Congo in 1984 ... but that  
report is clearly false,'' Young spokesman Lee Echols said. ``Andy 
Young never made promises to build facilities nor to provide aid to 
build facilities in relation to the Atlanta Olympic bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Payne and other former Olympic organizers in Atlanta  
were preparing answers to an anticipated inquiry into their bid for 
the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading the investigation  
into the rapidly broadening bribery scandal, recently said he wants 
the IOC to look at the Olympic bids of all cities dating back to 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members have been expelled and another three have  
resigned as a result of the revelations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a sudden rash, as we did in this case, everyone  
assumes everybody did it,'' Payne said. ``That's something the 
opportunity of a formal request will put to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta organizers have not received an official request, and  
U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz said it 
would probably go straight to Atlanta and not through the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trying to make Atlanta look bad,'' Schultz said.  
``This is more of an internal thing inside the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Payne: ``It's kind of, once again, 'rack your brain, rack  
your brain. We're not getting together in a room or anything, but 
we're all glad for the chance to respond in this formal way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne and others involved with the Atlanta bid have continuously  
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our bid would stand a pretty rigorous scrutiny by the  
rules that existed at time,'' said A.D. Frazier, former chief 
operating officer of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. 
``Not only that, but we had six years from 1991 of clean audits by 
Price-Waterhouse. And the AOC (the Atlanta Olympic Committee, which 
handled the bid) had a clean audit.''

<HEADLINE> Haas Is on the Upswing Down Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- For so long, Tommy Haas has been  
surrounded by bigger names. 
</P>
<P>
	He learned his tennis in the same Florida academy that produced  
Andre Agassi and Jim Courier. He comes from a country that has the 
likes of Boris Becker, Steffi Graf and Michael Stich. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, slowly, Haas is starting to get noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	He delivered his biggest Grand Slam victory Wednesday, a 7-6  
(7-5), 7-5, 6-3 win over Vince Spadea that put him in the 
semifinals of the Australian Open against Yevgeny Kafelnikov. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time the 20-year-old has moved beyond the third  
round of a Grand Slam tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas is only the fourth German man to make the semifinals in a  
Grand Slam since the start of the Open era in 1968. The others are 
Becker, Stich and Karl Meiler, who reached the 1973 Australian 
semis. Becker has won six Grand Slams, including the Australian 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some goals in my life, and that is to play good tennis,  
maybe win a Grand Slam tournament one year in my career, and to 
come into the top 10,'' Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas is ranked 33rd in the world. He has been working for 10  
years under Agassi's former coach Nick Bollettieri in Florida. He 
finished high school in the United States in 1996, when he made his 
debut on the ATP Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I phoned Nick and I phoned my father straight after today's  
match,'' Haas said. ``It was a big match for me and I'm really 
happy to be in my first semifinal in a Grand Slam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Haas was Germany's top male player, beating out Nicolas  
Kiefer, who ousted No. 4 seed Carlos Moya in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Spadea, who beat Agassi, the No. 5 seed, in the fourth round,  
also was making his first appearance in the quarterfinals of a 
major. But he had no answer for Haas' forehand. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ninth game of the third set, Spadea double faulted to  
give Haas the advantage. The match was sealed when Spadea hit a 
forehand return long. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas said he began feeling tired in the third set and his legs  
cramped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am trying to do my best every time I go out on the court,''  
he said. ``And everything went pretty well.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Denver's Plane Short of Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Singer John Denver was an experienced pilot,  
with thousands of hours of flight time in biplanes, acrobatic 
aircraft and his own Lear Jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he did not have experience in the experimental  
plane he bought late in 1997, and the government believes that 
contributed to the crash that killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, in a 5-0 vote, said  
Tuesday that the probable cause of Denver's crash was threefold: He 
took off with too little fuel in one tank, had trouble switching to 
his backup tank and inadvertently put his plane into a roll while 
his attention was diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said contributing factors included the plane builder's  
decision to relocate the fuel tank selector handle and an absence 
of markings on the handle and nearby fuel gauges, as well as 
Denver's lack of training in his new plane. It crashed Oct. 12, 
1997, off Pacific Grove, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The board urged the Federal Aviation Administration and the  
Experimental Aircraft Association to develop a program under which 
new pilots of experimental planes -- like the one Denver was flying 
-- would receive formalized training before their first flights. 
Board members noted the planes are sometimes difficult to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just somebody who flew his (Cessna) 172 around the  
pattern,'' said board member Robert T. Francis. ``This was an 
experienced pilot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old singer-songwriter, famous for such hits as  
``Rocky Mountain High'' and ``Sunshine on My Shoulders,'' was the 
lone passenger when his plane plunged about 150 feet straight into 
the waters off California's Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	He had bought the aircraft only two weeks earlier and had  
limited flying time as its pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing from its investigators, the board concluded that  
Denver's plane had only about three gallons of fuel in its left 
tank when he took off from the Monterey Peninsula Airport in the 
late afternoon to practice takeoffs and landings. The right tank 
had only about six gallons, but Denver declined an offer to refuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said they heard a sputter, and investigators theorize  
that Denver ran out of fuel in the left tank and had trouble 
switching to his right tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans for Denver's homemade Long E-Z say the fuel selector  
handle, which switches the fuel flow between the left and right 
tanks, should be located between the pilot's legs. But the plane's 
builder, Texas aircraft maker Adrian Davis Jr., told investigators 
he put it behind the pilot's left shoulder because he did not want 
fuel in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those circumstances, the pilot would have had to remove  
his shoulder harness, turn around and switch the handle. While 
doing so, the pilot would press on the plane's right rudder pedal, 
causing the aircraft to roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators told the board that Denver may have been  
unfamiliar with the plane's fuel gauges and the fuel tank selector 
handle because they were not marked. 
</P>
<P>
	The selector, for example, pointed to the left for the right  
tank, to the right for the left tank and in between for ``OFF.'' 
There were no placards or other markers designating those 
positions, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the fuel gauges -- with vertical windows showing the  
fuel in each wing tank -- can be misleading because they do not 
represent the volume in a linear fashion. When the fuel rises to 
one-quarter on the window, for example, it does not indicate that 
the 26-gallon tank is one-quarter full. In reality, it contains 
less than 5 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	The EAA, a widely praised private group, has developed a program  
to teach many first-time pilots how to make a safe transition to 
their new planes. The safety board now wants the FAA and EAA to 
require more formalized training for pilots of experimental planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the board recommended that the FAA require markings on  
vital aircraft controls such as the fuel gauge and fuel tank 
selector handle, and also demand that the markings be inspected 
annually.

<HEADLINE> New Arthritis Treatment Touted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The standard medicine for rheumatoid arthritis appears to ease  
pain and swelling significantly better when combined with a new 
genetically engineered drug, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last decade, methotrexate has been the first-choice drug  
because it relieves symptoms quickly and more effectively than 
other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it doesn't help many patients enough, so researchers  
compared using methotrexate alone and using it with an injectable 
drug called Enbrel, the first genetically engineered medication 
sold for arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 study of 89 patients, doctors found pain and swelling  
decreased noticeably in 71 percent of patients who got both drugs 
for six weeks. The rate was 27 percent for patients who got 
methotrexate and a dummy shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms decreased as much as 70 percent for 15 percent of the  
patients who got Enbrel and methotrexate, compared with none who 
only took methotrexate. 
</P>
<P>
	Enbrel is made by Immunex Corp. of Seattle, which funded the  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead researcher of the study reported in today's New England  
Journal of Medicine was Dr. Michael Weinblatt, director of clinical 
rheumatology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which rogue  
immune cells attack the tissue cushioning joints, eventually 
disabling many patients. It affects 2 million Americans, mostly 
women, and usually develops between age 25 and 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Enbrel, chemically known as etanercept, caused few adverse  
effects in the study besides itching and rashes at the injection 
site, but it has one big drawback -- it costs $12,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in the journal, Dr. James O'Dell of University  
of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha also noted the success of 
infliximab, a genetically engineered drug approved for a digestive 
tract disorder and being tested for rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A new era has begun,'' he wrote. ``For the first time,  
clinicians can target a specific aspect of the pathologic process'' 
in rheumatoid arthritis, rather than just reducing inflammation.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sign Abdur-Rahim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- They call Shareef Abdur-Rahim  
`The Future,' and now the Vancouver Grizzlies believe their future 
is secure. 
</P>
<P>
	With Abdur-Rahim inking a six-year, $71 million contract  
extension Wednesday, the Grizzlies enter their fourth NBA season 
with a blossoming core of players locked up for at least the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Bryant Reeves, the club's first draft pick, has a  
seven-year contract that kicks in this season, while point guard 
Mike Bibby, taken second overall in last June's draft, is signed to 
a four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this has Grizzlies president and general manager Stu  
Jackson hopeful that his young franchise, which has recorded only 
48 wins in its first three seasons, is finally beginning to turn 
the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have any hopes of having a good team one day, and  
you're in a situation like we are coming from an expansion 
situation, you've got to get a collection of good young players and 
be able to keep them and allow them to stay together and continue 
to grow,'' said Jackson. ``Because, as we've found out in the NBA, 
the experienced teams that have played together for a long time 
generally win. And that's really our mission as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signing Abdur-Rahim was key to following that mission through.  
</P>
<P>
	``For this organization to move forward, it was important to  
have Shareef as the central figure of our team for at least the 
next seven years,'' said Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It exemplifies the franchise has some stability from a player  
standpoint. It sends a message to the rest of the league that this 
is a destination point for very good players. And thirdly, it 
ensures that we've added to our foundation which we're going to 
build around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim, who led the Grizzlies in scoring in his first two  
seasons, was in the final year of his rookie contract and would 
have been eligible for free agency at the end of this season. His 
contract extension is the maximum allowable under the 
newly-negotiated collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel blessed and honored,'' said Abdur-Rahim, who  
celebrated his 22nd birthday last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest issue in Abdur-Rahim's mind was not money but  
getting assurances that the team was committed to become a 
contender. He said he got that from Jackson and owner John McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have signed this if I didn't feel like we were  
moving in the right direction,'' he said. ``Honestly, I really do 
feel good about our team and the direction that we're moving in. I 
feel good about the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim wasn't concerned that he lost a chance to cash in on  
his success, considering the limits placed on salaries in the new 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, you have to look at it and say, `This is more money  
than my parents ever made.' I really don't pay too much attention 
to that. I'm happy to be back playing basketball. I'm pleased and 
I'm blessed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim said today's NBA players are indebted to those who  
never had the opportunity to make this much money. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think about it, you have to thank the guys that came  
before me, the Dr. J's and the guys before him. All of those guys 
were worth money like this, but the league wasn't in a situation 
like this. They really paved the way for guys like myself,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing Abdur-Rahim said he would do with his newfound  
wealth is buy his mother, Aminah, a new home in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected third overall in the 1996 draft out of California,  
Abdur-Rahim is considered the foundation of the Grizzlies' future. 
A unanimous choice to the NBA rookie team in his first season, he 
followed that up with an outstanding second year in which he 
averaged 22.3 points per game, tied for sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got a lot of unfulfilled potential. I'm not  
pleased or satisfied at the point I'm at. I've got a lot of work to 
do,'' said Abdur-Rahim.

<HEADLINE> Art Center Celebrates Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- A crack-addicted mother begging for  
help from indifferent bystanders. A partly clothed man seated on a 
bathroom toilet talking about Abraham Lincoln, trousers gathered 
around his feet for effect. 
</P>
<P>
	It's social commentary that probably wouldn't raise an eyebrow  
in New York or San Francisco, but is hardly par for the course in 
the Midwestern city that claims former President Gerald Ford as its 
favorite son. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, as the Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts celebrates its  
21st birthday, it is flourishing and taking artistic risks other 
venues might consider too experimental. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an era of cutbacks in federal art funding, the nonprofit  
group has moved into a new $2 million building with gallery and 
studio space for the public and artists, as well as an alternative 
movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see this become a place for public dialogue on  
arts, even economics ... an open space where people make 
connections they haven't made before,'' says Lambert Zuidervaart, a 
former UICA president. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the UICA unique on the national art scene, experts  
say, is the way it solicits community support for diverse arts, 
ranging from painting and music to theater. It also represents a 
new breed of art organizations no longer dependent on public funds: 
Less than 10 percent of its $375,000 annual budget comes from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're on the cutting edge by combining both performance and  
visual arts,'' says Sandy Boyd, a University of Iowa professor and 
art expert. ``It's impressive ... not only in terms of the 
community, but also in terms of the forward vision. Most 
contemporary venues focus on one or the other, not both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the handful of similar ventures in other cities have had  
a tough time. Many were started in the 1970s, when more public 
funding was available, and have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Randolph Street Gallery in Chicago, a  
nonprofit group with a history of commitment to performance and 
visual arts, closed its doors, in part because of financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Finances also forced the Franklin Furnace, a 22-year-old  
nonprofit organization in New York City, to close its exhibit and 
performance space in 1997, in favor of an Internet web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Sheckler, a member and volunteer for three years, believes  
the key to UICA's success has been its ability to provide space for 
ideas outside the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got involved because of the unique art exhibits and films  
they bring to this area,'' says Mrs. Sheckler, who says she has no 
artistic background but values the chance to enjoy art. ``Today I 
came in to fill out a donor card, so that one of the seats in the 
new theater will have a plaque with my name on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People like Mrs. Sheckler are crucial to the success of  
nonprofit groups, according to Jeff Abell, a professor at Columbia 
College in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're on the dole receiving public money, you're at the  
whim of politicians,'' says Abell, who also is a former assistant 
director of the failed Randolph Street Gallery. ``If you receive 
support from committed individuals, chances are they are going to 
stick with you, even when there is controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Endowment for the Arts is in Washington, D.C.  
What do they know about the community other than the grant 
application?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the NEA's budget has shrunk significantly since its  
inception in 1965 partly because of controversy surrounding grants 
to such sexually explicit artists as Andres Serrano and 
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, but largely because conservative 
politicians have long opposed government support of symphony 
orchestras, opera and dance companies, poets, fine artists and 
musicians. Last year, the federal agency's budget was about $98 
million, down from about $175 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the UICA's operating budget more than quadrupled  
during the same time, even though its public funding has not 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, public funds made up about 40 percent of the UICA's  
then-budget of $80,000. Today, public funding accounts for less 
than 10 percent of this year's $375,000 operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
	UICA has always relied on annual membership drives,  
word-of-mouth advertising and fund-raisers like art auctions and 
beer tastings to raise money from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high price of renovating a new home has meant casting a  
wider net. That includes corporate and individual sponsors who may 
need educating about contemporary art's value, according to Hank 
Meijer, a prominent businessman who co-chaired UICA's fundraising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an entrepreneurial dimension to arts,'' says Meijer,  
who also donates to UICA. ``That's something that people who 
otherwise might not give a hoot about contemporary arts might 
relate to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message apparently is paying off. Some 200 volunteers helped  
sell tickets, answer phones and run film projectors to ensure the 
success of projects like this summer's ``The Human Zoo,'' a 
performance art piece. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to an indisposed Abe Lincoln imitator and  
drug-addicted mom, the exhibit also featured a satire entitled 
``Women Who Love Men Who Kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In written comments after the show, one audience member lauded  
the performance as ``an intellectual haunted house,'' while another 
wrote, ``You people are weird!'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's all right with Greg Bliss, director of one of the pieces,  
who believes the show made people think about the world in which 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became more of a sarcastic comment on modern culture,''  
says Bliss. ``A lot of people who saw it commented how we live 
alongside each other but do not have contact with each other.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Dead in Mich. Assault, Fire </HEADLINE>

	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Two massage parlor employees were  
killed and two others critically injured early Wednesday by 
attackers who also set the building on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Carter Bright said the victims, all women, at the  
King's Garden Health Spa were assaulted. He did not know what role 
the fire may have played in the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Bright said all of the women were Asian, and language  
differences were complicating efforts to identify them. One of the 
injured women owns the parlor, which is across the street from a 
Post cereal factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Bright also declined to discuss a possible motive and did not  
say whether anything was taken.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For Randall Cunningham, it was an unbelievable end  
to an unbelievable season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years removed from laying tile in Las Vegas and thinking  
he'd never play in the NFL again, the Minnesota Vikings quarterback 
was stunned to learn he was voted the league's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like Miss America sitting there,'' said Cunningham, who  
helped the Vikings set an NFL scoring record and come within one 
victory of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the greatest achievements I've ever received. I  
was losing my breath just sitting there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham was the winner in the closest voting in the 10-year  
history of the award. He received 37 percent of the vote from a 
nationwide panel of 200 writers and broadcasters, 2 percent more 
than Denver running back Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Davis was named the league's most valuable  
player by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Other finalists for the NFL award were Indianapolis running back  
Marshall Faulk and quarterbacks Doug Flutie of Buffalo, Steve Young 
of San Francisco and Vinny Testaverde of the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings finished the season with 556 points, breaking the  
record of 541 set by the 1983 Washington Redskins. However, 
Minnesota's march to the Super Bowl was stopped by Atlanta in the 
NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an empty feeling,'' Cunningham said. ``The feeling I  
have is it wasn't our time. The year 2000 looks better for us. It's 
a year of completion. I think we'll do better next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAD DANCER:* Atlanta kicker Morten Andersen got caught up in  
the Dirty Bird craze during the Falcons' divisional playoff victory 
over the San Francisco 49ers. But don't look for a repeat 
performance during Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a wounded bird. I just kind of put my fingers under my  
armpits and started waving my arms,'' he said of his version of the 
dance popularized by teammate Jamal Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was after a kickoff. I hit a nice ball into the end zone. I  
got a little fired up and the crowd got fired up, so I thought that 
I would give it a try. That was my last one, believe me. It is not 
going to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PARTY WORM:* There's no word on how fast tickets are going for  
the party Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra will co-host tonight at 
Liquid on South Beach. The $30 admission charge allows access to 
the Triple-X No-No Room, the Retro Drag Room and the Funk Room. 
</P>
<P>
	Last time anyone heard, they were still man and wife.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COACHING CAROUSEL:* Rich Brooks' success with the Atlanta  
Falcons may have prevented him from consideration for another head 
coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive coordinator, who has transformed one of the NFL's  
worst units into one of the best in just two years, couldn't be 
interviewed by any team other than the expansion Cleveland Browns 
until the Falcons completed their season. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Atlanta was reaching the Super Bowl for the first  
time, all the head coaching vacancies were filled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't control that,'' Brooks said Tuesday. ``At least I'm  
still coaching. I'm one of two defensive coordinators out of 30 
that are still coaching and I'm thrilled to be doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, who was 13-19 as head coach of the St. Louis Rams in  
1995-96, said the NFL should impose a moratorium on hiring until 
after the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be some sanity put to the process,'' he said.  
``Make it so a head coach can't be hired before a certain date. 
Make it after the Super Bowl, then we won't have all the discussion 
about someone getting left out or somebody not having an 
opportunity. All the teams with openings would start on the same 
day with the opportunity to hire somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it is, most teams figure they can't afford to wait until late  
January to interview a potential coach, fearing that all the other 
top candidates will wind up elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Atlanta assistant coach who was considered for another  
job was Art Shell, the former Raiders coach who now oversees the 
Falcons' offensive line. He was interviewed by Cleveland, but 
didn't get the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he doesn't favor allowing assistants to interview  
for other jobs while their teams are still in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a distraction, to be honest with you,'' he  
said. ``I would love to be thought of or interviewed. By the same 
token, there's no way you can go through that process and still be 
coaching and have your full focus on your job. No coach ought to be 
hired until after the Super Bowl.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Court Upholds Tax Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Supreme Court has upheld a tax break  
for people who donate money for scholarships at religious and other 
private schools, saying it did not represent an unconstitutional 
mingling of church and state interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-2 ruling Tuesday is the second court action in recent  
months to boost public support for private education. The U.S. 
Supreme Court on Nov. 9 refused to hear a legal challenge to 
Wisconsin's 8-year-old school voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona court said opponents failed to demonstrate that the  
credit violated either the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on 
government involvement in religion or the Arizona Constitution's 
ban on public money being used for churches or private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no indication that the authors of the Arizona  
Constitution ``intended to divorce completely any hint of religion 
from all conceivably state-related functions, nor would such a goal 
be realistically attainable in today's world,'' Chief Justice 
Thomas Zlaket wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit, Zlaket wrote, is a ``neutral adjustment mechanism  
for equalizing tax burdens and encouraging educational 
expenditures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stanley G. Feldman dissented, saying the credits  
destroyed ``any pretense of separation of church and state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law was promoted by legislators and others who had been  
thwarted in previous efforts to win approval for vouchers, which 
are cash grants to parents for tuition at private or public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the credit said they had not decided whether to  
appeal the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Witty, Bos Break Skating Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLALBO, Italy (AP) -- Chris Witty of the United States and Jan  
Bos of the Netherlands shattered the rink record for the second 
straight day Wednesday as they won 1,000-meter races at a World Cup 
speedskating meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Witty, the women's 500-meter world champion, won the 1,000  
meters race in one minute, 17.28 seconds as she edged World Cup 
leader Monique Garbrecht of Germany by 0.10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbrecht finished second also in the earlier women's 500-meter  
race, won by Japan's Tomomi Okazaki in a rink record time of 38.48 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Catriona LeMay Doan, the overall World Cup sprint  
champion and 500-meter Olympic gold medal winner, finished third, 
0.46 seconds behind Okazaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Bos, third in the men's 500-meter won by Canadian Jeremy  
Wotherspoon, set a rink record of one minute, 10.87 seconds over 
the longer distance as he led Japan's Yukinori Miyabe and 
compatriot Jan Jakko Leeuwangh. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Witty and Bos won the 1,000-meter races in record  
rink times of 1:18.29 and 1:11.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Wotherspoon continued to lead the overall standings both in the  
men's 1,000 and 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbrecht led Witty 305 to 293 points in the women's overall  
1,000-meter standings. LeMay Doan led the women's 500-meter 
standings with 300 points, ahead of Japan's Sanmiya Enko.

<P>
	Snow and blustery wind took aim at the Dakotas early today, and  
unsettled weather across the Rockies threatened to drop snow over 
Arizona and New Mexico. Rain was moving toward the Ohio Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was possible today from the northern Plains to the northern  
Great Lakes, with accumulations of up to 12 inches possible from 
the Black Hills of South Dakota through northern Wisconsin, 
accompanied by gusts that could cause drifting and whiteout 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest western snow was forecast for the Colorado Rockies  
-- where up to a foot was possible -- and over parts of eastern 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Clouds were spreading toward the Northeast, with scattered  
showers possible over the eastern Great Lakes and flurries likely 
across northern New England. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Miami's Hoeppner To Face Mentor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Ohio (AP) -- Terry Hoeppner is looking forward to the  
first week of September. 
</P>
<P>
	At his first news conference as Miami University's head football  
coach, Hoeppner twice alluded to the RedHawks' first game next 
season and how he thinks it will turn out. 
</P>
<P>
	The game will be at Northwestern. The other coach will be Randy  
Walker, who left Miami last week to coach the Wildcats. And 
Hoeppner, who has been an assistant at Miami for the last 13 years, 
is looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they have a chance from the get-go,'' Hoeppner  
said Wednesday. ``And if (Walker) hears about that, that's OK 
because we're not going to sneak up on Northwestern. We all know 
that. But they know what's coming their way also. So it will be a 
fun game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner, 51, was assistant coach and defensive coordinator  
under Walker, who rebuilt a downtrodden program in the 1990s and 
led Miami to a 10-1 mark last season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Walker left for Northwestern, Hoeppner became the top  
in-house candidate to replace him. He wanted the job and got the 
backing of his players -- a major factor in his selection. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of players met twice with athletics director Joel  
Maturi, lobbying for Hoeppner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the players' support, I don't think I would have  
gotten this job,'' Hoeppner said. 
</P>
<P>
	From the players' standpoint, hiring Hoeppner was the best way  
to keep continuity in a program that has gone 18-4 over the last 
two seasons and has the core of a 10-1 team coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one thing we wanted to emphasize: Right now, we're in a  
position to be an outstanding team next year,'' quarterback Mike 
Bath said. ``We didn't think that having a new coaching staff 
coming in and everything would be the best possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner wore a red Miami tie for his introduction in the Cradle  
of Coaches Room, a wood-paneled room at the football stadium 
decorated with framed black-and-white photographs of prominent 
Miami coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The honor roll includes Sid Gillman, Woody Hayes, Ara  
Parseghian, John Pont, Bo Schembechler, Bill Mallory and Dick Crum. 
Hoeppner has an autographed copy of Hayes' football book and is 
aware of the coaching legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to being part of the Cradle of Coaches,''  
he said. ``When Joel offered me the job yesterday, it didn't take 
me long to accept. I don't think he had the whole sentence out of 
his mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner grew up in Indiana and graduated from Franklin College.  
He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals as an undrafted free agent, 
but was hurt in training camp. He was with the Green Bay Packers 
for one year as a nonroster defensive back and never got to play in 
an NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a high school coach and an assistant at Franklin College  
before going to Miami as linebacker coach. He was elevated to 
defensive coordinator for 1995, and Miami's defense finished second 
in the nation that year in yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	His years at Miami made him a natural for the head coaching job.  
His players' lobbying made him a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly, the guy can coach,'' Maturi said.

<HEADLINE> Vikes' Cunningham Is Player of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two years ago, Randall Cunningham was laying tile  
during a one-year hiatus from football. No one wanted him, and it 
looked like he would never play in the NFL again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he was stunned to hear his name called as the  
league's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like Miss America sitting there,'' said the Minnesota  
quarterback, who helped the Vikings set an NFL scoring record and 
come within one victory of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the greatest achievements I've ever received. I  
was losing my breath just sitting there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham was the winner in the closest voting in the 10-year  
history of the award. He received 37 percent of the vote from a 
nationwide panel of 200 writers and broadcasters, 2 percent more 
than Denver running back Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Davis was named the league's most valuable  
player by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Other finalists for the NFL award were Indianapolis running back  
Marshall Faulk and quarterbacks Doug Flutie of Buffalo, Steve Young 
of San Francisco and Vinny Testaverde of the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, pressed into service after Brad Johnson broke his  
leg in Week 2, wound up NFL's top-rated passer with a 106.0 rating 
that ranks No. 8 in history. The 13-year veteran threw for 3,704 
yards and 34 touchdowns as the Vikings became only the third team 
to win 15 regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings finished the season with 556 points, breaking the  
record of 541 set by the 1983 Washington Redskins. However, 
Minnesota's march to the Super Bowl was stopped by Atlanta in the 
NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an empty feeling,'' Cunningham said. ``The feeling I  
have is it wasn't our time. The year 2000 looks better for us. It's 
a year of completion. I think we'll do better next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham spent 11 seasons in Philadelphia, where he set an NFL  
career record for most rushing yards by a quarterback. But his 
individual efforts weren't enough to lift the Eagles past the first 
round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out the 1996 season, returning home to Las Vegas to go  
into tile construction. The Vikings signed him before the 1997 
season, and he was content to be the backup until Johnson's injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all that you go through is a good time, so something like  
this is amazing to me,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	In connection with the award, sponsor Miller Brewing Company  
will donate $30,000 to Minneapolis-based CAUSE Ministries. 
Cunningham has been active in the organization's Christian outreach 
programs for several years.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Dr. Charged With Assaulting Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERRICK, Pa. (AP) -- A doctor attacked a 14-year-old boy  
participating in the Special Olympic Pennsylvania Winter Games 
because he thought the youth was calling him names, state police 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Irais Leon, 38, of Johnson City, N.Y., was charged with  
simple assault, harassment and stalking, and disorderly conduct. 
The charges stem from the alleged attack on a boy Tuesday at the 
Elk Mountain Ski Resort in northeastern Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim had just completed his part in the Games when he was  
riding the ski lift to the top of the slopes and yelling to his 
friends skiing below, according to a state police report. At one 
point, the passengers on the lift called each other ``Bubba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leon was skiing below and apparently thought the teen-agers were  
yelling at him, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon was in the lift line at the bottom when he saw the youths.  
He left the line, removed his skis and beat the victim, state 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim suffered a black eye and a bruised eyeball.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania Special Olympics did not immediately return a  
call for comment Wednesday night. Leon's number was not listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon was released on $5,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Pope's St. Louis Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Comments by Pope John Paul II at Tuesday's arrival ceremony at  
Lambert Airport in St. Louis: 

</P>
<P>
	``Although St. Louis is the only place I am able to visit at  
this time, I feel close to all the Catholics of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times of trial, tests of national character, in the  
history of every country. America has not been immune to them. One 
such time of trial is closely connected with St. Louis. Here, the 
famous Dred Scott case was heard. And in that case, the Supreme 
Court of the United States subsequently declared an entire class of 
human beings -- people of African descent -- outside the boundaries 
of the national community and the Constitutions protection. After 
untold suffering and with enormous effort, that situation has, at 
least in part, been reversed.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms,  
cherishes, and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that 
seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the 
terminally ill, the handicapped, and others considered ``unuseful'' 
-- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life.  
And the values underlying that vision will greatly depend on 
whether the nation continues to honor and revere the family as the 
basic unit of society.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to have another opportunity to thank the American  
people for the countless works of human goodness and solidarity 
which, from the beginning, have been such a part of the history of 
your country. At the same time, I know that you will hear my plea 
to open wide your hearts to the ever increasing plight and urgent 
needs of our less fortunate brothers and sisters throughout the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This too -- the spirit of compassion, concern and generous  
sharing -- must be part of the `Spirit of St. Louis.'''

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Quotes from Super Bowl players and coaches  
Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a good talker, I'm a great talker because I do it so  
often. I think if you do something well enough you become great at 
it. Michael Jordan was a good basketball player once he got into 
the league. But he shot so many jumpers and went to the hole so 
many times that he became a great basketball player -- one of the 
greatest of all time. I've kind of done that. When I was in 
college, I'd get in the mirror 20 minutes at night before I'd go to 
bed and talk to myself. I'd ask questions, answer questions and 
just talk in general. I've kind of perfected it now. '' -- Broncos 
TE Shannon Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to try to intimidate them a little bit.  
You don't want Terrell Davis to think he's going to be running up 
and down the field without taking some blows and some big hits. 
We'll have Eugene (Robinson) and William (White) come up and give 
him hits, even if he doesn't have the ball, just to give him some 
knocks. Just to make him aware of the fact that someone is going to 
be on him every play.'' -- Falcons CB Michael Booker, on trying to 
stop Denver's running game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway is Colorado. They should change the name. He's done  
things in Denver no one else has done. When people find out I'm a 
Bronco, they say: `Do you know John Elway?' Duh. I would think so. 
Then they ask what he's like. What type of guy is he? I don't go 
anywhere without somebody saying I play for John Elway's team. They 
should change the name to the Elway Broncos.'' -- Broncos CB Ray 
Crockett, on Elway's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't stop anybody.'' Falcons defensive coordinator Rich  
Brooks, recalling the unit he inherited when he was hired two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough getting up and going in to play for a defense that  
you knew didn't have a chance going into the game.'' Falcons DE 
Chuck Smith, on the state of the defense before Brooks' arrival. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time in other years, it seemed I was always watching  
(former) teammates playing in the Super Bowl. Andre (Rison). Brett 
(Favre). But I never wanted to leave. So this is much sweeter to 
me. And I can appreciate it more. I wanted to be part of the 
solution here for the Atlanta Falcons after so many years of 
losing.'' -- Falcons LB Jessie Tuggle. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the guys are friends in the league now and we hang out.  
It's not like in the 70's when, if you saw Pittsburgh Steelers and 
Oakland Raiders in a bar, you might see a rumble.'' -- Falcons DE 
Chuck Smith, on the lack of animosity between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of different. It's a little mix of everything. I'm  
still trying to get used to it, the nationalities and all the 
different restaurants. It's nice, very nice. Great weather. I 
wouldn't mind being here for the next eight or nine Super Bowls.'' 
-- Falcons RB Jamal Anderson, on his impression of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always go into it just like you do a game -- you  
expect to win,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves, on undergoing heart 
surgery last month.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Carlos Baerga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals filled their need for a  
second baseman, agreeing Wednesday to a $1.25 million, one-year 
contract with free agent Carlos Baerga. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, a switch hitter, was a three-time All-Star with  
Cleveland but his production has dropped off sharply since he was 
traded to the New York Mets in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlos is an experienced, quality infielder who gives us good  
offensive potential at second base and versatility from both sides 
of the plate,'' Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' second baseman for the past two seasons, Delino  
DeShields, agreed in December to a $12.5 million, three-year 
contract with Baltimore. St. Louis considered signing Pat Meares, 
let go last month by Minnesota, and moving him from shortstop to 
second base. Meares was seeking about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, 30, had his best season in 1993, when he hit .321 with  
21 homers and 114 RBIs. He hit .314 the following season, dropped 
to .254 with Cleveland in 1996, then hit .193 during the rest of 
the season with the Mets and .281 and .266 during his full seasons 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, coming off a $21.4 million, six-year contract, has a  
.293 career average with 121 homers and 676 RBIs. He gets a $1 
million salary, which will be increased to $1.25 million if he's on 
the opening day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing continues the revamp of the Cardinals. First baseman  
Mark McGwire and center fielder Ray Lankford are the only remaining 
starters from last year's opening day lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of last season, St. Louis has signed outfielders  
Eric Davis and Darren Bragg and reliever Scott Radinsky, and traded 
for reliever Ricky Bottalico, starter Garrett Stephenson and 
shortstop Edgar Renteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie J.D. Drew is expected to start in left field, replacing  
Ron Gant, who was traded to Philadelphia in the Bottalico deal.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Warns America's Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Welcomed like a rock star by a crowd of 20,000,  
Pope John Paul II warned America's young people against drifting 
into a world ``filled with darkness'' and rife with violence, drugs 
and easy sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are each called to be a disciple of Christ,'' he told a  
jubilant youth rally Tuesday night at a packed sports arena, where 
his somber message sharply contrasted with his listeners' shrieks 
of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's 30-hour visit to the American heartland kept up a  
mission begun in Mexico to rally his flock against a ``culture of 
death'' as the church heads into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people were expected to turn out today for his  
major public event in St. Louis, a Mass at the Trans World Dome. He 
is to return to Rome tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	During the youth rally at the Kiel Center, the crowd waved white  
handkerchiefs in welcome, chanting, ``John Paul II, we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just such an incredible role model, someone you can  
really look up to,'' said Sarah Einhorn, 14, of Effingham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports were a metaphor for his message, and the youths presented  
him with a hockey jersey that read: ``John Paul II No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turned somber when describing ``the darkness of children who  
go hungry and even die. The darkness of homeless people of who lack 
work and proper medical care. The darkness of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong when so many people are  
overcome by hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives,'' 
the pope said. Instead, he said, ``Do not listen to those who 
encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility. Do not listen to 
those who tell you that chastity is passe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope appeared tired during the evening event.  
His shoulders were slumped and his left hand trembled. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was John Paul's fifth to the U.S. mainland, and his  
message contained a familiar theme -- that Americans should use 
their freedoms responsibly and strive for a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	During a ceremony at the airport upon his arrival Tuesday  
afternoon, he likened the U.S. debate over abortion and euthanasia 
to the one over slavery, calling the outcome a test of national 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial today,'' he said with  
President Clinton seated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms,  
cherishes and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that seeks 
to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the 
terminally ill, the handicapped and others considered `unuseful' to 
be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a leading opponent of capital punishment and  
has intervened in several cases in the United States. Missouri's 
Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was 
to have taken place while the pope was in town. Papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, John Paul avoided certain sources of tension  
with the United States and dropped from the advance text of his 
speech any mention of land mines, drug trafficking or U.S. air 
strikes against Iraq, something the Vatican has assailed as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told John Paul at the airport ceremony. 
``We honor you for standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and  
the pope, abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica 
Lewinsky affair not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley 
said. The two did discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said.

<P>
	``He's just such an incredible role model, someone you can  
really look up to,'' said Sarah Einhorn, 14, of Effingham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports were a metaphor for his message, and the youths presented  
him with a hockey jersey that read: ``John Paul II No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turned somber when describing ``the darkness of children who  
go hungry and even die. The darkness of homeless people of who lack 
work and proper medical care. The darkness of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong when so many people are  
overcome by hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives,'' 
the pope said. Instead, he said, ``Do not listen to those who 
encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility. Do not listen to 
those who tell you that chastity is passe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope appeared tired during the evening event.  
His shoulders were slumped and his left hand trembled. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was John Paul's fifth to the U.S. mainland, and his  
message contained a familiar theme -- that Americans should use 
their freedoms responsibly and strive for a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	During a ceremony at the airport upon his arrival Tuesday  
afternoon, he likened the U.S. debate over abortion and euthanasia 
to the one over slavery, calling the outcome a test of national 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial today,'' he said with  
President Clinton seated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms,  
cherishes and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that seeks 
to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the 
terminally ill, the handicapped and others considered `unuseful' to 
be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a leading opponent of capital punishment and  
has intervened in several cases in the United States. Missouri's 
Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was 
to have taken place while the pope was in town. Papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, John Paul avoided certain sources of tension  
with the United States and dropped from the advance text of his 
speech any mention of land mines, drug trafficking or U.S. air 
strikes against Iraq, something the Vatican has assailed as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told John Paul at the airport ceremony. 
``We honor you for standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and  
the pope, abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica 
Lewinsky affair not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley 
said. The two did discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Faces Close Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- On the eve of the Nagano Winter Olympics, Juan  
Antonio Samaranch bragged about the success and health of the 
Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something isn't broken, don't fix it,'' he said. ``The  
Olympic movement is in very good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Samaranch is besieged with calls for his  
resignation. Many blame him for the worst corruption scandal in 
Olympic history, which has prompted the expulsion or forced 
resignation of nine International Olympic Committee members 
implicated in misconduct in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard was appointed IOC president in 1980 and  
is the third longest-serving behind American Avery Brundage, who 
served from 1952-72, and Pierre de Coubertin, the French baron who 
founded the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	When Samaranch took over in 1980, the Olympic movement had been  
hit by terrorism, was facing bankruptcy and was brought to its 
knees by the catastrophic boycott of the 1980 Summer Games in 
Moscow by the United States, Canada and 52 other nations and 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
	A former diplomat, he used quiet diplomacy and his skills as a  
businessman to turn the Olympics into the most prestigious sporting 
event in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is credited with building the games into a  
multibillion-dollar industry, largely based on lucrative TV rights 
deals and the fierce competition among cities to land them. 
</P>
<P>
	With success has also come criticism about the rampant  
commercialism of the games. Samaranch has been characterized as a 
despot ruling over an inherently undemocratic, self-appointed body 
that lacks the normal financial controls of a multinational 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the IOC is incapable of policing itself, suggesting  
that Samaranch's greatest legacy to the Olympics would be his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not thinking of any kind of resignation,'' he has said,  
adding there wasn't ``a single'' call within the IOC for him to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to his authoritarian image, Samaranch describes himself  
as ``the conductor'' who delegates to the 11-member IOC executive 
board. ``I'm not the boss,'' he likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is a small, shy man, visibly uncomfortable in the  
public spotlight. He's the IOC's first full-time executive and the 
first to live full time in Lausanne, Switzerland, the IOC's 
headquarters. He receives no salary, although he has said the next 
IOC president should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC pays the rent on a small hotel suite in Lausanne, which  
costs $220 a day when he's there and $72 when he's away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' Samaranch said. ``I am a normal man. My  
style of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I 
have no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board member Richard Pound described his lifestyle  
as ``practically monastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former boxer and roller hockey goalie who never competed for  
an Olympic medal, Samaranch grew up in Barcelona, Spain, as the son 
of a wealthy textile magnate. He still holds the honorary title of 
president of the Barcelona-based La Caixa, Spain's largest savings 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed an IOC member in 1966 and came to the  
presidency after three years as Spain's ambassador to the 
then-Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of his tenure came in 1992 when Barcelona played  
host to what's considered the most successful Summer Games of all 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	A low moment came earlier in the same year with the publication  
of the book ``The Lords of the Rings,'' which charged the Olympic 
movement with being corrupt, undemocratic and consumed by 
commercialism and greed. 
</P>
<P>
	The book recounted Samaranch's rise through Spain's political  
ranks during the 36-year rule of dictator Francisco Franco, and 
describes him as a ``dedicated Francoist'' who supported Franco's 
conglomeration of right-wing parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch called the book full of ``lies'' and ``mistakes.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Spain know very well that I was collaborating  
with the Franco regime, like many others,'' he added. ``We are very 
proud of what we did. We went from the Franco regime to a full 
democracy in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, said the book gave him a reason to run for another  
term. He was re-elected in 1993, and in 1995 IOC members raised the 
retirement age, which cleared the way for him to run again. He was 
re-elected in 1997 and has vowed to stay until his term ends in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	He has appointed 94 IOC members. The body had 115 members,  
including Samaranch, before the nine resigned or were expelled. Of 
the 14 implicated in the scandal, Samaranch appointed eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch will put his leadership to a vote of confidence at a  
special IOC session March 17-18. Only if he fails to get the 
members' endorsement will he resign, Samaranch said. The chances of 
that are remote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain the Olympic movement will emerge from the crisis  
stronger than ever,'' Samaranch said.

<HEADLINE> Lott: Senate To Be Busy After Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott today  
promised a ``burst of activity'' after the impeachment trial to 
impress on Americans that Congress is working on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, in a breakfast speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  
listed education, military pay and the year 2000 computer problem 
as among the first areas the Senate will address when the trial is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mississippi Republican said he thought the trial would be  
over in ``two weeks at the most, and then we have work to do. We 
need to get a burst of activity to show that we are attending to 
the people's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first bills on the Senate floor, he said, would be  
``education flexibility'' legislation sponsored by Sens. Bill 
Frist, R-Tenn., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., to extend a program giving 
state and local governments more freedom to try innovative 
approaches to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that before the end of February the Senate also hopes to  
pass legislation raising the pay of military personnel. ``We've got 
to pay attention to the fact that morale is down, we are losing 
ground in readiness and on pay and pensions we are shortchanging 
them and they are getting out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within 10 days after the trial ``we're are going to make the  
senators all come to the Senate chamber and sit down and we are 
going to get a report'' about the status of efforts to correct 
computer glitches that could cause serious disruptions in basic 
services with the arrival of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said legislation is being prepared that will help the private  
sector deal with the problem without facing a rash of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also will take up bills on the Federal Aviation  
Administration, juvenile crime, bankruptcy reform, financial 
services reform, a second round of changes in welfare programs and 
fast-track trade authority for the president, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that much time and debate will be spent working out  
differences with the administration on such major issues as Social 
Security reform, saving Medicare and protecting consumer rights 
from health care abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Republicans would press for an across-the-board tax  
rate cut and would oppose administration plans to raise tobacco 
taxes or spend the budget surplus on Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said it was unlikely that electricity deregulation will  
pass this year and added that ``the idea of this global warming 
treaty is going nowhere.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Sues U.S. Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Venezuelan government sued the leading U.S.  
tobacco companies Wednesday in the hopes of recovering the public 
health-care costs of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For decades, Big Tobacco's conduct has caused an incalculable  
loss of life, disease, disability, pain, suffering, illness and 
economic loss to the users of Big Tobacco's products,'' said the 
suit, filed in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks billions of dollars in damages, said attorney  
Steven Marks, who is representing Venezuela in the claim. He said 
the lawyers have hired economists to help calculate the damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela claims it suffered economic losses because of  
decreased productivity of its labor force, lost taxes and lost 
gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
	``It mirrors the state and federal claims that were filed  
against the tobacco companies,'' Marks said. ``Venezuelan lives are 
worth just as much as American lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defendant British American Tobacco Co. Ltd, which makes Lucky  
Strike, Kent and other cigarettes, controls about 76 percent of the 
Venezuelan cigarette market. Philip Morris Inc. controls most of 
the remaining market, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also names R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown and  
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett Group 
Inc. Research organizations the Tobacco Institute Inc.; The Council 
For Tobacco; Research-U.S.A. Inc. and the Tobacco Institute 
Research Committee are also named. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks said Venezuela tried for 10 months to negotiate with the  
tobacco companies -- seeking restrictions or limits on cigarette 
marketing, increased education on the dangers of smoking and 
additional cancer research funds. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some companies refused to meet with government  
officials. Others refused to discuss compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in Miami because defendant the Brooke Group  
Ltd. Inc. is based in the city and the city has ties to Venezuelan 
government and business offices. Miami is also better suited to 
hear a case involving a Spanish-speaking country, Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Tobacco has controlled virtually the entire cigarette market  
in Venezuela. The companies also knew their products were addictive 
and caused illness that killed Venezuelans, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies have also attempted to thwart or delay the  
country's attempts to reduce tobacco use, the suit claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks said his law firm -- Podhurst, Orseck, Josefsberg, Eaton,  
Meadow, Olin and Perwin of Miami -- is also preparing lawsuits on 
behalf of Ecuador and the Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris dismissed the suit as inappropriate.  
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuela lawsuit was filed ``by the wrong party, in the  
wrong place, for the wrong reasons,'' said Greg Little, associate 
general counsel for Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson Corp., the third largest U.S. cigarette  
maker, said lawsuits filed by Central and South American countries 
are an attempt to capitalize on settlements reached in suits filed 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They represent a cynical attempt on the part of foreign  
government officials to hijack the U.S. legal system. These matters 
should properly be handled by the courts and with the domestic 
cigarette companies in these countries,'' said spokesman Mark 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds and Brooke Group, which owns defendant Liggett  
Group Inc., declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala became the first country last May to sue U.S.  
cigarette-makers to recover damages for treating sick smokers. 
Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Panama have since filed lawsuits in the 
United States or Puerto Rico, and Brazil announced last month that 
it was planning to sue cigarette manufacturers operating there. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco giants settled suits in November with 46 states over  
claims for Medicaid spending on sick smokers, agreeing to pay $206 
billion to the states over 25 years. They had previously settled 
with four states for about $40 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Philip Morris, which reported a 79 percent decline in  
fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, were down $1.81 1/4 to close at 
$46.43 3/4 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR 
Nabisco, the parent company of R.J. Reynolds, was up 18 3/4 cents to 
close at $27 a share on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans $800M for Job Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to boost the skills of American  
workers, President Clinton is unveiling more than $800 million in 
new and increased spending to retrain dislocated workers, teach 
illiterate adults to read and increase job opportunities for 
at-risk youth. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest details from the budget Clinton outlined in his State  
of the Union address include increased grants for adult literacy 
programs, a toll-free number that connects displaced workers to 
unemployment and retraining resources, and $50 million to create 
jobs for disadvantaged kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joining Communications Workers of America President  
Morty Bahr and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman today at an Oakton, 
Va., training facility jointly operated by AT&AMP;T, Lucent 
Technologies and the union to unveil the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an initiative by the president to help ensure that all  
of our workers are prepared for the 21st century,'' said an 
administration official who asked that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, which must be approved by the  
Republican-controlled Congress, call for $190 million in increased 
spending in fiscal 2000 over last year's figures for adult 
education and family literacy programs, $350 million more for job 
retraining assistance, and $303 million to increase youth 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the initiatives is Clinton's conviction that the income  
gap in America reflects a skills gap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating  
economy in history. But we can do even better -- in building a 21st 
century economy that embraces all Americans,'' Clinton said in his 
State of the Union speech. ``Today's income gap is largely a skills 
gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft of the proposals shows Clinton is asking Congress to  
expand the Workforce Investment Act signed into law last year to 
streamline the job training system into grants that allow workers 
to choose what kind of training they need. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants a five-year commitment to the Workforce  
Reinvestment Act, which was enacted last year, that would ensure 
``every displaced worker will receive training if they need it,'' 
according to a draft of the proposals. Among other things, the act 
provided for ``one-stop career'' centers to make it easier for 
those out of work to get assistance and information about where 
they could learn new skills for new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking a $95 million increase in adult  
education grants to increase the number of teachers and the 
resources available for adults who are learning to read. The 
president also proposes a 10 percent tax credit for employers who 
provide workplace literacy programs. 
</P>
<P>
	For disadvantaged youth, the package calls for a new $100  
million program promoting partnerships between schools and 
employers to reduce school dropout rates and a new $50 million 
program that would help empowerment zone businesses increase the 
number of at-risk youths hired.

<HEADLINE> Ford-Volvo Deal Reportedly Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Sweden's Volvo AB is apparently ready to sell its  
automotive operations to Ford Motor Co., with an announcement 
possible as early as today, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	In a story on its Web site Wednesday, Business Week magazine  
quoted unnamed sources as saying Ford's $6 billion offer won out 
over a $7 billion bid by Italy's Fiat SpA, which also wanted to 
purchase Volvo's commercial truck business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's Automotive Reports, also quoting unnamed sources, said on  
its Web site that Ford president Jac Nasser was in New York earlier 
this week to work out the deal. The trade publication said Volvo 
had been asking $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman John Spelich declined to comment, while messages  
left at Volvo's North American offices in Rockleigh, N.J., were not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo has been one of several auto companies considering  
possible mergers or acquisitions since last year's big merger of 
Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG. Business Week said Germany's 
Volkswagen AG was among the final bidders for Volvo. Most of the 
speculation in recent weeks, however, has focused on a deal with 
either Fiat or Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has nearly $24 billion in cash, compared with Fiat's $1.5  
billion reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo presumably would retain its commercial truck operations in  
a deal with Ford. Two weeks ago, Volvo bought a 12.85 percent share 
in rival truck maker Scania, also based in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquiring Volvo would allow Ford to expand its 10 percent share  
of the European market by offering a broader line of near-luxury 
sedans and station wagons. Volvo would also help Ford in its effort 
to market itself as a leader in automotive safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a lot of sense for Ford,'' said analyst Joe Phillippi  
of Lehman Brothers. ``As long as they don't overpay for it in the 
eyes of the Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford already owns Jaguar Cars Ltd., whose cars are priced well  
above Volvo's. Ford's European cars, meanwhile, are priced below 
Volvo's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing is there's so little overlap, even with  
Jaguar,'' Phillippi said. ``Volvo prices end way before Jaguar 
prices start, so that's not really an issue. In Europe, it helps 
them enormously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo sold almost 400,000 cars last year, with 100,200 of them  
in the United States, or more than a quarter of all of its sales. 
Sweden was its second-largest market, with 53,600 cars sold. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time Volvo has been involved in merger  
discussions. Stockholders blocked a proposed merger with Renault SA 
of France in 1993. Opponents, mostly small shareholders in Sweden 
and mid-level managers, were worried about control of Volvo and 
jobs moving outside Sweden, where manufacturing costs are high. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be less of a concern with Ford as an owner, based on  
the way the world's No. 2 automaker has handled its acquisition of 
Jaguar, keeping it as a largely separate entity based in England. 
Ford paid $2.5 billion for Jaguar in 1989, but pumped an additional 
$3.5 billion into the company's aging assembly plants; the British 
automaker only recently has returned to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the DaimlerChrysler merger, a Ford-Volvo deal would do  
little to address the industry's problem of too much production 
capacity. Because there is no product overlap, there would be no 
immediate need to close plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some would argue this is not necessarily good for the  
industry,'' Phillippi said. ``You need a bunch of weak players with 
a lot of excess capacity to get together and close a bunch of 
capacity. That's really going to be hard.''

<HEADLINE>  Senate OKs Witnesses for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate blocked  
dismissal of the impeachment case against President Clinton on 
Wednesday and then voted for new testimony from Monica Lewinsky and 
two other witnesses -- but by margins well short of the two-thirds 
that would be needed to oust the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of roll calls in the hushed Senate chamber, all 55  
Republicans voted against dismissal and for the witnesses opposed 
by the White House. They were joined by a single Democrat, Russell 
Feingold of Wisconsin, leaving them far below the 67 needed for 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will not be removed from office,'' Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle declared moments later in comments 
swiftly seconded by the White House. ``For the good of the country 
and in keeping with the Constitution it is now time to end this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the votes, Daschle and Majority Leader Trent Lott  
were at work trying to fashion a bipartisan agreement for the 
balance of the trial, including videotaped depositions of Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon, Lott told reporters the two parties had  
exchanged offers and he said he was hopeful for agreement by 
Thursday on a timetable for a final vote on the articles of 
impeachment by mid-February. He suggested the witness depositions -- 
possibly videotaped -- could take place over the weekend or Monday, 
and left open the question of whether the White House might then 
decide it wanted witnesses of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, too, said he was hopeful of an agreement within 24  
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no debate on the Senate floor before Wednesday's two  
votes, but numerous senators issued written statements afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is premature to dismiss this case at the present  
time,'' said Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican who had 
previously expressed misgivings about witnesses. He said he 
believed the prosecution ``should be allowed the opportunity to 
demonstrate whether there is new and significant information that 
would justify live testimony.'' 
</P>

	Apart from Feingold, Democrats were unanimous that whatever  
Clinton's wrongs, they weren't impeachable offenses. ``However 
reprehensible that conduct was, I do not believe it is 
constitutional grounds for removing from office a president elected 
by the people,'' said North Dakota's Byron Dorgan. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers have warned repeatedly that calling any  
witnesses would mean protracted delays to allow for time for a 
review of documents thus far withheld from the president's team.

the White House would not seek to delay the depositions with a

Maryland mistakenly sided with the Republicans against dismissal,

not be interpreted as a signal that I intend to vote to convict the

their leader, Rep. Henry Hyde. That was to allow Lott to hold 
Republicans in line at a time when many are eager to end a trial 
that remains unpopular with the public.

censure,'' he said.

could be difficult to achieve, given the tricky constitutional 
issues involved and the disagreement among lawmakers about the 
extent of Clinton's transgressions.

would conclude that Clinton had lied and obstructed justice.

information about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to take to the 
grand jury.

<HEADLINE>  Senate OKs Witnesses for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate blocked  
dismissal of the impeachment case against President Clinton on 
Wednesday and then voted for new testimony from Monica Lewinsky and 
two other witnesses -- but by margins well short of the two-thirds 
that would be needed to oust the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of roll calls in the hushed Senate chamber, all 55  
Republicans voted against dismissal and for the witnesses opposed 
by the White House. They were joined by a single Democrat, Russell 
Feingold of Wisconsin, leaving them far below the 67 needed for 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will not be removed from office,'' Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle declared moments later in comments 
swiftly seconded by the White House. ``For the good of the country 
and in keeping with the Constitution it is now time to end this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the votes, Daschle and Majority Leader Trent Lott  
were at work trying to fashion a bipartisan agreement for the 
balance of the trial, including videotaped depositions of Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon, Lott told reporters the two parties had  
exchanged offers and he said he was hopeful for agreement by 
Thursday on a timetable for a final vote on the articles of 
impeachment by mid-February. He suggested the witness depositions -- 
possibly videotaped -- could take place over the weekend or Monday, 
and left open the question of whether the White House might then 
decide it wanted witnesses of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, too, said he was hopeful of an agreement within 24  
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no debate on the Senate floor before Wednesday's two  
votes, but numerous senators issued written statements afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is premature to dismiss this case at the present  
time,'' said Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican who had 
previously expressed misgivings about witnesses. He said he 
believed the prosecution ``should be allowed the opportunity to 
demonstrate whether there is new and significant information that 
would justify live testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Feingold, Democrats were unanimous that whatever  
Clinton's wrongs, they weren't impeachable offenses. ``However 
reprehensible that conduct was, I do not believe it is 
constitutional grounds for removing from office a president elected 
by the people,'' said North Dakota's Byron Dorgan.

<HEADLINE> Minor Leaguers Can Play in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Olympic baseball is taking out the ping and  
bringing on the minor league pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball will allow any players not on 40-man  
rosters to participate in Olympic qualifying this year and at the 
2000 Sydney Games. Because of that, the Olympics are switching from 
metal bats to wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, the new executive director of baseball  
operations in the commissioner's office, on Wednesday said that 
Olympic teams will have access to players about five days before 
this summer's Pan American Games, which serve as the regional 
Olympic qualifying tournament. The Pan Am Games baseball tournament 
is scheduled for July 24-Aug. 2 at Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	In switching to wood bats, the Olympics will follow the rule of  
professional baseball in the United States and Canada. Baseball 
became an official Olympic sport for the 1992 Barcelona Games, and 
metal bats were used both that year and during the 1996 Atlanta 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said the nature of baseball made it unnecessary for  
national teams to need players for extensive preparation time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players will have been playing a full season,'' he said  
during an interview with The Associated Press. ``It's a matter of 
relay plays and cutoff throws and learning signs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the United States sending a team of college players, the  
Americans finished fourth in 1992 and third in 1996 as Cuba won the 
gold medal twice. The International Baseball Association voted in 
September 1996 to open Olympic baseball to professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the NBA, which sent Dream Teams to Barcelona and Atlanta,  
and the NHL, which sent all-star teams to represent the United 
States and Canada at last year's Nagano Winter Games, baseball has 
no intention of sending major leaguers. Most of the minor leaguers 
in Sydney are expected to come from Double-A and Triple-A rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Games are scheduled for Sept. 16-Oct. 1, the final  
two weeks of the American and National leagues' 2000 regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said all nations could have players who are not on  
40-man rosters for Olympic qualifying tournaments, even if it 
interrupts their minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Players not on 40-man rosters generally are in their first three  
years of professional baseball. If they are not put on a 40-man 
roster after that, they become subject to the December major league 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch to wood from metal should have a major effect on  
Olympic play. While 45 homers were hit in Barcelona, players 
combined for 110 homers in 28 games -- an average of 3.9 per game -- 
at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium during the last Olympics. Cuba 
alone hit 38 homers in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Seiler, the director of national team baseball operations  
for the U.S. Baseball Federation, said the switch to wood bats had 
not yet been put in writing but would be included in the technical 
instructions for the Pan Am Games. The U.S. team will be chosen 
jointly by the USBF, the commissioner's office and the Major League 
Baseball Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	By using minor leaguers, he said most teams would be improved,  
since Latin America is heavily represented among the 30 major 
league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all be pulling from same pool level-wise,'' Seiler said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines Soc. Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today his proposal to  
earmark more than 60 percent of the projected budget surplus for 
Social Security would ``actually grow the American economy while 
preparing for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, along with Vice President Al Gore, played host to  
a panel of economists and other experts to discuss ways to ensure 
that both Social Security and Medicare remain solvent well into the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
	He explained his State of the Union address plan to transfer 62  
percent of the projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years, 
more than $2.7 trillion, to Social Security. Once Social Security 
is secure, he said, he wants 15 percent of surpluses to go to 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he did not  
object to the idea of using 62 percent of surpluses for Social 
Security, but he would like to see the rest go back to taxpayers in 
the form of a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president hasn't gone far enough, but he tiptoed out in  
the water,'' Lott said in a Chamber of Commerce speech today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton argued that, just as the nation worked carefully to  
erase its fat budget deficits, it must be cautious in crafting a 
plan to shore up Social Security and Medicare so that it won't 
buckle under the weight of baby-boomer retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current prosperity in this country was created not by rash  
actions in Washington, but by ... getting the deficit down, getting 
into balance, bringing the interest rates down and bringing the 
economy back,'' Clinton said. ``We also should face the challenge 
of the aging of America in the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called preserving Social Security and Medicare ``profoundly  
moral responsibilities,'' and said Clinton was correct to try to 
defuse the political charge around those two programs in order to 
do what is necessary to ensure their survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has transformed what used to be called a third  
rail into a second chance for America's senior citizens,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton released letters from government accountants backing his  
assertion that if his proposals are accepted, Social Security would 
gain more than 20 years of financial health and Medicare more than 
a decade. Social Security would not run short of cash until 2055, 
instead of 2032 as now projected, and Medicare would be able to pay 
its bills until 2020, instead of 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without his proposal to invest some Social Security money  
in the stock market, the accountants said, Social Security's 
viability would be significantly extended -- until 2049. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan that would actually grow the American economy  
while preparing for the future,'' Clinton said. ``From my point of 
view, this is a very good thing for Americans of all ages, without 
regard to their political party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, some Republican lawmakers have charged that Clinton's  
proposal is little more than an accounting gimmick, instead of real 
reform that would help control the two retirement programs' drain 
on national resources in the future.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Warns About Exotic Sea Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- They sound like creepy science fiction  
plots: Asian clams devouring plankton in San Francisco Bay, comb 
jelly decimating Black Sea anchovies and predatory snails 
overtaking oyster beds in Chesapeake Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called ``bioinvasion'' scenarios, however, are real and may  
be coming to a coast near you. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists warned Tuesday that the number of sea invaders has  
grown exponentially -- and swelled into a multibillion-dollar 
problem -- as fishermen inadvertently dump exotic species, foreign 
bacteria and viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	The critters are often found lurking in cargo holds or in  
ballast water, pumped in to stabilize ships during their voyage and 
then pumped out when they reach their destination. Once the 
invaders take hold, they can devour native species, alter food 
chains and change whole ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of global marine hitchhikers and now is the  
time to take action,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who 
spoke at the first international Marine Bioinvasions Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bioinvasion costs government and industry $123 billion a year to  
control on land and at sea, Babbitt said, citing a study released 
at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	In the San Francisco Bay area -- where there are more than 250  
known exotic invaders -- one of the most voracious predators has 
been the Asian clam introduced in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The mud-dwelling clams feed by filtering out food particles in  
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clams have been filtering out so much of the water that we  
haven't seen annual blooms of phytoplankton since the 1980s,'' said 
Andy Cohen, a marine biologist for the San Francisco Estuary 
Institute in Richmond, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Creatures that eat phytoplankton have been stripped of an  
essential food source, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along New England coasts, a type of Japanese algae is  
aggressively taking root, while a New England organism called a 
comb jelly was exported to the Black Sea and has decimated an 
economically important anchovy fishery. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists used to introduce predator species to control  
invaders. But now, fearing new species could further threaten 
ecosystems, scientists are trying to stop the invaders before they 
make it to foreign waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt called for mandatory ballast water exchange programs and  
urged Congress to work on bioinvasion before it becomes a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballast exchange programs would require a ship coming from the  
Mediterranean, for example, to dump its ballast water in deep seas 
-- at least 200 miles from shore and about 2,000 feet deep -- then 
replace it with deep sea water. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory is that organisms found in deep sea water have a  
harder time surviving in water closer to the coasts, and vice 
versa, said Deb Tanis, a Massachusetts project manager working on a 
ballast exchange program with New Zealand.

<HEADLINE>  Germans Remember Holocaust Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germans marked their fourth annual  
Holocaust memorial day today with ceremonies at former 
concentration camps and warnings to keep alive the memory of Nazi 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the events commemorated an estimated 10,000  
gay victims of the Nazi regime with a ceremony at the Sachsenhausen 
camp at Oranienburg outside Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	But the memorial day also illustrated the nation's growing  
uncertainty about how new generations of Germans should remember 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	President Roman Herzog, speaking in parliament, said recent  
renewed debate in Germany about the Nazi past showed ``that we have 
not yet found this lasting form of memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Germany must build a national Holocaust memorial, a  
project that politicians and intellectuals have debated for a 
decade. ``We Germans must build this memorial for our own sake,'' 
he said. ``Nazism is our common, terrible heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has backed a design unveiled this  
month by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman that calls for a memorial, 
library and Holocaust research center in central Berlin, near the 
Brandenburg Gate. Parliament hopes to approve the memorial this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	As government flags flew at half-staff, Schroeder warned Germans  
to stay on guard against racism and intolerance and reminded them 
of their duty to preserve the memory of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every attempt to withdraw from that historical responsibility  
is doomed to failure,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	His comment appeared partly aimed at German author Martin  
Walser, who set off controversy last fall by suggesting he was 
weary of repeated reminders of the genocidal crimes of his 
forefathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Walser's remarks sparked weeks of angry debate led by the head  
of Germany's Jewish community, Holocaust survivor Ignatz Bubis, who 
accused the author of playing into the hands of anti-Semites. 
</P>
<P>
	Herzog proclaimed the Day of Remembrance for Victims of Nazism  
in 1996, saying it was needed to keep memories of the Holocaust 
from fading after five decades. He chose Jan. 27 because it was the 
day Soviet soldiers liberated the Auschwitz death camp in 
Nazi-occupied Poland in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.6 million Jews and tens of thousands of Poles and Gypsies  
died in 1942-45 at Auschwitz and at nearby factories where they 
were forced to work under Nazi SS guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools across German held special classes today about the  
Holocaust, and some planned field trips to former concentration 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceremonies at the Sachsenhausen camp included a wreath-laying  
and lectures about Nazi persecution of gays, honoring a group 
organizers say has long been overlooked because of prejudice 
against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sachsenhausen had about 1,000 homosexual inmates, more than  
other concentration camps because it was near Berlin, which had a 
thriving gay culture in the 1920s.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Norway Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's state central bank cut interest  
rates by 0.5 percentage points on Wednesday, the first cut in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Norway said the rate for loans to other lending  
institutions would be cut to 9.5 percent from 10 percent and the 
interest on deposits from 8 percent to 7.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts still leave Norway with one of Europe's highest  
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank governor Svein Gjedrem said a tight national budget for  
this year and signs that the economy was cooling off made it 
possible to reduce interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The state bank increased interest rates seven times between May  
and August of last year to defend the value of the krone and dampen 
an economic boom. The currency had plunged in value, due partly to 
fears that Norway's economy was about to overheat and that the 
minority government would not be able to impose a tighter economic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway has tried to keep the krone stable against a basket of  
European currencies, especially the new euro. Gjedrem said 
maintaining a low inflation rate and reducing wage growth would be 
essential to bringing Norwegian interest rates in line with the 
rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway is not among the 11 nations using the common currency.

<HEADLINE> Male Cleopatra on London Globe Sked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shakespeare's Globe theater will include a male  
Cleopatra in its line-up this summer -- with artistic director Mark 
Rylance himself playing the celebrated Egyptian queen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be camp. She's very playful,'' Rylance said  
Wednesday in unveiling a summer season of plays that will include 
the Bard's ``Julius Caesar'' and ``The Comedy of Errors,'' as well 
as ``Antony and Clopatra,'' opening July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Augustine's Oak,'' a new verse drama by Peter Oswald, will  
complete the repertory line-up, running May 13-Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rylance Cleopatra is likely to be the talking point of the  
four-play season, two of which will be performed entirely by men in 
keeping with practices in Shakespeare's own time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem very politically correct, does it?'' said  
Rylance, 39, who has yet to cast an Antony to appear opposite him. 
``I'm already thinking about how can I balance this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brainchild of the expatriate American actor Sam Wanamaker,  
who died in December 1993, the 1,600-seat Globe marks its third 
full season of plays this summer.

<HEADLINE> White House May Call No Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the uncertain world of witness testimony,  
President Clinton's legal team has a single mission in the finale 
of the impeachment trial -- maintain Democratic opposition to his 
removal. To that end, presidential lawyers may skip calling their 
own witnesses, advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	While reserving their options, White House lawyers have  
discussed summoning no witnesses if prosecutors fail to elicit 
significant new testimony from Monica Lewinsky and two others 
called by the prosecutors and if the Senate decides against live 
testimony, the advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also opposes an idea that Clinton could be found  
guilty but not removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential advisers say they have made their position known to  
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle to inject into the ongoing 
discussion on Capitol Hill as he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of new revelations, one legal adviser said the White House  
was comfortable to just argue the facts ``and bring this to a 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would be contrary to the instincts of a normal  
criminal defense team. But this is no ordinary trial or even a 
typical congressional proceeding requiring a majority of votes to 
win. Clinton needs only 34 votes to be acquitted on charges of 
obstruction of justice and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, 44 Democratic senators voted to dismiss the case --  
a sign the Republicans are far short of the two-thirds majority 
needed to oust Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, the White House will pursue a three-pronged  
strategy, according to officials who spoke condition of anonymity. 
Presidential spokesmen will make the public argument that fairness 
demands the president have access to all the evidence kept from him 
so far and the chance to interview witnesses, too. But they'll 
suggest that witnesses are unnecessary because Democratic senators 
already have the votes to acquit Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's events make clear that the votes are not there to  
convict and remove the president from office,'' special counsel 
Gregory Craig said. ``Any proceedings from this day forward only 
serve to delay the final resolution of this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, White House aides want to fiercely fight a proposal  
from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would break the final 
decision into two votes -- one a ``finding of fact'' that Clinton 
committed the crimes he is charged with and a second on removal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is unbelievably unfair and outrageous to suggest  
that there be a finding of fact based on a one-sided and incomplete 
record of Kenneth Starr without giving the White House a full-scale 
and extensive discovery,'' said Lanny Davis, a former White House 
special counsel who continues to advise the legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	The final prong of the strategy, officials said, is a compelling  
closing argument that will hold Democrats in line. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the House managers argued they needed to question  
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal because they want to show 
Clinton fed him a false story about the Lewinsky affair so 
Blumenthal would pass it on to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential lawyers will argue that makes no sense because  
Clinton invoked executive privilege to keep Blumenthal away from 
the grand jury for several months, several advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	If prosecutors cause a sea change with some new testimony from  
Ms. Lewinsky or presidential confidants Blumenthal and Vernon 
Jordan, Clinton's lawyers reserve the right for an all-out trial 
assault. They'll look for witnesses who engender sympathy among 
Democrats who believe Clinton was treated unfairly throughout the 
impeachment drama despite his transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential lawyer David Kendall suggested Tuesday that a Paula  
Jones' lawyer, who introduced an affidavit to help the House case, 
may have waived his attorney-client privilege and could be summoned 
by White House lawyers in such a cross-examination. Presidential 
lawyers have long been eager to explore whether Mrs. Jones' lawyers 
and Starr's office colluded to bring the Lewinsky scandal to light 
in January 1998. Starr and Mrs. Jones have denied such collusion.

<HEADLINE> Buck Williams Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of the classiest and most durable players of  
the 1980s and 90's has decided that his rebounding days are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck Williams, one of the greatest power forwards in NBA  
history, announced his retirement Wednesday after a 17-year career 
spent with New York, Portland and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	His only regret was that he never won a title.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've come to the realization that for some people a  
championship is just not in the cards,'' Williams said. ``Now I 
have to give up on the dream that I chased for 17 years. I think 
that's really the only thing missing from my resume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NBA's rookie of the year in 1981-82 and a  
three-time All-Star, retires in fourth place on the league's list 
of games played (1,307), eighth in minutes (42,464) and 10th in 
rebounds (13,017). 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of only seven players to amass more than 6,000 points  
and 13,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tremendous journey, but the time has come for me  
to move on and do other things with my life,'' Williams said at a 
Madison Square Garden news conference before the Knicks' first 
exhibition game. ``I feel proud to leave with dignity and honor 
while there's still something left in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``My new lifestyle of spending more time at home carried more  
weight than playing another year,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams came to his decision in part because of the realization  
that there might not be a place for him on New York's roster. His 
name popped up in a trade rumor last week involving Dennis Rodman, 
and he had not been practicing with New York since training camps 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed 33 games last season after undergoing knee surgery --  
the first surgical procedure of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said his fondest memories will be of the coaches he  
played under, mentioning Jeff Van Gundy, Larry Brown and Rick 
Adelman by name. He also said he as proud to have played so well in 
his final game -- a 12-point, 14-rebound effort against Miami in 
Game 5 of the first round of the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If character has anything to do with being in the Hall of  
Fame, then he should definitely be in,'' Van Gundy said, ``because 
he has character like few others in this league, and to do it over 
17 years and also to be as good of a player as he is, that 
combination is very rare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played in the NBA finals twice for Portland, losing to  
Detroit in 1990 and Chicago in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every player thinks about the Hall of Fame, and I would be  
lying if I said I didn't. I would love to go into the Hall of 
Fame,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pope To Star in Music Video, CD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Pope John Paul II is about to star in a music video.  
</P>
<P>
	Sony Classical and Vatican Radio announced plans this week for  
the video, saying it will be a spin-off of their joint release of a 
music CD titled ``Abba Pater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Abba Pater'' will combine ``original compositions and  
arrangements of contemporary musical forms with live recordings of 
Pope John Paul II delivering prayers, homilies and chants in five 
languages,'' Sony said. Abba is Aramaic for father, pater is father 
in Latin. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD is scheduled for release in March, ahead of Holy Week and  
Easter, according to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	The papal recordings -- in Latin, Italian, French, English and  
Spanish -- were chosen from Vatican Radio's exhaustive archives of 
John Paul's 20-year papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 11 tracks, which features the pope chanting the Pater  
Noster (Our Father), also will be produced as a music video. The 
video will be featured on the Vatican Web site and Sony Classical's 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD cover will be adorned with pictures of the pope,  
according to Sony. It will come with a booklet that includes the 
papal texts and more pictures of the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Royalties from the sale of ``Abba Pater'' will go to Vatican  
Radio and to Audiovisivi San Paolo, co-producer of the CD and one 
of the world's largest publishers of religious books and 
periodicals.

<HEADLINE> Roller Hockey International Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- After a one-year sabbatical to  
restructure the league and change half its teams, Roller Hockey 
International officials said Wednesday they will resume play this 
June with 10 franchises in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The reconfigured league that features players on in-line skates  
will have teams in Anaheim, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, 
Minnesota, Las Vegas, St. Louis, San Jose and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the San Jose Rhinos, Anaheim Bullfrogs, Buffalo Wings,  
Minnesota Blue Ox and Saint Louis Vipers remain from 1997. 
Franchises dropped since then are Los Angeles, New York/New Jersey, 
Orlando (moved to Miami), Ottawa and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The league called off the 1998 season because of economic  
problems that left only three teams ready to play last year. Now, 
there's a new national TV contract and the league will pay all 
player and coach salaries as well as teams' travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game and the product and the fan support were there, but  
the finances weren't there,'' new league president Bernie Mullin 
said. ``The league ran out of money because it used its money to 
bail out a couple of bad franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league will provide about $3.5 million -- an average of  
$350,000 per team -- for salaries and travel costs. That money will 
come from the national TV contract and national advertising. The 
league also will keep expansion fees from future teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, minor-league ice hockey players who have the summer  
off, all will get the same salary depending on performance. They'll 
get $300 for each win and $200 for each loss, with bonuses for 
playoff success. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Gustafson, general manager for the Rhinos, said such  
incentive pay is a great idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys have to perform to make money. The more games you  
win, the more money you make. Money is a great incentive,'' he 
said. ``It creates a sense of urgency. In other leagues, there are 
guarantees and guys sometimes take the night off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RHI will have an 11-week regular season with most games on  
Friday and Saturday nights. Eight of the 10 teams will advance to a 
weekend of playoffs on Aug. 20-22, with quarterfinals on Friday, 
semifinals on Saturday and the final on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The site for the playoffs is expected to be announced in  
February, with Las Vegas the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	If a team wins the championship, each player has a chance to  
make as much as $12,000 for a three-month season. Many of the 
players make $15,000-$18,000 the rest of the year playing 
minor-league hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our guys are minor-league hockey players and they're  
looking for something to do in the summer,'' Gustafson said. ``This 
is a lot better than going home and cutting lawns or digging 
ditches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the San Jose Arena Management Company -- which  
runs the San Jose Arena that is home to the Rhinos and the NHL's 
San Jose Sharks -- announced it has taken a 50 percent ownership in 
the Rhinos. 
</P>
<P>
	With the popularity of in-line skating, RHI officials believe  
it's only a matter of time before the league features non-ice 
hockey players. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the next few years you're going to see guys who have played  
roller hockey all their lives,'' Mullin said. ``Now we have the 
guys who switch over to us for the summer.''

<HEADLINE> Wis. Sen. Feingold Breaks Rank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stubbornly independent Sen. Russell Feingold  
was the one Democrat who broke party lines and sided with 
Republicans in Wednesday's Senate impeachment votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite the bipartisanship Republicans had hoped for, but they  
were grateful nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have one Democrat who was willing to stand up to his own  
caucus,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``Let me tell you, that 
was a big-time thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold said he had ``serious problems'' with the case against  
Clinton. He also said his votes against dismissal of the two 
impeachment articles and in favor of allowing House prosecutors to 
summon witnesses Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney 
Blumenthal should not be viewed as a signal that he would vote to 
convict the president. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it is only fair to give House prosecutors more time  
to attempt to prove the impeachment allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Back home in Wisconsin, Feingold's decision was met with some  
disapproval, generally mild, and indifference. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's wrong. Get it over with,'' said Tracy Skare, 22, of  
Wausau, as she smoked a cigarette during a break from her downtown 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Nezworski, 44, a carpenter in Wausau, said he was  
surprised by Feingold's votes and ``somewhat angry'' at the 
senator, whom he voted for in November. ``I guess you normally 
follow your party,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could care less,'' said Ken Lindekugel, 50, while tending  
bar at the Admiral Lounge in downtown Wausau. ``We are all sick of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denny Jagler, 46, sipping a beer at the bar, said what his  
senator had done didn't surprise him. ``He's got a mind of his 
own,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold issued a written statement regarding his votes, but  
refused to take reporters' questions. In the statement, he said 
dismissing the case now would ``improperly short-circuit this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the House prosecutors must have ``every reasonable  
opportunity'' -- including testimony from witnesses -- to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that Clinton should be removed from 
office on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this surprised people who know Feingold. He's long  
demonstrated a maverick streak. 
</P>
<P>
	In his hard-fought re-election campaign last year against  
Republican congressman Mark Neumann, Feingold took the unusual step 
of ordering negative ads about his opponent taken off the air and 
rejecting commercials on his behalf paid for with ``soft money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in the Senate he has been a leading advocate of campaign  
reform legislation unpopular with many colleagues in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his Senate votes Wednesday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., said Feingold had indicated that he had concern especially 
about the obstruction of justice article and ``wanted to hear 
witnesses before he reached his judgment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold had previously sought separate dismissal votes on the  
two articles and said in his statement that one of them ``comes 
closer to the core meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman, who stunned the White House in September with a  
speech highly critical of Clinton's conduct and urged some formal 
disapproval, said he respected Feingold's position and told him 
``not to worry about his votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats avoided direct criticism of Feingold. ``I think  
he voted his conscience,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. ``It's an 
indication we didn't try to break arms and insist on a caucus 
vote.''

<HEADLINE> Kraft To Cut 600 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Kraft Foods plans to cut 600 full- and  
part-time jobs that have become obsolete due to new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., said the cuts would come  
through voluntary retirement and separation offers, resulting in a 
charge of $150 million in the first quarter of the year. No layoffs 
are included in the plan, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts would leave Kraft, based in the Northfield, Ill.,  
with 37,900 employees worldwide and would result in annual savings 
of more than $50 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert A. Eckert, the company's president and chief executive,  
said the cuts would affect employees in manufacturing, distribution 
and numerous staff areas.

<HEADLINE> Senators Look for Clinton Reprimand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Without the votes needed to remove President  
Clinton, senators of both parties are drafting plans for the Senate 
to officially frown on his efforts to cover up an affair with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a widespread feeling on both sides of the  
aisle that some expression of the inappropriateness of the behavior 
is a good idea,'' said Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	He is among a group of GOP senators drafting one possible  
resolution. According to an official familiar with the effort, the 
latest version would say the Senate is satisfied that the House 
proved that Clinton made misleading statements and tried to block 
justice -- but it would not convict him of felonies or eject him. 
</P>
<P>
	A more harshly worded version, which would have said the Senate  
finds that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice, 
was set aside because it would not have drawn Democratic support, 
said the official, who commented only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution would be offered before the final vote on the  
articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they'd seen a final version of the ``finding of fact''  
measure, Democrats said they couldn't go along. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't interested in that,'' Democratic leader Tom Daschle  
said Wednesday night. ``We oppose it and I hope we can avoid it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether that was negotiable, he replied, ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California was heading a  
Democratic effort. Her group was drafting language that ``would 
state the feelings of the Senate with respect to misconduct'' by 
the president, she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to the Democratic and Republican working groups  
said senators favor the general idea of a resolution condemning 
Clinton's behavior -- in part because of the political cover it 
could give them in the likely event that the Senate acquits the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also say such a resolution would legitimize the  
House managers' four-month investigation of the charges delivered 
to them by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for the House to have some vindication,'' said  
Sen. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas. But he acknowledged that such an 
approach -- giving senators an ``out'' to avoid voting for 
conviction -- could have a downside for conservative lawmakers who 
want Clinton ejected from the White House. ``It might lower the 
total (vote) on the articles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican working group, which includes Budget Committee  
Chairman Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe 
and Susan Collins, wants its measure offered before the articles of 
impeachment are voted, to give ``context,'' according to several 
officials with knowledge of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is to formally present the plan during a private  
meeting of the GOP caucus Thursday, said John Czwartacki, Majority 
Leader Trent Lott's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	If Republicans support it, Domenici said, the group will  
approach Democrats with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews this week, several Democrats have panned the GOP  
plan as possibly unconstitutional, especially if presented to the 
Senate as part of the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, said one Democrat, senators of both parties disagree on  
whether Clinton perjured himself or obstructed justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not going anywhere,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said of  
the GOP's plan. ``We all disagree on the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It leads to an unconstitutional and ambiguous resolution,''  
added Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who is working with Feinsten on the 
Democratic proposal. ``The responsibility of the Senate is to 
convict or acquit, period. If some senator or member wants to raise 
the possibility of censure, let them do it in the Senate, not in 
the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Durbin, Feinstein and other Democratic senators are  
crafting a proposal that would censure the president, to be brought 
to the floor after the Senate votes on the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is clearly condemning the president's misconduct,'' said  
Durbin. ``This would be on the record and President Clinton's 
legacy would be burdened by it.''

<HEADLINE> Web Auction Site Being Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After vowing to combat fraud, online auction  
service eBay Inc. finds itself the subject of a fraud investigation 
being conducted by the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is looking into whether people who use eBay to  
sell items falsely labeled some sports memorabilia as 
``one-of-a-kind,'' a source close to the investigation told The 
Associated Press Tuesday. Specifically, the agency is investigating 
whether baseballs supposedly signed by Babe Ruth, Roberto Clemente 
and Christy Mathewson are authentic, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials confirmed the probe Tuesday but refused  
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe raises the question of whether eBay can be held  
accountable for allegedly unscrupulous sellers and how it could 
monitor claims made in each sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes at a time of explosive growth in the Internet and as  
regulators are grappling with how to protect consumers without 
strangling the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the Wild, Wild West, the Internet,'' said Cleo  
Manuel, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based National Consumers 
League, which has been monitoring Internet fraud since 1992. ``It's 
going to take a while for regulations to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EBay does not have any inventory for sale. Instead, it allows  
people worldwide to post listings of items for sale, with potential 
buyers placing bids over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	When an auction is completed, the winning bidder contacts the  
seller to finish the deal. eBay collects a small commission on each 
listing and sale. In the three-month span ended Dec. 31, eBay 
hosted 13.6 million auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to its Web site, more than 1,000 items -- including  
Beanie Babies, dolls, books and gemstones -- are sold via eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay declined to comment on the investigation Tuesday. On  
Monday, in response to a New York Post story that disclosed the 
investigation, the company issued a statement saying it was 
cooperating fully with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to its customers late Monday, Meg Whitman, eBay  
president and chief executive officer, said the company had zero 
tolerance for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have committed and will continue to commit resources to  
have the most comprehensive programs in order to keep eBay a safe 
harbor for online person-to-person trading,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay receives an average of 27 fraud complaints for every 1  
million auctions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, the company announced its own initiatives to combat  
fraud. These included giving users the option of having their 
identities verified by an outside agency so they can be listed on 
eBay as accredited users and penalizing bidders who win auctions 
but don't collect the goods or pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the rapid growth of its business, eBay separately  
reported Tuesday it earned $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 
1998, sharply above the $189,000 of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter, revenue came to $19.5 million, more than seven  
times the $2.6 million of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, the company earned $2.4 million on revenue of  
$47.4 million, against $874,000 in earnings on revenue of $5.7 
million in 1997. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Euro Disney Might Build Second Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Euro Disney is studying the construction of a  
second amusement park on its Disneyland Paris site, the French 
theme park operator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it has started discussions with French  
authorities regarding a 1987 agreement, which already mentioned 
building a second theme park at its site east of Paris before 2011. 
</P>
<P>
	``This project, which remains to be confirmed once the technical  
and financial conditions have been satisfied, would reinforce the 
tourist potential of the Ile-de-France (Paris) region, generate 
thousands of direct and indirect jobs, and would confirm Disneyland 
Paris as the number one tourist destination in Europe,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro Disney, 39 percent owned by the Walt Disney Co. based in  
Burbank, California, opened its doors in April 1992 and has 
reported annual profit since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at Disneyland Paris, east of the capital, fell to  
12.51 million visitors in 1998, from 12.57 million the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slight drop in attendance, Euro Disney reported that  
net profit rose 34 percent to 290 million francs ($51.8 million) 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A Euro Disney spokesman said the existing Paris park, which  
opened in April 1992, has created 10,000 jobs directly and another 
30,000 jobs indirectly in the surrounding region.

<HEADLINE> SEC's Lindsey Leaves Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Lindsey, director of market regulation  
at the Securities and Exchange Commission, is leaving the 
government to join a major Wall Street firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey, 44, will leave in March to become a senior managing  
director of Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc., the SEC announced Tuesday. 
The agency hasn't yet named a successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey will assume the newly created No. 2 position at Bear,  
Stearns Securities Corp., the company's clearing division that 
processes trades for brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns' clearing operations have come under scrutiny  
recently from securities regulators and criminal prosecutors, who 
are examining whether the company ignored signs of fraudulent 
activity at the small firms for which it clears transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Manhattan district attorney's office has been  
investigating Bear Stearns' role in clearing trades for now-defunct 
A.R. Baron &AMP; Co., a small brokerage firm that allegedly defrauded 
investors of $75 million. The Wall Street Journal reported last 
week that Bear Stearns has offered to settle the district 
attorney's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey is the latest of a string of high-level officials who  
have left the market watchdog agency for the more lucrative private 
sector in the past year. They include former enforcement director 
William McLucas and his deputy, Colleen Mahoney; ex-chief 
accountant Michael Sutton, and Barry Barbash, formerly the top SEC 
official overseeing mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rich has been a critical part of our management team and at  
the center of the most dynamic changes that have occurred in our 
markets in 25 years,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey became director of the SEC's Division of Market  
Regulation in November 1995, after serving as the agency's chief 
economist during the previous five months. 
</P>
<P>
	As market regulation director, he was responsible for developing  
new rules governing alternative trading systems, such as Instinet, 
Bloomberg, Island and Terranova; for major changes in rules on 
execution of securities trading orders, and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to the SEC, Lindsey was a finance professor at  
Yale University's School of Management, where he did research on 
the design and regulation of markets.

<HEADLINE> Microbe Might Cause Ear Infections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A common microbe appears to be the leading virus causing painful  
middle ear infections in children. 
</P>
<P>
	Three types of bacteria are considered the most common causes of  
such infections, but viruses that cause respiratory infections are 
also known to be major culprits. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Terho Heikkinen and others from the University of Texas  
Medical Branch in Galveston studied 456 children with ear 
infections between the ages of 2 months and 7 years. 
</P>
<P>
	They found respiratory viruses in the lungs of 186 of the  
children. The respiratory syncytual virus, or RSV, was most 
frequently implicated in ear infections, present in the middle ear 
fluid of 48 of the children. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine  
concluded that an effective vaccine for RSV would greatly reduce 
the incidence of both ear and respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial by two doctors at Finland's National Public Health  
Institute agreed, noting two such vaccines are being tested. They 
cautioned that the researchers' laboratory methods might have led 
to an undercount of two major groups of respiratory viruses, which 
might have affected conclusions about the prevalence of the 
different viruses in the ear.

	Thousands Attending Pope Mass  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II is giving a homily to more  
than 100,000 people at the Trans World Dome. Earlier, they filed 
through metal detectors to attend the pope's only public Mass in 
his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland. The dome and the adjoining 
convention center were turned into a temporary cathedral for what 
the St. Louis Archdiocese believed would be the largest indoor 
gathering ever in the United States.

	Lott: Trial May End in 10 Days  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans today discussed a timetable  
that could end President Clinton's impeachment trial within 10 
days. The White House said it was concerned Republicans were trying 
to ``put a blindfold on us.'' Under the GOP plan, depositions of 
Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House 
aide Sidney Blumenthal would begin as early as tomorrow.

<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- A night of heavy rains has slowed the  
search for earthquake victims and worsened the suffering of 
survivors of one of the worst disasters in Colombia's history. 
Relief efforts resumed under gray skies today with reports of 
looting and coffin shortages. At least 700 people are confirmed 
dead from Monday's magnitude-6 quake in western Colombia but 
officials say the final toll will surely rise.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A new outbreak of fighting in Kosovo  
added urgency to international efforts today to enlist ethnic 
Albanian rebels in talks on the future of the Serb province. U.S. 
envoy Christopher Hill was meeting with representatives of the 
Kosovo Liberation Army. He has been trying to enlist rebel support 
for a U.S. plan envisaging autonomy for Kosovo that falls short of 
the rebels' demand for independence.

	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia has banned ``The Prince  
of Egypt,'' the animated Hollywood epic about Moses, on religious

Malaysia's 22 million people are Muslim; the rest are Christian, 
Hindu or Buddhist. Social and religious sensitivities run high. In 
1996, officials broke off a telecast of Hollywood's Academy Awards

	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Walt Disney's profits dropped 18 percent  
in its fiscal first quarter, hampered by high costs to broadcast 
NFL games, lower ratings for ABC's news programs and slower 
home-video sales. The results, announced today, were slightly below 
Wall Street estimates. The decline came despite strong box-office 
showings from ``The Waterboy'' and ``A Bug's Life'' and rising

<HEADLINE> Impact of NAFTA Eyed After 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years after the United States, Canada and  
Mexico entered into a new trade alliance, whether the North 
American Free Trade Agreement is a boon or a burden generally 
depends on who's evaluating it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration lobbied furiously to secure  
congressional passage of the trade pact in 1993. Not surprisingly, 
it views NAFTA as a net positive -- particularly in light of the 
current Asian economic downturn and Mexico's 1994 peso crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's been a very successful enterprise,'' David  
Aaron, Commerce undersecretary for international trade, said in a 
recent interview. ``There are still problems. It's still a work in 
progress, and there are more things we need to do to improve it 
..., but I think we can take significant satisfaction in the fact 
our exports to NAFTA in the five years have risen more than 67 
percent -- almost double the rest-of-world exports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the critics: NAFTA is to blame for job flight  
to Mexico, lowered labor and environmental standards and a host of 
other ills in all three partner countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over NAFTA's impact on the U.S. economy is certain to  
be among the central issues Congress will examine this year as it 
considers President Clinton's request to renew the negotiating 
authority he needs to strike new trade agreements, including the 
suggestion in his State of the Union address for a round of talks 
involving the 133 nations of the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined opposition from labor and environmental groups has  
blocked Clinton for four years from obtaining the trade authority, 
known as fast track. Opponents argue that NAFTA did not provide 
enough safeguards to ensure that U.S. companies setting up 
operations in Mexico did not exploit workers' rights or the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious NAFTA has failed to produce the benefits its  
boosters promised,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public 
Citizen's Global Trade Watch, which battled to keep the pact from 
being enacted. ``But NAFTA also fails a more lenient `do no harm' 
test. In key areas NAFTA affects, things are worse than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its recently issued NAFTA report card, Global Trade Watch  
gives failing grades on everything from agriculture to highway 
safety, public health and national sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	NAFTA has cost Americans hundreds of thousands of jobs,  
depressed wages in some sectors and transformed the $1.7 billion 
trade surplus with Mexico in 1993 to an $11.5 billion deficit by 
fall 1998, Global Trade Watch says. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration retains a far more positive view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look at the whole spectrum of issues -- trade, the environment,  
labor conditions, cooperation with Mexico in law enforcement. 
Whatever the issue, there is not one area where we would be better 
off today if the NAFTA were not in place,'' said Jay Ziegler, a 
spokesman for the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade with Canada and Mexico supports 2.6 million U.S. jobs,  
Aaron said, an increase of 655,000 over 1993. As to the job loss 
claim, he said: ``It's quite clear that most of the job dislocation 
that has taken place in the United States is not due to trade, let 
alone trade with NAFTA. Most of it is due to technological 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the United States is enjoying its lowest unemployment  
rates in three decades, averaging 4.5 percent last year, Aaron 
said, ``You can hardly say (NAFTA) has precipitated some kind of 
jobs crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NAFTA is scored, however, as having cost the jobs of 209,000  
Americans. That is the number of workers certified under a federal 
program designed to help people who lose work because of shifting 
trade patterns with Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials rush to say it's far easier to quantify  
jobs lost under NAFTA than those created. They also say the 209,000 
figure is an inaccurate reflection of job loss because, although 
entire work forces are certified as NAFTA losses, many displaced 
workers immediately go to new jobs or choose to retire. Some also 
may be reported under different federal trade assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Beale, acting director of the Labor Department's Office of  
Trade Adjustment Assistance, said his staff often is asked how many 
jobs have been lost to NAFTA, ``to which we give a hearty `We don't 
have the slightest idea,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the most certifications of NAFTA job loss are  
North Carolina, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The sectors with the most certifications are the apparel  
industry, with 55,000; electrical and electronic equipment, 26,600; 
and transportation equipment, 14,600.

<HEADLINE> Computer World Seen Helping Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continued stellar growth in practically  
anything to do with computers should help offset a slowdown in 
industries hurt by the world economic slump and make the current 
expansion the longest in U.S. history, the government predicted 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to computers, other fast-growing businesses include  
telephone and broadcasting equipment manufacturing, space commerce, 
management consulting and public relations, accounting and the 
mutual funds industry, the Commerce Department said in its annual 
``U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The big winners are clearly the information sectors, which  
continue to plow on regardless of what's happening around the 
world,'' said Jonathan C. Menes, the department's director of trade 
and economic analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	But, many industries -- from mining and construction machinery to  
leather goods to petroleum -- will continue to suffer from either 
slack world demand or competition from imports produced in 
countries with devalued currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other businesses projected to suffer shrinking shipments in 1999  
include apparel, newspapers and search and navigation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 800-page report, produced for the department by The  
McGraw-Hill Companies, forecasts trends in 137 manufacturing 
industries and 36 service and other non-manufacturing businesses. 
Growth should continue in more than 80 percent of them -- 144. 
Declines are expected in 27 areas and no change is expected for 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	If realized, the sector-by-sector forecasts add up to another  
year of expansion for the U.S. economy, albeit at a slower pace 
than 1998's nearly 4 percent growth rate, said economist David Wyss 
of Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a McGraw-Hill division. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyss said the recovery from the 1990-91 recession would  
undoubtedly continue through its eighth anniversary in March and, 
by next year, should surpass the record expansion of 1961-69. 
</P>
<P>
	``No economic expansion has made it to its ninth birthday, but I  
think this one will,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report offered these highlights:  
</P>
<P>
	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: Projected manufacturing growth includes  
computer and peripherals, 8.7 percent; circuit boards, 14 percent; 
radio and television equipment, 10 percent; semiconductors, 10.2 
percent, and telecommunications equipment, 6.9 percent. Related 
services expected to grow strongly include information retrieval, 
data processing and computer consulting. 
</P>
<P>
	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE: 52,000 Americans log on to the Internet for  
the first time, every day. Companies across the economy are 
exploring sales and marketing on the Internet of products including 
books, compact discs, newspaper articles, plane tickets, concert 
tickets, flowers, gardening tools, computers and even traditional 
durable goods such as cars and refrigerators. One early victim of 
the sea change: encyclopedia publishers. Encyclopedia Britannica's 
sales have fallen by more than 50 percent since 1990, after 
Microsoft began giving away it's CD-ROM encyclopedia, Encarta, to 
personal computer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	MOTOR VEHICLES: After a healthy 3.6 percent growth last year,  
shipments should increase about 1 percent this year. Imports claim 
just 15 percent of the U.S. market, down from 26 percent in 1986, 
reflecting the increased popularity of U.S.-made sport utility 
vehicles, vans and light trucks and the establishment of American 
factories by foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
	HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION: The construction industry, employing  
7.1 million Americans, should increase 1 percent this year after 3 
percent growth in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	HEALTH CARE: Health care expenditures should grow 5.6 percent to  
$1.2 trillion in 1999, compared with 5 percent growth in 1998. 
Growth in spending on drugs should remain brisk, 7.9 percent in 
1999 compared with 10 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	ENERGY: Petroleum imports should increase 17 percent this year,  
increasing the U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Low coal prices, new 
technology and increasing competition should push electricity 
prices down by more than 1.5 percent a year through 2005.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen  
Wednesday amid reports that Japanese banks were hiding losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also rose against the euro as investors decided that  
European economic fundamentals seemed less sound than those of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1430 in late New York trading, falling  
from $1.1553 late Tuesday. The dollar was trading at 115.82 yen, up 
from 113.82 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a rising U.S. stock market helped the dollar gain  
against the yen. Although stocks fell Wednesday, U.S. Treasury bond 
prices rose, helping push the dollar higher, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also fixated on a Financial Times front-page report that  
said Japanese banks were hiding losses by making pretend-trades in 
Japanese Treasury bonds. Japanese banks already were facing massive 
loan problems compounded by the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, meanwhile, continued to pay attention to rumors that  
China was devaluing its currency, a move high-ranking Chinese 
officials continued to deny Wednesday. If the value of the yuan 
fell, it would have a negative effect in Asia, particularly in 
recessionary Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The conjunction of the three factors led to dollar euphoria,  
said Robert Fullem, a corporate trader at National Westminster 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a coincidence that the dollar happened to break  
through that 115 level,'' Fullem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, meanwhile, soured on the euro, determining that the  
11 countries using the common currency were increasingly likely to 
lower interest rates to correct such economic problems as rising 
unemployment. They also expect U.S. interest rates to remain 
steady, providing investors with better returns on U.S. assets than 
European. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market went the other way and decided the dollar is the  
best thing to hold,'' Fullem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4100 Swiss francs, up from 1.3888,  
and 1.5203 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5191. The British pound rose 
to $1.6458 from $1.6595. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7112 German 
marks, up from 1.6929; 5.7405 French francs, up from 5.6786; and 
1,694.92 Italian lire, up from 1,675.04.

<HEADLINE> Nations Fail To Improve Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Countries that agreed to spend $5.7 billion a  
year by 2000 to help improve reproductive health and slow 
population growth are falling short of that goal -- and the United 
States and Japan account for more than half the shortfall, 
according to a global survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Total aid for population and health programs by donor countries  
reached just $1.4 billion in 1996, the latest year for which full 
data are available, according to Population Action International. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was set by 180 nations at the 1994 International  
Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. Pledges at the 
conference were set for each country according to the size of its 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At $640 million last year, the United States contributed more  
than any other country but lagged in its contribution as a share of 
wealth and population. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years since the year reflected in the survey Congress  
has cut U.S. funding for family planning further, and, said 
Population Action spokeswoman Sally Ethelston, ``it's likely that 
the total amount of donor support increased little or not at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family planning and health organizations hope to spur countries  
that have not met the goal to a new commitment at a follow-up 
conference in The Hague next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without more money, there can be no increase in access to  
contraception, to prenatal care, or to lifesaving information about 
such killers as HIV/AIDS,'' said the group's president, Amy Coen. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's report, which outlines the need for population  
assistance and covers related issues, gives the United States a 
grade of B in answering the question in its title, ``Paying Their 
Fair Share?'' Its above-average grade, despite the shortfall, is 
based partly on the fact that it provides a greater share of its 
total foreign aid -- about 7 percent -- than any other country for 
population and related health assistance, including assistance for 
AIDS and maternal health programs as well as family planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Population Action International is a private, nonprofit group  
advocating the expansion of voluntary family planning and increased 
funding to slow population growth.

<HEADLINE> Free Tickets Cause Toronto Rampage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Free tickets for the Toronto Raptors' exhibition  
game against the Boston Celtics assured there would be a big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crowd -- larger than expected and anxious to grab the  
best available seats -- turned a nice gesture into an ugly scene 
Tuesday night at SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really caught off guard,'' said Jim Roe, director of  
event operations for Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. ``We were 
a little overwhelmed by the number of people taking us up on our 
offer of free tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really very sorry.''  
</P>
<P>
	So was Toronto teen-ager Daniel Segon, perhaps the worst of the  
several people injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to get in and my head was pushed up against  
the door and it just shattered,'' the 16-year-old Segon said of the 
door. ``It was too rough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segon suffered several deep cuts in his right hand while  
protecting his head during the melee. Ambulance attendants called 
to the entrance of the upper deck wrapped his hand in gauze and 
examined several other people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew someone was going to get hurt, I just didn't think it  
would happen to me,'' Segon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge of fans created a mini-stampede that left dozens of  
women and children in tears as well as four smashed doors and some 
broken turnstiles. No serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about a dozen SkyDome security guards were on duty when the  
gate opened at 5:30 p.m. Police and ambulances didn't arrive until 
things got out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The melee eased once Raptors officials removed the turnstiles.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' said Richard Peddie, president of Maple  
Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. ``We never anticipated this kind 
of a turnout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans began lining up as early as noon because of the free-ticket  
offer -- part of the NBA's plan to win back fans following the 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But the organized lineup turned into an uncontrollable mob when  
thousands of fans arrived later in the day. It was so crowded that 
the faces of the people in the front of the line were being smeared 
against the glass doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodies got caught between the doors when they opened, and people  
were tripping over each other as they scrambled to get the best of 
the 10,000 free seats. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar incident happened at SkyDome on April 25, 1995. People  
stampeded through a gate when the Toronto Blue Jays tried to win 
back fans after the baseball strike by offering free seats in the 
upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Once things calmed down Tuesday night, about 8,000 fans found  
seats in the upper level while about the same amount of Raptors 
season-ticket holders filled the lower section. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have also offered free upper-level tickets to three  
upcoming regular-season games, two at SkyDome and one at Maple Leaf 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	Roe said the team would re-examine how it handles the free seats  
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Ron Mercer scored 25 points -- including Boston's  
first 11 -- as the Celtics beat the Raptors 106-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Antoine Walker added 19 points for the Celtics. Kenny Anderson,  
who refused to play for the Raptors last season after being 
acquired for Damon Stoudamire, was booed every time he touched the 
ball. Anderson finished with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Christie led the Raptors with 16 points and Kevin Willis  
added 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto trailed by 12 points after the first five minutes and  
didn't make a basket until Charles Oakley put back an offensive 
rebound at 5:55 of the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Parent Wants Gang Memoir Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Following the lead of conservative family  
activists across the nation, a San Diego parent is calling for a 
school ban of an award-winning book about gang life that he says is 
pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Rogers wants ``Always Running, La Vida Loca: Gang Days in  
L.A.'' pulled from San Diego County school shelves. The memoir is 
about street life in a Los Angeles barrio and was written in 1993 
by Luis Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a censor,'' said Rogers, who urged the board of the  
San Diego Unified School District on Tuesday to pull the book from 
schools. ``This is about common sense. This book is pornographic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have praised Rodriguez' book as an insightful depiction  
of urban struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	But parent activists from San Jose to Rockford, Ill., have  
requested that it be banned, saying it glorifies drug use, violence 
and sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers filed a complaint with the district, claiming the school  
system is violating state education code rules. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a committee of teachers, librarians, school  
administrators and parents selected to evaluate the text determined 
that the petition is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Bersin, San Diego schools superintendent, said he  
understands concern over content, but defended the novel under the 
First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As distasteful as it may be, it is consistent with the  
academic freedoms we enjoy,'' Bersin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers' appeal is under review. Until a final decision is made,  
the book is off limits to elementary students.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Encourages IMF Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund has to change  
the way it operates to keep pace with an increasingly globalized 
economy, a senior Clinton administration official told a Senate 
panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers also said the  
financial turmoil that swept Asia, Russia and Brazil in the past 18 
months would have been much worse without the IMF. The Fund 
provided the worst affected nations with billion-dollar rescue 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is one message running through my entire testimony  
today it is this one,that the global economy has changed greatly 
and the IMF has to change with it,'' Summers told a Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee on international economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers also said the 182-nation organization, financed by the  
world's taxpayers, ``must not operate entirely behind closed doors. 
Thanks to recent U.S. initiatives, the IMF has moved significantly 
toward openness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF must be more accountable in its use of public funds,  
provide aid at market-based rates and get the private sector more 
involved in burden sharing, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is early days yet,'' Summers said. ``No one should doubt  
that we are only part way down the long road toward reforming the 
IMF.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Fisher, an American who is the IMF's No. 2 official, was  
unable to testify before the panel because he was holding 
discussions with Brazilian officials on the country's continuing 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about the rescue packages for Brazil, Russia and three  
Asian nations, Summers said, ``I have no doubt that without an IMF 
with the capacity to respond, the cost of these crises would have 
been even higher and the impact on our own economy and markets much 
more severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., the subcommittee chairman, said that  
even though the United States is the IMF's largest shareholder it 
should not expect nor ask the IMF to do everything. Hagel was the 
only lawmaker present at the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expecting the IMF to do too much will set it up for failure,''  
Hagel said. ``The IMF cannot be all things to all peoples. That was 
never in its charter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the $18 billion in replenishment of IMF funds that  
Congress approved last year will require lawmakers to exercise 
better oversight of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Among recommendations in the legislation is establishment of an  
advisory committee consisting of lawmakers from the IMF's top five 
contributors: the United States, Germany, Japan, France and 
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Female Religious Activism Seen Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American women have moved markedly toward  
accepting religious activism in politics, according to a poll 
released Wednesday by a feminist group. 
</P>
<P>
	Respondents split 50-50 when asked whether elected officials  
should be guided by religious values and whether ``religion and 
politics shouldn't mix.'' In a comparable survey done in 1992, 63 
percent of women picked the second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	On abortion, a prime topic for church politicking, 53 percent of  
those surveyed in the poll conducted in mid-1998 said it should be 
illegal except for rape, incest and saving a woman's life, or else 
forbidden in all cases. That's an 8 percent shift away from 
abortion rights in a poll done two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The changes on abortion are pretty dramatic,'' said Diane  
Colasanto of Princeton Survey Research Associates, which conducted 
the telephone survey for the Center for Gender Equality. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also showed that American women are becoming more  
devout, with 75 percent considering religion ``very important'' in 
their lives. That's a 6 percent increase from 1996. Women who said 
they prayed daily increased 11 percent in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Those identifying themselves as ``born-again or evangelical  
Christian'' totaled 51 percent, an increase of 6 percent since 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 poll showed 76 percent of women think religious leaders  
and groups have a ``somewhat'' or ``very positive'' effect on the 
country. Responding to a series of questions about the influence of 
such groups on government, politics and public schools, those 
surveyed showed little worry that it was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 2-to-1 ratio, respondents had a favorable attitude toward  
the Christian Coalition's impact on women's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find some of the findings very disturbing,'' Faye  
Wattleton, president of the center, said in a teleconference with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. John Buchanan of Chicago, newly appointed editor of the  
Christian Century magazine, said: ``I don't understand how we get 
from more religiosity to more conservatism, particularly on 
reproductive choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all the women polled favored equal treatment in  
employment, promotion, pay raises, education and access to loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was conducted among 1,000 women who were 18 and over.  
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.

<P>
	HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- William M. Batten, a former head  
of J.C. Penney Co. Inc., died Friday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Batten, the company's fourth chairman and chief executive  
officer from 1958 to 1974, guided J.C. Penney's growth into a 
diversified, mass-merchandising chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The transformation from small-town stores was launched by a memo  
Batten wrote in 1957 detailing changes in the country's population, 
especially shifts to large cities and suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo's proposed changes included expansion of the  
merchandise mix and an end to the chain's ``cash only'' policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Batten retired in 1974 and two years later was invited to become  
chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. He retired again in 1984.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hungarian tenor Gabor Carelli, who sang at the  
Metropolitan Opera from 1951 to 1974, died Jan. 22. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Carelli began his vocal studies in Budapest and continued them  
in Rome. He made his opera debut in Florence in a production of 
Puccini's ``Boheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to the United States in 1939 and traveled as a  
recitalist and a principal singer with operatic touring companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Carelli sang as Dr. Caius in an NBC Symphony broadcast  
performance of Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' conducted by Arturo Toscanini, 
in 1951. RCA has reissued the performance on compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
	Carelli made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Don Curzio in  
Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro'' in 1951. Over the next 23 years, he 
sang more than 1,000 times in 39 operas.

</P>
<P>
	Crofut, a banjo player, took up the instrument in 1955. After  
performing in coffeehouses and clubs with a high school friend, his 
career was launched when Adlai Stevenson asked the folk-singing duo 
to play at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	They performed a parody, written by Crofut and sung to the tune  
of the ``Twelve Days of Christmas,'' about President Kennedy and

</P>
<P>
	Day hit it big in 1956 playing steel guitar with Ray Price on  
the hit ``Crazy Arms.'' He played on Nelson's classic ``Shotgun 
Willie'' album, and hits like ``Pick Me Up on Your Way Down'' by 
Charlie Walker and Price's ``Heartaches By the Number'' and ``City

guitarist with the Grammy-nominated band, Steve Riley &AMP; The Mamou 
Playboys, died Monday in a motorcycle accident. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Domengeaux, wrecked his motorcycle on U.S. 90 and was struck by  
two motorists as he lay on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	A musician for 38 years, Domengeaux was known for his versatile  
guitar playing. He first rose to prominence in the late 1970s and 
early '80s with the hard rock group Black Dog, a band that fused 
rock and ``swamp'' pop. 
</P>
<P>
	But Domengeaux really shined with Steve Riley &AMP; The Mamou  
Playboys, whose sound made them popular in roots music circles and 
mainstays on the international festival circuit. The group 
performed worldwide, won numerous awards from the Cajun French 
Music Association and was nominated for a Grammy award in 1993.

</P>
<P>
	Kagan's widely published photographs of the victims, including

	French authorities hid the scope of the crackdown on the  
Algerians who were beaten, shot and thrown into the Seine River 
during a protest tied to Algerian independence. 
</P>

killed. Some historians said at least 200 people were killed;

<HEADLINE> Lodish Poised for 6th Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- On Sunday, when he sprints onto the field to  
replace one of the Denver Broncos' starting defensive tackles, Mike 
Lodish will make history. 
</P>
<P>
	Already one of nine players who have played in five Super Bowls,  
Lodish will become the first to play in six. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he does, he'll think about the many players, some of  
them Hall of Famers, who never went to a single Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a very fortunate young man,'' Lodish said. ``I'm very  
blessed, and I know that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for the guys who never had a chance to be in Super  
Bowls, especially the great players. But at the same time, I've 
worked very hard to get where I am. I don't take anything for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they can see that, yes, I'm a guy who will play in six,  
but that I played very hard every time. I hope they can respect 
that and say, `There's a guy who deserves to be there even though 
he isn't a Hall of Famer, because he competes hard.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The joy of six will be a remarkable accomplishment for Lodish,  
considering that he was a 10th-round draft choice of the Buffalo 
Bills in 1990 who has been a starter in only one of his nine NFL 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching the NFL's pinnacle game seemed easy to Lodish, who went  
to a Super Bowl as a rookie -- and again in each of his next three 
seasons. On the other hand, the first four appearances ended in 
losses, which wasn't so easy to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe that I was a rookie in the league going to  
a Super Bowl,'' he said. ``That was crazy. But by the time we lost 
the fourth one, I thought I was an unlucky charm. I really did. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go the big game with such excitement. Four times, I left  
feeling as down as any time I can remember. You never want to 
accept second best for just being there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lodish, 31, who signed a free-agent contract with the Broncos in  
1995, got another shot at a Super Bowl title last January, and 
cashed in as Denver defeated Green Bay 31-24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on top of the world,'' he said. ``It's a feeling I'll  
never forget, very fulfilling. It was sort of like a 300-pound 
block of ice had been lifted off my back. There was a tremendous 
sense of gratification right after that last second ticked off the 
clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lodish finally has his ring, and so does Broncos quarterback  
John Elway, who himself endured three losing trips to the Super 
Bowl. Because this is likely to be Elway's final game, Lodish said 
he and his teammates have a special feeling about this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is going to be his last game, we'd like to see him go  
out a winner,'' he said. ``Back-to-back Super Bowl championships 
would be a nice accomplishment for a guy who was always told he was 
one of the best in the league, but never got the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To win it for Elway, Lodish and the Broncos defense must play  
the same run-stuffing defense they played in two previous playoff 
games, when they held Miami and the New York Jets to identical 
rushing totals -- 13 carries for 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a tall order, since Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson  
rushed for 1,846 yards this season -- second only to Denver's 
Terrell Davis, who had 2,008. 
</P>
<P>
	``He runs the ball very hard, and we're going to have to put a  
lot of hats on him to stop him,'' Lodish said. ``I think the key to 
our run success the last few games is our attitude. It's a frame of 
mind when you say: You're not running the ball on us. If you're 
going to beat us, you're going to beat us in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know how important this is. Defenses win championships. If  
you don't play good defense, you're not going to win the Super 
Bowl.''

<HEADLINE>  Iverson Gets $70.9M From Sixers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson is constantly criticized for  
hanging with the wrong crowd. He's loyal and generous to a fault, 
and won't renounce his roots no matter how many millions he makes. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he got advice from the right people.  
</P>
<P>
	Passing up a chance at more money in the open market, Iverson  
signed a six-year, $70.9 million contract extension with the 
Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday. A final push from his mom and former 
Georgetown coach John Thompson convinced him he was doing the right 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took their best player and they didn't get into the game  
of a negotiation,'' said Iverson's agent, David Falk. ``Allen 
reciprocated and said, `Thanks. I want to be here, and enough's 
enough.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson lost his chance at a $100 million mega-contract with the  
NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. But he chose not to wait 
until July 1, when he could have negotiated a seven-year deal with 
any team for more than $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to show them he wanted to be here,'' Falk said.  
``There was no need to sit around and try to make the contract look 
bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson got a big raise and all the pressure that comes with it.  
Sixers president Pat Croce has put his championship hopes on the 
shoulders of a 23-year-old who's still learning -- on the court and 
off. Among other legal problems, Iverson is still on probation for 
a 1997 drug and weapons arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	He has amassed a formidable list of indiscretions since entering  
the league as the No. 1 draft pick in 1996, but Croce believes he's 
finally ready to be an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the street, although definitely not the same street  
as him,'' Croce said. ``I can relate. I see a stone-cold winner in 
him that really has a big heart. Sometimes his heart gets the best 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, this is Iverson's team now. The next few years could  
make it his city, or even his NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' Iverson said. ``And I  
want to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson will get the maximum for a player entering his third  
season in the league, Croce said. He will get $9 million next 
season with annual raises of $1.1 million that add up to $14.6 
million in the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to wait until the end of the year and then  
decide whether to play for a contender,'' Iverson said. ``I never 
wanted to take the easy way out. I've been here through the bad 
times, I want to be here through the good. I pretty much knew what 
time it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson wanted to stay with the Sixers all along, but  
sought counsel from Thompson and his mother before finalizing his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen wanted to be here,'' Falk said.  
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's 1998-99 salary of $3.5 million is prorated for a  
50-game schedule, reducing it to $2.2 million -- a loss of more than 
$1.3 million due to the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make enough money to take care of my  
family,'' Iverson said. ``The money that's out there for me right 
now is enough for me to do so. If the Sixers were going to give me 
$100 million, I would be a fool not to take it. I have a family and 
I want to know how my future's going to look financially. But it's 
not all about money all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, legal problems haunted Iverson again.  
Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. sued Iverson in a dispute over unpaid 
lease payments on three late-model cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said Iverson's lawyers were ``putting the final wrinkles on  
that.'' Though Croce was willing to let his championship hopes rest 
with Iverson, he still worries about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, and I know he's giving of himself and of his  
riches to his friends and family to a fault,'' Croce said. ``So I 
always worry about him, because he's not someone who will say no.''

<HEADLINE> Web Site eBay Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After vowing to combat fraud, online auction  
service eBay Inc. finds itself the subject of a fraud investigation 
being conducted by the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is looking into whether people who use eBay to  
sell items falsely labeled some sports memorabilia as 
``one-of-a-kind,'' a source close to the investigation told The 
Associated Press Tuesday. Specifically, the agency is investigating 
whether baseballs supposedly signed by Babe Ruth, Roberto Clemente 
and Christy Mathewson are authentic, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials confirmed the probe Tuesday but refused  
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe raises the question of whether eBay can be held  
accountable for allegedly unscrupulous sellers and how it could 
monitor claims made in each sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes at a time of explosive growth in the Internet and as  
regulators are grappling with how to protect consumers without 
strangling the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the Wild, Wild West, the Internet,'' said Cleo  
Manuel, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based National Consumers 
League, which has been monitoring Internet fraud since 1992. ``It's 
going to take a while for regulations to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EBay does not have any inventory for sale. Instead, it allows  
people worldwide to post listings of items for sale, with potential 
buyers placing bids over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	When an auction is completed, the winning bidder contacts the  
seller to finish the deal. eBay collects a small commission on each 
listing and sale. In the three-month span ended Dec. 31, eBay 
hosted 13.6 million auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to its Web site, more than 1,000 items -- including  
Beanie Babies, dolls, books and gemstones -- are sold via eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay declined to comment on the investigation Tuesday. On  
Monday, in response to a New York Post story that disclosed the 
investigation, the company issued a statement saying it was 
cooperating fully with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to its customers late Monday, Meg Whitman, eBay  
president and chief executive officer, said the company had zero 
tolerance for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have committed and will continue to commit resources to  
have the most comprehensive programs in order to keep eBay a safe 
harbor for online person-to-person trading,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay receives an average of 27 fraud complaints for every 1  
million auctions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, the company announced its own initiatives to combat  
fraud. These included giving users the option of having their 
identities verified by an outside agency so they can be listed on 
eBay as accredited users and penalizing bidders who win auctions 
but don't collect the goods or pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the rapid growth of its business, eBay separately  
reported Tuesday it earned $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 
1998, sharply above the $189,000 of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter, revenue came to $19.5 million, more than seven  
times the $2.6 million of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, the company earned $2.4 million on revenue of  
$47.4 million, against $874,000 in earnings on revenue of $5.7 
million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently focused on the strong earnings report,  
sending shares of eBay up $83.06 1/4, or 38 percent, to $303.93 3/4 this 
morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>

	The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs is asking  
consumers to contact the department if they believe they've been 
sold fraudulent merchandise. It may be reached at (212) 487-4444.

<HEADLINE> Woman Used for Sacagawea Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Randy'L He-dow Teton was a little girl  
growing up in the Shoshone-Bannock tribe near Blackfoot, Idaho, her 
mother called her ``chokecherry eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her round dark eyes reminded her mother of the purplish-red  
berries growing wild near the rivers and streams of the Fort Hall 
Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always know when she's in good spirits because her eyes  
get chokecherry dark. They get all glistening,'' Bonnie 
Wuttunee-Wadsworth said of her 22-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Those same eyes attracted Santa Fe, N.M., sculptor Glenna  
Goodacre to Teton when she was looking for a model for her 
rendition of another young Shoshone woman, Sacagawea, who with her 
baby accompanied explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to 
the Pacific Ocean in 1805. 
</P>
<P>
	By next year, millions of Americans will fall under their serene  
gaze when Goodacre's version of the 15-year-old Sacagawea appears 
on the front of a new, gold-colored dollar coin that will replace 
the Susan B. Anthony dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for authenticity, for someone from that  
particular tribe,'' Goodacre said. ``And from an artistic 
standpoint, she had interesting features.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, in Shoshone legend, Sacagawea was described as having  
large, dark eyes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacagawea on the 50 million to 60 million coins produced  
each year won't look exactly like Teton. Federal law prohibits 
depictions of living persons on coins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The eyes and nose look like mine, and the eyebrows and mouth,  
but the cheeks are fuller,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teton, who expects to graduate this year with a bachelor of fine  
arts degree from the University of New Mexico, lives in 
Albuquerque, a little more than an hour from Goodacre's studio in 
Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodacre, who is perhaps best known for her bronze sculpture of  
three military women installed in 1993 at the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial in Washington, found Teton through her mother, an employee 
of the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	After spotting Goodacre's ad seeking a model, Wuttunee-Wadsworth  
showed her a picture of her four daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were here. It was the luck of the draw, more or less,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Department officials are considering three of  
Goodacre's designs and expect to announce Secretary Robert Rubin's 
choice next month. One of them, showing Sacagawea looking over her 
shoulder, her baby on her back, has been recommended by the U.S. 
Commission on the Fine Arts and was the public's overwhelming 
favorite in an Internet survey. It's Teton's favorite, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laughed when Glenna first put a doll on my shoulder. But  
when I looked at the finished design, it spooked me out. It was 
just so realistic. It was like my future baby,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The design has generated some controversy among the Shoshone.  
Sacagawea is portrayed carrying her baby, Jean-Baptiste, in a 
deerskin rather than a willow cradle board. But Teton said Shoshone 
women sometimes used deerskin instead of a cradle board when 
traveling in difficult places. 
</P>
<P>
	The unadorned deerskin dress from the late 1860s in which Teton  
posed is not Shoshone. But Teton said Sacagawea, who at the age of 
10 or 11 had been captured by Hidatsa warriors, probably was not 
wearing an ornately beaded Shoshone dress by the time she became 
part of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, some have complained that Teton is Shoshone Bannock while  
Sacagawea was Lemhi Shoshone, a band that lived farther north on 
the Montana-Idaho border near present-day Salmon, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking on it as me. To me, the coin represents my  
people, Native Americans in general,'' Teton said. ``I think it's 
finally the time for Native Americans to be portrayed 
realistically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, Teton, who is minoring in Native American  
studies, eventually would like to go into museum work, helping with 
the repatriation of Native American objects and relics. But for 
now, she's hoping for a semester off in California, and graduate 
school. Like Sacagawea, she is a young woman far from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I look at the coin, I feel Sacagawea,'' Teton said.  
``I'm far away from home, all by myself, trying to get my education 
so I can go back and do good for the people. Hopefully, that will 
happen some day.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago BOT Abandons Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Members of the Chicago Board of Trade voted  
Wednesday to abandon a proposed alliance with Eurex, a computerized 
European exchange that is its fastest-growing competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision once more signaled a commitment to auction-style  
trading that many call an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
	In what some had called a key vote in determining the direction  
the Chicago exchange will take in coming years -- and even whether 
it will survive -- members voted 450-390 to place their bets with 
open outcry, in which traders stand in pits yelling and gesturing 
to set the price for everything from soybeans to Treasury bond 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, they turned their backs on an alliance with Eurex,  
the Frankfurt-based all-electronic exchange owned jointly by 
Germany's Deutsche Boerse and its Swiss counterpart, despite having 
spent millions of dollars already on implementation plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Trade is the world's largest futures exchange,  
dealing in contracts for future delivery of agricultural 
commodities like wheat and financial securities such as Treasury 
bonds. Eurex is No. 2 in rankings based on trading volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Tradition, money and some 150,000 Chicago-area jobs connected to  
the industry are at stake as the exchange moves forward in an era 
of competitive challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Large trading firms have migrated to computer-based trading,  
saying it is easier and cheaper because it saves keeping expensive 
staff at individual exchanges. Others argue open outcry is the best 
method of determining prices because face-to-face contact allows 
traders to ``feel'' the mood of a market and act accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to explore initiatives that meld the cost  
efficiencies of electronic trading with the transaction 
efficiencies of open outcry trading,'' David Brennan, the Board of 
Trade's recently elected chairman, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had urged a go-slow approach to considering the issue of  
electronic trading and apparently came down squarely against the 
deal after flying suddenly to Europe last week to seek better 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chairman had argued that Chicago's 50 percent share in  
the venture was too small and that the Board of Trade's electronic 
trading platform, Project A, should not be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chicago Board of Trade has the largest and fastest-growing  
electronic trading system in the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Eurex's system trades far more contracts daily and  
single-handedly last year trounced exchanges in London and Paris, 
forcing them to cut jobs, attempt hurried switches to electronic 
trading and seek alliances with Eurex. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurex executives had hoped to salvage the alliance with the  
Board of Trade despite the December defeat of its largest booster, 
former chairman Patrick Arbor. But they have indicated their are 
prepared to seek alliances with other European and U.S. exchanges 
to expand their dominance of trading in lucrative currency 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of switching to an all-electronic trading platform has  
clearly divided the Board of Trade, from the floor traders and 
members all the way up to the executive offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan and his deputy earlier this month openly disagreed on  
whether an alliance with Eurex was in the best interests of the 
exchange.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Pay $29M to Whistleblowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The federal government has paid $29.1 million to  
a woman and her attorney for reporting health-care fraud at Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty overwhelming,'' said Evelyn Knoob, who has moved  
from Herrin to nearby Carterville. ``I'm relieved that it's finally 
settled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government decided that Mrs. Knoob, who formerly worked for  
the company's Marion office, and attorney Ronald Osman of Marion 
deserved more than the minimum payment, which would have been 15 
percent of the civil penalty, or $21 million. They have now 
received four government checks totaling $29,108,999. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Osman, who got a contingency fee, nor Knoob would say  
how they split the reward. But Mrs. Knoob, 54, gave much of the 
credit to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, in a way, liberating,'' Mrs. Knoob said Tuesday. She no  
longer has to worry about the possibility of losing her disability 
benefits, the income she has lived on for the past five years since 
she left her $35,000-a-year supervisory job at Health Care Services 
Corp., also known as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors announced last summer that Blue Cross Blue Shield of  
Illinois would pay $144 million to settle allegations that managers 
at its Marion office lied to auditors, destroyed documents and 
mishandled claims. It was the federal government's largest 
settlement ever with a Medicare contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last summer, Mrs. Knoob and her husband have bought a new  
home, which she described as a modest ``quarter of a million 
dollar'' home.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sign Abdur-Rahim for $71M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies,  
who've suffered through three dismal seasons in their NBA 
existence, solidified their future by signing Shareef Abdur-Rahim 
to a $71 million, six-year contract extension on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It exemplifies the franchise has some stability from a player  
standpoint,'' said Stu Jackson, Grizzlies president and GM. ``It 
sends a message to the rest of the league that this is a 
destination point for very good players. And thirdly, it ensures 
that we've added to our foundation which we're going to build 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For this organization to move forward, it was important to  
have Shareef as the central figure of our team for at least the 
next seven years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim, who led the Grizzlies in scoring in his first two  
seasons, was in the final year of his rookie contract and would 
have been eligible for free agency at the end of this season. His 
contract extension is the maximum allowable under the 
newly-negotiated collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel blessed and honored,'' said Abdur-Rahim, who  
celebrated his 22nd birthday last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest issue in Abdur-Rahim's mind was not money but  
getting assurances that the team was committed to become a 
contender. He said he got that from Jackson and owner John McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have signed this if I didn't feel like we were  
moving in the right direction,'' he said. ``Honestly, I really do 
feel good about our team and the direction that we're moving in. I 
feel good about the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim wasn't concerned that he lost a chance to cash in on  
his success, considering the limits placed on salaries in the new 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, you have to look at it and say, `This is more money  
than my parents every made.' I really don't pay much too much 
attention to that. I'm happy to be back playing basketball. I'm 
pleased and I'm blessed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim said today's NBA players are indebted to those who  
never had the opportunity to make this much money. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think about it, you have to thank the guys that came  
before me, the Dr. J's and the guys before him. All of those guys 
were worth money like this, but the league wasn't in a situation 
like this. They really paved the way for guys like myself,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing Abdur-Rahim said he would do with his newfound  
wealth is buy his mother Aminah a new home in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected third overall in the 1996 draft out of California,  
Abdur-Rahim is considered the foundation of the Grizzlies' future. 
A unanimous choice to the NBA rookie team in his first season, he 
followed that up with an outstanding second year in which he 
averaged 22.3 points per game, tied for sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got a lot of unfulfilled potential. I'm not  
pleased or satisfied at the point I'm at. I've got a lot of work to 
do,'' said Abdur-Rahim. 
</P>
<P>
	With Abdur-Rahim, the Grizzlies now have three core players --  
center Bryant Reeves, who is in the first year of a seven-year 
contract, and rookie point guard Mike Bibby, who last week signed a 
four-year deal -- locked up for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big step for the organization,'' coach Brian Hill said.  
``It shows, number one, that we have a commitment to our players. 
And even more importantly it shows that, in Shareef's case, he's 
got a commitment to us.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Invite Strawberry To Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees invited Darryl Strawberry  
and 17 other non-roster players to their major league 
spring-training camp Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Strawberry hit .247 last year with 24 homers and  
57 RBIs, his best season since 1991, but he missed the Yankees' 
successful postseason after a cancerous tumor was removed from his 
colon Oct. 3. The outfielder had chemotherapy following the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed to a minor-league contract for 1999 so that he won't  
count against the Yankees' luxury tax until he is able to play in 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also invited outfielder Jerome Walton, who won the  
NL Rookie of the Year award in 1989, and right-handers Jeff Juden, 
Dave Pavlas and Jason Grimsley, along with 14 minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton, 33, hit .324 in 12 games with Tampa Bay last season and  
has a .269 career average in 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Juden, 28, was a combined 8-14 with a 5.80 earned run average in  
32 games, including 30 starts, for Cleveland and Anaheim last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavlas, who pitched for the Yankees in 1995 and 1996, spent last  
year in Triple-A for Oakland and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley, who is 18-25 with a 5.39 ERA in his major league  
career, spent last season on Cleveland's Triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
	New York also invited catchers Michael Hernandez, Tim McIntosh,  
Jaime Torres, Victor Valencia and B.J. Waszgis; infielders Clay 
Bellinger, Mike Coolbaugh and Brian Raabe; outfielders Bubba 
Carpenter and Alonzo Powell; right-handers Katsuhiro Maeda and 
Chris Nichting; and left-hander David Carroll.

<HEADLINE> Senators Tackle Farm Concentration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers hoping to halt the number of big  
company mergers in agriculture plan to make their case to Attorney 
General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has agreed to meet with senators Feb. 10, said Sen. Kent  
Conrad, D-N.D. Conrad is one of a group of lawmakers who have been 
urging the Justice Department to investigate concentration in 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmer share has dropped precipitously,'' Conrad told a  
Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on industry consolidation 
Tuesday. ``Concentration has consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One after another, lawmakers expressed the same concern: Too  
much consolidation may spell the end of the small family farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are losing family farmers at a record pace,'' said Sen.  
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who has called for a moratorium on approving 
any new agribusiness mergers or acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa: ``Agriculture benefits from  
the resulting efficiencies. But how big is too big?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about concentration have risen since Cargill Inc. of  
Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, announced plans to 
buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked Continental Grain Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger comes at a time when low prices have swept  
both livestock and commodities markets. Many lawmakers worry that 
the Cargill-Continental deal, which is being reviewed by Justice, 
will further depress prices for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1997, the four largest packing firms accounted for 80  
percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent of hog slaughter, and 70 
percent of sheep slaughter, USDA chief economist Keith Collins told 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	With grain, market shares of the four largest exporting firms  
ranged from 47 percent for wheat to almost 70 percent for corn. In 
storage, Collins said, the four largest firms accounted for almost 
27 percent of total elevator capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, industry representatives rejected arguments that they  
were squeezing out small farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cargill and Continental did not cause or even contribute to  
low farm prices,'' said Frank Sims, president of Cargill's North 
American Grain Division. ``We believe this acquisition should be 
analyzed on its own merits, not as an accessory to tough times on 
the farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims said the combination of Cargill's 243 U.S. grain facilities  
with Continental's 83 U.S. grain facilities would make up only 6 
percent of total commercial storage space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our combined business should handle about 10 to 13 percent of  
the U.S. grain moving to markets,'' Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials, however, have expressed concern that the  
combined companies could stifle or drive out competition in some 
local markets and at key distribution points, as well as control a 
significant amount of exports.

<HEADLINE> Flu Hits European Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- World and European pairs champions  
Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze withdrew from the European 
Figure Skating Championships just before the final free program 
Wednesday after Berezhnaya was diagnosed with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic silver medal winners led after the short program and  
were virtually assured of repeating as champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Their withdrawal all but ended Russian hopes of sweeping the  
championships, as they did the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Russian women led the qualifying round Wednesday, the  
Russian men were one-two-and-three going into Thursday's final, and 
Russian champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov topped the 
dance standings after the compulsory Ravensburger Waltz and Tango 
Romantica. 
</P>
<P>
	The flu may turn out to be the real wild card in these  
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	French pairs skater Stephane Bernadis didn't show for a news  
conference after he and partner Sarah Abitbol finished second in 
the short Monday because of flu symptoms. And in the women's 
competition, Viktoria Volchkova complained of a fever as she left 
the ice, though she skated strongly enough to finish second in her 
group, behind defending champion and teammate Maria Butyrskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	Other competitors and judges also complained of feeling ill.  
</P>
<P>
	The Russian pair's coach, Tamara Moskvina, said Berezhnaya  
became ill suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are used to competing at all cost,'' Moskvina said. ``But  
we didn't think it appropriate to put her health at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair's absence will leave room higher on the podium for  
Germany's Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller, who were third after the 
short. Schwarz was the only skater in the competition to have 
participated in Europeans last time they were in Prague, in 1988, 
finishing third with partner Alexander Konig. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, much earlier, Butyrskaya led the qualifying round,  
having drawn the disdained first slot among a field of 35 skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	By 11 a.m., the Russian had completed an elegant long program in  
the qualifying round, hours before most elite skaters' circadian 
clocks are set to deliver championship performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know where I was, if I was in a dream,'' Butyrskaya  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If she had been, the six-time Russian champion would have been  
dressed for it, all in white, to complement the classic program 
emphasizing her grace and elegant spirals and spins, one with her 
arms clasped uniquely behind her back. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, new International Skating Union rules count  
the qualifying round toward the final score, leaving little room 
for emotionless, technically correct run-throughs by skaters 
assured of finishing in the top 30. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting the competitive juices flowing early in the day was  
only part of the problem. Judges can't squander all of their 5.9s 
and 6.0s on the first skater, even on the European champion and 
world bronze medalist, on the chance another competitor will merit 
distinction later. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya hit just five triple jumps -- just as many as  
17-year-old teammate Julia Soldatova who led the other qualifying 
group, and one more than 16-year-old Volchkova -- winning technical 
marks averaged a solid, if unimpressive 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been marked 5.6 for so long,'' she said, ruefully.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, the performance endured as the best in two rounds  
qualifying 30 skaters for the short program Friday and the free on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Both Parties' Mid-Term Funds Grew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican and Democratic parties raised a  
total of nearly $628 million during the midterm election cycle, a 
41 percent increase over the contributions they took in during the 
1993-94 midterm election cycle, the Federal Election Commission 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans raised the most, taking in $384.9 million from  
January 1997 through last November, compared with Democrats, who 
raised $242.8 million, the FEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures represent money raised by the parties' three  
national committees, plus funds raised by state and local groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing a trend that began in the 1996 presidential election,  
both parties saw big jumps in ``soft money'' donations from 
corporations, wealthy patrons and labor unions that are not subject 
to giving limits established by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans took in $111 million in soft money contributions,  
more than double the soft money they raised in 1993-94. Democrats 
raised $89 million in soft money, an 82 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money contributions are supposed to be used for general  
party-building activities, not for electing specific candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	As for money raised for specific candidates, Republicans far  
outspent their Democratic counterparts. The GOP spent $265 million 
for candidates and Democrats spent $147.6 million, the FEC said.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspect Allowed To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A judge today granted torture murder  
defendant Charles Ng's last-minute request to reopen his defense 
and testify on his own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	The request came just as Ng's lawyers were about to begin  
closing arguments in the lengthy case involving a dozen slayings in 
the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Ng in his chambers, Orange County Superior  
Court Judge John J. Ryan said he was granting Ng's request and told 
prosecutors, who had already concluded their closing arguments, 
that they could restate them after Ng's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney William G. Kelley, whose dismissal Ng  
unsuccessfully sought again today, made clear that he'd advised Ng 
to not testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a constitutional right to testify, whether we want him  
to or not,'' Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution of Ng has become one of California's lengthiest  
and costliest murder cases. Ng, 38, is charged with killing seven 
men, three women and two baby boys in 1984 and 1985, using female 
victims as sex slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Since trial began in October, the defense has tried to blame the  
killings on Ng's friend Leonard Lake, who committed suicide by 
eating cyanide in 1985 after he was questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng was arrested in Canada that same year and fought extradition  
for six years. In 1994, the case was transferred to Orange County 
because of extensive media coverage in Calaveras County. 
</P>
<P>
	A prisoner's cell, human remains and victims' belongings were  
found at Lake's cabin in Calaveras County. Other victims' 
belongings were found at Ng's San Francisco apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors let videotapes of victims speak for themselves as  
they concluded their final summation on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last words the jury heard before court recessed were  
directed at a partially nude Brenda O'Connor, one of the final 
victims. On a tape made by Ng and Lake, she has just been given a 
choice: become their sex slave or be raped and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng cuts away her shirt and bra with a knife.  
</P>
<P>
	``Notice who has the weapon in this scene,'' said Calaveras  
County District Attorney Peter Smith. ``Notice who's the 
aggressor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stand up, Brenda,'' Lake says as the tape ends.

<HEADLINE> DNA Finds Improper Whale Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have used DNA fingerprinting to prove that whale meat  
sold in Japan comes from endangered animals, an accusation that 
Japan has rejected in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the meat's sale is not prohibited by treaties that ban  
most whaling and regulate the trade in endangered animal products, 
conservationists say the genetic results demonstrate that current 
whaling laws are not working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loopholes in the regulatory network are large enough for  
protected whales to slip through,'' said Frank Cipriano, co-author 
of the Harvard study to be published Thursday in the latest issue 
of the scientific journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNA technology can help the whaling industry regulate  
itself to prevent illegal meat from entering commercial markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard biologists who sequenced the DNA in samples from whale  
meat sold in Osaka, Japan, for the first time have traced a meat 
sample to an individual whale -- in this case, a rare blue-fin 
hybrid that was killed off the coast of Iceland in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunt apparently was legal because the Iceland-registered  
vessel held a permit to take whales from unspecified species for 
scientific research. Their meat can be sold, although the 
International Whaling Commission recommends it go to local markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, Japan  
and other nations have secured scientific exceptions to continue 
hunting about 1,000 whales annually. But they are restricted to 
more plentiful species. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Harvard's Cipriano and co-author Stephen R. Palumbi  
were among a group of researchers who surreptitiously sampled whale 
meat from sushi restaurants and supermarket freezers in Japan and 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Using less specific genetic comparisons, researchers at the  
University of Auckland in New Zealand reported last year that the 
meat samples were from 30 individual whales. Many were rare 
species, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's national whaling agency rejected the Auckland report as  
scientifically flawed. If markets were selling endangered whale 
meat, the incidents were isolated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Harvard group continued to test the samples with  
more precise methods. 
</P>
<P>
	The rare hybrid whale meat being sold in Osaka, known as sample  
no. 26, was among the whales sequenced in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 26 was killed in June 1989 near Hvalfjordur, Iceland. A rare  
male hybrid -- its father was a fin-whale and mother a blue-whale -- 
it was one of four such hybrids documented since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a second treaty, the U.N. Convention on Trade in  
Endangered Species, prohibits international trade in rare animal 
products, Iceland had not signed the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	That made it legal for Japan to import the hybrid blue-fin meat  
despite its very rare status. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every step was technically legal, even if it was not in the  
spirit of the law,'' Cipriano said ``That's why they call them 
loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups point to the Harvard study as proof that  
whaling nations such as Japan are primarily interested in 
satisfying demand for an exotic, expensive delicacy, despite 
signing conservation treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises legitimate concerns about the willingness and the  
ability of the Japanese to enforce their agreements,'' said Roger 
McManus, president of the Center for Marine Conservation in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Whales are the planet's largest mammals, and many species have  
been hunted to the brink of extinction. Their meat is prized by 
some cultures, and their blubber and bones have been processed into 
soap, oils and other products.

<HEADLINE> Shell Craves Another Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The resume is impressive: Hall of Fame lineman.  
Survived almost six seasons as the Raiders' head coach working for 
the despotic Al Davis. Turned a bunch of run-and-shoot misfits into 
a Super Bowl offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone interested?  
</P>
<P>
	Art Shell wants another chance to be a head coach. Only this  
time, he doesn't feel the color of his skin should have anything to 
do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I have something to offer,'' the first black coach of  
the NFL's modern era said. ``I've done it before. I know what it 
takes to win. ... I can lead men. The key thing in my mind to being 
a coach in the NFL is being able to lead men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shell has certainly done nothing to dissuade that notion as  
offensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons. Two years ago, he 
inherited a ragtag unit that was used to the passive blocking 
schemes of the run-and-shoot. The new boss, Dan Reeves, favored a 
run-oriented, ball-control style of offense centered around Jamal 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of growing pains the last two years,'' center  
Robbie Tobeck said. ``We were watching the film from the Denver 
game last year and we were like, `Man, we were no good.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, they weren't. Outside of Bob Whitfield, a former  
first-round pick, there seemed to be nothing of redeeming value on 
the Falcons' line. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobeck was an undrafted free agent. Calvin Collins was a  
sixth-round draft pick. Gene Williams had been dumped by the old 
Cleveland Browns. The right tackle position was a wasteland, 
finally filled this year by rookie Ephraim Salaam, a 
seventh-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a bunch of run-and-shoot misfits,'' Whitfield said.  
``We blew a lot of assignments. I can admit that. We played hard, 
but we just weren't there as a unit. We needed a little grooming, 
and Art was patient with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still an impressive mountain of a man, able to command respect  
with his presence alone, Shell saw a desire to improve in this 
woebegone group. Prior to the very first workout, he told them, 
``No matter what happens from here on out, remember, I love all of 
you guys. When I jump on you, it's not because I don't like you. 
It's because I'm trying to make you better football players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They laughed nervously but were willing pawns in his Shell game.  
</P>
<P>
	On the field, he cajoled and criticized, intimidated and taught,  
prodded and pushed. Off the field, he helped instill a sense of 
togetherness, so critical at a position where one breakdown, one 
missed signal, can make the whole group look bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell lifts his cap to reveal a head of hair that's grown  
increasingly gray over the last two years. But the success of his 
work can be measured in the accomplishments of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons to have an All-Pro running back (Anderson), a Pro  
Bowl quarterback (Chris Chandler) and two players (Tony Martin and 
Terance Mathis) with more than 1,100 yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that would have been possible without the guys up front.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just gave them some guidance, some technique, tried to show  
them what it takes to be an offensive lineman in the NFL,'' Shell 
said. ``I had to get on them about certain things, but you've got 
to give them honey, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The linemen began eating together. They conducted business  
together. They set up a good-natured system of fines that are 
imposed for all sorts of alleged offenses, real and imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, they raised nearly $7,000 among themselves -- donating  
$1,000 to charity, using the rest for a blowout of a party before 
the team traveled to Miami for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell rarely raises his voice and problems are addressed in  
private. His gentle but firm brand of leadership was embraced by 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never try to embarrass anybody,'' he said. ``I don't like  
doing that. I don't think you have to embarrass somebody to be a 
coach. If I have a problem, I will get him behind closed doors and 
we can sit down and talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, Shell's low-key persona has been a hindrance to  
landing another head coaching job, even though he posted a 54-38 
record and won a division title while coaching the Raiders from 
1989-94. He was viewed as a Davis' lackey, a puppet figure who bent 
to the whims of his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that's a factor,'' Shell said. ``Sure, when I started  
out, I needed some help from Al. But Al didn't coach on the field. 
I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shell was interviewed by the expansion Cleveland Browns during  
the playoffs, but didn't get the job. All the other available 
positions have been filled as well, so it appears he'll spend 
another season as an assistant after Sunday's game against the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	While disappointed, Shell shies away from injecting race as an  
issue. He wants to judged on his merits as a man and as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was named the coach the first time, the black issue  
came up and I understand that,'' he said. ``But now, I hope and 
expect that we are beyond that.''

<HEADLINE> Prepared Text of Pope's Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The prepared text of Pope John Paul II's comments during a  
prayer service Wednesday at the Cathedral Basilica, as provided by 
the Archdiocese of St. Louis: 

</P>
<P>
	Dear Friends,  
</P>
<P>
	We are here together in this striking Cathedral Basilica to  
worship God and to let our prayer rise up to him like incense. In 
singing God's praises, we remember and acknowledge God's dominion 
over creation and over our lives. Our prayer this evening reminds 
us that our true mother-tongue is the praise of God, the language 
of Heaven, our true home. 
</P>
<P>
	We are gathered on what is already the eve of a new millennium --  
by any standard a decisive turning-point for the world. 
</P>
<P>
	As we look at the century we are leaving behind, we see that  
human pride and the power of sin have made it difficult for many 
people to speak their mother-tongue. In order to be able to sing 
God's praises we must relearn the language of humility and trust, 
the language of moral integrity and of sincere commitment to all 
that is truly good in the sight of the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
	We have just heard a moving reading in which the Prophet Isaiah  
envisions a people returning from exile, overwhelmed and 
discouraged. We too sometimes experience the parched desert-land: 
our hands feeble, our knees weak, our hearts frightened. How often 
the praise of God dies on our lips and a song of lament comes 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The prophet's message is a call for trust, a call to courage, a  
call to hope for salvation from the Lord. How compelling, for all 
of us today, his exhortation: ``Be strong, fear not! Here is your 
God ... he comes to save you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Our gracious host, Archbishop Rigali, has invited to this  
Evening Prayer representatives of many different religious groups 
and sectors of civil society. I greet the vice president of the 
United States of America, and the other civil authorities and 
community leaders present. 
</P>
<P>
	I greet my brothers and sisters in the Catholic faith: the  
members of the laity who want to live their baptismal dignity ever 
more intensely in their efforts to bring the gospel to bear on the 
realities of everyday life in society. 
</P>
<P>
	With affection I greet my brother priests, representing all the  
many zealous and generous priests of St. Louis and other dioceses. 
My hope is that you will rejoice each day in your encounter -- in 
prayer and in the Eucharist -- with the living Jesus Christ, whose 
priesthood you share. 
</P>
<P>
	I happily greet the deacons of the church and encourage you in  
your liturgical, pastoral and charitable ministry. A special word 
of thanks goes to your wives and families for their supportive role 
in this ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The many religious who are here this evening represent thousands  
and thousands of women and men who have labored in the archdiocese 
from the beginning. You are those who follow Christ by imitating 
his total self-giving to the Father and to the cause of his 
kingdom. My appreciation and thanks go to each one of you. 
</P>
<P>
	I gladly address a special word of encouragement to the  
seminarians. You will be the priests of the new millennium, working 
with Christ in the new evangelization; helping the church, under 
the action of the Holy Spirit, to meet the demands of the new 
century. I pray each day that the Lord will make you ``shepherds 
after his own heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I am particularly pleased that distinguished members of other  
churches and ecclesial communities have joined the Catholic 
community of St. Louis in this evening prayer. With hope and 
confidence let us continue to work together to realize the Lord's 
desire: ``That they may all be one ... that the world may 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	My friendship and esteem go also to those of all other religious  
traditions. In particular I recall my long association with members 
of the Jewish faith, and my meetings in many parts of the world 
with my Muslim brothers and sisters. Today, divine providence has 
brought us all together and enabled us to pray: ``O God, let all 
the nations praise you.'' May this prayer signify our shared 
commitment to ever greater understanding and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	I wish also to say a word of appreciation to the civic community  
of the entire metropolitan area, to all those associated with the 
city of St. Louis and committed to its human, cultural and social 
well-being. Your determination to meet the many urban challenges 
facing the community will help bring about a renewed ``Spirit of 
St. Louis'' to serve the cause of the city, which is the cause of 
its people and their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern must be the training of young people for  
positive participation in the community. In this regard I share the 
archdiocese's hope that Cardinal Ritter College Prep, sustained by 
the concerted support of all sectors, will be able to continue to 
give numerous young people the opportunity for quality education 
and genuine human advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the church's name I express gratitude to everyone, including  
the business community, for their continuing support of many worthy 
charitable, social and educational services promoted by the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh God, let all the nations praise you!''  
</P>
<P>
	At the end of this century -- at once marked by unprecedented  
progress and by a tragic toll of human suffering -- radical changes 
in world politics leave America with a heightened responsibility to 
be for the world an example of a genuinely free, democratic, just 
and humane society. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a lesson for every powerful nation in the Canticle from  
the Book of Revelation which we have recited. It actually refers to 
the song of freedom which Moses sang after he had led the people 
through the Red Sea, saving them from the wrath of the Pharaoh. The 
whole of salvation history has to be read in the perspective of 
that Exodus: God reveals himself in his actions to defend the 
humble of the earth and free the oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same way, in her Magnificat Canticle, Mary, the Mother of  
the Redeemer, gives us the key to understanding God's intervention 
in human history when she says: the Lord ``has scattered the proud 
in the conceit of their hearts ... and exalted the lowly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From salvation history we learn that power is responsibility: it  
is service, not privilege. Its exercise is morally justifiable when 
it is used for the good of all, when it is sensitive to the needs 
of the poor and defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
	There is another lesson here: God has given us a moral law to  
guide us and protect us from falling back into the slavery of sin 
and falsehood. We are not alone with our responsibility for the 
great gift of freedom. The Ten Commandments are the charter of true 
freedom, for individuals as well as for society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	America first proclaimed its independence on the basis of  
self-evident moral truths. America will remain a beacon of freedom 
for the world as long as it stands by those moral truths which are 
the very heart of its historical experience. 
</P>
<P>
	And so America: If you want peace, work for justice. If you want  
justice, defend life. If you want life, embrace the truth -- the 
truth revealed by God. 
</P>
<P>
	In this way the praise of God, the language of Heaven, will be  
ever on this people's lips: ``The Lord is God, the mighty. ... Come 
then, let us bow down and worship.'' Amen.

<HEADLINE> Renowned Architect Dies at Age 89 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No matter if he was peddling soap or  
designing skyscrapers or building state-of-the-art sports arenas, 
architect and industrialist Charles Luckman never lost sight of his 
own vision: Build what the people want. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckman, who helped create American landmarks including Boston's  
Prudential Center and the new Madison Square Garden in New York, 
died Tuesday. He was 89 and died in his sleep at home, said Nancy 
Hogan, executive vice president of Luckman Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
	His legacy stretched from coast to coast: Luckman helped create  
Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Center, Houston's Johnson Space 
Center, Hawaii's Aloha Stadium and several Los Angeles landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Kansas City, Mo., Luckman trained as an architect but  
was a soap salesman when Time magazine put him on its cover in 1937 
as American industry's ``Boy Wonder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 30 he was Pepsodent Co.'s president; seven years later he  
became president of Lever Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	He used his training to influence the design of Lever House, the  
soap manufacturer's 21-story headquarters and Park Avenue's first 
glass and steel skyscraper, which has been heralded as one of the 
world's greatest examples of modern architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950 he returned to architecture, establishing his own firm  
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckman's firm designed Los Angeles International Airport's  
original control tower and his namesake $22 million Arts Complex at 
California State University, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He designed with practicality in mind, asking workers or  
patients or fans what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckman designed Aloha Stadium to be the first with seats that  
move on a cushion of air to change sight lines for either football 
or baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Learn to listen to your clients,'' he implored architecture  
students in 1982. ``It's a shocking thought, but your client was 
smart enough to make enough money to hire you and to afford to 
build a building. Listen. You just may possibly learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A civic activist who was a director on more than 60  
organizational boards, Luckman served for 22 years on the 
California State University Board of Trustees, twice as its 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. presidents from Harry Truman to George Bush sought  
Luckman's advice, usually on philanthropic or volunteer efforts 
such as the Citizen's Food Committee, a post-World War II effort to 
bring food to the needy in Europe, said Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, he became the first architect to be awarded the  
American Management Association's Gantt Medal for distinguished 
achievement of management as a community service, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Harriet; and sons, Charles Jr.,  
James and Stephen; eight grandchildren, and six great 
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dave Kearsley gave up doing impressions of famous  
people a long time ago. What he couldn't let go of was a deep 
resonant voice that would land him two tickets for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old astrophysics student from the University of  
Minnesota won the finals of a John Facenda sound-a-like contest 
Wednesday and will watch his first NFL game in person Sunday at Pro 
Player Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Facenda was the legendary voice of NFL Films before his death in  
1984, known for his booming delivery and a dramatic style of 
storytelling considered a perfect complement to highlight reels. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearsley was one of three finalists in a contest that began in  
the selected NFL cities of Chicago, San Francisco, Tampa and 
Minneapolis in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Kearney, an intern for a San Francisco television  
station, was the runner-up. Bill Carroll, a college professor from 
Chicago, was eliminated after the first of two rounds Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearsley, from Tarrytown, N.Y., grew up listening to Facenda on  
weekly highlight shows and said he once did decent impressions of 
entertainment personalities like Bill Cosby and Howard Cosell. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the key to sounding like Facenda, dubbed by some as the  
``Voice of God ,'' was detailed preparation for the contest and a 
naturally deep voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I found out that we'd be reading from a prepared text, I  
sat down with two computers and listened to the music in one ear 
and the words in the other,'' Kearsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's game between the Broncos and Falcons will be the first  
NFL game he's watched in person. The other finalists won three-day 
cruises to Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	THANK YOU: Players for five teams, including the Broncos and  
Falcons, will thank fans in their communities during a 60-second 
NFL commercial that will air during Sunday's game. Denver's Terrell 
Davis, Ed McCaffrey, Howard Griffith and Vaughn Hebron and 
Atlanta's Chris Chandler, Jamal Anderson, Ray Buchanan and Bob 
Whitfield are among 20 players reaching out to fans at their homes, 
in grocery stores, restaurants, railroad stations and beauty 
salons. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PARTY WORM: There's no word on how fast tickets are going for  
the party Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra will co-host Thursday 
night at Liquid on South Beach. The $30 admission charge allows 
access to the Triple-X No-No Room, the Retro Drag Room and the Funk 
Room. 
</P>
<P>
	Last time anyone heard, they were still man and wife.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SUPER VOICE: Fox play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall, covering  
his 14th Super Bowl for network television and 26th overall, 
doesn't see himself following long-time college football voice 
Keith Jackson into retirement any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson retired after the Fiesta Bowl this month. Summerall, 68,  
sees himself continuing as long as he's healthy and doesn't get to 
a point when his job feels like work. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I don't mind flying and traveling. As long as I  
enjoy the game. As long as I feel like I haven't lost touch with 
what's going on. No, I wouldn't voluntarily retire,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fox may say: 'Hey, we think that's enough.' In that case, I  
guess it depends. But I don't plan any great announcement or 
anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FANS UNITE: A national fans group is calling for a massive  
``mute out'' of Sunday's halftime show. The National Sports Fan 
Union is asking television viewers to turn off the program in 
protest of being taken for granted ``in a sports world featuring 
lockouts, outrageous ticket prices, and owners holding cities 
hostage for new stadiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By participating in this `Mute Out,' fans will be sending a  
clear message that the greed in sports has gotten out of control, 
and that changes must me made,'' said Steve Goldstein, co-founder 
of the group.

<HEADLINE> Sony's Profits Rise; Sales Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp.'s profits rose 2 percent in its fiscal  
third quarter on a special accounting gain, but operating profits 
tumbled as global economic weakness hammered its main electronics 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony reported Wednesday it earned 112.31 billion yen, or $968.3  
million, in the three months ended Dec. 31, aided by a special gain 
of 58.7 billion yen related to an employee benefits plan. Sony 
earned 110.37 billion yen in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time accounting boost in the recent quarter,  
Sony's operating profits dropped 20 percent. Sales fell 3 percent 
to 1.95 trillion yen, or $16.79 billion, from 2.01 trillion yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic problems hurt electronics sales in Latin America,  
Russia, Eastern Europe and other parts of Asia. Sony also suffered 
from intense price competition in the United States and Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Best known for TVs and its Walkman stereos, Sony has branched  
out in recent years and now makes computers, cellular phones and 
semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from electronics dropped 49 percent in the  
quarter, offsetting gains in Sony's other divisions -- films, music, 
video games and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Pictures improved profits despite lower revenue, as strong  
home-video sales offset a lack of strong box-office releases. Music 
profits were boosted by releases from Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and 
George Michael. The games division benefited from strong sales of 
the PlayStation video game machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak electronics market caused Sony to further cut its  
profit forecast for the full year ending March 31. Sony expects 
profits to drop 28 percent to 160 billion yen, which is down from 
the forecast of 170 billion yen Sony released three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Sony's profits  
fell nearly 2 percent to 198.37 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, while 
sales climbed 5 percent to 5.32 trillion yen, or $45.83 billion.

<HEADLINE> Presley Drops Suit Against Tabloid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lisa Marie Presley dropped her lawsuit  
against the National Enquirer, which had said she was suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am satisfied with the settlement,'' Ms. Presley said  
Wednesday, explaining the lawsuit was designed to send a message to 
tabloids that she won't tolerate publication of untruths. 
</P>
<P>
	Enquirer editor Steve Coz was outraged by Ms. Presley's  
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is lying if she means to suggest that she proved false the  
1997 article,'' Coz said from his Lantana, Fla., office. ``If Lisa 
Marie wanted a public airing of the facts surrounding these matters 
she would not have dropped her lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tabloid reported that Ms. Presley tried to kill herself and  
performed self-mutilation, drawing blood from her body and 
scrawling, ``Nobody loves me'' and ``I'm ugly'' on her arms.

<HEADLINE> InterMedia, Charter, TCI Swap Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Three cable television companies serving  
Southern and Central states will swap assets in a $2.4 billion 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Charter Communications will  
acquire systems that InterMedia Partners now uses to serve about 
700,000 customers in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI, which is being acquired by communications giant AT&AMP;T, will  
give up its 49 percent stake in InterMedia in exchange for 
InterMedia's 300,000 customers in the Nashville area and Charter's 
systems in several Indiana communities; Shelbyville, Ky.; Logan, 
Utah; and Milltown, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI President Leo J. Hindery said InterMedia's recently rebuilt  
cable systems should help TCI provide the advanced communications 
services that will be available after the merger with AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has announced plans to spend billions of dollars upgrading  
TCI's cable systems to handle all-in-one packages of TV, local 
phone and Internet services. The TCI acquisition, valued at about 
$43 billion, is a major part of AT&AMP;T's push to use cable lines to 
offer local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI, currently the nation's second-largest cable company,  
already provides local phone service through its cable systems in 
Hartford, Conn., and the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter will pay InterMedia an unspecified amount of cash and  
will give it systems serving 140,000 customers in Indiana, 
Kentucky, Utah and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter will take over about 400,000 customers in Greenville and  
Spartanburg, S.C.; Athens and Gainesville, Ga.; Asheville and 
Marion, N.C.; Kingsport, Cleveland and Alcoa, Tenn.; and some West 
Tennessee communities. 
</P>
<P>
	InterMedia, now the 10th-largest cable system, will continue to  
own and manage systems serving about 465,000 customers in Kentucky, 
Georgia and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said TCI and InterMedia may strike a deal that would  
allow InterMedia to continue managing and operating the Nashville 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. It was  
ranked the eighth-fastest-growing company in the country by Inc. 
magazine last year, when it announced plans to acquire Marcus 
Cable. That deal should bump it up to No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	A definitive agreement will be finalized over the next couple of  
months and the transaction is expected to close this summer, 
pending regulatory and other approvals, the companies said.

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Wednesday's developments in the impeachment  
trial: 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate voted Wednesday on two critical motions. The first --  
a motion to dismiss the charges against President Clinton -- was 
voted down. The second -- a motion allowing House managers to depose 
Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal -- was 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both votes were largely along party lines, 56-44, with only one  
Democrat, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, breaking ranks on both 
motions. And both fell far short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	--House managers gave no indication when deposition of witnesses  
might begin. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott predicted that, barring White  
House lawyers calling witnesses, the trial could conclude by the 
President's Day holiday, Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Senate trial resumes at 1 p.m. Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Johnson &AMP; Johnson Wants Spread OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson will market the product touted  
as a cholesterol-lowering margarine as a food, not a dietary 
supplement, and hopes to get the spread onto store shelves by late 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson has battled the Food and Drug Administration  
for four months over just what classification to give its new 
spread, called Benecol. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J initially wanted to sell it as a dietary supplement so it  
would not need government approval before going on the market. The 
FDA wanted to treat it as a food additive, subject to a lengthy 
safety review. That would undoubtedly slow Benecol's path to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said this week it is willing to considering classifying  
the ingredients in Benecol as ``generally recognized as safe.'' If 
it receives such a recognition, it can be added to products without 
prior approval, a faster course than a full regulatory review. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol could potentially ring up at least $400 million in  
annual sales once it becomes established, said Charlene Lu, analyst 
with Prudential Securities. Benecol is important to J&AMP;J because it 
has not introducted a big new product in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol contains an ingredient known as plant stanol esters,  
which are natural components of wood, plants, fruits and 
vegetables. In its marketing information, Johnson &AMP; Johnson cites a 
recent study conducted by The Mayo Clinic, which found that Benecol 
can reduce LDL cholesterol, known commonly as bad cholesterol, by 
up to 14 percent, if eaten regularly.

<HEADLINE> Race Preference Foes Boost Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservatives who say top U.S. colleges are  
illegally using racial preferences in admissions are taking their 
case to the nation's college newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper ads by the Center for Individual Rights, a  
conservative law firm representing students suing universities, are 
headlined ``Guilty by Admission'' and charge that nearly every 
elite college in the United States violates the law. 
</P>
<P>
	But many educators say the law firm has misrepresented 20 years  
of court rulings and overstated colleges' efforts to bring 
diversity to their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The center issued two 30-page handbooks it says are intended to  
help students identify discrimination and to help institutions keep 
from getting sued, but critics say the handbooks are designed to 
incite lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colleges very clearly understand they may not use quotas,''  
said Norma Cantu, the assistant secretary for the Department of 
Education's Office of Civil Rights, referring to programs that 
don't consider a student's merit. ``There's no need for a 
handbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth spokeswoman Laurel Stavis said the college would not  
comment until it had seen the handbook. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads started running Tuesday in campus newspapers such as The  
Daily Dartmouth. While that newspaper and those at other Ivy League 
colleges have occasionally rejected ads, such as one denying the 
existence of the Holocaust, such rejections are rare, said editor 
Jacob Elberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is clearly something that's being debated all over the  
country,'' Elberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads and handbooks are part of a campaign to highlight the  
use of racial preferences in admissions, say conservatives, 
including former Education Secretary William Bennett, who called 
college diversity programs ``an antithesis of the civil rights 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, they cited  
anecdotes and a handful of state-specific studies as evidence that 
race preference without merit is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the government, minority college enrollment was  
25.3 percent in 1995, up from 16.5 percent in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group supporting the campaign, The Center for Equal  
Opportunity, was releasing a study today concluding that the odds 
of a white candidate being admitted to the University of Virginia 
instead of an equally qualified black candidate are 45 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, based on 1996 applications for 10 public Virginia  
universities, include the race, sex, SAT scores, class rank and 
high school grade point averages of 72,000 applicants who were 
admitted or rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've found use of racial ethnic preference in all of the  
states. The more selective schools tend to use preferences the 
most,'' said Roger Clegg, general counsel for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rene Redwood, executive director of Americans for a Fair  
Chance, a group that advises colleges and community groups on 
affirmative action, says many preference programs are still needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have studies that show that there are communities that are  
healthier because women and minorities who become doctors often 
return to those communities,'' Redwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides in the affirmative action battle cite the 1978 Bakke  
case, in which a white student denied admission to medical school 
claimed specific slots for minority students were unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court decided colleges could not have separate  
admissions criteria for minority students, but could consider race 
a ``plus'' factor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a federal appeals court in the Hopwood case from Texas  
essentially contradicted Bakke and barred the consideration of race 
in admissions and financial-aid decisions, citing other high court 
rulings involving government contracting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court has refused to hear Hopwood, but the appeals  
court's decision is binding only in the its region of Texas, 
Louisiana and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Universities also must consider state ballot measures such as  
California's 1996 Proposition 209 that ban many racial preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colleges do not just seek racial and ethnic diversity when  
composing a class,'' said Deborah Wilds of the American Council on 
Education, a Washington group representing 1,800 public and private 
universities.

<HEADLINE> Toronto: Ganga Wanted Cheap Tuition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- One of the six International Olympic Committee  
members ousted for corruption asked for a financial favor from 
then-Ontario premier David Peterson during bidding for the 1996 
Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, visiting the city in  
the late 1980s, asked Peterson that his son pay cheaper tuition at 
York University as a Canadian resident rather than the 
international student fee, Norm Seagram, a spokesman for Toronto's 
bid committee, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was turned down, Seagram and Paul Henderson, head of  
the bid committee, said. ``The premier said no,'' Seagram said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga's son, Guy, graduated from York's Glendon College in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, ousted by the IOC on Sunday, is accused of accepting  
cash, travel, medical expenses and other lavish gifts valued at 
more than $216,010 from Salt Lake City successful bidders for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Pound, an IOC vice president and Montreal lawyer,  
dismissed accusations by Ganga that he is using the scandal to 
further his ambitions to succeed current president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	A Paris newspaper quoted Ganga as saying the scandal is ``part  
of a struggle for the succession of president Samaranch and they 
are doing everything they can to eliminate those who might campaign 
against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said it could have the opposite effect.  
</P>
<P>
	``This, if anything would hurt any such aspirations,'' Pound  
said. ``When you do a cleanup thing, everyone agrees that cleanup 
should occur, but the one who's connected with it usually pays the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that when I started, but I still think we have to do  
it.''

	``Down in the Delta'' (Virgin) -- Various artists  

</P>
<P>
	Unlike some movie soundtracks that slap together songs that have  
nothing to do with the picture, ``Down in the Delta,'' has produced 
a fitting musical counterpart to echo its themes of love, 
redemption and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost exclusively a collection of ballads, the soundtrack  
features a who's who of top entertainers, from Janet Jackson to 
Stevie Wonder. Wonder's contribution, ``If Ever,'' with the sounds 
of nature and birds in the background, is serene and lovely, while 
D'Angelo turns up the heat on the sexy ``Heaven Must Be Like 
This.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just about every track here is a winner. The Sounds of Blackness  
offers up a riveting gospel performance, as usual, on ``Don't Let 
Nothin' Keep You Down''; Shawn Stockman from Boyz II Men provides 
one of the sweetest songs with the soft tone of ``Just a Little 
Luv.''

</P>
<P>
	Anyone who thinks Howard Jones was strictly a 1980s phenomenon  
should check out his eighth and latest release, ``People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disc, covered with oval-shaped photos of HoJo fans, kicks  
off on a catchy, upbeat note with ``You're the Buddha'' and 
``Tomorrow Is Now.'' But the classically trained pianist wastes no 
time reminding us he's king of the pop ballad (who can forget 
1986's haunting ``No One Is to Blame'') with the sorrowful ``Let Me 
Be the First to Know'', the understated ``Not One of the Lonely 
Tonight,'' and the beautiful lullaby ``Sleep My Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' richly orchestrated, grown-up sound will resonate with  
his now thirtysomething fans who discovered him in high school.

<P>
	That's not to say it's not good because it is a pleasant enough  
earful of acoustic instrumentation and has poetic lyrics like 
``Wind through the window, come sing me a song'' in ``Good to Be

like ``Sunday Bloody Sunday,'' ``Pride (In the Name of Love)'' and 
``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For'' since 1978.

	Any self-respecting U2 fan already owns this collection, a

delight is found in the limited B-sides collection, which includes 
``The Three Sunrises,'' ``Silver and Gold'' and the instrumental

<HEADLINE> Brewers, Jim Abbott Agree to Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jim Abbott will get to see new faces at the  
plate -- and on the mound -- in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old left-hander is taking his comeback to the  
National League, where the one-handed pitcher will have to bat for 
the first time since he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about it,'' said Abbott, who agreed  
Wednesday to a $600,000, one-year contract with the Milwaukee 
Brewers. ``I'm looking forward to swinging the bat. I hope I can 
hold my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Abbott went 2-18 for the California Angels, leading the  
majors in losses. He was released by the Angels in spring training 
last year and stayed out of baseball until the Chicago White Sox 
signed him on May 31, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 6-6 for four minor league teams, Abbott went 5-0 in  
five late-season starts for the White Sox last season and felt he 
had made a bid to become a member of the team's 1999 starting 
rotation. But the White Sox decided they would rather give their 
innings to young pitchers, so Abbott chose the Brewers, who 
promised him a spot in their rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's his spot to lose. I mean, someone's going to have  
to beat him out because we're penciling him in as one of the 
starters,'' said Brewers general manager Sal Bando, who is hoping 
Abbott's experience and work ethic will aid his young pitching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected by the California Angels in the first round of the 1988  
amateur draft out of the University of Michigan, Abbott has an 
85-100 career record and 4.12 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott gets a $400,000 base salary and the chance to earn  
$200,000 in performance bonuses: $40,000 each for 12, 16, 20, 24 
and 28 starts. The pitcher and the team have a $1.5 million mutual 
option for 2000 with a $200,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said his goals are 30 starts and 200 innings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think any pitcher that does that as a starter has really  
given his contribution to the team,'' he said. ``That's the kind of 
pitcher I prided myself on being earlier in my career. And that's 
the pitcher I would like to get back to being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott credited his comeback to changing speeds, location and  
release points on his fastball -- along with his attitude -- 
adjustments he failed to make in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really explain '96,'' Abbott said. ``I got off to a  
bad start and I just didn't pitch with confidence. I became awful 
tentative on the mound and it just became a downward spiral, a bad 
year personally and it was a tough year for the Angels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Abbott said the experience of hitting rock bottom and  
climbing back to the majors has made him a better pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was gone from the game,'' he said. ``I know what it's like  
to sit there on the couch and watch the game and miss it. I'm very 
fortunate to be young enough and healthy enough to come back and 
play again.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Doesn't Dismiss Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate refused today to dismiss the  
impeachment case against President Clinton, voting mostly along 
party lines. Majority Republicans pressed ahead with plans to allow 
House prosecutors to question Monica Lewinsky and two other 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 56-44 to reject a motion by Democratic Sen. Robert  
Byrd of West Virginia that would have dismissed perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges brought by the House against the 
nation's 42nd president. Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold voted 
with the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate next turned to its vote on approving the House  
prosecutors' request to subpoena the three witnesses -- Ms. 
Lewinsky, White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal and presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan -- to questions them about the president's 
efforts to conceal his affair with the former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the trial, Senate Republicans discussed a plan that  
could end the trial within 10 days if the White House did not call 
its own defense witnesses. The White House said it was concerned 
that Republicans were trying to ``put a blindfold on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The country wants this over. ... As we move forward here, the  
country will understand that this trial belongs to the Senate 
Republicans and the Republican House managers and that they alone 
are responsible for extending this process,'' press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats also reacted warily to the GOP plan but left  
open the possibility of further negotiations. ``We're not going to 
rush to any conclusion,'' Minority Leader Tom Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he was concerned Republicans  
were telling the president, ``We want to have our witnesses but you 
don't need to have your witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP plan, the depositions of the three witnesses would  
begin as early as Thursday and would be videotaped. Each deposition 
would last six hours, equally divided between the White House and 
House prosecutors with two senators sitting in as mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotaped sessions and transcripts would be distributed  
Monday to senators, who would then vote Tuesday on whether to 
permit live testimony. The timetable would allow for that testimony 
and then closing statements from the House managers and White House 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla.,  
acknowledged that ``we kind of need to get a little bit closer on 
some details'' before any bipartisan agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans expected to muster party-line majorities  
today to defeat a Democratic motion to dismiss the impeachment case 
and approve witness depositions. At the same time, Democrats were 
ready to demonstrate the strength to block the two-thirds majority 
that eventually would be needed to oust Clinton from office 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today that if prosecution witnesses are  
allowed the president's lawyers deserve a chance to review some 
56,000 pages in still-secret evidence the House collected during 
the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're now trying to put a blindfold on us,'' press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said, declining to say whether the White House would 
demand to slow things down or call its own witnesses. ``We believe 
we ought to have an adequate chance to get prepared and to present 
a defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House remains convinced that the best course is to  
avoid calling witnesses altogether, he added. ``We don't want this 
to stay open-ended. We think there is enough testimony on the 
record now for members to make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After days of being blamed for considering extending the trial,  
Senate Republicans suggested their plan would turn the tables on 
the White House. ``The longer it is prolonged, the more risk to 
their client. If another shoe drops, it's there fault, not ours,'' 
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks before today's votes, Lott said, ``There is a point  
when we will complete the work we are involved in and I believe it 
could be within the next 10 days, two weeks at the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott won over some wavering Republicans on the issue of deposing  
witnesses after House prosecutors Tuesday restricted their list to 
Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center of the 
sex and cover-up scandal, and then two presidential confidants. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors on Tuesday asked the Senate to invite Clinton  
to testify, but the White House has rejected the idea and Daschle 
called the proposal ``a red herring. It is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle warned the trial would plod on indefinitely if witnesses  
were approved, and Clinton lawyer David Kendall said the White 
House would be ``faced with a critical need'' to review mountains 
of previous testimony before deciding whether to seek rebuttal 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, sensing the Senate will not remove Clinton, is considering  
a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to end the trial with 
two votes: the first on whether Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction and the second on whether he should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' that it  
was ``well-grounded both in the Constitution and precedents to have 
separate findings of fact, separate from the decision on whether or 
not the offenses ... justify removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us are concerned about whether an acquittal vote --  
what kind of message that would send to the White House and the 
American people,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., scoffed at that proposal. ``Our  
vote is whether or not to remove the president,'' he said on ABC. 
``We can admit to the fact the president has not been truthful. ... 
But the question is a judgment question: Do we believe it is 
grounds for overturning an election.The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said Tuesday that he, along with GOP  
Reps. Bill McCollum of Florida, James Rogan of California and Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas most likely would depose the witnesses for 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan about his efforts to find  
Ms. Lewinsky a job at the same time she had been subpoenaed in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal is one of the White House aides to whom the president  
falsely denied having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The article of impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says 
Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Profits Down 87 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Slumping sales and restructuring costs  
at Nabisco Holdings Corp. pushed fourth-quarter net income down 87 
percent, the company reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The international manufacturer of cookies, snacks and other  
grocery products said earnings for the October-December quarter 
fell to $19 million, or 7 cents per share, from $146 million, or 54 
cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any extraordinary charges, net income was 50 cents,  
beating a First Call Corp. estimate of 49 cents a share. Nabisco's 
stock rose $1.43 3/4, or 4 percent, to $39.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales slipped 9.3 percent, to $2.21 billion from $2.44 billion a  
year earlier. However, the company noted that for its ongoing 
businesses, sales would have risen 3 percent after adjusting for 
foreign exchange rates and the different number of selling days in 
the two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Nabisco reported a loss of $71 million, or 27  
cents per share, compared with a 1997 profit of $405 million, or 
$1.51 per share. Sales also were down for the year, declining 3.8 
percent to $8.40 billion from $8.73 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income plunged 63 percent for the quarter and 73  
percent for the year, mainly because of $530 million in charges for 
restructuring programs begun in June and December of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We enter 1999 in a greatly strengthened position with good  
momentum,'' said president and chief executive officer James M. 
Kilts, just ending his first year at Nabisco's helm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have strengthened our core brands in biscuits, other snacks  
and most of our specialty food categories,'' while lowering costs 
and better using company assets, Kilts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biscuit company sales, including core cookie brands such as  
Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Nutter Butter, were flat at $3.54 billion for 
1998 but down 2 percent for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco said ongoing businesses in its U.S. Foods Group actually  
increased sales 3 percent to $2.05 billion in 1998 behind record 
growth for Planters nuts and snacks, as well as solid gains for A1 
steak sauce, hot cereals and pet snacks. However, the division's 
total sales fell because the company sold off its College Inn 
broths, margarine and Egg Beaters businesses in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	International sales were down 4.6 percent for the fourth  
quarter, but rose 1 percent after adjusting for unfavorable 
currency rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco also makes Ritz and Air Crisps crackers, A1 steak sauce  
and Grey Poupon mustard.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Has Hip Replacement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Golf was never far away from the thoughts of Jack Nicklaus, even  
as he lay on an operating table just before hip replacement 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather be one down walking up the 18th fairway in  
Augusta than be here,'' Nicklaus said he told the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to his new ceramic left hip, Nicklaus might get that  
chance yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	After surgery Wednesday in Boston that his doctor described as a  
success, Nicklaus will be on crutches for the next six weeks. He 
will miss the Masters in April for the first time in 40 years and 
possibly the U.S. Open in June, but Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum said 
there was no reason to believe Nicklaus would not be competitive 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went well,'' Bierbaum, head of orthopedic surgery  
at New England Baptist Hospital, said after the 1-hour, 45-minute 
operation. ``No complaints. No surprises. I was pleased with how 
everything came along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 professional majors, had a  
degenerative left hip that had troubled him for years. He tried to 
avoid hip replacement surgery with a rigorous exercise routine, but 
finally yielded when the hip began to affect his quality of life as 
well as his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus was resting after surgery and unavailable to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very much looking forward to what it can do for me down  
the road,'' Nicklaus told Golf.com in an interview last week. ``For 
the last three to four months ... I haven't been able to do much of 
anything. I'm not used to that. That's not the way I've lived my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing on one leg, essentially, for several  
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus agreed to use a ceramic hip replacement as part of a  
study directed by Bierbaum and involving 10 hospitals. Ceramic is 
smoother than materials typically used in hip implants and is 
believed to last longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will remain in the hospital for six days before  
returning home to Florida. Bierbaum said Nicklaus would be on 
crutches for six weeks so the bone and soft tissue could heal. 
After that, he would go through a strengthening, flexibility and 
agility program that could take at least six more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking around three months until he is able to hit some  
golf balls,'' Bierbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Nicklaus opted for hip surgery now was to make sure  
he could play in 2000, when the majors are played on courses that 
Nicklaus helped make famous -- Pebble Beach, where he won the U.S. 
Open in 1972; St. Andrews, where he won two of his three British 
Opens; and Valhalla outside Louisville, designed by Nicklaus and 
later bought by the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Nicklaus is not ruling out the rest of 1999. Bierbaum  
estimated the recovery would take at least six months, but Nicklaus 
has said he would like to be ready for his own tournament the first 
week in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to try to get back before the Memorial Tournament  
and try to play there,'' Nicklaus said last week in Monterey, 
Calif., where he is designing a new course. ``If not, maybe the 
Open right after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hip problems, Nicklaus became the oldest player to  
finish in the top 10 in the Masters last April when he thrilled the 
Augusta gallery yet again with a final-round 68 to tie for sixth. 
But he was hobbling so badly in the summer that he pulled out of 
the British Open, ending his streak of 146 consecutive majors. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time Nicklaus has missed the Masters  
since 1958, four years before he turned pro and began one of the 
greatest careers in golf.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japan Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar drifted slightly higher against the yen  
today amid a fresh reiteration of China's official commitment to 
maintain the yuan's value. Tokyo stock prices rose for the third 
consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 68.05 points,  
or 0.47 percent, closing the session at 14,450.06. On Tuesday, the 
average rose 173.20 points, or 1.22 percent, on top of Monday's 
54.41-point rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 113.82 yen, up 0.26  
yen from its level late Tuesday in Tokyo and unchanged from its 
late New York level overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	China's central bank chief, Dai Xianglong, repeated today his  
government's pledge to maintain a stable yuan through the end of 
this year. Earlier this week, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said the 
yuan would remain stable in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai's comments resulted in a brief spurt of yen buying against  
the dollar, sending the greenback as low as 113.45 yen. But 
short-covering by interbank players pushed the dollar back towards 
it daily high of 113.94 yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.59 yen, down  
from 131.82 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks started moderately higher but soon turned mixed on  
a retreat of major bank issues. The market regained upward momentum 
in the afternoon on buying of high technology issues, including 
Hitachi, Kyocera and NEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been propped up in recent days by bank shares,  
which have been boosted by reports of mergers and alliances between 
Japanese banks and stepped up efforts to write off bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 416  
million shares, down from Tuesday's turnover of 499 million shares. 
Despite the Nikkei's gains, declines slightly outnumbered advances 
559 to 557, with 188 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 5.49 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,115.37. The 
TOPIX closed up 11.17 points, or 1.02 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.810 percent from 1.715 percent late 
Tuesday, driving its price down to 99.91 yen from 100.68 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Women Lead European Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Defending champion Maria  
Butyrskaya led three Russian women to top qualifying spots today at 
the European Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russia's bid for a title sweep for the third straight  
year all but ended with the withdrawal of the pairs champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic silver medalists Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton  
Sikharulidze dropped out hours before tonight's pairs finals 
because Berezhnaya has the flu. That puts French couple Sarah 
Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis in the lead entering the free 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's competition, Butyrskaya was the easy winner of  
one qualifying group. She skated first in her group, doing triple 
jumps in a near-empty arena at an hour better suited for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of it felt like practice,'' Butyrskaya said. ``It didn't  
feel like a competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Viktoria Volchkova, one of a number of rising junior  
stars in Russia, came in second in her first major international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other group, former junior world champion Julia Soldatova  
captured the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The women have their short program on Friday with the free  
skating concluding the championships on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya completed five triples and earned marks in the  
5.6-5.7 range, high for the first skater. 
</P>
<P>
	The only skater to come close to her in the group was Volchkova,  
who did four triples to an elegant routine to music from ``Gone 
with the Wind''. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 16, Volchkova has been just below the top trio for the past  
two years in Russia but not able to break into the upper echelon 
until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldatova captured the second group with five triples, falling  
on another. 
</P>
<P>
	She was seventh in last year's Europeans but that wasn't good  
enough to keep her on the Russian Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of coursed I was disappointed but I will get over it,''  
Soldatova said. ``And there are others to go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian women are strong this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Left off the team were Irina Slutskaya, two-time European  
champion and the current world silver medalist, Yelena Sokolova, 
who won two Grand Prix events last fall and Daria Timochenko, the 
current junior world champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereznaya and Sikhardulidze won nine competitions in a row since  
getting the silver medals at the Olympics in Nagano last February. 
</P>
<P>
	They won the short program easily and were heavily favored to  
retain their title. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of dominating the pairs and ice dance in the former  
Soviet Union, the individual skaters are now in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian men have won three of the last four titles in that event  
and the Russian women have won the last three European titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian men went 1-2-3 last year and are in a position to  
three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Urmanov, Yevgeny Plushenko and Alexei Yagudin are so  
close that Thursday's free skating will decide who takes the 
championship.

<HEADLINE> Art Center Celebrates Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- A crack-addicted mother begging for  
help from indifferent bystanders. A partly clothed man seated on a 
bathroom toilet talking about Abraham Lincoln, trousers gathered 
around his feet for effect. 
</P>
<P>
	It's social commentary that probably wouldn't raise an eyebrow  
in New York or San Francisco, but is hardly par for the course in 
the Midwestern city that claims former President Gerald Ford as its 
favorite son. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, as the Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts celebrates its  
21st birthday, it is flourishing and taking artistic risks other 
venues might consider too experimental. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an era of cutbacks in federal art funding, the nonprofit  
group has moved into a new $2 million building with gallery and 
studio space for the public and artists, as well as an alternative 
movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see this become a place for public dialogue on  
arts, even economics ... an open space where people make 
connections they haven't made before,'' says Lambert Zuidervaart, a 
former UICA president. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the UICA unique on the national art scene, experts  
say, is the way it solicits community support for diverse arts, 
ranging from painting and music to theater. It also represents a 
new breed of art organizations no longer dependent on public funds: 
Less than 10 percent of its $375,000 annual budget comes from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're on the cutting edge by combining both performance and  
visual arts,'' says Sandy Boyd, a University of Iowa professor and 
art expert. ``It's impressive ... not only in terms of the 
community, but also in terms of the forward vision. Most 
contemporary venues focus on one or the other, not both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the handful of similar ventures in other cities have had  
a tough time. Many were started in the 1970s, when more public 
funding was available, and have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Randolph Street Gallery in Chicago, a  
nonprofit group with a history of commitment to performance and 
visual arts, closed its doors, in part because of financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Finances also forced the Franklin Furnace, a 22-year-old  
nonprofit organization in New York City, to close its exhibit and 
performance space in 1997, in favor of an Internet web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Sheckler, a member and volunteer for three years, believes  
the key to UICA's success has been its ability to provide space for 
ideas outside the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got involved because of the unique art exhibits and films  
they bring to this area,'' says Mrs. Sheckler, who says she has no 
artistic background but values the chance to enjoy art. ``Today I 
came in to fill out a donor card, so that one of the seats in the 
new theater will have a plaque with my name on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People like Mrs. Sheckler are crucial to the success of  
nonprofit groups, according to Jeff Abell, a professor at Columbia 
College in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're on the dole receiving public money, you're at the  
whim of politicians,'' says Abell, who also is a former assistant 
director of the failed Randolph Street Gallery. ``If you receive 
support from committed individuals, chances are they are going to 
stick with you, even when there is controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Endowment for the Arts is in Washington, D.C.  
What do they know about the community other than the grant 
application?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the NEA's budget has shrunk significantly since its  
inception in 1965 partly because of controversy surrounding grants 
to such sexually explicit artists as Andres Serrano and 
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, but largely because conservative 
politicians have long opposed government support of symphony 
orchestras, opera and dance companies, poets, fine artists and 
musicians. Last year, the federal agency's budget was about $98 
million, down from about $175 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the UICA's operating budget more than quadrupled  
during the same time, even though its public funding has not 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, public funds made up about 40 percent of the UICA's  
then-budget of $80,000. Today, public funding accounts for less 
than 10 percent of this year's $375,000 operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
	UICA has always relied on annual membership drives,  
word-of-mouth advertising and fund-raisers like art auctions and 
beer tastings to raise money from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high price of renovating a new home has meant casting a  
wider net. That includes corporate and individual sponsors who may 
need educating about contemporary art's value, according to Hank 
Meijer, a prominent businessman who co-chaired UICA's fundraising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an entrepreneurial dimension to arts,'' says Meijer,  
who also donates to UICA. ``That's something that people who 
otherwise might not give a hoot about contemporary arts might 
relate to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message apparently is paying off. Some 200 volunteers helped  
sell tickets, answer phones and run film projectors to ensure the 
success of projects like this summer's ``The Human Zoo,'' a 
performance art piece. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to an indisposed Abe Lincoln imitator and  
drug-addicted mom, the exhibit also featured a satire entitled 
``Women Who Love Men Who Kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In written comments after the show, one audience member lauded  
the performance as ``an intellectual haunted house,'' while another 
wrote, ``You people are weird!'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's all right with Greg Bliss, director of one of the pieces,  
who believes the show made people think about the world in which 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became more of a sarcastic comment on modern culture,''  
says Bliss. ``A lot of people who saw it commented how we live 
alongside each other but do not have contact with each other.''

<HEADLINE> Non-Profit Hospital Chains To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The two largest nonprofit hospital chains in north  
Texas plan to merge in a $3.4 billion deal that would create one of 
the nation's largest nonprofit clinic systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger follows more than a year of talks between  
the boards of Baylor Health Care System and Texas Health Resources, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, Southwest Health System, would be among the  
nation's 10 largest nonprofit hospital systems, with combined 
assets of $3.4 billion. It would have 28,900 local employees, 
including more than 7,000 doctors, and control 40 percent of 
hospital business in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Baylor, Presbyterian, St. Paul, Harris and  
Arlington Memorial would be among the 19 acute-care hospitals that 
would function under a single corporate umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties will keep ownership of their existing assets, but  
all operations, profits and losses will be combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some real advantages to be made when we are able to  
provide a delivery system for the entire 4.5 million people in this 
region,'' Baylor President Boone Powell Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers should see few changes initially because the hospitals  
will all keep their names, missions and religious affiliations. The 
deal is expected to be completed this summer if approved by state 
and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all job reductions associated with the merger will be  
accomplished through attrition, said Texas Health President Douglas 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for Hawthorne to be president of the new company and  
for Powell to chair a council made up of hospital leaders.

<HEADLINE> Study: Human Genes Prone to Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the last 6 million years, humans or their ancestors have  
been developing flaws in their genes at a surprisingly fast clip, a 
new study says. But they've apparently removed some of the buildup 
through sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Every newborn over that time span has had an average of two or  
three new harmful mutations, researchers calculated. Such flaws 
don't cause disease, though they detract from a person's overall 
fitness, said the study published in Thursday's issue of the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The study done by Adam Eyre-Walker of the University of Sussex  
in England and Peter Keightley of the University of Edinburgh in 
Scotland offers the first reliable estimates on such mutations, 
said gene expert James F. Crow of the University of Wisconsin in 
Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in a telephone interview that the estimated flaw rate is  
surprisingly high and implies ``a rather large load (of flaws) for 
us to be dealing with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how has the human race survived all that pollution in the  
gene pool? 
</P>
<P>
	Some mutations have apparently been eliminated by people who  
carry them never having offspring, the researchers said. Flaws that 
remain might be too minor to make a real difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Keightley speculated that human ancestors who carried the most  
flaws were least likely to have children. That would eliminate 
mutations in batches and might still be going on today. 
</P>
<P>
	Crow said the new work strengthens the argument that most  
organisms reproduce sexually because it lets them get rid of gene 
flaws more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern medicine, by saving lives and overcoming infertility,  
lets people reproduce now who couldn't have in the past. So it 
presumably lets more bad mutations live on. 
</P>
<P>
	Does this mean the human race will become dangerously loaded  
down with genetic flaws? Don't worry, Keightley and Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's something to think about, but it has an awfully  
long fuse,'' Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutations almost certainly have very tiny effects, such as a  
predisposition to headaches, stomach upsets and weak eyesight, 
especially later in life. It would take centuries or thousands of 
years of modern health care to build up to a significant level of 
harm, Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers calculated the rate of new deleterious mutations  
by looking for differences in the details of 46 genes in humans and 
chimpanzees. That let them estimate rates of mutation since the 
evolutionary split between the ancestors of people and of chimps.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Women Lead European Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Defending champion Maria  
Butyrskaya led three Russian women to top qualifying spots today at 
the European Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russia's bid for a title sweep for the third straight  
year all but ended with the withdrawal of the pairs champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic silver medalists Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton  
Sikharulidze dropped out hours before tonight's pairs finals 
because Berezhnaya has the flu. That puts French couple Sarah 
Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis in the lead entering the free 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's competition, Butyrskaya was the easy winner of  
one qualifying group. She skated first in her group, doing triple 
jumps in a near-empty arena at an hour better suited for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of it felt like practice,'' Butyrskaya said. ``It didn't  
feel like a competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Viktoria Volchkova, one of a number of rising junior  
stars in Russia, came in second in her first major international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other group, former junior world champion Julia Soldatova  
captured the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The women have their short program on Friday with the free  
skating concluding the championships on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya completed five triples and earned marks in the  
5.6-5.7 range, high for the first skater. 
</P>
<P>
	The only skater to come close to her in the group was Volchkova,  
who did four triples to an elegant routine to music from ``Gone 
with the Wind''. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 16, Volchkova has been just below the top trio for the past  
two years in Russia but not able to break into the upper echelon 
until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldatova captured the second group with five triples, falling  
on another. 
</P>
<P>
	She was seventh in last year's Europeans but that wasn't good  
enough to keep her on the Russian Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of coursed I was disappointed but I will get over it,''  
Soldatova said. ``And there are others to go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian women are strong this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Left off the team were Irina Slutskaya, two-time European  
champion and the current world silver medalist, Yelena Sokolova, 
who won two Grand Prix events last fall and Daria Timochenko, the 
current junior world champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bereznaya and Sikhardulidze won nine competitions in a row since  
getting the silver medals at the Olympics in Nagano last February. 
</P>
<P>
	They won the short program easily and were heavily favored to  
retain their title. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of dominating the pairs and ice dance in the former  
Soviet Union, the individual skaters are now in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian men have won three of the last four titles in that event  
and the Russian women have won the last three European titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian men went 1-2-3 last year and are in a position to  
three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Urmanov, Yevgeny Plushenko and Alexei Yagudin are so  
close that Thursday's free skating will decide who takes the 
championship.

<HEADLINE> S. Carolina Wants To End Photo Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina has gone to court to block  
the use of 3.5 million driver's license photos it sold to a private 
company amid public outcry over the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to angry callers to radio shows and state departments,  
the governor also promised to make it easier for people to keep 
their photos from being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5,000 sale of license photos for use only in fraud  
prevention was authorized by the Legislature, but Attorney General 
Charlie Condon said the state's constitutional guarantee of privacy 
is more important. Condon filed suit to keep the photos from being 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data LLC, which is developing a fraud-prevention system,  
could get a partial refund, Condon said. A Circuit Court hearing 
was set for Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	At Image Data in Nashua, N.H., spokeswoman Lorna Christie said  
the action caught the company by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores using its system to prevent check and credit-card fraud  
can get a person's photo on a screen for eight seconds. It cannot 
be printed, modified or saved and is encrypted when it is sent to 
the store, and Image Data does not resell the photo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges said he ordered the Public Safety Department to  
create a form making it easy for drivers to put their pictures 
off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Carolina drivers will have the right to decide not to  
have their license photo sold to the highest bidder,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Condemns Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Winding up his six-day journey to the Americas,  
Pope John Paul II condemned capital punishment Wednesday in some of 
the strongest terms yet and told the United States that with power 
comes moral responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radical changes in world politics leave America with a  
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a 
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he said at a 
prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica before leaving for Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Power is ``service, not privilege. Its exercise is morally  
justifiable when it is used for the good of all, when it is 
sensitive to the needs of the poor and defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tired-looking pope walked hand-in-hand with Vice President Al  
Gore on the tarmac at Lambert Airport before the pontiff boarded 
his plane for the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, he urged 100,000 worshippers at a Mass in  
this death-penalty state to spare even those who have ``done great 
evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform,'' he said at 
the Trans World Dome, addressing the biggest crowd of his 30-hour 
visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a  
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and 
unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message may have had particular relevance in Missouri, where  
the state Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an 
execution that was to have taken place while the pope was in town. 
Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the delay ``a 
mockery.'' On Jan. 13, a killer was executed by injection in 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, making his fifth trip to the U.S. mainland, also  
called on his flock to end racism. Racism is ``a plague which your 
bishops have called one of the most persistent and destructive 
evils of the nation,'' the stooped, 78-year-old pontiff said, his 
voice hoarse and his words slurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, he met briefly with 85-year-old civil rights  
pioneer Rosa Parks, the black seamstress whose refusal to give up 
her seat on a segregated bus in 1955 led to the Montgomery, Ala., 
bus boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	During the evening prayer service, the pope welcomed Muslims and  
Jews who joined him in the Romanesque cathedral that houses the 
world's largest collection of mosaics. For the first time, a rabbi, 
Robert P. Jacobs, participated in a Roman Catholic papal prayer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this prayer signify our shared commitment to ever greater  
understanding and cooperation,'' the pope told the crowd of 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Trans World Dome, the faithful came for blessings, cures  
or just a glimpse of the man credited with hastening the fall of 
Communism and lessening religious restrictions in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people filled the seats of the football  
stadium and an adjacent convention center, where the pope's image 
was projected on giant TV screens with running captions of his 
homily. One thousand priests celebrated the Mass with the pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Ida Costa, a cancer-stricken 77-year-old woman from Little Rock,  
Ark., looked for a miracle cure from the pope: ``I'll get the 
blessings God wants to shower upon me in his presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Mary DeLonais of Springfield, Ill., was a forest ranger  
when she saw the pope in Denver in 1993. ``Part of the pope's final 
blessing was a prayer for vocations,'' she recalled. She has since 
become a nun. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's condemnation of the death penalty brought mixed  
reactions from those at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I guess we've all got a right to live, but I  
don't know, especially when they take someone else's life,'' said 
William Walker of Alton, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic, it's easy to be against abortion,'' said  
Douglas Marshall of St. Louis. But as for sparing the life of an 
evil person, ``that's the thing. It all boils down to a matter of 
forgiveness. Are you willing to forgive an evil person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope arrived in St. Louis on Tuesday after five triumphant  
days in Mexico. He met with President Clinton and attended a youth 
rally where he got rock-star treatment from the crowd of 20,000. 
His message: that Americans should use their freedoms responsibly 
and strive for a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting for the pope to go back and start his  
pilgrimage in Mexico, to close the gap between Mexico and the 
United States,'' Rosalia Vazquez, 21, said in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Alleged NY Killer May Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A former school hall monitor has offered to  
plead guilty to killing eight women, hoping to take advantage of a 
recent ruling by the state's highest court that could spare him 
from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor William Grady said he will still push for the death  
penalty despite the plea offer, and it was unclear whether the 
court would accept Kendall Francois' plea. A decision is expected 
as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other case that is as worthy of consideration for  
the death penalty as this case,'' Grady said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois, 28, is charged with strangling eight women over a  
22-month spree and stashing their corpses in the Poughkeepsie home 
he shared with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea offer was included in court documents unsealed  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was filed after a ruling in December by the state Court of  
Appeals that struck down portions of New York's capital punishment 
law that dealt with prosecutors threatening to use the death 
penalty in order to coerce a guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the ruling seemed to offer a loophole for Francois  
to avoid capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	In it, Chief Judge Judith Kaye said defendants can plead guilty  
and receive a life-without-parole sentence -- as long as they do so 
before prosecutors file a notice of intent to seek the death 
penalty against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the ruling, Francois' lawyer Randolph Treece said  
he appeared in a closed courtroom and told state Supreme Court 
Justice Thomas Dolan his client was ready to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day -- Christmas Eve -- Grady announced his intention to  
seek the death penalty against Francois. Grady said he had not 
planned on announcing his intent until after the holidays but sped 
it up to avoid being barred from seeking the death penalty by the 
Court of Appeals ruling.

<HEADLINE> Limit to Gov't-Education Role Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A current governor and a former governor urged  
Congress on Wednesday to limit the federal government's role in 
education, saying the Education Department should not become a 
federal school board. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and former Ohio Gov. George V.  
Voinovich, both Republicans, said states and local school districts 
should be given flexibility to innovate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unleash the creativity of states, hold us accountable and give  
us the opportunity to partner with you,'' Ridge told the House 
Committee on Education and the Workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is set to consider legislation this year to renew  
federal programs for grades K through 12. Wednesday's House hearing 
was the first of several scheduled to prepare for that task. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his State of the Union address this month,  
said he would seek $200 million to help states fix their schools 
and $600 million to triple funding for after-school and summer 
catch-up programs for failing students. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials also are working on proposals to tie  
the $15 billion that states get from the federal education budget 
to Clinton's accountability goals, which include requirements that 
schools stop promoting students who are failing and that states fix 
or shut down low-performing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Voinovich said governors are ``concerned about the consequences  
for states and communities that fail to adopt the new federally 
mandated policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On school construction, Voinovich said Clinton's proposal would  
reward states that have not taken action to keep up with 
infrastructure. In states like Ohio, which committed more than $1.5 
billion to repair or rebuild schools, taxpayers essentially would 
be asked to pay for construction twice, Voinovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge and Voinovich both called for expanding to all 50 states a  
pilot program that now gives a dozen states, including Ohio, 
additional flexibility in spending their federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge, who served in the House for 12 years, said states should  
be considered partners in any effort to overhaul education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education policies and initiatives historically have been the  
domain of the states and their local school districts, not the 
federal government,'' Ridge said. ``That's not to say we are not 
grateful of the dollars we receive and that objectives and goals of 
those dollars are not objectives and goals that we share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Washington could properly establish a framework of  
standards, as long as states still can tailor policies to meet 
unique needs and get a range of options from which to choose. 
Existing federal mandates are too restrictive, Ridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., the education committee chairman,  
also spoke of a desire to keep policy decisions at the state and 
local levels, noting that more than 92 percent of all education 
spending come from those sources.

<HEADLINE> Norfolk Southern 4Q Earnings Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. said Wednesday that  
earnings fell 29 percent in the fourth quarter as the railroad 
continued to prepare to take over part of Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern earned $160 million, or 42 cents per share,  
down from $224 million, or 59 cents per share, in the fourth 
quarter of 1997. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. were 
anticipating 42 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Norfolk Southern fell 18 3/4 cents to close at $27.37 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special charges related to the Conrail acquisition,  
fourth-quarter net income would have been $194 million, or 51 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern had railway operating revenues of $1.03  
billion, down 3 percent from $1.06 billion in last year's fourth 
quarter. Coal revenues declined 10 percent in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Railway operating expenses were $778 million for the quarter, up  
4 percent from $748 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Norfolk Southern's earnings rose 2 percent, from  
$721 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in 1997 to $734 million, 
or $1.93 per diluted share, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results included an after-tax gain of $105 million, or  
28 cents per share, from the sale of Norfolk Southern's North 
American Van Lines Inc. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Conrail, 1998 net income would have been a record $890  
million, or $2.34 per diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, railway operating revenues were $4.2 billion,  
essentially unchanged from 1997. Railway operating expenses were 
$3.17 billion for the year, up 5 percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern is taking over 58 percent of Conrail and  
Richmond-based CSX Corp. will control the rest. The railroads 
announced last week that they will begin operating their respective 
portions of Conrail on June 1.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Hurts Philip Morris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos.'s profit skidded 79 percent  
in the fourth quarter of 1998 as the world's biggest tobacco 
company absorbed a big charge for settling lawsuits with states 
that demanded reimbursement for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the legal expenses, underlying earnings rose 9  
percent, matching Wall Street's expectations. The gains came as 
Philip Morris increased its share of the U.S. cigarette market and 
despite unprecedented hikes in cigarette prices to pay for the 
settlement with the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The company behind Marlboro cigarettes, Kraft foods and Miller  
beer earned $274 million, or 11 cents a share, in the three months 
ended Dec. 31, down from $1.3 billion, or 53 cents a share a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $18.4 billion from  
$17.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company's Kraft Foods division announced plans  
Wednesday to cut 600 jobs through voluntary separation offers. The 
plan will result in a charge of $150 million against Philip Morris 
earnings this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft, based in the Chicago suburb of Northfield, has 37,900  
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results included a charge of $2.4 billion before  
taxes mainly for settling suits in November with 46 states over 
claims for Medicaid spending on sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Philip Morris and three other top tobacco makers  
will be paying $206 billion to the states over 25 years under that 
settlement. They had previously settled with four states for about 
$40 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 results also included a $1.3 billion tobacco settlement  
charge that was offset by a $774 million gain on the sale of an ice 
cream business. 
</P>
<P>
	If onetime items are excluded from the comparison, Philip Morris  
said its underlying earnings rose 9 percent to $1.8 billion, or 72 
cents a share. That matched the average estimate by analysts 
surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company's stock fell 3.8 percent and closed down $1.81 1/4  
at $46.43 3/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic tobacco profits rose 15 percent in the quarter to $1.4  
billion even though its cigarette shipments to distributors fell 
6.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher profits reflected higher prices. Philip Morris  
boosted cigarette prices by about 45 cents a pack after the tobacco 
settlement on top of increases of about 20 cents a pack earlier in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Philip Morris was able to extend its lead in the cigarette  
market anyway. It said independent retail sales data showed it 
accounted for a record 52.6 percent of U.S. cigarette sales last 
year, up 1.6 share points from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlboro's shares was also a record 37.6 percent of the U.S.  
market, up 2.3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty good set of results,'' said tobacco analyst  
Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney. He said the domestic profit 
gains came despite unprecedented price increases and a tough U.S. 
competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
	International tobacco profits rose 5.3 percent in the quarter  
and food profits were up 3 percent in North American and 2 percent 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adelman, who follows tobacco for Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter, said while the overall results were in line with 
expectations, some investors may be disappointed that the 
international tobacco and domestic food results weren't stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	He said international tobacco performance was hurt by weakness  
in Russia, central Europe and Asia outside Japan, while Kraft had 
to absorb sharply higher cheese costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't that the quality of earnings is at issue,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Philip Morris earned $5.37 billion, or $2.20 a  
share, down 14.9 percent from $6.31 billion, or $2.58 a share, in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 3.2 percent to $74.39 billion from $72.06 billion  
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Schulz Knocked Off Tyson List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Axel Schulz was at ringside when Mike Tyson  
knocked out Francois Botha. That's apparently as close to Tyson in 
action as the German heavyweight is going to get. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tyson dispatched Botha with a single right to the head Jan.  
16 in the MGM Grand at Las Vegas, Botha thought he was going to be 
next to take on the former undisputed heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday, Wilfred Sauerland, Schulz's manager, said in  
Frankfurt, Germany, that Showtime, the cable network with a 
multiple-fight deal with Tyson, was not interested in a a 
Tyson-Schulz match April 24 at the MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of all dreams,'' said Sauerland, noting a fight  
contract had been drawn up and had been ready to sign. ``The 
subject is closed. Axel is very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying he's in or out,'' said Jay Larkin, who runs  
boxing for Showtime and SET, it's pay-per-view arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, however, also said, ``It would be very difficult for us  
to sell Mike Tyson against a guy who lost to the guy he just beat. 
And Schulz in not exactly a household word in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, knocked out in the fifth round by Tyson on Jan. 16,  
outpointed Schulz for the vacant IBF title Dec. 9, 1995, at 
Stuttgart, Germany. Schulz had not fought in the United States 
since he lost a decision to George Foreman April 22, 1995, in a 
bout preceding his loss to Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said others being considered for the next fight in  
Tyson's latest comeback included former IBF champion Michael 
Moorer; Lou Savarese, who knocked out former champion James 
``Buster'' Douglas in the first round and who lost a decision to 
Foreman; Shannon Briggs, who beat Foreman on a controversial 
decision; Herbie Hide, WBO champion from Britain, and Brian Nielsen 
of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said Donovan ``Razor'' Ruddock, who has lost twice to  
Tyson, was not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauerland said Showtime was concerned about lower than expected  
income from Tyson's pay-per-view fight against Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, however, said, ``From Showtime's standpoint, it did  
fine. There were about 750,000 buys on cable and satellite 
(averaging $45), making it the most successful pay-per-view event 
in the last 20 months. But Tyson is only measured by his own past 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Botha bout was Tyson's first since he bit Evander  
Holyfield's ears and was disqualified June 28, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Jury Convicts Alleged Crime Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal jury has convicted the alleged boss of  
the Colombo crime family of tampering with a jury in an attempt to 
help his son evade imprisonment for racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Russo, 64, was convicted Tuesday of obstructing justice  
by trying to contact a juror and of concealing a witness from the 
FBI. He faces up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A codefendant, Dennis Hickey, 57, was convicted on the witness  
concealing charge. He was not charged with obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Fiorenza, Russo's former mistress, testified against the  
defendant in hopes of helping her husband, Colombo mobster Lawrence 
Fiorenza, gain early release from prison, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorenza, her formerly blond hair dyed dark to help conceal her  
identity as a protected witness, testified how she began an affair 
with Russo after they met at a 1994 Christmas party. She said she 
later used her status as a lawyer to make jail house visits to 
Russo's son, Joseph ``Jojo'' Russo, carrying coded messages from 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers said Fiorenza knew Russo and Hickey were hiding  
Joseph Russo's mistress, Teresa Castronova, whom the FBI wanted to 
question about the jury tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court papers, agents believe Castronova had  
recognized an alternate member of the anonymous jury in Joseph 
Russo's 1994 trail, and tipped off the elder Russo, who allegedly 
tried to contact the woman. The younger Russo was convicted on the 
racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say Russo, who describes himself as a  
gardener, is the de-facto head of the Colombo crime family.

<HEADLINE> Largest of Ga. Olympic Suits Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge rejected the largest of the liability  
suits filed by victims of the 1996 bombing in Centennial Olympic 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	State Court Senior Judge Charles L. Carnes ruled that all  
remaining defendants in the suit are protected from liability under 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by 37 people injured when a pipe bomb  
exploded at the park July 27, 1996, and by six of their spouses. 
Defendants were the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, AT&AMP;T 
and two companies that handled park security. The bomb exploded 
near an AT&AMP;T tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnes ruled last fall that ACOG was protected from liability by  
the Georgia Recreational Property Act of 1965, which protects 
property owners who make their property available for public 
recreational use free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hearing last week, Carnes ruled that the same protection  
extends to AT&AMP;T and the security companies, Anthony Davis Inc. and 
Borg-Warner Protective Services Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	James Sadd, who represents the plaintiffs, said he will appeal.  
His clients were seeking more than $100 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Robert Rudolph has been charged with the Olympic Park  
bombing, as well as with two 1997 Atlanta bombings and one last 
year at a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic. He remains a fugitive.

<HEADLINE> Major League Baseball Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dipping into the low-priced players still on the  
free-agent market, the Milwaukee Brewers picked up Jim Abbott and 
the St. Louis Cardinals signed Carlos Baerga. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott agreed Wednesday to a $600,000, one-year contract and  
will take his comeback to the National League, where the one-handed 
pitcher will have to bat for the first time since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, whose career slumped the last three years, agreed to a  
$1.25 million, one-year deal with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, left-hander Mike Magnante agreed to a one-year contract  
with the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Among players in arbitration, left-hander Sterling Hitchcock and  
the San Diego Padres agreed to a $15.5 million, three-year 
contract, and left-hander Omar Daal and the Arizona Diamondbacks 
settled on a $6.75 million, two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, a 31-year-old left-hander, was 5-0 with a 4.55 ERA for  
the Chicago White Sox last year in five late-season starts after a 
successful stint in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about it,'' Abbott said. ``I'm looking  
forward to swinging the bat. I hope I can hold my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott was 2-18 with the Angels in 1996, then retired after a  
poor spring training the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The novelty of my playing I think has long since passed, and  
I'm as accountable as the next guy down the line. I have to go out 
there and do well,'' Abbott said. ``And if I can go out there and 
give my team a chance to win, pick up the innings, that's how you 
gain respect, not by my switching the glove and all that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott gets a $400,000 base salary and the chance to earn  
$200,000 in performance bonuses. The pitcher and the team have a 
$1.5 million mutual option for 2000 with a $200,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, coming off a $21.4 million, six-year contract, gets a $1  
million salary, which will be increased to $1.25 million if he's on 
the opening day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, a switch hitter, was a three-time All-Star with  
Cleveland, but his production has dropped off sharply since he was 
traded to the New York Mets in 1996. He hit .266 last year with 
seven homers and 53 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlos is an experienced, quality infielder who gives us good  
offensive potential at second base and versatility from both sides 
of the plate,'' Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis considered signing Pat Meares, let go last month by  
Minnesota, and moving him from shortstop to second base. Meares was 
seeking about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Magnante, 33, pitched for the Houston Astros last season, going  
4-7 with a 4.88 ERA and two saves in 48 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock gets a $3 million signing bonus, $2.5 million this  
year and $5 million in each of the next two seasons. He was 9-7 
with a 3.93 ERA during the regular season and 3-0 with a 1.23 ERA 
in four postseason starts with 32 strikeouts in 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a desire to play closer to home than all the  
way across the country, but I'm very comfortable in San Diego,'' 
said Hitchcock, who lives in Florida and was eligible for free 
agency after the 1999 season. ``Certainly, I think it showed what 
kind of baseball town it is with I don't know how many nights of 
60,000-plus attendance. It's a hard place to turn down to play when 
the club shows it's serious about keeping you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daal gets a $250,000 signing bonus, $2.5 million this season and  
$3.5 million in 2000. Arizona has a $5.5 million option for 2001 
with a $500,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan left-hander, who turns 27 on March 1, was 8-12  
last season with a 2.88 ERA, the fifth best in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Omar is one of the players from the expansion draft who really  
made the most of the opportunity that expansion afforded him,'' 
Diamondbacks general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``Given the 
chance to start on a regular basis, he showed he was capable of 
holding his own against the better pitchers in the league.''

<HEADLINE> Riot-Torn Neighborhoods Reeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The chaos of the week before the 1989 Super Bowl is  
still vivid to Prentice Rasheed and Betty May: sirens, police cars, 
thick smoke. Standing guard inside their stores to keep looters 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, they have different opinions on whether things  
have changed for the better in the predominantly black 
neighborhoods of Liberty City and Overtown, where riots left nearly 
$1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	May, who has owned Ibo's Market in Overtown since 1980, looks  
forward to expanding her store with help from a federal grant. 
Rasheed laments that the communities still aren't seeing enough 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasheed's African clothing-and-general goods store has been a  
fixture for 14 years in Liberty City, which some community leaders 
describe as a ``gun, drug and gang-battered neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Large numbers of ``black people in this country ... are just  
barely making it,'' said Rasheed, who blames community leaders for 
not doing enough. ``No kind of sensible human being puts a Band-Aid 
around (a) sore and leaves the sore open. This is what our leaders 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that black communities won't see economic benefits from  
the tourism dollars that being host to this year's Super Bowl will 
bring because game and city officials have not worked with 
businesses and residents in those areas, or informed tourists about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasheed gained a measure of fame in 1986 -- the year his store  
was robbed 13 times -- when he set a booby trap that electrocuted a 
burglar. A grand jury refused to indict him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounds of community initiatives were announced in January 1989,  
days after the fatal shooting of a black man by a Hispanic police 
officer in Overtown sparked riots that spread to Liberty City. 
Stores were set afire and looted, and hundreds were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiatives echoed promises made in 1980 following three  
days of rioting in Liberty City that left 18 dead. Those riots were 
touched off by the acquittal of four white officers charged with 
the fatal beating of a black motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of it has been disappointment because we haven't  
been able to get anything long-term off the ground,'' said state 
Sen. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	But there has been some progress.  
</P>
<P>
	The Metro Miami Action Plan, a quasi-government nonprofit  
organization started in 1980, has been providing loans, technical 
assistance and affordable housing in Liberty City and Overtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Miami-Dade County was designated a federal  
empowerment zone, meaning it will receive as much as $130 million 
in tax incentives and millions of dollars more in job grants. 
Communities targeted under the program include Overtown, Liberty 
City, Little Havana, Homestead and Florida City. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is will those communities benefit from our latest  
victories,'' said Meek, who characterized the major problems in 
Liberty City as drugs and joblessness. ``The community ... should 
pay very close attention. If we don't, we will find ourselves 
anemic like we have been as it relates to not receiving the dollars 
that we deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than $1 million in money earmarked for Overtown was  
siphoned to other downtown projects, and this year $200,000 
generated by Overtown parking lots was diverted to the city's 
operating budget instead of the community, the Sun-Sentinel of Fort 
Lauderdale recently reported. City officials also are trying to 
account for as much as $77 million spent on housing and other 
projects in Overtown since the mid-1980s, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ibo's Market, where patrons buy their hot dogs or 25-cent bag  
of potato chips from the owner they respectfully address as Miss 
Jean or Miss Betty, there was hope that the economic windfall will 
help provide funds for her to expand the convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see everyone trying to be more independent, more people  
working,'' May said. 
</P>
<P>
	The '89 riots made some people think about their future, she  
said. ``I can't say everyone because I still see things I wish I 
didn't see.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Criticizes Iraq After Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today  
defended the right of U.S. and British pilots to protect themselves 
while patrolling the ``no-fly'' zones over Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been 70 violations of the no-fly zones by the Iraqi  
regime and 20 hits or attempts to hit our pilots,'' Albright said. 
She made the remarks at a news conference here following talks with 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key U.S. ally in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``We regret the stray missile in Basra that killed  
some civilians, but we believe that it is essential for the no-fly 
zones to be protected and for our pilots to be able to defend 
themselves when they are attacked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Using force is not our preferred mechanism,'' Albright said of  
the current conflict with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime 
over northern and southern no-fly zones set up after the 1991 Gulf 
War to protect Iraqi dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon acknowledged Tuesday that a U.S. missile missed its  
target Monday during strikes near the southern Iraqi city of Basra. 
Iraqi officials said that errant U.S. missiles killed at least 11 
people and injured 59 in and around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stressed that the United States intends to ``contain  
his (Saddam's) potential aggression'' but also work to improve the 
condition of Iraqi civilians by expanding the U.N.-approved 
oil-for-food program. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the use of force against Iraq, Egyptian Foreign  
Minister Amr Moussa said ``Egypt's position is within the framework 
of the Arab League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	League foreign ministers last weekend called for a dialogue with  
Iraq, instead of force, and also urged Saddam's regime to abide by 
U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers refused Iraq's call for Arab League condemnation  
of U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq in mid-December, and Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf stormed out of the 
meeting in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The airstrikes Dec. 16 to Dec. 19 were intended to punish Iraq  
for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors who must 
certify whether the Baghdad regime has eliminated its weapons of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also spoke about Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's  
upcoming visit to Washington for a meeting with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are to meet Feb. 4 to discuss the stalled Wye River  
accord that Clinton helped broker between Israel and the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has halted troop withdrawals promised under the accord,  
accusing the Palestinians of failing to do enough to resolve the 
Jewish state's security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's very important for both parties to fulfill their  
obligations'' under the Wye River accord, Albright said, adding: 
``The Palestinians have been fulfilling some aspects of what they 
need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who arrived here from Moscow, was leaving later for  
Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> White House Lawyers Change Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's legal team is resigned  
that witnesses will be questioned in the Senate impeachment trial 
and is developing a strategy to counter the unwanted turn of events 
with a new round of political and legal attacks, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	First and foremost is a warning that the move to witnesses may  
significantly delay the trial because presidential lawyers will 
need extensive time to review previously unseen evidence and 
interview their own witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyer, David Kendall, and several Democratic  
senators picked up that theme at the trial Tuesday as the prospects 
improved that House prosecutors would get to summon the three 
witnesses they sought: former White House intern Monica Lewinsky; 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal; and presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, presidential advisers said there is a chance despite  
their publicly stated position that they won't demand any witnesses 
or evidence of their own until they see what information 
prosecutors elicit from the witnesses and whether those witnesses 
will ever be questioned in person at the Senate trial. Many of the 
lawyers are in a wait-and-see mode, advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is quite possible, and some are urging this, that if there  
are no new revelations in the depositions and no request to have 
live witnesses in the well of the Senate, that we won't need to 
call witnesses,'' said one outside adviser to the White House 
involved in the planning, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But presidential lawyers also are preparing for the all-out  
trial strategy if necessary. They realize that in an environment 
where senators can vote to limit their presentation -- some 
Republican senators are talking about giving the White House 
lawyers only three witnesses of their own -- they may need to 
identify witnesses who could make the best case possible for the 
president against the perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On that front, House prosecutors' efforts to introduce some  
surprise evidence at the trial Tuesday left White House lawyers 
considering an unexpected avenue to demand a group of witnesses 
they had figured would be off limits, advisers inside and outside 
the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	These advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is  
possible that if the trial drags on, Clinton's lawyers will try to 
summon lawyers for Paula Jones to explore whether they colluded 
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in January 1998 to bring the 
Lewinsky matter to light. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, presidential lawyers have argued that the Jones  
matter should be kept outside the trial because the House rejected 
an impeachment article that alleged Clinton had committed perjury 
in Mrs. Jones' civil case. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, House prosecutors surprised senators and the  
White House legal team by introducing as new evidence an affidavit 
submitted by one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, T. Wesley Holmes, to the 
House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, Clinton's team would have no right to question Mrs.  
Jones' lawyers because of her attorney-client privilege, although 
they have long wanted to explore what sort of contacts her lawyers 
had with Starr in the days before the scandal erupted a year ago. 
Legal advisers are exploring whether Holmes' submission of the 
affidavit amounted to a waiver of Mrs. Jones' privilege to 
confidential legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes' affidavit dealt with the Jones camp's decision to  
subpoena presidential secretary Betty Currie as a witness in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told senators on Tuesday that Holmes' decision to file  
an affidavit was ``exceedingly interesting'' and suggested he might 
want to explore the Jones-Starr question during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a very interesting witness to depose, let me tell  
you,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of Paula Jones' lawyers talking about offering a  
declaration about his litigation strategy, and I think that the 
opportunity to depose him would provide a great deal of information 
about what really motivated the events of January 1998,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we could show that there were a number of connections  
between the independent counsel, Linda Tripp, and the Paula Jones 
lawyers,'' Kendall said.

<HEADLINE> Papal Pageantry, Emotion in Mo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Roman Catholic faithful wept in the streets  
and lit candles at an airport sendoff Wednesday for Pope John Paul 
II as he left for home. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff smiled and waved goodbye to America's heartland  
before boarding the plane to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers, many of whom had wildly cheered the pontiff at a  
boisterous youth rally Tuesday night, were grim-faced, some 
sobbing, as his motorcade left downtown at the end of the 31-hour 
visit to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope was visibly fatigued after the six-day trip  
to Mexico City and St. Louis, slowly making his way up the steps to 
Shepherd One, his papal jet. 
</P>
<P>
	In farewell remarks, John Paul said he came to the Gateway City  
to keep a promise to pilgrims who had serenaded him on the steps of 
St. Peter's with ``Meet Me in St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With God's help, I have done it,'' he proclaimed at an airport  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who saw the pope off, said John Paul's  
visit had produced an ``outpouring of joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, 1,000 priests, 250 bishops and more than a dozen  
cardinals joined John Paul and more than 100,000 worshippers in 
celebrating Mass in a football stadium that just a few days earlier 
had housed an auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a Mass for the masses, a display of papal pageantry and  
Roman Catholic tradition unfolding on artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
	A 45-foot-high brushed-aluminum replica of the soaring Gateway  
Arch that graces the city skyline towered above the white oak altar 
set up on the north goal post side of Trans World Dome, the home of 
football's St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul paid homage to the proud history of Catholicism in St.  
Louis, which was founded by French Catholics in 1764. Cameras 
flashed as he blessed the altar wine in the same gold chalice used 
by the missionary John St. Cosme in 1698 to celebrate the first 
known Mass in what is now St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball legend Stan Musial knelt devoutly in a box seat during  
Mass. Musial, who is of Polish descent, has known the pope for 
years and has visited him several times in Krakow and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff served Communion to cardinals and bishops while  
about 900 priests and deacons spread throughout the dome. Ushers 
holding yellow and white umbrellas were strategically placed to 
draw people to the nearest Communion station and lead them back to 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite glorious winter sunshine and unseasonably warm weather  
reaching the high 50s, the crowds lining the sidewalk to see John 
Paul failed to reach the expected 1 million mark. Still, they were 
the area's biggest crowds since 1927, when Charles Lindbergh 
returned from his solo flight to Paris aboard the Spirit of St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the pope was joined by religious leaders from other  
faiths and about 2,000 people at the Cathedral Basilica, where he 
spoke of America's responsibility to use its power for good.

<HEADLINE> For Some, Senate Votes Mean No End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For many Americans, the Senate's two votes Wednesday added up to  
one exasperating reality: The impeachment saga isn't over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody already knows what's already been said. I feel  
they're just wasting taxpayer dollars,'' said Tracie Dawson, 26, an 
assistant video store manager in Oakland, Md. ``I think they should 
just drop the whole thing and I'm a Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the votes -- not to dismiss the case against  
Clinton and to call three witnesses -- many people focused more on 
how an opportunity to end the 13-month-old ordeal had slipped away 
than on the intricate legalities of the two motions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disgusted. If I had my way, both the House and the Senate  
would be impeached,'' said Theresa Gilmore, 30, of Columbus, Ohio. 
``What else are they going to get?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some took comfort in the motions, saying the trial shouldn't be  
limited or cut short simply to satisfy a restless public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what I've taken away from this is that it's reinforced  
my faith in the American political system,'' said Helena Wolin, a 
19-year-old sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania in 
Philadelphia. ``It shows that the government is strong enough to 
check a president who has abused his powers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 56-44 along nearly unanimous party lines  
Wednesday to summon Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses. The 
same senators voted not to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., voted with Republicans on both  
measures. Some people in his home state were impressed by his 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obviously made his decision so he could get more  
information before he can vote on impeachment,'' said Dennis Dums, 
a member of a private utility watchdog group from Madison, Wis. 
``I've trusted his past decisions and I trust this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others were angry that he had broken ranks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised why he voted against his own party,'' said  
Raymond Kowalski, 60, of Mosinee, Wis. ``I don't understand what he 
is going to gain by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some focused on the question that prompted Democratic Sen.  
Robert Byrd of West Virginia to submit the failed motion to dismiss 
the charges: What's the point of continuing when it's already clear 
Republicans don't have the two-thirds majority needed to convict 
Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to have enough votes in the end, and they  
already know that, so it is kind of a waste of taxpayer time and 
money,'' said Jeff Sharratt, 31, as he shopped at a book store in 
his hometown of Minneapolis. ``People are tired of the whole 
impeachment trial and I think it should be done away with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Robert Bell, 60, a British knight who has lived in the  
United States for 20 years, said it's the Democrats who ``are 
making a fool of themselves.'' He said he was pleased the charges 
weren't dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least the Republicans are putting the Constitution to the  
test,'' said Bell, who lives in Greensboro, N.C. ``It's not a 
matter of whether he's booted out of office or not, it's a matter 
of how the judicial system works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll shows that 53 percent of Americans oppose having the  
Senate call witnesses. Sixty-three percent said the president 
should not be removed from office and 67 percent said they don't 
expect the Senate to oust him. The Pew Research Center for People 
and the Press poll, which was released Tuesday, questioned 1,500 
adults by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe into Clinton ``should have been stopped a couple of  
million dollars ago,'' said Dina Owens, an investment banker ``in 
her 40s'' from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He smoked weed, we voted him in. He dodged the draft, we voted  
him in. His moral character was in question a long time ago,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holly Stephens, a 19-year-old sophomore at East Tennessee State  
in Johnson City, said she wasn't following the votes and changes 
the channel on her television or radio when the topic comes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Athens Organizer Discusses Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Making Greece the permanent home of the  
Olympics is not the answer to the corruption scandal now engulfing 
the IOC, the top organizer of the 2004 Athens Games said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Greek newspapers have sought to fan public support to have  
the games rooted in their ancient birthplace, an idea first raised 
by the late Greek President Constantine Caramanlis. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has taken on new life amid accusations of bribery  
surrounding the long and costly bidding process for Olympic sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity that should not be lost,'' said an  
editorial in the newspaper Ta Nea. 
</P>
<P>
	But Constantine Bakouris, managing director of the 2004 Games,  
said it would be ``very difficult to deprive the other countries of 
organizing'' the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's nice and romantic to say that we'd like to have  
it,'' Bakouris told The Associated Press. ``I personally believe it 
isn't the answer to come to Greece only because other people had 
allegedly done some scandals. The idea is to improve the whole 
process and make it more transparent and give everyone a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakouris speculated other cities and regions could resent a  
permanent Olympic home in Greece because of the ``high stakes'' for 
revenue and global exposure associated with the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandals have so far spared Athens, where the modern  
Olympics were revived in 1896. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in the wake of the scandal, Rome's mayor wants a new  
vote on the 2004 Summer Olympics. Athens beat Rome 66-41 in the 
1997 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to remove every shadow of doubt  
about the decision,'' Mayor Francesco Rutelli says. ``That would be 
a move to make clear what now is not clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Greece's Olympic committee, Lambis Nikolaou,  
dared IOC inspectors to find any improprieties with Athens' 2004 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games were given cleanly. The doors are open, the dogs are  
tied up and they can come and examine whatever they want,'' he said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a full disclosure on bid spending has not yet been made  
public, and sports officials have not commented on the timetable 
for the release of the records. Athens was awarded the games 16 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Athens 2004 bid official, Constantinos Sofoulis, has  
alleged mismanagement and a lack of proper bookkeeping by the bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sofoulis, in an 18-page report in late 1997, told the AP that he  
found no indications of bid committee irregularities in dealings 
with the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor ordered Greece's special financial police to begin  
an investigation of the bid committee after Sofoulis' report, said 
Finance Ministry sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said that no signs of criminal mismanagement have  
been found, but the ``case is still open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sofoulis, an economics professor and former Socialist lawmaker,  
says the bid committee failed to keep proper accounts and did not 
keep full track of contractors and providers of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek officials, meanwhile, rallied to present Athens as free of  
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are devious days for the international Olympic family,''  
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos said. ``This gives us the 
opportunity to promote our main goal ... the elevation of the 
Olympic ideal.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Accuses Feds of Tinkering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's next witness at its antitrust  
trial told the judge in written testimony that government efforts 
to modify its popular Windows software slowed some functions 
sevenfold and prevented other programs from running at all. 
</P>
<P>
	James Allchin, a senior vice president expected to take the  
stand Monday, derided government efforts as a ``Rube Goldberg 
mechanism'' that made Windows ``effectively useless in a commercial 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft released Allchin's 139 pages of written testimony  
Wednesday, even as the government ended its initial questioning of 
Paul Maritz, the senior executive responsible for Microsoft's most 
important consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sought to show that, over Microsoft's protests,  
Internet browser software was illegally built into newer versions 
of the Windows operating system and can be safely removed. 
</P>
<P>
	A software expert, Edward Felten of Princeton University, who  
wrote a removal program, testified previously that his procedure 
``does not prevent Windows 98 from (starting) properly, nor does it 
affect the stability of Windows 98 under ordinary use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Allchin said Felten's methods ``seriously degrade'' Windows,  
making parts of it run seven times slower and preventing consumers 
from using popular software by IBM Corp., America Online Inc. and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies, in a second day of  
aggressive cross-examination, pressed Maritz about Microsoft's 
efforts in 1995 to discourage Intel Corp. from developing new 
technology, called Native Signal Processing, that could compete 
with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has used the episode to support its charge that  
Microsoft illegally used its influence in the high-tech industry to 
stifle potential competition against its lucrative Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to give Intel reason to feel they needed to go  
and develop system software,'' Maritz said, adding that Microsoft 
believed the new technology ``was not in Intel's own interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz later conceded, ``We did think it was a bad thing for  
Microsoft. ... I hope we got our point across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, a senior computer scientist for the company, rejected  
in his written testimony claims that Microsoft included its browser 
software within Windows to try to ``crush'' Netscape Communications 
Corp., whose own browser earned tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin accused the government of trying ``to cast such  
integration in a bad light, suggesting that it occurs only for 
improper purposes, namely, to force customers to take things they 
do not want. That is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand, Maritz called it ``inevitable we would integrate  
it into the Windows environment.'' But he also acknowledged that 
Nescape's success proved ``an added incentive to make as fast as 
progress as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin warned it would be a ``recipe for disaster'' for courts  
to impose limits on what could be added to Windows, adding that 
``this beneficial process is under attack in this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked  
Maritz how far Microsoft might go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you think of any application that could not be integrated  
into Windows?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't boundaries, your Honor,'' Maritz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to question Maritz further Thursday, and  
the judge said he will decide whether the company must turn over a 
controversial e-mail that could undermine one of its defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail from Microsoft software engineer David D'Souza  
analyzed Felten's efforts to strip the company's browser software 
from Windows, which Microsoft contends is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents said the message could be used to identify which  
parts of some shared software code relate to Windows and which 
parts relate to the Internet browser.

<HEADLINE> Investors Wonder About '99 Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- As we head toward a new millennium, U.S. investors  
find themselves finishing the century on an uneasy note. Following 
four straight excellent years, 1999 looks a little less clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy remains strong, but markets around the rest of the  
world, from Asia to Russia to Latin America, are shaky, and 
investors worry about what impact the decline will have on the U.S. 
markets. Investors nearing retirement or already retired, who have 
less time to overcome declines, are especially concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where the market is going to go in 1999 is anybody's guess,''  
says Hal Lenhart, an academic associate at the College for 
Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one characteristic about the market that investors can be  
pretty sure about is that it is going to be very volatile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason the market is likely to be volatile in 1999,  
according to Lenhart, is due to a word many of today's investors 
have never heard before -- deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time that word was commonly spoken in this country was  
during the Great Depression. Lenhart does not see a Great 
Depression in 1999, or in the next decade for that matter. But he 
does see declining prices, or certainly an extremely low inflation 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deflation reflects a lack of liquidity in the market,''  
Lenhart says. ``People are holding on to their money. They're not 
doing much with it from a consumer standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve tried to flush liquidity into the economy by  
lowering interest rates last fall, and that has helped, Lenhart 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, investment experts remain concerned that there is  
still not sufficient liquidity. Financial institutions tend to 
clamp down on lending in a deflationary market, so it's harder for 
businesses to borrow to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, businesses have a more difficult time passing along  
costs in a deflationary environment, such as the higher labor costs 
they're incurring due to the tight labor market. Consequently, 
deflation affects corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing extreme volatility because the market doesn't  
know where to go,'' Lenhart says. ``Any minor blip in earnings 
forecast sends market prices plummeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this puts retirees and those nearing retirement in a  
tight spot. With minuscule inflation and interest rates, bond 
yields and stock dividends -- two sources of relatively steady 
income for retirees -- are at or near record lows. That will force 
retirees to look at selling some of their investments for cash, but 
that may not be as bad as it sounds, Lenhart says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to back up and look at what your investments have  
done over the past several years,'' Lenhart says. ``Don't look back 
just to recent highs and feel disappointed about how poorly the 
market has done since then. Look at the value your investments have 
accumulated over the last ten years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in their late 50s or early 60s may not need to be too  
concerned about selling stocks at this point since they've got 10 
to 15 years before they may need to start seriously drawing on 
their retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But retirees who will need funds in the next five to 10 years  
may need to liquidate some of their stock holdings and invest the 
money in Treasury securities, shorter-term bonds and other forms of 
low-risk cash-oriented investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologically, that can be tough, Lenhart admits. ``Investors  
don't like to sell their seed corn, their principal. Yet if their 
investment planning was good, they accumulated this principal with 
the idea that it would provide them income to live on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This doesn't mean even investors well into retirement should  
bail out of stocks entirely, Lenhart cautions. You need to weigh 
your future income needs and what other sources of retirement 
income you have. But any money you need within the next five years 
should not be tied up in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenhart fears that people who have accumulated substantial  
wealth in the market the last few years may be reluctant to cash in 
some of their winnings. For one thing, they will have to face 
capital gains taxes on the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they shouldn't get greedy,'' he says. He doubts the market  
is going to repeat the 20 percent or better returns it has averaged 
over the past four years. In a deflationary environment, returns 
will likely be much lower. 
</P>
<P>
	He also warns against trying to time the market. Much of the  
market activity today is due not to traditional institutional 
activity, which tended to keep the market on a more even keel, but 
to retail day traders who flit in and out of the market.

<HEADLINE> Blue Cross Whistle-Blower Gets $29M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A woman and her lawyer have been paid $29.1  
million as a reward for blowing the whistle on health-care fraud at 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty overwhelming,'' said Evelyn Knoob of Carterville.  
``I'm relieved that it's finally settled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois agreed last summer to pay  
$144 million to settle allegations that managers at its Marion 
office lied to auditors, destroyed documents and mishandled claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Knoob, who worked for the company's Marion office, and  
attorney Ronald Osman of Marion, got more than the minimum 
whistle-blower payment, which would have been 15 percent of the 
civil penalty, or $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They have now received four government checks totaling  
$29,108,999. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Osman, who got a contingency fee, nor Knoob would say  
how they split the reward. But Mrs. Knoob, 54, gave much of the 
credit to her lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Ends Down 124.35 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended sharply lower Wednesday, as  
investors cashed in some recent profits in IBM and worried about 
the quality of corporate earnings and Brazil's fragile economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average broke a two-day winning streak,  
dropping 124.35 to close at 9,200.23. The blue-chip index climbed 
as much as 61 points in the first 30 minutes of trading but 
stumbled in mid-morning and never regained its footing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led lower by IBM, which lost 7 5/16 to 178 5/16, as  
investors took profits following big gains Monday and Tuesday on 
the company's announcement that it would split its stock 
two-for-one. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks defied the weakness in IBM for most of the  
day, but caved in the final hour, pulling broad market indexes down 
with them. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.27 to 2,407.14. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite lost 9.14 to 1,243.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lost 2 15/16 to 168 5/8 in leading volume in Nasdaq  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks fell after troubled Brazil reported that  
investors were pulling U.S. dollars out of the country rapidly, and 
its currency, the real, fell to 1.90 to the dollar. That is 
significantly lower than the 1.21 to the dollar at which it traded 
before Brazil decided on Jan. 13 to give up trying to support the 
real by massive selling of dollars into foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that Brazil may default on its debt, or that its  
recession will spread throughout Latin America, have weighed 
heavily on the stocks of U.S. banks and multinational companies. 
Dow component Citigroup, which has made many loans in Latin 
America, fell 1 1/2 to 54. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, Brazil is going to run out of capital,'' said  
Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
``Brazil is very much a negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banking stocks also fell after First Union said a change in the  
way it would account for the sale of lower quality home equity 
loans would cut 1999 earnings by 8 to 12 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union shares, which dropped 4 7/8 to 52 3/16, were ``weighing  
heavily on most of the financial services companies,'' said Ronald 
J. Hill, investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A First Union spokeswoman said that even if other banks did make  
a similar change, they would not be as severely affected as First 
Union, which has the country's largest home-equity loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks fell after Mobil said its earnings were hurt by  
sharply lower oil prices in the fourth quarter. Mobil stock dropped 
7/8 to 87 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Disney stumbled 1 5/8 to 32 15/16 on disappointing  
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks continued to blaze higher, after online book  
vendor Amazon.com reported a narrower loss than analysts expected. 
Amazon's shares rose 10 17/32 to 125 5/8. Online auctioneer eBay added 
82 5/8 to 303 1/2 after a strong earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders and analysts worried that the upside leadership has  
narrowed to just technology stocks. Investors are buying ``the same 
old stuff, which is technology, technology, and technology,'' said 
Bob Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Rauscher Wessels in 
Minneapolis. ``Although that's a good leading group for the market, 
it's uncomfortable that it's the only game in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners led advancers on the Big Board by 11 to 6. About 1.08  
billion shares changed hands on New York Stock Exchange, up 
slightly from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market action, the NYSE composite index fell 3.37 to  
588.08, but the American Stock Exchange market value index added 
0.83 to 707.19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.21 to 421.12.  
</P>
<P>
	Most overseas stock markets rose, building on Wall Street's  
advances Tuesday and Monday. Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 0.47 
percent, Frankfurt's DAX index was up 1.49 percent, and the CAC in 
Paris added 0.66 percent. But the FT-SE 100 index in London eased 
0.16 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell sharply today on concerns  
about some less-than-stellar domestic earnings reports and Brazil's 
fragile economy. Broad market indexes gave up moderate gains in the 
final hour of trading to end significantly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading today, the Dow Jones industrial average  
was down 124.35 to 9,200.23. The Dow climbed as much as 61 points 
in the first 30 minutes of trading but stumbled in mid-morning and 
never regained its footing. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes started higher but gave ground to  
profit-taking in the final hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders and analysts repeatedly expressed concerns that the  
upside leadership becoming more narrowly confined to technology 
stocks. Investors are buying ``the same old stuff, which is 
technology, technology, and technology,'' said Bob Dickey, a 
technical analyst at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. 
``Although that's a good leading group for the market, it's 
uncomfortable that it's the only game in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was dragged lower by IBM, as investors sold the stock to  
book profits following big gains Monday and Tuesday on the 
company's announcement that it would split its stock two-for-one. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks fell sharply after Brazil's real opened sharply  
lower against the dollar and the country reported that dollars were 
leaving the country at a very rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks were also hurt by an announcement from First Union  
Corp., which said that a change in accounting for the sale of 
lower-quality home equity loans would reduce the bank's earnings by 
8 to 12 cents this year. First Union's shares were down sharply and 
joined by Dow components J.P. Morgan and Citigroup. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks fell after Mobil said its earnings were hurt by  
sharply lower oil prices in the fourth quarter. Mobil stock fell, 
as did Dow components Exxon, which is in the process of merging 
with Mobil, and Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Disney stumbled on disappointing earnings, and  
Philip Morris shares were taken lower after the cigarette maker's 
earnings only met analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks, however, were higher for the second day in a row,  
with Dow component Merck moving higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks continued to trade in a world of their own,  
surging again on the strength of Internet shares this morning but 
bowing to profit-taking sales in the afternoon. Amazon.com rose 
sharply after the online bookseller reported a narrower loss than 
analysts expected. Online auctioneer eBay rose after a strong 
earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial  
average fell 124.35 to 9,200.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.12 to 1,243.19, and the

<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the

<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 888.63 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Dad Planned Murder-Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A man accused of abusing his two sons  
apparently got his wife to be a willing participant in a 
murder-suicide scheme that left them and the two boys dead, police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Armando Nunez, 33; his wife, Valree Nunez, 28; and sons Curtis,  
7, and Robert, 4 -- were found Tuesday morning in an old Chevy with 
a hose running from the exhaust pipe into the car. They and the 
family dog were dead from apparent carbon monoxide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said there was no sign of trauma to Mrs. Nunez.  
The scene inside the car, parked behind their home, suggested the 
couple had enjoyed a final celebration together in the front seat 
as their children went to sleep for the last time in the back, 
officials said. Police found freshly used hamburger wrappers, a 
bottle of Wild Turkey whiskey and cigarettes in the front of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a bottle there and both Mom and Dad had individual  
glasses,'' police spokesman Lt. Mark Krey said. ``There was a boom 
box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were pillows in the back seat for the children, who police  
believe were asleep before succumbing because of how they were 
found -- side by side, flat on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These sweet little boys ... it's hard to describe it, to tell  
you the truth,'' Officer Richard Carlberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said they didn't realize there was trouble in the  
family until Nunez's Jan. 11 arrest on an outstanding traffic 
warrant. That same day, state workers began investigating his sons' 
complaints that he had physically and sexually abused them. 
</P>
<P>
	Marleigh Meissner, a spokeswoman for Child Protective Services,  
said Ms. Nunez, a sales clerk, kicked her unemployed husband out, 
sent the children to live with relatives and changed the locks on 
the house. Ms. Meissner said the investigation into the abuse 
charges had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no inkling why a woman who had made her husband move  
out two weeks before would suddenly join him in a murder-suicide 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not proven conclusively, investigators believe the couple  
began preparing Monday for the lethal plan, shopping together for 
the tools to finish their family life. The boxes to the hose and 
car cover appeared to be new and had no dust on them, Krey said.

<HEADLINE> St. Joe Hoop Dreams: Start Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Like many coaches, St. Joseph's Phil  
Martelli didn't like a new NCAA rule allowing athletes to work 
during the school year. He didn't think there were enough hours in 
the day to attend class, study, practice and hold down a job. 
</P>
<P>
	So the St. Joe's coach came up with a way for his players to  
earn money. Now, seven St. Joe's players are running a small 
novelty-item business called Hawk Hoop Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players that there was a risk, that they did not  
have to be part of it,'' Martelli said. ``If they buy a product and 
the product costs $5 and they only raise $4, well, then they're 
going to have to figure out a way to get the dollar to pay for 
their bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working with Rap Curry, St. Joe's career assists leader, the  
team decided to sell ``Hawk Hankies,'' small towels that fans wave 
at games. Robert Haskins designed the towels, which feature a red 
Hawks mascot on a white background with the words, ``Attack, 
Respond, Grow: St. Joseph's Basketball, 1998-99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second semester, players plan to sell prints of a photo  
taken at their game against Villanova at the Palestra earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the NCAA doesn't keep records of how many athletes are  
working, St. Joe's compliance coordinator Renie Shields thinks few 
schools are taking advantage of the rule. While it seemed like a 
good idea to let athletes earn some spending money, the regulation 
comes with a lot of red tape and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell you the truth, I don't think anyone wants to deal with  
it,'' Shields said. ``We did away with this years ago, and now 
we're going back. It's just another thing that I have to monitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new rule, which went into effect last August, no  
player can earn more than $2,000 in a school year. St. Joe's 
interpretation seems like a harmless exercise. It achieves the 
spirit of what the NCAA was trying to accomplish by letting 
athletes earn a few dollars -- just like other students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't go out with the rest of my friends,'' Andre Howard  
said. ``I couldn't go see a movie because I didn't have the funds 
to do that. Many people don't know that as student-athletes, we 
don't have a lot of the things that other students might have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the new legislation raises questions. Martelli, who favors a  
stipend for athletes, worries about the risks, including the 
possibility of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suppose you send a kid out to get you a job at XYZ Corp.,''  
Martelli said. ``You go in there and hang out, and you know the 
people are going to be nice to you because they know you're young 
and you're a player and all this other stuff. And one day they ask, 
`Who do you think is going to win the UMass-Duquesne game?' Now all 
of a sudden, maybe unbeknownst to anybody, they're in the middle of 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools with large, high-profile sports programs apparently are  
reluctant to have their athletes work. At Penn State, only about 15 
of the Nittany Lions' 800 athletes are working during the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not worth it,'' said Bob White, Penn State's assistant  
athletic director. ``There are lot of steps, and a lot kids don't 
even want to fool with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks' towel business was set up as a subsidiary of Curry's  
marketing business. A small financial risk is spread evenly among 
the seven players -- Haskins, Howard, Tim Brown, Chy Chy Ikenokwalu, 
Frank Wilkins, Lionel Ngounou and Erick Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	They buy the towels for $3 each and sell them for $5. They  
bought 1,000 towels, and each player is responsible for selling 
100. They team up to sell the remaining 300 at functions like 
campus parties and alumni rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	The players recently received the $3,000 bill for their towels,  
and they're close to selling enough to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sold 20 to my mom, and she gave them out to our relatives,''  
Brown said. ``I tried to hit all the students on campus that I 
know. I tried to hit some faculty, but they're a little skeptical. 
I think when they see them at the games they'll be more apt to 
buy.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Disney Might Build Second Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Euro Disney is studying the construction of a  
second amusement park on its Disneyland Paris site, the French 
theme park operator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it has started discussions with French  
authorities regarding a 1987 agreement, which already mentioned 
building a second theme park at its site east of Paris before 2011. 
</P>
<P>
	``This project, which remains to be confirmed once the technical  
and financial conditions have been satisfied, would reinforce the 
tourist potential of the Ile-de-France (Paris) region, generate 
thousands of direct and indirect jobs, and would confirm Disneyland 
Paris as the number one tourist destination in Europe,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro Disney, 39 percent owned by the Walt Disney Co. based in  
Burbank, California, opened its doors in April 1992 and has 
reported annual profit since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at Disneyland Paris, east of the capital, fell to  
12.51 million visitors in 1998, from 12.57 million the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slight drop in attendance, Euro Disney reported that  
net profit rose 34 percent to 290 million francs ($51.8 million) 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A Euro Disney spokesman said the existing Paris park, which  
opened in April 1992, has created 10,000 jobs directly and another 
30,000 jobs indirectly in the surrounding region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Encourages IMF Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund has to change  
the way it operates to keep pace with an increasingly globalized 
economy, a senior Clinton administration official told a Senate 
panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers also said the  
financial turmoil that swept Asia, Russia and Brazil in the past 18 
months would have been much worse without the IMF. The Fund 
provided the worst affected nations with billion-dollar rescue 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is one message running through my entire testimony  
today it is this one,that the global economy has changed greatly 
and the IMF has to change with it,'' Summers told a Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee on international economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers also said the 182-nation organization, financed by the  
world's taxpayers, ``must not operate entirely behind closed doors. 
Thanks to recent U.S. initiatives, the IMF has moved significantly 
toward openness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF must be more accountable in its use of public funds,  
provide aid at market-based rates and get the private sector more 
involved in burden sharing, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is early days yet,'' Summers said. ``No one should doubt  
that we are only part way down the long road toward reforming the 
IMF.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Fisher, an American who is the IMF's No. 2 official, was  
unable to testify before the panel because he was holding 
discussions with Brazilian officials on the country's continuing 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about the rescue packages for Brazil, Russia and three  
Asian nations, Summers said, ``I have no doubt that without an IMF 
with the capacity to respond, the cost of these crises would have 
been even higher and the impact on our own economy and markets much 
more severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., the subcommittee chairman, said that  
even though the United States is the IMF's largest shareholder it 
should not expect nor ask the IMF to do everything. Hagel was the 
only lawmaker present at the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expecting the IMF to do too much will set it up for failure,''  
Hagel said. ``The IMF cannot be all things to all peoples. That was 
never in its charter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the $18 billion in replenishment of IMF funds that  
Congress approved last year will require lawmakers to exercise 
better oversight of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Among recommendations in the legislation is establishment of an  
advisory committee consisting of lawmakers from the IMF's top five 
contributors: the United States, Germany, Japan, France and 
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 26.52 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices shot higher at the open this  
morning, led by Internet-related stocks after Amazon.com posted a 
smaller-than-expected loss and EBay beat analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The bounce in technology stocks also boosted blue chip issues  
and the Dow Jones industrial average, which was up 26.52 at 
9,351.10 at 10 a.m. On Tuesday, the Dow added 121.26 to 9,324.58, 
leaving it 318 points shy of its closing record of 9,643.32 on Jan. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon shares were up 15 7/16 at 130 17/32 in Nasdaq trading,  
helping push the Nasdaq composite up 16.87 to 2,450.28. E-Bay 
shares were up 74 3/16 at 295 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was up 5.88 at 1,258.19.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a continuation of the tech rally that started Monday  
afternoon,'' said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Missouri. ``It's feeding off 
the positive news overseas regarding the markets, which of course 
is feeding off of our news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belski said the U.S. market is also benefiting from the hope  
that President Clinton's impeachment trial might end soon. ``There 
are signs that perhaps an ambiguous situation with our political 
problems here might be ending,'' he said. ``That's one less cloud 
of uncertainty hanging over the market, knowing that the president 
will be in place for another two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the trial  
could end in ``the next 10 days, two weeks at the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered  
decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
volume came to 102.38 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets moved higher in reaction to Wall Street's gains  
on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.47 percent. In 
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 2.29 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up .19 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.31 percent.

<HEADLINE> Beecher Stowe House Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) -- The house where Harriet Beecher Stowe  
lived when she wrote ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' fetched $865,000 at 
auction Wednesday. It had been valued at $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers, business partners George Elwell and Jim Koulovatos,  
were interested in the 192-year-old house both for its literary 
significance and for its business potential, said auctioneer Tom 
Saturley. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to invest ``significant money'' to make needed repairs  
and continue operating it as an inn and restaurant, Saturley said. 
The previous owner went out of business.

	The Stowe House was designated a National Historic Landmark in  
1963 because of its ties to ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' the most popular 
of more than 30 books by the abolitionist. 
</P>
<P>
	Stowe, whom President Lincoln had called ``the little lady whose  
book started the Civil War,'' lived at the home for two unhappy 
years after her family moved to Maine from Cincinnati. Her husband 
worked as a professor at nearby Bowdoin College. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter dated Oct. 29, 1850, Stowe wrote that the house was  
cold, crowded and chaotic. She noted that there was a schoolroom 
upstairs and a dining room next door, so there was no place she 
could take a nap without being disturbed.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Official Indicted in Extortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- City Treasurer Miriam Santos was indicted  
Wednesday on federal charges of scheming to extort campaign money 
from companies doing business with her office during her run for 
Illinois attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-count indictment also charged Santos, 43, with  
blacklisting seven brokerage firms that refused to donate money to 
the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said she pressured companies to exceed the city's  
$1,500 campaign contribution limit and forced treasurer's office 
employees to work on her campaign for attorney general while on the 
city payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos lost to Republican incumbent Attorney General Jim Ryan in  
the November election. She now is running for re-election as 
treasurer in the Feb. 23 city election. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of this indictment only weeks before the election  
is not only unjust, it is patently unfair,'' Santos said, adding 
she was ``innocent of any criminal wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar said Santos put undue pressure on the  
companies for money ``with the understanding that if they did not 
contribute they would lose their business with the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lassar said it's unlikely charges would be brought against the  
employees in the treasurer's office.

<HEADLINE> Dismissal of Navy Suit Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A federal magistrate has recommended dismissing  
a $12 million lawsuit against the Navy filed by the family of a 
sailor mistakenly blamed for a blast aboard the USS Iowa that 
killed 47 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate David Perelman said Tuesday that the defamation  
suit should be dismissed because the federal government is immune 
from such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George White will decide whether to accept  
or reject Perelman's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig contends Navy  
officials leaked false allegations to make Hartwig the scapegoat 
for the explosion during an exercise 300 miles north of Puerto Rico 
on April 19, 1989. Hartwig died in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Navy said there was no ``clear and convincing  
proof'' that Hartwig was to blame and apologized to his family. It 
said that despite a $25 million investigation it couldn't find the 
cause of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Hartwig's family filed the lawsuit, saying they  
suffered emotional distress from the Navy's public disclosure of 
confidential statements and false information. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, said Perelman's decision to  
dismiss the family's case disappointed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole life stopped in 1989,'' she said Tuesday. ``It just  
amazes me that this suit could be dismissed. I don't understand 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 85; Nasdaq Gains 13 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks resumed their decline in late  
afternoon following some disappointing earnings results from big 
companies, while broad market indexes were just barely in positive 
territory as investors again bought technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 85.73 at 9,238.85, near its low for the session. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first 30 minutes of trading the Dow had climbed as high  
as 9,385.60, up 61 points, on a burst of computerized buy programs. 
But it retreated in mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Big losers among the Dow industrials this afternoon included  
Philip Morris, down 1 15/16 at 46 5/16 after the cigarette maker 
failed to exceed analysts' earnings expectations, and Disney, down 
1 1/2 at 33 1/16 after a disappointing earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite a general resurgence this afternoon in technology  
stocks, Dow component IBM was down 6 3/16 at 179 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks were lower on concerns about Brazil, where the local  
currency, the real, opened sharply lower against the U.S. dollar 
but was only slightly lower in the afternoon. Dow component J.P. 
Morgan was down 2 3/4 at 101 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks, however, were higher. Dow component Merck was up 3/4  
at 144 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes were higher after bouncing around all  
morning. The Nasdaq composite was up 13.63 at 2,447.04, after 
gaining 30 points in the first hour, then dipping to negative 9 
points before swinging back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was off 1.12 at 1,251.19,  
after giving up a gain of 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were again flying high. Amazon.com shares were  
up 13 1/16 at 128 1/8. The online book seller announced a 
smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss late Tuesday. Online 
auctioneer eBay's shares were up 80 7/8 at 301 3/4, after the company 
beat analysts' earnings expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Rauscher Wessels in  
Minneapolis, said he expected blue chips to recover in the final 
hour of trading today as they has been doing lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have just got to own stocks by the end of the day, and  
I think today will be no different,'' he said. But he was concerned 
that investors were buying ``the same old stuff, which is 
technology, technology, and technology. Altough that's a good 
leading group for the market, it's uncomfortable that it's the only 
game in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today on the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues  
outnumbered decliners by 8 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where volume came to 719.74 million shares, up from Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Warns America's Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Welcomed like a rock star by a crowd of 20,000,  
Pope John Paul II warned America's young people against drifting 
into a world ``filled with darkness'' and rife with violence, drugs 
and easy sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are each called to be a disciple of Christ,'' he told a  
jubilant youth rally Tuesday night at a packed sports arena, where 
his somber message sharply contrasted with his listeners' shrieks 
of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's 30-hour visit to the American heartland kept up a  
mission begun in Mexico to rally his flock against a ``culture of 
death'' as the church heads into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people were expected to turn out today for his  
major public event in St. Louis, a Mass at the Trans World Dome. He 
is to return to Rome tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	During the youth rally at the Kiel Center, the crowd waved white  
handkerchiefs in welcome, chanting, ``John Paul II, we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just such an incredible role model, someone you can  
really look up to,'' said Sarah Einhorn, 14, of Effingham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports were a metaphor for his message, and the youths presented  
him with a hockey jersey that read: ``John Paul II No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turned somber when describing ``the darkness of children who  
go hungry and even die. The darkness of homeless people of who lack 
work and proper medical care. The darkness of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong when so many people are  
overcome by hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives,'' 
the pope said. Instead, he said, ``Do not listen to those who 
encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility. Do not listen to 
those who tell you that chastity is passe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope appeared tired during the evening event.  
His shoulders were slumped and his left hand trembled. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was John Paul's fifth to the U.S. mainland, and his  
message contained a familiar theme -- that Americans should use 
their freedoms responsibly and strive for a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	During a ceremony at the airport upon his arrival Tuesday  
afternoon, he likened the U.S. debate over abortion and euthanasia 
to the one over slavery, calling the outcome a test of national 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial today,'' he said with  
President Clinton seated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms,  
cherishes and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that seeks 
to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the 
terminally ill, the handicapped and others considered `unuseful' to 
be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a leading opponent of capital punishment and  
has intervened in several cases in the United States. Missouri's 
Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was 
to have taken place while the pope was in town. Papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, John Paul avoided certain sources of tension  
with the United States and dropped from the advance text of his 
speech any mention of land mines, drug trafficking or U.S. air 
strikes against Iraq, something the Vatican has assailed as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told John Paul at the airport ceremony. 
``We honor you for standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and  
the pope, abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica 
Lewinsky affair not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley 
said. The two did discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines Soc. Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton summoned approving academics  
and economists to the White House on Wednesday to endorse his 
Social Security rescue plan, push for Medicare reforms and argue 
against tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to shore up Social Security and Medicare for retiring  
baby boomers, Clinton said, ``We will simply have to have a 
bipartisan process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott made clear from Capitol  
Hill that Republicans, who want a 10 percent income tax cut, will 
not just hand over the budget surplus to Clinton, no matter how 
much assent he collected in the East Room of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take 62 percent (of the surplus) for Social Security, and the  
rest should go back to the taxpayers in tax cuts,'' Lott, R-Miss., 
told reporters. ``The president hasn't gone far enough, but he 
tiptoed out in the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is well to remember that the current prosperity of this  
country was created not by rash actions in Washington,'' countered 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's top economic adviser also responded to critics  
such as Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee. Archer said Clinton's proposal to invest Social Security 
funds in the stock market for potentially higher returns would mean 
``relying on government investment decisions that are subject to 
political pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, chairman of Clinton's National Economic Council,  
told questioning lawmakers assembled in the East Room that the 
investments would be made by private-sector managers ``independent 
and insulated'' from one another and selected through competitive 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House estimates the federal surplus at $4.4 trillion  
over the next 15 years. Clinton has proposed using the biggest 
chunk, 62 percent, to bolster Social Security and dedicating 
another 15 percent to increase the solvency of -- and add a 
prescription-drug benefit to -- Medicare, the health-care program 
for the elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton University economist Uwe Reinhart, a familiar voice of  
support for Clinton on health issues, called the plan civilized and 
said it would be a sin not to adopt it. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I understand the response, those who disagree with us are  
uncivilized sinners,'' joked Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press  
showed half of Americans favor applying the surplus to Social 
Security over using it for a tax cut, retiring the national debt or 
domestic spending. And more than half, 52 percent, opposed 
investing Social Security money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton seized Wednesday's occasion to dispute suggestions that,  
by pouring billions from the surplus into Medicare, unpopular 
cost-containments could be avoided. ``I did not intend to say that 
'Whoop-dee-doo! Now we don't have to make any changes in the 
program,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton released letters from government accountants backing his  
claim that under his plan, Social Security would gain more than 20 
years of financial health -- through 2055 -- and Medicare would be 
able to pay its bills until 2020, instead of 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtracting his proposal to invest some Social Security money in  
the stock market, the accountants said, would still mean extending 
Social Security's viability until 2049. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican lawmakers, New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg among  
them, have charged that Clinton is double-counting surplus funds 
already set aside for Social Security. The accounting trick should 
not paper over the hard choices on ``real'' reform to control the 
retirement programs' drain on national resources, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us support the president's rhetorical approach to  
saving Social Security. There might even be a bipartisan majority 
for devoting 62 percent of the budget surplus to Social Security 
reform,'' Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it must be 62 percent of a real surplus.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Pew poll of 1,500 adults was taken Jan. 19-25 and had a  
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Amazon Stock Jumps on Sales News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc.'s stock surged more than 20  
percent in early trading today on news that the Internet giant's 
fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, music and video retailer reported late Tuesday it lost  
$46.43 million, or 30 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 
compared with a loss of $10.81 million, or 8 cents a share, a year 
ago. The results include a charge of $24.2 million for costs 
associated with recent acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in online holiday shopping lifted sales to $252.89  
million in the fourth quarter, up from $66.04 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charges, Amazon.com lost $22.18 million, or 14  
cents a share, in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call had expected its operating losses to be 18 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's shares were up $23.66 at $138.75 in early trading  
today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1995, Amazon.com has yet to make a profit as it  
spends freely to advertise its site and expand its offerings. It 
added music, videos and a small selection of electronics and toys 
to its site last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its continued losses, it is a favorite stock on Wall  
Street, with investors bidding up Amazon.com shares in recent 
months on expectations that it will be a big winner as more people 
shop on the Internet in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon.com is spending a lot of money on sales and marketing,  
but that is money well spent,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul 
Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel, Calif. ``It is the cost of doing 
business on the Web and without it, you can't really do business 
successfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of customer accounts at Amazon.com's World Wide Web  
site increased by more than 1.7 million during the fourth quarter 
to nearly 6.2 million. That compares with 1.5 million customer 
accounts at the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During the holiday weeks between Nov. 17 and Dec. 31, Amazon.com  
shipped more than 7.5 million items, more than the company shipped 
during the entirety of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of its sales in the fourth quarter came from  
its music, video and international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of music, which it began to sell in June, were $33.1  
million, more than double the $14.4 million that was sold in the 
third quarter. The company didn't provide sales figures for its 
video division, which began on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's British and German operations nearly quadrupled  
over the third quarter, making them the No. 1 online booksellers in 
their countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also said that it would expand its distribution  
system to better handle orders. During the holidays, Amazon.com 
could not fulfill all of its processing in a timely manner and some 
customers received gifts after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com previously announced that it was leasing a new  
distribution center in Nevada that would speed up its shipping 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, Amazon.com lost $124.55 million, or 84 cents a share,  
compared with a loss of $31.02 million, or 24 cents a share, in 
1997. Sales totaled $609.99 million, up from $147.79 million last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush Knows He's in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Noting the attention he has drawn as an  
undeclared presidential candidate, Republican Gov. George W. Bush 
urged Texas legislators to use the national spotlight to show the 
nation how limited, bipartisan government solves problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the State address Wednesday, Bush -- unlike a  
week ago in his inaugural address -- acknowledged how his indecision 
over seeking the White House in 2000 has taken center stage. 
</P>
<P>
	While he repeated that he remains undecided on seeking the GOP  
presidential nomination, Bush said state House and Senate members 
could capitalize on his rising national profile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been asked about it. You have been asked about it. You  
didn't ask for it -- but it is here anyway. And we can either view 
it as a distraction, or seize it as an opportunity to show the 
world what limited and constructive government looks like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush noted that the nation's second-largest state, with the  
world's 11th-largest economy, runs well with a Legislature that 
meets only 140 days every other year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Texas' short lawmaking period focuses the attention of  
all participants because it ``requires us to put aside posturing 
and politics and find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sometimes disagree, but we do so agreeably,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The first Texas governor re-elected to consecutive four-year  
terms, Bush praised lawmakers for changes enacted during his first 
term. The state's welfare rolls have been trimmed by half, more 
than 340,000, to the lowest level in a decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the son of former President George W. Bush, is considered  
an early front-runner for the 2000 GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Other possible candidates are former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, former cabinet secretary 
Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and activist 
Gary Bauer.

<HEADLINE> Jana Johnson Ready for Center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of voice training and acting  
classes, countless waitressing jobs and timid dreams of being 
onstage, Jana Johnson decided that 1997 was the year to overcome 
her fear of performing. 
</P>
<P>
	And what a payoff.  
</P>
<P>
	She produced and co-stars in ``Los Enchiladas,'' which was  
selected for this year's Sundance Film Festival in Utah. The film, 
shot in St. Paul, Minn., is a comedy about a fictitious Mexican 
restaurant of the same name and what happens when its sleazy 
manager walks out before Cinco de Mayo, the busiest day of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundance, the nation's top showcase for independent films, is a  
dream come true for Ms. Johnson and ex-boyfriend Mitch Hedberg, a 
rising young comic who wrote and directed the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played around with the concept of a Mexican restaurant,''  
she remembers. ``We're both from Minnesota and find the lack of 
authenticity in ethnic restaurants there to be a source of humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film's Midwestern setting is part of what impressed the  
Sundance judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Los Enchiladas' had a freshness from its regionality,'' says  
John Cooper, associate director of programming at Sundance and one 
of five people who selects films to be shown there. ``These 
characters are universal but they bring a Minnesota-something to 
the film. A kind of craziness. After all, look who's their 
governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ms. Johnson, 29, a native of Lake City, Minn., is trying to  
snag a distribution deal for the film. 
</P>
<P>
	She's also happy that she's getting recognition in front of the  
camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked on the outside of this industry for so long,''  
says Ms. Johnson, who has booked rock groups such as Pearl Jam and 
Smashing Pumpkins into local Seattle clubs and traveled the country 
promoting Hedberg's career. ``This film is my chance to finally 
switch the focus to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of her performance, Cooper says, ``She was pretty impressive.  
One of the great things about Sundance is that they're looking for 
new talent. This film had lots of new faces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Johnson and Hedberg recently ended a nine-year  
romance, they maintain a business relationship. Enough perspiration 
and $100,000 of hard-earned cash and credit -- theirs and that of 
friends and family -- went into the project to override any 
potential falling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's talented in her own right. She was an asset to the whole  
situation,'' says Hedberg, who has appeared on the ``Late Show With 
David Letterman'' and was a smash at the Montreal Comedy Festival. 
``Jana did all the legwork and all the organization. She was able 
to keep things in order when they were falling apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1991, Ms. Johnson and Hedberg, 30, lived variously in  
Florida, Seattle, Los Angeles and New York. She studied voice and 
acting. He wrote, sought development deals and did stand-up comedy. 
They moved to New York in June 1997. Hedberg was writing a 
screenplay, and Ms. Johnson thought it was time to give acting a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	To support their artistic pursuits, the pair had worked in  
franchise restaurants; Ms. Johnson as a waitress, Hedberg as a 
cook. 
</P>
<P>
	Their restaurant experiences form the plot of ``Los  
Enchiladas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always certain characters that are at every  
restaurant,'' Ms. Johnson says. ``It seems as if there's always one 
cook who takes his job way too seriously and wears the full chef 
regalia. And they're working with a bunch of kids, who are just 
making some money to go party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By summer's end, the screenplay was complete. They decided it  
would be less expensive to make the film in Minnesota, foremost 
because their families live there, so they were unlikely to starve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedberg used some money leftover from a TV development deal that  
never got off the ground to begin filming. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Ms. Johnson's crackerjack organizational skills  
came in. 
</P>
<P>
	She began making calls from New York to the Minnesota Film  
Board, which provided lists of local crew technicians. Once the 
directors of photography were hired, everything else fell into 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	After three weeks of pre-production, ``Los Enchiladas'' was shot  
in St. Paul during 22 days in September and October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The actors were culled from the vast community of local  
stage-actor groups. ``They would work all day at their jobs, then 
show up for 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. shoots,'' Ms. Johnson recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of post-production, a rough cut of ``Los  
Enchiladas'' was submitted on video to Sundance this past autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two days before Thanksgiving, Hedberg got the word from  
Sundance. He called Ms. Johnson at her New York apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yup, we're in,'' he told her.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the best day of my life,'' Ms. Johnson remembers.  
``When my future husband proposes to me, he better have something 
special up his sleeve, because it's going to take a lot to top that 
one.''

<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- Robin Adair, a technician who helped set up  
the first Associated Press bureau in New Mexico, died Tuesday. He 
was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Adair began with the AP in August 1924 after having been a  
telegrapher for Western Union. He worked for the news organization 
in west Texas for 12 years until coming to Albuquerque to help set 
up the AP's first New Mexico bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Adair worked for the organization until his retirement in 1966  
as traffic bureau chief -- in charge of AP technicians -- in the 
Albuquerque bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP bureau was established in New Mexico in the 1930s, with  
Adair as its first technician -- and later its chief technician.

<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, a major figure  
in Spanish contemporary literature whose novels blended realism 
with fantasy, died Wednesday of a heart attack. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the 1985 Cervantes Prize for Literature -- the most  
important literary award in the Spanish-speaking world -- Torrente 
Ballester published his first novel, ``Javier Marino'', in 1943 and 
his last, ``Los Anos Indecisos'' (The Indecisive Years), a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Torrente Ballester wrote more than 30 novels, establishing his  
importance with his 1972 novel ``La Saga/Fuga de J.B'' (The 
Legend/Flight of J.B.). 
</P>

of J.C. Penney Co. Inc., died Friday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Batten, the company's fourth chairman and chief executive  
officer from 1958 to 1974, guided J.C. Penney's growth into a 
diversified, mass-merchandising chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The transformation from small-town stores was launched by a memo  
Batten wrote in 1957 detailing changes in the country's population, 
especially shifts to large cities and suburbs. The memo's proposed 
changes included expansion of the merchandise mix and an end to the 
chain's ``cash only'' policy.

Metropolitan Opera from 1951 to 1974, died Jan. 22. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Carelli began his vocal studies in Budapest and continued them  
in Rome. He made his opera debut in Florence in a production of 
Puccini's ``Boheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to the United States in 1939 and traveled as a  
recitalist and a principal singer with operatic touring companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Carelli sang as Dr. Caius in an NBC Symphony broadcast  
performance of Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' conducted by Arturo Toscanini, 
in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Carelli made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Don Curzio in  
Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro'' in 1951. Over the next 23 years, he 
sang more than 1,000 times in 39 operas.

</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jack DeWitt, a scientist and inventor  
who later became president of television and radio station WSM 
Inc., died Monday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Although DeWitt was best remembered for his work in radio and  
TV, he played a key role during World War II and was awarded the 
Legion of Merit for inventing the proximity fuse. It was a 
pencil-sized radio device that rode inside 105mm howitzer shells, 
dramatically increasing accuracy. He also worked on a project to 
bounce radio waves off the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWitt took a job at WSM, and after a stint at Bell Telephone  
Laboratories in New York, returned to WSM as chief engineer. He 
played a pivotal role in boosting the station from 5,000 watts to 
50,000 watts. 
</P>
<P>
	He became president of WSM Inc. in 1947. In 1950 he helped  
launch WSM Channel 4, using a series of microwave relays to 
transfer NBC's signal from Louisville to Nashville. The station is 
now WSMV-TV. The relay system brought network TV to Nashville years 
before the telephone company would lay the land lines that brought 
NBC and other networks to Middle Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, DeWitt worked on a way to download images  
from a government weather satellite. Soon after, WSMV became the 
first station in the country to broadcast a near-real time weather 
satellite photo. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1968. In 1987, he was awarded a regional Emmy for  
lifetime achievement.

<P>
	Rimmel was managing editor in charge of general news operations  
in the 1970s and was assistant executive editor when he retired in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
	As night managing editor directing the layout of the 1963  
assassination coverage of President John F. Kennedy, Rimmel was 
told the word ``assassinated'' wouldn't fit in the headline. He 
ordered it done and was given the metal front-page press plate as a 
souvenir.

</P>
<P>
	Sciranko's broadcasting career started in the 1960s at WSKE in  
Everett. He worked for Johnstown-based WCRO in the 1970s, and in 
the 1980s was an on-air personality for WBFD, a Christian station.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Max R. Stanley, a Northrop test pilot who  
flew the experimental Flying Wing 40 years before its modern-day 
equivalent, the B-2 Bomber, was invented, died Saturday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew the four-engine, 172-foot-long, boomerang-shaped Flying  
Wing on June 25, 1946, from Northrop's Hawthorne Airport to the 
Muroc Army airfield -- now known as Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen versions of the Flying Wing were developed by John  
K. Northrop between 1942 and 1949, including the two-seat N-9s used 
to train pilots, the B-35 three-man piston-engine aircraft and the 
eight-jet, 15-man B-49. But the planes were criticized for a lack 
of safety and fuel inefficiency and eventually were replaced by the 
Convair B-36.

	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Jerzy Turowicz, a leading Polish  
intellectual and editor of a weekly Catholic newspaper, died 
Wednesday from complications of a heart attack. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Turowicz became a philosopher, a writer and a spiritual guide  
for generations of Polish anti-Communist opposition members. As 
editor of a leading lay Catholic publication in Poland, he was 
close to Archbishop Karol Wojtyla of Krakow, who became Pope John 
Paul II in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	His newspaper, Tygodnik Powszechy (Universal Weekly), was a  
leading independent voice during the communist years. Turowicz 
edited it from 1945 until his death, except for a three-year period 
from 1953-56 when he was barred from running it by the Communist 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	An adviser to the Solidarity trade union that led the movement  
to topple Communist rule in 1989, Turowicz remained a careful 
observer and critic of Poland's new democracy in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Anna, three daughters and five  
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Concern Over Future of Antarctica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McMURDO BASE, Antarctica (AP) -- Officials from 24 countries  
meeting in the Antarctic said today that the region faces several 
serious threats, including illegal fishing. But they stopped short 
of taking any specific steps to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups such as Greenpeace had urged the delegates  
at the first meeting of Antarctic Treaty nations ever held on its 
frozen tundra to achieve more than a photo opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's final statement, however, did little more than name  
a few of the challenges facing the Antarctic, the only region in 
the world devoted to peace and science and which does not contain a 
single country, government or armed force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Representatives expressed in particular their grave concern at  
the threat posed by continuing illegal, unregulated and unreported 
fishing for toothfish,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	British environmental minister Michael Meacher had earlier urged  
the delegates to protect the Antarctic by asking the world to cut 
greenhouse gas emissions, reduce ozone depletion and control 
illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Other delegates expressed concern about the damaging effects  
that growing tourism is having on the region's environment. 
</P>
<P>
	And Simon Upton, New Zealand's minister for the Antarctic, gave  
an emotional speech comparing the illegal fishing to piracy and 
saying that the region lacked any means of enforcing its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, this is an awful indictment of us and our claim to be  
the stewards or guardians of the Antarctic,'' Upton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement urged the Treaty nations to continue working  
closely together, especially with important scientific research in 
the area in areas such as global climate change. And it looked 
forward to any steps that the group may decide to take at its May 
24 meeting in Lima, Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	During their visit, the delegates stayed at the U.S. McMurdo  
Base and New Zealand's Scott Base on Ross Island. They took 
helicopter tours across the desolate Antarctic, visiting places 
such as huts that had been used by famous explorers of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the Antarctic Treaty contains strict rules regarding  
vessels from member countries that enter the region carrying 
fishermen or tourists. But he said the region often lacks the 
ability to enforce them by going after violators. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, at least 70 illegal fishing ships are currently  
plundering the Patagonian toothfish, and selling them for huge 
profits in Japan and the United States. One of the illegal vessels 
threatened to ram a licensed New Zealand fishing boat, and legal 
Australian ships also have been menaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal fishing often results in other unwanted species  
being netted and then dumped, scientists told the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism also is growing rapidly, thanks to cruise ships carrying  
helicopters that fly passengers inland to sightsee across the 
frozen region. The delegates heard about one ship that recently 
visited and left behind a trail of garbage.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Accuses Feds of Tinkering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's next witness at its antitrust  
trial told the judge in written testimony that government efforts 
to modify its popular Windows software slowed some functions 
sevenfold and prevented other programs from running at all. 
</P>
<P>
	James Allchin, a senior vice president expected to take the  
stand Monday, derided government efforts as a ``Rube Goldberg 
mechanism'' that made Windows ``effectively useless in a commercial 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft released Allchin's 139 pages of written testimony  
Wednesday, even as the government ended its initial questioning of 
Paul Maritz, the senior executive responsible for Microsoft's most 
important consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sought to show that, over Microsoft's protests,  
Internet browser software was illegally built into newer versions 
of the Windows operating system and can be safely removed. 
</P>
<P>
	A software expert, Edward Felten of Princeton University, who  
wrote a removal program, testified previously that his procedure 
``does not prevent Windows 98 from (starting) properly, nor does it 
affect the stability of Windows 98 under ordinary use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Allchin said Felten's methods ``seriously degrade'' Windows,  
making parts of it run seven times slower and preventing consumers 
from using popular software by IBM Corp., America Online Inc. and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies, in a second day of  
aggressive cross-examination, pressed Maritz about Microsoft's 
efforts in 1995 to discourage Intel Corp. from developing new 
technology, called Native Signal Processing, that could compete 
with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has used the episode to support its charge that  
Microsoft illegally used its influence in the high-tech industry to 
stifle potential competition against its lucrative Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to give Intel reason to feel they needed to go  
and develop system software,'' Maritz said, adding that Microsoft 
believed the new technology ``was not in Intel's own interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz later conceded, ``We did think it was a bad thing for  
Microsoft. ... I hope we got our point across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin, a senior computer scientist for the company, rejected  
in his written testimony claims that Microsoft included its browser 
software within Windows to try to ``crush'' Netscape Communications 
Corp., whose own browser earned tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin accused the government of trying ``to cast such  
integration in a bad light, suggesting that it occurs only for 
improper purposes, namely, to force customers to take things they 
do not want. That is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand, Maritz called it ``inevitable we would integrate  
it into the Windows environment.'' But he also acknowledged that 
Nescape's success proved ``an added incentive to make as fast as 
progress as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin warned it would be a ``recipe for disaster'' for courts  
to impose limits on what could be added to Windows, adding that 
``this beneficial process is under attack in this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked  
Maritz how far Microsoft might go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you think of any application that could not be integrated  
into Windows?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't boundaries, your Honor,'' Maritz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to question Maritz further Thursday, and  
the judge said he will decide whether the company must turn over a 
controversial e-mail that could undermine one of its defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail from Microsoft software engineer David D'Souza  
analyzed Felten's efforts to strip the company's browser software 
from Windows, which Microsoft contends is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents said the message could be used to identify which  
parts of some shared software code relate to Windows and which 
parts relate to the Internet browser.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Theater Founders Defy U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The co-founders of Livent Inc., charged with  
widespread fraud at the theater company, say they will not appear 
at an arraignment in New York this week and will surrender to U.S. 
authorities only if extradited. 
</P>
<P>
	Garth Drabinsky, the high-profile producer of ``Ragtime'' and  
other Broadway hits, and his business partner, Myron Gottlieb, were 
charged by U.S. prosecutors two weeks ago with criminal conspiracy 
and securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Canadians were scheduled to appear in a New York court  
Thursday, but their lawyers said Wednesday that the men would 
remain in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Greenspan, Drabinsky's lawyer, suggested nothing short of  
a formal extradition process would get his client to leave Canada 
for a U.S. court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will vigorously oppose any extradition request by the  
United States, if such a request is made,'' Greenspan said in a 
statement. ``This is the process ... that will have to be applied 
in this matter, as Mr. Drabinsky will avail himself of the legal 
protections afforded him in his native Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Gottlieb, Lee Richards, issued a similar statement.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said U.S. authorities shouldn't be seeking to  
prosecute Drabinsky because the case involves a Canadian citizen 
running a Canadian company bound by Canadian accounting rules.

<P>
	``Canada is, without doubt, the most appropriate forum to  
consider the issues raised by the indictment,'' Greenspan said. 
``Mr. Drabinsky has suffered a great deal by the charges leveled 
against him -- charges brought after a very quick and rushed 
investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation of the Livent case by Canadian police is still  
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's office in New York has said failure to  
appear in court could make Gottlieb and Drabinsky fugitives from 
the law, and possibly prompt the issuing of international arrest 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	After announcement of the U.S. charges, Drabinsky held a news  
conference in Toronto to proclaim his innocence. He denounced U.S. 
authorities for conducting a ``quick, ill-conceived'' 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabinsky and Gottlieb are accused of inflating earnings reports  
and arranging kickbacks worth $4.6 million between 1990 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	They were suspended in August by Livent's new management team,  
headed by former Walt Disney Co. president Michael Ovitz and New 
York investment banker Roy Furman. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabinsky, Livent's former chairman and chief executive, and  
Gottlieb, its former president, allegedly had a senior vice 
president, Gordon Eckstein, write off most of $4.6 million as 
pre-production expenses. The pair allegedly pocketed the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckstein and Maria Messina, Livent's chief financial officer  
from the middle of 1996 through last November, each pleaded guilty 
in recent weeks to federal criminal charges. No sentencing date was 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	Five others also were charged by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission with engaging in a pervasive accounting fraud beginning 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent, based in Toronto, has sought court protection from  
creditors in Canada and the United States. It has obtained $25 
million in emergency financing to survive for another six months 
while it restructures its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent owns or controls four theaters in New York, Chicago,  
Toronto and Vancouver. Its productions have included ``Kiss of the 
Spider Woman,'' ``Show Boat,'' ``Barrymore'' and ``Phantom of the 
Opera.''

<HEADLINE>  Pope Warns America's Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Welcomed like a rock star by a crowd of 20,000,  
Pope John Paul II warned America's young people against drifting 
into a world ``filled with darkness'' and rife with violence, drugs 
and easy sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are each called to be a disciple of Christ,'' he told a  
jubilant youth rally Tuesday night at a packed sports arena, where 
his somber message sharply contrasted with his listeners' shrieks 
of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's 30-hour visit to the American heartland kept up a  
mission begun in Mexico to rally his flock against a ``culture of 
death'' as the church heads into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people were expected to turn out today for his  
major public event in St. Louis, a Mass at the Trans World Dome. He 
is to return to Rome tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	During the youth rally at the Kiel Center, the crowd waved white  
handkerchiefs in welcome, chanting, ``John Paul II, we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just such an incredible role model, someone you can  
really look up to,'' said Sarah Einhorn, 14, of Effingham, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports were a metaphor for his message, and the youths presented  
him with a hockey jersey that read: ``John Paul II No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told there was much excitement in St. Louis during the  
recent baseball season, when two great players, Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa, were competing to break the home run record,'' he told 
the young people. ``You can feel the same great enthusiasm as you 
train for a different goal -- the goal of following Christ, the goal 
of bringing his message to the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turned somber when describing ``the darkness of children who  
go hungry and even die. The darkness of homeless people of who lack 
work and proper medical care. The darkness of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong when so many people are  
overcome by hopelessness to the point of taking their own lives,'' 
the pope said. Instead, he said, ``Do not listen to those who 
encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility. Do not listen to 
those who tell you that chastity is passe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pope appeared tired during the evening event.  
His shoulders were slumped and his left hand trembled. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was John Paul's fifth to the U.S. mainland, and his  
message contained a familiar theme -- that Americans should use 
their freedoms responsibly and strive for a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	During a ceremony at the airport upon his arrival Tuesday  
afternoon, he likened the U.S. debate over abortion and euthanasia 
to the one over slavery, calling the outcome a test of national 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``America faces a similar time of trial today,'' he said with  
President Clinton seated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms,  
cherishes and celebrates the gift of life, and a culture that seeks 
to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the 
terminally ill, the handicapped and others considered `unuseful' to 
be outside the boundaries of legal protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is also a leading opponent of capital punishment and  
has intervened in several cases in the United States. Missouri's 
Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an execution that was 
to have taken place while the pope was in town. Papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the postponement ``a mockery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During previous visits to the United States, home to 62 million  
Roman Catholics, the pope has spoken out against American 
materialism and consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, John Paul avoided certain sources of tension  
with the United States and dropped from the advance text of his 
speech any mention of land mines, drug trafficking or U.S. air 
strikes against Iraq, something the Vatican has assailed as 
``aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For 20 years you have challenged us to think of life not in  
terms of what we acquire for ourselves but what we give of 
ourselves,'' the president told John Paul at the airport ceremony. 
``We honor you for standing for human dignity and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during a private 20-minute meeting between Clinton and  
the pope, abortion only ``came up in passing'' and the Monica 
Lewinsky affair not at all, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley 
said. The two did discuss Cuba and Iraq, Navarro-Valls said.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A man who was believed killed in a car  
crash has turned up alive, and he may be charged with killing the 
man found in the burned vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental records suggested the man who died in the July 1997 car  
crash was Bruce Alan Littleton, authorities said. But police say 
they stopped Littleton in Smyrna last week for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton, 31, who at the time of the crash faced drug charges,  
had been using an alias, according to police. Police now say that 
the man who died in the crash was a homicide victim and that 
Littleton killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't go into the details at this point but we feel he  
killed the individual and placed him in the vehicle,'' Richard

<HEADLINE> Argentines Discuss Currency Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Liliana Fabricante doesn't mind a  
few American influences, like fast-food chains or movies. But 
President Carlos Menem's recent suggestion of replacing Argentina's 
peso with the U.S. dollar is too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it,'' the 31-year-old homemaker said. ``I want  
money that's ours. Something that shows it's from Argentina, not 
something that makes us feel like we're another state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A resurgence of economic turmoil in Latin America has prompted  
Menem to seek ways Argentina could scrap its multicolored peso 
bills for the more universally recognized American greenbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that sinking currencies around the world have increased  
economic pressures at home, Menem hopes an economy operating 
exclusively in dollars could insulate Argentina from future global 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has gained momentum in recent weeks, particularly  
amid Brazil's struggle to bolster its sinking currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Pou, Argentina's Central Bank president, said last week  
that local officials were working with their U.S. counterparts to 
prepare working papers on the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	However, officials from both countries concede any formal switch  
wouldn't happen anytime soon. A final decision to dump the peso for 
the dollar would require several years of planning, not to mention 
approval from Argentina's Congress, the U.S. Treasury and the 
Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Menem's proposal has sparked a debate over what  
Argentines are willing to sacrifice for economic security and just 
how much a shift to dollars would compromise national sovereignty 
and pride. 
</P>
<P>
	Disagreeing with critics who maintain Argentina would relinquish  
part of its nationhood, convenience store owner Julio Roussales 
said: ``If that's what it takes to reduce interest rates, prevent 
our country from slipping into recessions, and curb our debt, then 
I'm for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Roussales noted, dollars already freely circulate in  
the Argentine economy, where the peso is pegged one-to-one with the 
dollar. Dollars have served as a parallel currency since 1991, when 
the peso replaced the country's former currency, the austral. 
</P>
<P>
	ATM machines ask customers whether they want pesos or dollars,  
bank accounts can be opened in either currency and most daily 
transactions can be handled using either bill. Many mortgages and 
long-term business projects are handled in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``People keep dollars at home or tucked away in their wallet,''  
Roussales said. ``We've changed currencies before and I don't have 
any love for the peso.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the loss of its national currency is only one  
potential drawback should Argentina decide to join Panama as the 
second Latin American country with a dollar-based economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Argentina wants to dollarize its economy, it would have to  
surrender it's monetary sovereignty to the United States,'' said 
Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown University's Center for 
Latin American Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have no flexibility because the Federal Reserve  
makes decisions thinking only of the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers acknowledged as  
much Tuesday, saying in congressional testimony that countries are 
reluctant to adopt another nation's currency because they fear 
``loss of control over monetary policy,'' such as the ability to 
independently set interest rates or print money. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's obviously a choice for Argentina to pursue,'' Summers  
told the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. But ``it may be a choice 
that can serve important functions in anchoring the (Argentine) 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Argentina, aided by its economic plan pegging the  
peso to the dollar, has weathered two recent financial crises in 
neighboring Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	But Argentine officials say that has not completely allayed  
investor fears of a potential devaluation or default on foreign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears, Pou said, are reflected in the recent surge in  
Argentina's interest rates, now at 11 percent. Replacing the peso 
with the dollar would end those fears, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of dumping the peso isn't new. Argentina talked of  
switching to the dollar in 1995, when the region's economies 
contracted during the Mexican peso devaluation. Such talk helped 
Argentina ward off more severe consequences from that crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem says the debate over switching to the dollar could be a  
step toward considering a regional dollar-based common currency, 
along the lines of the euro, launched by 11 of the 15 European 
Union nations on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	That, says Fabricante, would be easier to swallow than the faces  
of American presidents on Argentina's currency.

<HEADLINE> Boy, 11, Charged in Sister's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEOLA, Fla. (AP) -- An 11-year-old boy, enraged over being  
disciplined for fighting with his 13-year-old sister, shot and 
killed the girl, deputy sheriffs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Domanic Boykin Jr. told a 911 dispatcher he shot his  
sister, Constance, because his mother had ``whupped'' him after a 
dispute with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy sheriffs released the 911 tape Tuesday after charging the  
middle school student with first-degree murder on Monday. On the 
tape, Patrick said the shooting was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shot my sister. ... I got whupped twice. ... Then I got real  
mad,'' the boy said on the tape in a sobbing voice. ``She's dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth grader was struck twice in the back, once in the head  
and once in the right shoulder as she stood at the kitchen sink 
with her back turned, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's parents, Patrick and Michelle Boykin, were both  
at work at the time of Monday's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick, who was held without bond, told detectives he got the  
gun from his parents' closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Sgt. Nick Pallitto said the siblings had a physical  
tussle recently and Patrick was punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some discipline that the kid felt was too harsh,''  
Pallitto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant State Attorney Bill Gross said Monday he did not know  
if the state will ask the grand jury to try Patrick as an adult.

<HEADLINE> Feds Might Pursue Olympic Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators scrutinizing the Salt  
Lake City Olympic scandal are searching for evidence to bring a 
bribery prosecution in which both bribers and recipients could be 
charged, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors and agents are looking at mail and wire  
fraud and conspiracy statutes and a racketeering law to prosecute 
what they initially see as a case of commercial bribery, rather 
than the more familiar government variety, the officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department normally lets private parties resolve  
commercial bribery cases through civil lawsuits rather than 
bringing a federal criminal charge. The exception is when a federal 
interest is involved, like the integrity of the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The racketeering law prohibits interstate and foreign travel to  
further federal or state crimes like bribery and extortion or to 
distribute their illicit proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under study are tax, currency transfer and foreign bribery  
statutes that might provide additional charges, according to these 
Justice Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal inquiry is in a very early stage -- months from  
key decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents are still trying to understand the records they  
subpoenaed from Salt Lake's bid committee. Stephanie Pate, one-time 
secretary of former bid committee head Tom Welch, has been meeting 
with agents this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the International Olympic Committee have  
resigned over the scandal. Kenya's Charles Mukora, who resigned 
Wednesday, was among six members who were effectively expelled 
Sunday following revelations of misconduct in the Salt Lake 
bidding. Others remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses, scholarships for 
their children and cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic case under investigation is whether Salt Lake's  
committee paid bribes to IOC members to win the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. Federal mail and wire fraud charges could be brought if 
someone used the mails or phones to ``defraud the International 
Olympic Committee of the honest services of its members,'' one 
Justice official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any Olympic decision-maker who took a bribe also could be  
vulnerable to being charged with defrauding the international panel 
of his or her honest service -- honest service meaning a vote for a 
site based on its merits rather than on under-the-table payments, 
this official said. 
</P>
<P>
	If more than one person were involved, then prosecutors could  
charge a conspiracy to defraud the Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal statute known as ITAR, for interstate travel in aid of  
racketeering, is also a potential charge because it criminalizes 
interstate and foreign travel to promote bribery and extortion 
schemes that violate federal or state laws, one official said. This 
statute could apply to bribe givers or takers. 
</P>
<P>
	If evidence showed illicit payments began with and were the  
product of pressure on Salt Lake representatives from Olympic 
decision-makers, then the recipients could be charged with 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also are looking into whether the Salt Lake panel  
violated its tax-exempt status or if any recipients failed to 
report payments on which U.S. taxes were due. 
</P>
<P>
	But such charges are considered longer shots at this point.  
``It's hard to make cases of violating an organization's tax-exempt 
status, and it's very hard to show that foreigners were aware they 
would owe U.S. taxes on things like scholarships for their kids,'' 
said one former Justice official, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax charges would likely be added to other federal counts ``only  
if they are necessary to clearly demonstrate what happened -- that 
tax-exempt dollars were misused or personal gain was involved,'' 
said this former official. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury agents are focusing on cash payments, particularly  
whether IOC members violated requirements to report carrying cash 
out of the country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials familiar with the Foreign Corrupt  
Practices Act are still being briefed on evidence gathered in the 
case, but that act applies only to bribes paid by U.S. citizens to 
foreign officials to influence actions of their government. While 
some foreign officials serve on the IOC, it is a private, 
non-governmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, prosecutors must still weigh whether federal or state  
charges would be the most likely to succeed, would reach the 
largest number of potentially guilty parties and would provide the 
most appropriate penalties.

<HEADLINE> Barry Levinson Shares More of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- It's Friday night, and Pennsylvania Avenue is  
jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the blue neon marquee of the Royal Theater, a small circle  
of men break into song, snapping their fingers and bobbing in and 
out in a curbside jam session. The excited screams from a young 
woman pierce the cold night air as huge, eight-cylinder ``boats'' 
motor down the wet street, the heart of Baltimore's black 
entertainment strip. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Royal's bill that night: James Brown and his Orchestra.  
Sharing the stage: Sugar Pie DeSanto and The Famous Flames, and Six 
Beautiful Dancing Girls. But this is long before Brown was ``the 
hardest-working man in show business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is 1954, when Elmer Liepman's Smart Clothing sold two-tone  
wingtip shoes for $10 and charge accounts were personal, not 
plastic; when Maryland's license plates were a dull 
orange-and-black and women wore socks with high heels. 
</P>
<P>
	In an alley across the street, a television monitor shows the  
scene from a camera suspended on a crane high above the street. 
Director Barry Levinson points to a bit of blue neon in the upper 
left-hand corner. It's just a small piece, but it gives the 
illusion of the marquee of some grand hotel. A little trick of the 
trade; saves money and looks good. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a child marveling at his diorama of a Civil War  
battlefield, Levinson is impressed by the ``establishing shot'' for 
a scene in his new movie, ``Liberty Heights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't here,'' he says, sucking on a root beer barrel  
candy in the warmth of a 4-foot-high heat lamp. ``These poles 
aren't there, you know what I mean? Nothing. The hotel's not. 
Nothing that you see exists today. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make this Pennsylvania Avenue because Pennsylvania  
Avenue is really no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrienne Townes, an extra, stands in front of the theater in a  
beige beret, red heels and a tartan cloak. Big pearl and rhinestone 
earrings glitter from her lobes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother graduated from Douglas High School in 1954, and she  
used to tell me stories about the Royal Theater and going there and 
going to James Brown concerts and the women screaming, and how she 
used to look around in awe because she didn't see what this big 
thing was about this man,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``She passed away three years ago, and I feel like I'm living a  
part of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a part of Levinson's.  
</P>
<P>
	``Liberty Heights'' is the fourth in a series of  
semi-autobiographical movies he's made that have come to be known 
as ``the Baltimore films,'' for the city of his childhood, for the 
city of his dreams. As he did with ``Diner,'' ``Tin Men'' and 
``Avalon,'' the 56-year-old writer-director has left his home in 
Los Angeles to cannibalize his family and childhood friends for the 
stories and characters that come to life in his latest creation. 
</P>
<P>
	And with this new film, Levinson advances his work by  
confronting bigotry and anti-Semitism more directly than he has in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Disclosure,'' ``Bugsy,''  
``Young Sherlock Holmes,'' ``Wag the Dog'' or ``Rain Man,'' which 
won Levinson an Academy Award, the Baltimore films are not star 
vehicles that will gross hundreds of millions of dollars. They are 
heartwarming, character-driven, slice-of-life movies that glory in 
how ordinary people fit into extraordinary times. 
</P>
<P>
	They are made by a man who, in three decades of writing, acting  
and directing in television and film, has made a living at trusting 
his instincts -- and teaching others to trust them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only go by what I know and the stories I tell, and then  
you hope that you connect in some way,'' Levinson says. ``I mean, 
the rhythms, characters, the atmosphere ... 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where I'm the most comfortable for that kind of  
piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Heights is the former Jewish section of Baltimore, where  
Levinson grew up. To hear Levinson describe it, his life has been a 
series of fortunate accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson took it for granted that he'd follow his father into  
the appliance and carpet business, and he never set any clear 
ambitions for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I kind of blundered into various things along the  
way without any kind of real plan,'' says Levinson, clad all in 
black, his mane of gray hair topped by a Baltimore Ravens cap with 
the word ``Fight'' embroidered on the back. ``But I'd go with 
instincts that catch my eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson was not a remarkable student. He stayed up until all  
hours playing cards and hanging out at the Hill Top Diner. He was 
crowned fraternity king two years running at Forest Park High 
School because of his Ricky Nelson good looks and quiet James Dean 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry was just another of the guys who went out with as many  
girls as he possibly could -- trying to get as much off of them as 
he possibly could,'' says Richard Sher, a Baltimore TV newsman who 
hung out at the Hill Top. ``He wasn't a jock. All he was was 
cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sher was co-host of ``People Are Talking,'' a TV show that also  
featured Oprah Winfrey. It was easier to see potential in Winfrey 
than in Levinson, a guy who watched movies on television all night 
and sat around making sex noises into a tape recorder and calling 
it ``adult films for the blind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to say to me when I was working with Oprah, `Did  
you think Oprah was going to go on to do all of this?' I would say, 
`Sure,''' he says. ``But Barry? No. Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Saiontz, another diner rat who went on to become one of  
the city's most successful attorneys, says Levinson didn't appear 
to be serious about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry was so laid back, I used to wonder what he was ever  
going to do with his life,'' says Saiontz, whose experiences were 
the basis for ``... And Justice for All,'' an outrageous satire 
about the judicial system starring Al Pacino. ``I used to worry 
about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He needn't have, says mom Vi Levinson. Mrs. Levinson says her  
son always had his own way of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we moved to Liberty Heights he was, what, first grade I  
think, and I wanted to take him to school. And he's, `No way! No 
way!''' she says, breaking into a throaty chuckle. ``He went by 
himself -- and he found it! Got lost coming home but. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson was always quiet, preferring to sit back and watch  
(``The greatest observer I've ever come across,'' says Mom). But 
when he had something to say, he had the means to say it. 
</P>
<P>
	``One time Barry had to go into the hospital,'' she recalls.  
``He made a painting. I took one look at that painting, I almost 
died. ... You could tell what he was feeling. ... It was all in the 
picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After high school, Levinson enrolled in Baltimore Junior College  
but dropped out after five months. He sold cars and encyclopedias 
for a while, before Paul Newman's ``The Young Philadelphians'' gave 
him the idea that being a lawyer might be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	He cut classes and spent most of his time reading about radio,  
television and film. So he transferred to American University in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then, by accident, I got a job at the television station  
(WTOP in Washington) because a professor took a liking to me in a 
television course that I had,'' he says. ``There was a final and we 
had to do a show and at the last minute I ended up changing 
everything around to make it something completely different. And I 
think he liked the idea that I was willing to kind of gamble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After four years of learning rudimentary editing and watching a  
lot of late-night movies, Levinson gambled again. In 1967, at age 
25, he headed for Hollywood. His mother says he gave himself two 
years to succeed or come home. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson took some acting classes, where he hooked up with  
comedian Craig T. Nelson, who later starred in the TV series 
``Coach.'' They graduated from standup to TV's ``Lohman and Barkley 
Show,'' writing and performing such skits as ``The Lawyers and the 
Pigs'' -- which featured actors deadpanning legalese while holding 
pigs under their arms. 
</P>
<P>
	When his career was just starting to take off, Levinson passed  
up a chance to write for TV's No. 1 ``The Dean Martin Show'' and 
opted to work for ``The Carol Burnett Show,'' No. 19. It paid off. 
Martin was off the air within a year; Levinson went on to win two 
Emmy Awards with Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, it wasn't really gambling. Levinson was following his  
gut. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, Levinson graduated to film writing. He had a  
string of hits with funny man Mel Brooks before collaborating on 
``... And Justice for All'' with Valerie Curtin, who later became 
his first wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Saiontz says Levinson decided to become a director after writing  
1982's ``Best of Friends,'' Levinson's and Curtin's take on the 
union of his Baltimore Jewish background and her Boston upbringing. 
The settings were changed to northern Virginia and Buffalo, and 
none of the jokes between Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn worked the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson's directing debut came with ``Diner,'' the story of a  
bunch of guys who, in spite of their attempts to stay immature and 
irresponsible, learn that life is more than just eating gravy fries 
and trading stories of sexual conquests. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Mason, an old Baltimore buddy who was the inspiration for  
the character in ``Diner'' who was obsessed with music and could 
name the ``B'' side of any 45 record, says ``Diner'' first showed 
Levinson's genius at taking a throwaway memory and weaving it into 
a story that makes you laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being dumb, immature and silly, if you can get through that  
part of your life and move on and reflect back to that and grow out 
of that and yet remember that, what great memories!'' Mason says in 
the hyperbolic screech captured so well in ``Diner'' by actor 
Daniel Stern. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It's a cold November day on the set of ``Liberty Heights.'' Joe  
Mantegna, the biggest name in the ensemble cast for this $20 
million production, is wearing black long johns under his dapper 
blue, self-check silk suit. A drop of condensation clings to the 
tip of Levinson's nose as he watches the crew push-start one of the 
vintage automobiles for the umpteenth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things about doing a period movie -- cars don't  
start,'' he says, chewing on a stick of Juicy Fruit from a 
well-stocked bowl on the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The story is a year in the life of a Jewish family, the year  
Brown v. Board of Education forced the integration of public 
schools. It follows three members of the family and their social 
circles: father Nate (Mantegna), who runs a burlesque as a front 
for a numbers racket; his college-student son, Van (Adrien Brody); 
and his 17-year-old boy, Ben (Ben Foster). 
</P>
<P>
	Ben is based on Levinson's late cousin, Eddie, a wiseacre who  
once dressed up as Hitler for Halloween -- a scene played to great 
hilarity in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie has three parallel story lines. Ben falls in love with  
a black girl at school and finds everyone questioning his motives; 
Van and his buddies try to cross over into the WASP ``promised 
land'' and find it's not as glamorous and cool as they thought; 
Nate and his partners learn that while the law ignores gambling, it 
frowns on blacks and whites doing business together. 
</P>
<P>
	As with ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Levinson uses humor to deal  
with some very serious issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening scene, Ben and his friends are found ogling a  
bikini-clad girl through the fence at the Turkey Point Swim Club. 
But when they reach the gate, they're confronted with a sign that 
says, ``NO JEWS, DOGS OR COLOREDS ALLOWED.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BEN: ``How do you think they decided the order? ... That Jews  
should be first?'' 
</P>
<P>
	SHELDON: ``Yeah. I would have thought it would have been, `Dogs,  
Coloreds, Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BEN: ``That must have been some meeting to come up with that.  
Someone had to say, `No, I have to tell you, the Jews bother me 
more than the dogs.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson says what triggered the story was a review of his  
movie, ``Sphere,'' last year's science-fiction thriller that 
starred Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman 
played a psychologist, but a critic somehow decided that Hoffman 
was playing a ``Jewish psychologist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie `Sphere' has nothing to do with religion and faith  
or anything, so why would you say that?'' he says, the incredulity 
still ringing in his voice. ``And all of a sudden, it very quickly 
made sense to me in terms of what I could do for one of the 
Baltimore stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message of the film is clear -- but subtle.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I love about Barry's script is the fact that without  
hitting people over the head, without proselytizing, he's dealing 
with two major, major issues of the time -- one being anti-Semitism 
and one being racism,'' says actor Richard Kline, a Levinson friend 
who plays Nate's partner, Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
	The film begins and ends with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New  
Year, and the time when the new Cadillac always hit the showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Levinson got the idea after speaking with one of his father's  
friends at Irv Levinson's funeral in 1990. Irv Levinson would get a 
new Caddy every two years, and the friend said he would always 
sneak out of services to check out the new model. 
</P>
<P>
	The script flows like buttermilk, dense and tangy. But Levinson  
hardly takes any credit. He says he just follows the characters 
where they lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think of myself as less of a writer and more of like  
I'm taking dictation. Because the characters, once they come alive 
in my head, they're just carrying on conversations, and I'm just 
trying to keep up with them,'' he says between shots. 
</P>
<P>
	As with ``Diner,'' Levinson took just three weeks to write the  
script for ``Liberty Heights.'' And unlike many directors, Levinson 
knows exactly what he wants by the time he gets to the set. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem you run into is you end up overproducing for  
someone who doesn't know exactly what they want to do,'' says 
executive producer Patrick McCormick, who is working with Levinson 
for the first time. ``(Levinson) doesn't spin a lot of wheels. He 
doesn't overprepare or make people crazy getting things ready that 
then become irrelevant or unused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean the script is a sacred scroll. After a  
scripted scene is over, Levinson will often allow improvisation 
among the actors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't rule with an iron hand,'' says Vince Guastaferro,  
who plays Nate's buddy and numbers partner, Pete. ``He gives the 
actors freedom with the dialogue. He gives us freedom with our 
characters. He even gives us some freedom with the actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the actors are very conscious that this is a piece of  
Levinson's life -- and they respect that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the artist; we're the paint,'' says Charlie Scalies  
(Nate's friend, Louie). ``He tells us, `Be green and go there,' so 
we be green and go there. Then he wants us to be red and go there, 
and that's what we do. That's our job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to be paint.''  
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to trust Levinson, says Mantegna, who compares  
Levinson to another great Baltimore writer -- Edgar Allen Poe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter Falk once told me, `Always treasure the great directors,  
because they'll never hurt you,''' Mantegna says. ``And he's one of 
them.''

<HEADLINE> America Online Profits Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings for America Online  
Inc. nearly quadrupled as the nation's largest online service 
handily beat Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said Wednesday that it earned $121 million, or 22 cents per  
share, compared with $33 million, or 6 cents per share, for the 
same quarter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was up 62 percent to $960 million, compared with $592  
million last year. In the three-month period ended Dec. 31, AOL 
added 1.6 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The net earnings figures include an accounting adjustment that  
allowed the company to deduct past losses from its tax bill, which 
raised net income. 
</P>
<P>
	Not including the adjustment, AOL earned $88 million, or 17  
cents per share. That was well above expectations of analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. who had predicted AOL would earn 14 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, which has more than 15 million subscribers, plus 2 million  
with its subsidiary CompuServe, is planning to buy Netscape 
Communications Corp. for $4.2 billion in a deal expected to close 
this spring. The Netscape browser site draws 20 million visitors 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1998, the Internet truly came of age and became even more  
integral to people's everyday lives,'' said Steve Case, chairman 
and chief executive officer. ``We're excited about the 
opportunities presented by our pending combination with Netscape as 
well as our alliance with Sun Microsystems to drive the growth of 
this new medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the company launched AOL in Australia in a  
joint venture with Bertelsmann AG and announced a joint venture 
with the Cisneros Group to develop and market AOL services for 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from customers' online fees grew 61 percent to $779  
million. Revenues from advertising and online transactions rose 66 
percent to $181 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended Dec. 31, earnings rose 356 percent to  
$228 million, or 41 cents per share, from $64 million, or 13 cents 
per share, in the last half of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Wednesday a 2-for-1 stock split to  
take effect on Feb. 22. It is the sixth split since the company 
went public in March 1992. The most recent split was Nov. 17.

<HEADLINE>  Fourth IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A fourth IOC member implicated in the Salt  
Lake City bribery scandal resigned Wednesday, three days after he 
was accused of accepting payments arranged by the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Charles Mukora, one of six IOC members facing expulsion,  
proclaimed his innocence even as he quit. David Sibandze of 
Swaziland, Libya's Bashir Mohammed Attarabulsi and Finland's Pirjo 
Haeggman had previously quit, and five others have been essentially 
ousted pending a formal IOC vote in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora, 64, denied receiving any money personally. The IOC said  
he received $34,650, but Mukora said the cash was for ``sports 
development in Kenya'' and ``world youth sporting activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been party to any improper dealings in the last  
40 years I have been involved as a volunteer in Kenyan sports and 
sports management or as an IOC member,'' said Mukora, an IOC member 
since 1990. ``The monies that I am alleged to have received as 
regards to Salt Lake City were monies paid towards the 
establishment of high altitude training camps in Nanyuki, and I 
have not used the monies for my personal use or personal purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest. I have decided therefore to accept his advice 
on principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The others facing expulsion are Lamine Keita of Mali,  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed 
Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador and Sergio 
Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said Wednesday he did nothing wrong and will not  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to resign as a member of the IOC,'' Santander,  
who also is president of the Chilean Olympic Committee, said. 
``There are no cowards in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands received a warning and  
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea 
and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``complimented Mr.  
Mukora for taking the honorable path'' and called for others ``to 
follow Mr. Mukora's lead and tender their resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation concluded Keita ``knowingly permitted''  
Salt Lake City bidders to make payments totaling more than $97,000 
from 1993-97 to support his son at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fighter by nature, not someone who resigns,'' Keita was  
quoted as telling the Swiss daily Le Matin. ``I'm going to defend 
myself. The statutes give us the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze, who resigned Friday, said he believed there was  
nothing wrong with his son receiving $100,000 in scholarships and 
living expenses from the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities in the United States give scholarships all the  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze told a news conference that he also received numerous  
gifts, including paintings and sculptures, from the Salt Lake City 
Olympic Committee while it was wooing IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he knew there was a $150 limit on the total amount  
of gifts an IOC member could receive from a city, but added: ``I 
never asked about the value of a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not my intent to let the IOC expel me,'' Sibandze said.  
``That's the manner in which the IOC has approached these problems. 
I resigned in the interests of my country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov maintained his innocence and said the scandal stemmed  
from increased commercialization of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more money is involved in big sports, the bigger is the  
temptation to touch them,'' the 63-year-old Russian said in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was asked by the  
investigators to explain his request for free medical treatment for 
former Soviet hockey star Alexander Ragulin and his receipt of a 
Browning rifle from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the IOC member from Ecuador facing expulsion, denied  
accepting bribes. He told the newspaper El Comercio it would be 
``cowardly'' to resign and it would be an ``admission that I had 
done something of which I am innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Officials in Turin, Italy, and Zakopane, Poland, both trying to  
win the 2006 Winter Games, oppose the rule changes in bidding for 
future sites. The IOC recommends a ban on visits by IOC members and 
wants a 15-member panel to choose the host. The Turin and Zakopane 
groups say this puts first-time bidders at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 2004 Athens Summer Games said staging the  
Olympics permanently in Greece as a scandal-stopping move ``isn't 
the answer. Constantine Bakouris, managing director of the 2004 
Games, said it would be ``very difficult to deprive the other 
countries of organizing'' the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Federal investigators scrutinizing the scandal are searching  
for evidence to bring a case in which both bribers and recipients 
could be charged, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors and agents are looking at mail and wire  
fraud and conspiracy statutes and a racketeering law to prosecute 
what they initially see as a case of commercial bribery, rather 
than the more familiar government variety, according to Justice 
Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal inquiry is in a very early stage -- months from key  
decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. A Utah ethics panel also is not close to wrapping up its 
investigation, which has a self-imposed deadline of Feb. 11.

<HEADLINE> Fourth IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A Kenyan implicated in the Salt Lake City  
bribery scandal today became the fourth International Olympic 
Committee member to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Mukora said he resigned ``on principle.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest,'' Mukora said. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee on Sunday named Mukora as  
one of nine IOC members who received an under-the-table payment 
from Salt Lake City when it bid to host the Winter Olympics in the 
year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Mukora, who is a wealthy man in his own right,  
received $34,650. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lausanne-based organization recommended he resign before  
being ousted at an IOC board meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora had told the IOC panel the payments were made in support  
of ``sports development in Kenya'' and for ``world youth sporting 
activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the IOC concluded that Mukora accepted the payment for ``his  
personal benefit'' and should be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other members resigned last week in the scandal.  
</P>
<P>
	Mukora, an IOC member since 1990, has been chairman of the Kenya  
Olympics Association and first vice chairman of the Commonwealth 
Games Federation.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Ethics Panel Hard at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As a Feb. 11 deadline approaches, the  
ethics panel examining Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games isn't even hinting it's close to wrapping up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do it as promptly as we can, but we just haven't  
got it completed yet,'' the panel's chairman, Gordon Hall, said 
Wednesday. ``We're still working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said he could not predict when the results of the ongoing  
investigation would be turned over to the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee, whose chairman has promised decisive action against any 
board members found culpable for excesses in Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those from the Salt Lake bid committee became part of  
the organizing committee after the International Olympic Committee 
awarded Salt Lake City the games in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just a matter of writing the panel's report, Hall said.  
``We have been writing from the beginning. We've been documenting 
everything we've been doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, a former chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court, is  
joined on the panel by former U.S. Attorney David Jordan, two 
professors and an accountant skilled in investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC began the inquiry Dec. 18 and imposed the Feb. 11 deadline  
on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Revelations by SLOC's outside attorneys, including cash payments  
of more than $70,000, already have prompted a housecleaning at the 
committee's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 8, senior vice president David Johnson resigned and two  
senior vice presidents were put on administrative leave pending 
completion of the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day, former bid and organizing committee president Tom  
Welch was stripped of his $10,000-a-month consulting contract and

the lavish spending, resigned to give the games a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	An International Olympic Committee investigation released Sunday  
found Salt Lake's bid committee spent nearly $800,000 on 14 IOC 
members, including travel expenses, scholarships for their 
children, medical care and cash payments in the years leading up to 
the 1995 vote making Salt Lake an Olympic host city. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC on Sunday ousted six members, including one who alone  
received $216,000 from Salt Lake, warned another, and said it 
continues to investigate three others. Another four have resigned, 
and one died last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ousted can appeal for reinstatement at an IOC meeting  
March 17-18, although they are almost certain to be denied.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Condemns Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Winding up his six-day journey to the Americas,  
Pope John Paul II condemned capital punishment Wednesday in some of 
the strongest terms yet and told the United States that with power 
comes moral responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radical changes in world politics leave America with a  
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of 
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he said at a 
prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica attended by 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Power is ``service, not privilege. Its exercise is morally  
justifiable when it is used for the good of all, when it is 
sensitive to the needs of the poor and defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, he urged 100,000 worshippers at a Mass in  
this death-penalty state to spare even those who have ``done great 
evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform,'' he said at 
the Trans World Dome, addressing the biggest crowd of his 30-hour 
visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a  
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and 
unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message may have had particular relevance in Missouri, where  
the state Supreme Court, without explanation, postponed an 
execution that was to have taken place while the pope was in town. 
Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls called the delay ``a 
mockery.'' On Jan. 13, a killer was executed by injection in 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, making his fifth trip to the U.S. mainland, also  
called on his flock to end racism. Racism is ``a plague which your 
bishops have called one of the most persistent and destructive 
evils of the nation,'' the stooped, 78-year-old pontiff said, his 
voice hoarse and his words slurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, he met briefly with 85-year-old civil rights  
pioneer Rosa Parks, the black seamstress whose refusal to give up 
her seat on a segregated bus in 1955 led to the Montgomery, Ala., 
bus boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul was also scheduled to meet with Vice President Al Gore  
before leaving for Rome on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	During the evening prayer service, the pope welcomed Muslims and  
Jews who joined him in the Romanesque cathedral that houses the 
world's largest collection of mosaics. For the first time, a rabbi, 
Robert P. Jacobs, participated in a Roman Catholic papal prayer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this prayer signify our shared commitment to ever greater  
understanding and cooperation,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Trans World Dome, the faithful came for blessings, cures  
or just a glimpse of the man credited with hastening the fall of 
Communism and lessening religious restrictions in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people filled the seats of the football  
stadium and an adjacent convention center, where the pope's image 
was projected on giant TV screens with running captions of his 
homily. One thousand priests celebrated the Mass with the pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Ida Costa, a cancer-stricken 77-year-old woman from Little Rock,  
Ark., looked for a miracle cure from the pope: ``I'll get the 
blessings God wants to shower upon me in his presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Mary DeLonais of Springfield, Ill., was a forest ranger  
when she saw the pope in Denver in 1993. ``Part of the pope's final 
blessing was a prayer for vocations,'' she recalled. She has since 
become a nun. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's condemnation of the death penalty brought mixed  
reactions from those at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I guess we've all got a right to live, but I  
don't know, especially when they take someone else's life,'' said 
William Walker of Alton, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic, it's easy to be against abortion,'' said  
Douglas Marshall of St. Louis. But as for sparing the life of an 
evil person, ``that's the thing. It all boils down to a matter of 
forgiveness. Are you willing to forgive an evil person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope arrived in St. Louis on Tuesday after five triumphant  
days in Mexico. He met with President Clinton and attended a youth 
rally where he got rock-star treatment from the crowd of 20,000. 
His message: that Americans should use their freedoms responsibly 
and strive for a higher moral standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting for the pope to go back and start his  
pilgrimage in Mexico, to close the gap between Mexico and the 
United States,'' Rosalia Vazquez, 21, said in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE>  Fourth IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A fourth IOC member implicated in the Salt  
Lake City bribery scandal resigned Wednesday, three days after he 
was accused of accepting payments arranged by the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Charles Mukora, one of six IOC members facing expulsion,  
proclaimed his innocence even as he quit. David Sibandze of 
Swaziland, Libya's Bashir Mohammed Attarabulsi and Finland's Pirjo 
Haeggman had previously quit, and five others have been essentially 
ousted pending a formal IOC vote in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora, 64, denied receiving any money personally. The IOC said  
he received $34,650, but Mukora said the cash was for ``sports 
development in Kenya'' and ``world youth sporting activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been party to any improper dealings in the last  
40 years I have been involved as a volunteer in Kenyan sports and 
sports management or as an IOC member,'' said Mukora, an IOC member 
since 1990. ``The monies that I am alleged to have received as 
regards to Salt Lake City were monies paid towards the 
establishment of high altitude training camps in Nanyuki, and I 
have not used the monies for my personal use or personal purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest. I have decided therefore to accept his advice 
on principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The others facing expulsion are Lamine Keita of Mali,  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed 
Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador and Sergio 
Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said Wednesday he did nothing wrong and will not  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to resign as a member of the IOC,'' Santander,  
who also is president of the Chilean Olympic Committee, said. 
``There are no cowards in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands received a warning and  
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea 
and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``complimented Mr.  
Mukora for taking the honorable path'' and called for others ``to 
follow Mr. Mukora's lead and tender their resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation concluded Keita ``knowingly permitted''  
Salt Lake City bidders to make payments totaling more than $97,000 
from 1993-97 to support his son at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fighter by nature, not someone who resigns,'' Keita was  
quoted as telling the Swiss daily Le Matin. ``I'm going to defend 
myself. The statutes give us the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze, who resigned Friday, said he believed there was  
nothing wrong with his son receiving $100,000 in scholarships and 
living expenses from the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities in the United States give scholarships all the  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze told a news conference that he also received numerous  
gifts, including paintings and sculptures, from the Salt Lake City 
Olympic Committee while it was wooing IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he knew there was a $150 limit on the total amount  
of gifts an IOC member could receive from a city, but added: ``I 
never asked about the value of a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not my intent to let the IOC expel me,'' Sibandze said.  
``That's the manner in which the IOC has approached these problems. 
I resigned in the interests of my country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov maintained his innocence and said the scandal stemmed  
from increased commercialization of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more money is involved in big sports, the bigger is the  
temptation to touch them,'' the 63-year-old Russian said in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was asked by the  
investigators to explain his request for free medical treatment for 
former Soviet hockey star Alexander Ragulin and his receipt of a 
Browning rifle from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the IOC member from Ecuador facing expulsion, denied  
accepting bribes. He told the newspaper El Comercio it would be 
``cowardly'' to resign and it would be an ``admission that I had 
done something of which I am innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Officials in Turin, Italy, and Zakopane, Poland, both trying to  
win the 2006 Winter Games, oppose the rule changes in bidding for 
future sites. The IOC recommends a ban on visits by IOC members and 
wants a 15-member panel to choose the host. The Turin and Zakopane 
groups say this puts first-time bidders at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 2004 Athens Summer Games said staging the  
Olympics permanently in Greece as a scandal-stopping move ``isn't 
the answer. Constantine Bakouris, managing director of the 2004 
Games, said it would be ``very difficult to deprive the other 
countries of organizing'' the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Federal investigators scrutinizing the scandal are searching  
for evidence to bring a case in which both bribers and recipients 
could be charged, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors and agents are looking at mail and wire  
fraud and conspiracy statutes and a racketeering law to prosecute 
what they initially see as a case of commercial bribery, rather 
than the more familiar government variety, according to Justice 
Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal inquiry is in a very early stage -- months from key  
decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. A Utah ethics panel also is not close to wrapping up its 
investigation, which has a self-imposed deadline of Feb. 11.

	On Jan. 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73  
seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, killing all seven crew 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1547, England's King Henry VIII died; he was succeeded by his  
9-year-old son, Edward VI. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1596, English navigator Sir Francis Drake died off the coast  
of Panama; he was buried at sea.

<P>
	In 1902, the Carnegie Institute was established in Washington  
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1909, the United States ended direct control over Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1915, the Coast Guard was created by an act of Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1916, Louis D. Brandeis was appointed by President Wilson to  
the Supreme Court, becoming its first Jewish member. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, during World War II, Allied supplies began reaching  
China over the newly reopened Burma Road. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, six U.S. diplomats who had avoided being taken hostage  
at their embassy in Tehran flew out of Iran with the help of 
Canadian diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Italian anti-terrorism forces rescued U.S. Brig. Gen.  
James L. Dozier, 42 days after he had been kidnapped by the Red 
Brigades. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: In Hungary, official Imre Pozsgay described the  
1956 Hungarian Revolution as a popular uprising -- a startling 
contradiction of the official Communist view that the revolt was a 
counter-revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: In Los Angeles, Superior Court Judge Stanley  
Weisberg declared a mistrial in the case of Lyle Menendez, just 
over two weeks after a mistrial was declared in the case of Lyle's

guilty of murder in the shooting deaths of their wealthy parents. 
They were later retried, convicted of murder and sentenced to life 
in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: The day after his State of the Union address,  
President Clinton barnstormed in the nation's heartland, where he

<HEADLINE> 'Cheap' Calls May Not Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alexander Korogodsky of Scotch Plains, N.J.,  
saw an ad promising deeply discounted long-distance rates if he 
dialed a string of numbers before making a call. Instead, he was 
billed $2.35 for a one-minute call from his home to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The total bill for three months of calls came to $720.12. ``My  
wife said, `Did they forget to put a period in the right place?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Korogodsky wasn't charged the low rate promised by  
``dial-around'' service 10-321, now 10-10-321, operated by Telecom 
USA, a subsidiary of MCI WorldCom. Instead, a technical glitch 
caused his dial-around call to be billed at MCI's highest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the problem that affected many others as well was a  
fluke, Korogodsy's experience illustrates the confusion some people 
endure when they turn to dial-around services to save money. 
Korogodsky spent days trying to reach Telecom USA to fix the 
charges, which he paid in full. Nearly a year later, he's still 
waiting for MCI to reimburse him. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a growing number of complaints, the Federal  
Communications Commission is looking into how such dial-around 
services are advertised and whether consumers get enough 
information about rates, restrictions and where to call with a 
billing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should not get the runaround on dial-around,'' said  
FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is checking into three areas, according to officials  
who spoke on condition of anonymity: 
</P>
<P>
	--Whether consumers realize that some services charge monthly  
fees, per-call fees or have minimum talk times; 
</P>
<P>
	--Confusion over the discount: for instance, 20 percent cheaper  
compared with what price? 
</P>
<P>
	--Difficulty contacting the company with problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Two big marketers of dial-around services -- MCI and AT&AMP;T -- say  
their ads are clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some criticism, but I will let our ads stand on  
their own,'' said Howard McNally, president of AT&AMP;T's Lucky Dog 
Phone Co., which runs 10-10-345. ``If you look at our TV 
advertising, look at our direct mail, we think our pricing is very, 
very clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other companies, MCI and AT&AMP;T purposefully keep their  
corporate names out of dial-around ads. That's done to create a 
separate brand identity for a service that targets customers 
looking for a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	But that means consumers should do their homework, calculating  
the math and reading the fine print -- even if it's just flashed at 
the bottom of a TV ad, said Samuel Simon of the Telecommunications 
Research &AMP; Action Center, which monitors phone rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's already a huge amount of consumer confusion out there  
about getting the best deal for phone service -- and ads for 
dial-around services have added to that,'' Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers need not switch from their current long-distance carrier  
to use a dial-around. They can just dial a seven-digit access code. 
The charges from the dial-around company usually show up on the 
customer's regular phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Navdeep Singh of Dallas said he's sworn off all dial-arounds  
after a problem with 10-10-297. Singh says he was promised one rate 
in writing, and was charged another. Although the overcharge only 
amounted to about $15 for three months, the aggravation of trying 
to get the problem fixed drove him to complain to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial-around is small but growing: It's projected to be a $3  
billion business by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard says he finds ``particularly galling'' an ad saying a  
consumer can make a 20-minute call for 99 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	That ad is for MCI's 10-10-220 service. One newspaper ad says:  
``Time can be expensive.'' It says a 20-minute cab ride costs $19 
and a 20-minute tanning session costs $20. ``Or, time can be 
cheap,'' the ads says, showing a telephone with the message 
``20-minute phone call 99 cents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said, ``Consumers know that's 5 cents a minute and  
that's a pretty good rate.'' But if the consumer is on the phone 
for less than 20 minutes, they still must pay the full amount, 
Kennard notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad does say: ``only 99 cents for all calls up to 20  
minutes,'' but Kennard doesn't think it's clear enough. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI's Burns defends the ads, saying they're clear. More than 85  
percent of MCI's dial-around users are repeat customers, he notes. 
The typical call on 10-10-220 lasts 15 minutes, he says, making the 
per-minute charge 6.6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a TV ad for AT&AMP;T's 10-10-345, viewers are told: ``It's always  
10 cents a minute.'' But small print that quickly disappears says 
there's a 10-cent connection charge. That means the first minute is 
20 cents.

<HEADLINE> 5 Questions with Rachael Leigh Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's 1999. Online shopping is the ultimate mall.  
Computers have replaced typewriters. And yet, some things never 
change. ... Like high school. 
</P>
<P>
	So baby boomers and their children can relate to ``She's All  
That,'' a new romantic comedy set in a trendy Los Angeles high 
school. The film is the feature film debut of Robert Iscove, the 
Emmy-nominated director of ``Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein's Cinderella.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh sure, backpacks have replaced book bags. And kids tote  
beepers and cell phones. But the class president still rules. 
Cheerleaders and star athletes are at the top of the social pecking 
order. Your status is defined by the car you drive, the person you 
date and the people you hang out with at school. 
</P>
<P>
	And the senior prom is THE event of the year.  
</P>
<P>
	So when class president Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is dumped by  
his social-climbing girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), he makes 
a bet with his best friend that any girl on his arm will be voted 
prom queen. 
</P>
<P>
	Any girl in the school? Is this guy's ego big enough?  
</P>
<P>
	His friend picks Laney Boggs, whose father (Kevin Pollak) drives  
a pickup truck and cleans swimming pools. She helps with expenses 
by working part-time at a cheesy fast-food restaurant. The kids she 
hangs out aren't part of the most popular crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Laney has her sights set on an art scholarship and college.  
</P>
<P>
	And she's not about to let anything or anyone -- including the  
mega-popular Zack -- distract her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of surprises her more than anything when Zack comes up  
and he wants to talk to her,'' says Rachael Leigh Cook, who plays 
Laney. ``Her attitude is like 'What is wrong with you? Are you 
stupid?' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kinda funny.''  
</P>
<P>
	From her character's perspective, Prinze is the loser, lost in a  
world of parental expectations, superficiality and trendiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you meet Freddie, you will not realize what a feat of  
acting this was for him. Because he's just the nicest guy you will 
ever meet in your entire life,'' Cook says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook and Prinze met during the filming of ``The House of Yes,''  
a dark comedy about a family obsessed with the JFK assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never had any scenes together but I had little parts  
opening and closing the film. Freddie is great in it. He's so 
funny,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, 19, grew up in Minneapolis, where she worked as a print  
model. She moved to Los Angeles about three years ago. She stars in 
the upcoming films, ``The Hi-Line'' and ``The Bumblebee Flies 
Anyway'' with Elijah Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	As for life in Los Angeles, ``I read a lot of scripts, I go on a  
lot of auditions, and I meet people and whatnot. It's not all that 
glamorous and everything. The truth is, it's kind of hard to find 
your way around, it's kind of hard to meet people. It's OK. You 
can't beat the weather. I miss Minnesota, I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. What attracted you to ``She's All That''?  
</P>
<P>
	Cook: I think people were marketing a lot of the whole 'Scream'  
idea. And I had a stack of scripts 'this high' of just carnage and 
cheerleaders. And when I got this script, it was just like, this is 
a nice movie, this is a good movie, I feel good. I'm going to read 
this script again. 
</P>
<P>
	2. How would you describe the film?  
</P>
<P>
	Cook (laughing): It's your classic 'boy meets girl, girl hates  
boy, boy loses girl, girl reprimands boy for everything he ever did 
and said, boy and girl get back together' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Did you go to high school or professional children's school?  
</P>
<P>
	Cook: I went to high school until my freshman year. And then  
things got pretty confusing. I had tutors who would have to 
coordinate all my work with the school. But I got a diploma. It was 
hard, but I got a diploma. That's why this movie was so funny. It 
was like everything that I missed in high school, like the cliques, 
the sports teams playing and the prom, and all this stuff, it was 
just my total vicarious high school experience. It was great. It 
was funny. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How did you pick your film roles?  
</P>
<P>
	Cook: Actors have like a hundred different ways of choosing  
which projects they want to do. But ... the ones I want are the 
ones where I can just read it, I can so clearly just see myself 
saying these lines. I read them on the page and I can hear my voice 
in my head and how I would say them. At that point, it's like, 'I 
have to do this. You might think that there is someone else you 
might want for this role, but you don't understand, because I'm 
going to do this.' I can just hear these characters in my head. 
</P>
<P>
	4 1/2. And what about ``She's All That''?  
</P>
<P>
	Cook: I think it was more just the language of the film. It's so  
funny, it's just hilarious, I mean, I read it late at night, I was 
just like laughing out loud. And I couldn't remember the last time 
I've read a script and I was like actually by myself laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	5. You get the feeling that Laney could take or leave Zack, that  
she is going to be successful in her own life with or without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook: I'm glad you say that because sometimes people will say  
'Well, here you play kind of a loser in the film.' And I just get 
so mad! Like absolutely not! They're sorry they asked. It's so 
wrong!

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Said to Divert Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A minister who was supposed to get $35,000  
two years ago to rebuild his burned church says he never got a dime 
until last week, when the trial of the man accused of stealing the 
money began to heat up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Willie Coleman said his church secretary received a  
$10,000 check from the National Baptist Convention USA last week, 
days before testimony was scheduled in the trial of the Rev. Henry 
Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, president of the powerful black church organization, is  
accused of stealing $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of 
B'nai B'rith intended to rebuild burned black churches in the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman's Rising Star Baptist Church in Greensboro, Ala., had  
burned to the ground in June 1996, but since has been rebuilt 
``bigger and better'' with insurance money and other donations, he 
testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could have got (the missing money), we could have used  
it. But we didn't get it,'' said another minister, the Rev. Arthur 
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Coleman, pastor of Mount Zora Baptist Church in Eutaw,  
Ala., said his church already had been rebuilt when he attended a 
1996 ADL meeting in New York where Lyons accepted a $225,000 check 
to rebuild burned churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We immediately determined where these funds should go and the  
wheels that are squeaking the loudest at this point in time, we 
will give the funds to those churches,'' Lyons said in a videotape 
of the meeting shown to jurors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Lyons instead deposited $60,000 into a personal  
savings account, gave $12,000 to his wife, sent money to love 
interests in Tennessee and Indiana and spent part of the money to 
redecorate his house and pay off credit card bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons later sent a letter to the ADL saying he'd given $35,000  
each to six churches, including the two headed by the Colemans, 
testified Mark Medin, the ADL's director of national leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Lyons asked for more funds to help other  
churches. The ADL forwarded him another check for $19,500, Medin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, prosecutors say Lyons actually had distributed less  
than $40,000 to burned churches -- $10,000 each to three churches 
and $3,000 each to their pastors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Medin admitted the ADL had given Lyons  
no timeline or instructions for distributing the money and Lyons 
did return the funds when the ADL asked him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with codefendant Bernice Edwards of  
racketeering, accused of diverting more than $4 million from 
corporations seeking to do business with the convention to finance 
their own lavish lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a similar trial this spring on 54 federal charges of  
bank fraud, wire fraud, extortion and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> NBC Scores Weekly Ratings Victory / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Who needs Michael Jordan? NBC has just scored  
its highest weekly Nielsen Media Research ratings since last June, 
when it was broadcasting Jordan's swan song in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Golden Globe Awards show and the countdown to  
George Clooney's departure from ``ER'' led NBC to a 10.4 rating and 
17 share, Nielsen said Tuesday. CBS was a distant second with an 
8.8 rating and 14 share. ABC, with a 6.8 and 11, and Fox, with a 
6.7 and 11, both struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was easily the week's most-watched show, solidifying its  
lead over ``Friends'' in the competition for the season's 
top-ranked series. NBC is promoting Clooney's upcoming exit, 
expected during next month's ratings ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's Golden Globes telecast had a 16.1 rating, its best ever  
and a pleasant surprise for NBC, which has broadcast the show for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's previous record was 15.9, achieved last year and in  
1981 on CBS. Last year's telecast was buoyed by interest in 
``Titanic,'' and NBC executives had anticipated the ratings would 
slip this year. Instead, the awards show is becoming a major stop 
on the way to the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of ``Monday Night Football'' on ABC is setting up a  
strong battle for viewers. CBS's comedies ``Everybody Loves 
Raymond'' and ``Becker'' both scored top 10 Nielsen finishes last 
week, and so did their Fox competition, ``Ally McBeal.'' ABC's 
rating last week was well below its season average. 
</P>
<P>
	The developing networks were helped by showing entertainment  
programs during President Clinton's State of the Union address. The 
WB had a 3.6 rating and 6, UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share and Pax 
TV was at 0.8 and 1. All were above their season averages. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' tied in  
the evening news competition with 8.6 ratings and 16 shares. The 
``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.8 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 18-24, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 21.3; ``Friends,'' NBC, 16.8; 
``Frasier,'' 16.5; ``Golden Globe Awards,'' NBC, 16.1; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 14.4; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.2; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 
13.5; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.5; ``Becker,'' CBS, 
11.2; ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 11.1.

<HEADLINE> That's Entertainment! That's Life! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``The phenomenon of a Richard Simmons fascinates  
me. What other culture would anoint a diet guru who's fat? He's 
this fat little guy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like it matters. Neal Gabler knows full well why America  
embraces clownish, roly-poly Simmons: He's entertaining. As he 
would have to be. In a nation bathed in hot and cold running 
entertainment, why would any of us waste time on someone who 
doesn't amuse us? 
</P>
<P>
	But it goes a little further. Gabler says our entertainment  
whirlpool has taken us beyond passive audience state, and absorbed 
us into the act. ``Life has become art,'' he declares, ``so that 
the two are now indistinguishable from each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happens when all of us Tickle Me Elmos start tickling back?  
Gabler explores such questions in his new book ``Life the Movie,'' 
subtitled ``How Entertainment Conquered Reality. Starring 
Everyone.'' (Rolling! Action! Welcome to the world of 
post-reality!) 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment drives the economy,'' Gabler says. ``But while I  
mean conventional entertainment, I'm also talking about the way we 
want to perform in our own lives, so that we buy clothes, we buy a 
car, we live in a house, and we use a certain toothpaste, all of 
which contribute to the image that we want to project as 
entertainers performing our own lives for the audience of others -- 
and ourselves, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it's one for the money, two for the show, and -- uh-uh, honey  
-- don't step on my Air Jordans! 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm no prophet of doom,'' says Gabler, a dapper man with a  
salt-and-pepper beard who authored the splendid Walter Winchell 
biography ``Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity.'' Talking 
about his new book, he speaks in thoughtful pauses and animated 
bursts. And he radiates unapologetic good cheer. ``I don't say, 
`Entertainment debases us and destroys our cultural values.' I love 
entertainment!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, expect no happy ending in ``Life the Movie.'' Nor, for  
that matter, any quick fix for the problems that crop up in a 
society when reason is upstaged by sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment mentality demands that at the end you give the  
answer,'' Gabler says with a knowing smile. ``My book does not 
fulfill that expectation. Because, to my mind, the answer is too 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then why read it?  
</P>
<P>
	``I do think that this is a culture where people want to  
understand their own obsessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A cultural historian, Gabler has the presence of mind to look  
back. By doing so, he upends some popular assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, he disputes the notion that television is to  
blame for all of society's ills. TV, he says, ``is a subset of the 
larger entertainment revolution, not the cause of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the Internet is simply another technology like  
television, radio or movies that will be driven to satisfy, first 
and foremost, our entertainment lust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about that common complaint that the business of  
news-gathering has somehow shamed itself in the age of O.J. 
Simpson, Princess Diana, Monica-and-Bill and other real-life 
melodramas? Not so. Entertainment hasn't compromised journalism, 
Gabler argues. It was journalism that pioneered mass entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	News as we think of it today didn't exist before the 1830s and  
the ``penny press'' papers. ``They purveyed news for its 
entertainment value,'' Gabler says. ``That's what they were all 
about.'' By such reckoning, it's The National Enquirer, not The New 
York Times, that follows in the footsteps of the Fourth Estate's 
founders. 
</P>
<P>
	But here's perhaps the book's biggest insight. Despite the  
outcry of parents and busybody virtuecrats, TV series like ``South 
Park'' and ``Jerry Springer'' don't inevitably trigger moral 
decline and national decay. 
</P>
<P>
	On the contrary, says Gabler, viewer support of rude, crude and  
lowbrow entertainment is not only as American as apple pie, it is 
pie in the face of its harshest detractors -- a democratic Bronx 
cheer aimed at society's bluenoses; an ongoing declaration of 
independence against Old World-brand stuffed shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most critics would say entertainment culture is `default  
culture' for the mentally impaired,'' Gabler notes. ``They would 
say that's why we like television, rock music and trashy novels -- 
because we're dumb! 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm saying we like these things BECAUSE they're  
anti-cultural, that the entertainment culture was devised 
deliberately as a way of challenging high culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So take that, Alexis de Tocqueville and Bill Bennett! We love  
``Beavis and Butt-head''! (Are we having fun yet?) 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`CUPID': TV reviewers often hate what they see, and say so. But  
not always. New York Post critic Michele Greppi absolutely loves 
``Cupid.'' She loves this low-rated ABC comedy-drama so much, she 
had a contest and invited its winners to a viewing party. She 
reports that her 18 guests loved the show, and promised to go forth 
and multiply -- recruiting their friends to watch ``Cupid,'' too, 
when it airs Thursday at 9 p.m. EST. ``Cupid'' is about Trevor 
Hale, who presents himself as the Roman god of love when he turns 
up in a Chicago mental ward. Dr. Clair Allen, a renowned 
psychologist and relationship expert, is sure he's a self-deluded 
fraud. But is he? Meanwhile, Hale insists he has been expelled from 
Mount Olympus and must bring together 100 couples before he can go 
home. Starring Jeremy Piven, the show is a mystery (is this guy a 
nut case or the supernatural real deal?), as well as a showcase for 
fascinating ruminations on the nature of love and companionship. 
It's a show to watch, fall in love with, and tell your friends 
about. And since it's sitting at the bottom of the ratings, there's 
no time to waste.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks' Sprewell Cheered in Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The greeting for Spree was one of unabashed  
glee. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell received a roar of approval in pregame  
introductions at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night as he 
prepared to play his first game in almost 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	If the fans haven't forgiven him for his attack on Golden State  
coach P.J. Carlesimo, they didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, introduced fourth among the Knicks' five starters,  
received the warmest response of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there were more boos for Patrick Ewing, the president  
of the players' union, than there were for the league's so-called 
poster child for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll be fine regardless of what the response is,''  
Sprewell said Wednesday morning at the Knicks' shootaround. ``I'm 
going to go out to compete and play and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the response is, I'm not going to worry too much  
about it. If it's good, I'm happy with that. If it's bad, I'm going 
to try to change that by working hard. But I can't let it affect 
the way I play on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was on the court practicing more than two hours before  
the game, his hair tied in cornrows and flapping in the breeze 
whenever he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said he was operating at about 80-85 percent of peak  
efficiency, although the range on his jumper, he said, was not much 
better than college 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to even touch the ball in the first three minutes  
of the game, there was no way Sprewell could have ignored the noise 
the first time the ball came his way. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first touch, the crowd roared as he went one-on-one  
against Kendall Gill and drew a foul. His first shot came some 30 
seconds later, a clean jumper from 17 feet that hit nothing but 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, the decibel level of the crowd's approval was somewhat  
stunning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell later missed his first 3-point attempt and shot a layup  
on an uncontested breakaway rather than unleashing one of his 
trademark screaming dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand any emotion anybody has,'' Knicks coach Jeff  
Van Gundy said before the game. ``But from my dealings with him 
over the first eight days, he's going to be a fan favorite at some 
point because of how hard he plays. The bottom line with our crowd 
is that they expect hard work, and Latrell plays extremely hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell started for New York in a three-guard alignment  
alongside Charlie Ward and Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time All-Star is being counted on to lift New York out  
of a four-year slump of not having made it past the second round of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks took a large amount of public criticism for their  
decision to trade for Sprewell, and it remains to be seen whether 
he'll be able to flourish in the spotlight of the nation's largest 
media market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable with the team, it's just a matter of getting  
the terminology down and feeling better about my legs,'' Sprewell 
said. ``It's a little different for me, but I'm going to try to get 
to the basket, defend guys, make open shots and create for other 
people. So I'm still doing the same things offensively and 
defensively.''

<HEADLINE>  Knicks' Sprewell Cheered in Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The greeting for Spree was one of unabashed  
glee. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell received a roar of approval in pregame  
introductions at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night as he 
prepared to play his first game in almost 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	If the fans haven't forgiven him for his attack on Golden State  
coach P.J. Carlesimo, they didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, introduced fourth among the Knicks' five starters,  
received the warmest response of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there were more boos for Patrick Ewing, the president  
of the players' union, than there were for the league's so-called 
poster child for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll be fine regardless of what the response is,''  
Sprewell said Wednesday morning at the Knicks' shootaround. ``I'm 
going to go out to compete and play and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the response is, I'm not going to worry too much  
about it. If it's good, I'm happy with that. If it's bad, I'm going 
to try to change that by working hard. But I can't let it affect 
the way I play on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was on the court practicing more than two hours before  
the game, his hair tied in cornrows and flapping in the breeze 
whenever he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said he was operating at about 80-85 percent of peak  
efficiency, although the range on his jumper, he said, was not much 
better than college 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to even touch the ball in the first three minutes  
of the game, there was no way Sprewell could have ignored the noise 
the first time the ball came his way. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first touch, the crowd roared as he went one-on-one  
against Kendall Gill and drew a foul. His first shot came some 30 
seconds later, a clean jumper from 17 feet that hit nothing but 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, the decibel level of the crowd's approval was somewhat  
stunning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell later missed his first 3-point attempt and shot a layup  
on an uncontested breakaway rather than unleashing one of his 
trademark screaming dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand any emotion anybody has,'' Knicks coach Jeff  
Van Gundy said before the game. ``But from my dealings with him 
over the first eight days, he's going to be a fan favorite at some 
point because of how hard he plays. The bottom line with our crowd 
is that they expect hard work, and Latrell plays extremely hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell started for New York in a three-guard alignment  
alongside Charlie Ward and Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time All-Star is being counted on to lift New York out  
of a four-year slump of not having made it past the second round of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks took a large amount of public criticism for their  
decision to trade for Sprewell, and it remains to be seen whether 
he'll be able to flourish in the spotlight of the nation's largest 
media market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable with the team, it's just a matter of getting  
the terminology down and feeling better about my legs,'' Sprewell 
said. ``It's a little different for me, but I'm going to try to get 
to the basket, defend guys, make open shots and create for other 
people. So I'm still doing the same things offensively and 
defensively.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis New BankAmerica's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Kenneth D. Lewis was elected president of  
BankAmerica Corp. Wednesday, solidifying his chances of eventually 
succeeding Hugh McColl Jr. as chief executive of the nation's 
second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action is in recognition of Ken's superior performance in  
managing the greater part of our business,'' said McColl, the 
bank's chairman and chief executive officer, who until recently was 
also president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our company is fortunate to have executives such as Ken with  
the necessary experience and demonstrated track record to 
successfully complete our integration and help us lead this dynamic 
organization forward,'' McColl said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 51, has been mentioned as a possible successor to McColl  
even before the BankAmerica and NationsBank merger was announced 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A 30-year company man, Lewis runs the bank's largest and most  
profitable division -- consumer and commercial banking. He was 
directly involved in folding acquired banks into NationsBank, 
including the mergers with FirstRepublic in Dallas and C&AMP;S/Sovran 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Meridian, Miss., and a graduate of Georgia State  
University, Lewis began his career with the company in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica Corp., which does business as Bank of America, has  
operations in 22 states and the District of Columbia and $618 
billion in assets.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Online Porn Statute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge is expected to decide next week  
whether a federal law designed to keep online pornography away from 
children violates free speech guarantees or is a permissible way to 
keep tabs on potentially harmful material. 
</P>
<P>
	The Child Online Protection Act would have a ``devastating  
effect on free speech,'' Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday during final arguments at a 
federal court hearing on the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU is challenging the act, which would require commercial  
Web sites to collect a credit card number or some other access code 
as proof of age before allowing users to view material deemed 
harmful to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton signed the law last year, but U.S. District  
Judge Lowell Reed Jr. issued a restraining order against its 
enforcement. Reed is expected to decide by Monday whether a 
preliminary injunction -- a more permanent delay -- should be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of Web sites dealing with issues from homosexuality to  
gynecology fear they could be punished under the act for expressing 
their views, Beeson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer Karen Stewart dismissed Beeson's  
view as ``a doomsday scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is not a private playground. It can be  
regulated,'' she said, adding that the measure is aimed only at 
pornographic sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the law is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. The ACLU, however, contends it 
violates the First Amendment and fears mainstream sites may 
inadvertently get snared in its enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The ID requirement could also result in costly technical  
upgrades for Web site owners and would discourage users from freely 
using the Web, Beeson argued. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brian Blonder, an accountant for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  
testified Tuesday that the act would not subject commercial Web 
site operators to unreasonable costs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had analyzed financial data for seven companies  
challenging the law and found that all but one could afford to 
comply with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonder also said only a small fraction of material on the  
Internet would be covered, and that Web sites already are 
segregating objectionable material due to advertiser pressure. He 
said the concerns of non-pornographic sites were based on ``gut 
feelings'' and not evidence.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Aid Efforts Begin for Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Marisol Munoz spent anguished hours worrying about the fate of  
her father, not knowing whether he was dead or alive in his 
earthquake-ravaged Colombian community of Armenia and powerless to 
get a telephone call through. 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of trying, she finally got the best possible news  
early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get him all day Monday but couldn't,'' said  
the 28-year-old Munoz, who lives in a heavily Colombian 
neighborhood in New York. ``At night, I woke up every hour to call 
him. Finally, he called me and said he was all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nightmare of not knowing the fate of loved ones stretched  
from coast to coast as details emerged about the devastation 
wrought by one of the worst quakes to hit Colombia in more than a 
century: a magnitude-6 temblor that crumbled nearly two-thirds of 
the buildings in the western Colombian city of Armenia on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of deaths have been confirmed and the toll was expected  
to climb. 
</P>
<P>
	In Southern California, Jairo Osorio has been spent much of his  
time since the quake watching TV reports and awaiting news about 
the fate of his older brother Umberto Osorio, a politician in their 
hometown of Manizales, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has heard from him,'' Osorio said Tuesday as he  
lingered over a half-eaten plate of food at Antojitos, a popular 
Colombian restaurant in the San Fernando Valley. ``There's a lot we 
need to know, but it's just not easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to send aid -- everything from high-tech search equipment  
to donated baby diapers -- are being mobilized throughout the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	In Marisol Munoz's neighborhood, relief efforts are evident all  
around: Shopkeepers set out boxes so that people could donate 
clothing and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
	As in New York City, the Colombian consulate in Los Angeles has  
been flooded with callers worried about relatives, but information 
has trickled in slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people phoned the New York offices of the Colombian  
RCN radio and television network, which is broadcasting rescue 
efforts and updating viewers with lists of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's crying over here,'' said Sandra Castaneda, who  
works at the station. ``People are bringing food, medicine. It's 
been absolutely crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The station is collecting supplies and plans to hold a  
quake-relief telethon Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Urban Search and Rescue Task Force --  
the same team recognized for its work in the Oklahoma City bombing 
-- arrived in Armenia on Tuesday to dig through the destruction. The 
team, equipped with 56,000 pounds of gear, will remain in the area 
about a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're bringing the most advanced listening and fiber optic  
devices to search for people trapped under rubble,'' said Lt. Luis 
Fernandez, a spokesman for Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	And from New York City's Queens borough -- where Munoz lives -- to  
Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, people packed cardboard boxes 
with donations bound for Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami's Little Havana, the mood was somber at the Monserrate  
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very united, and very sad,'' said Jairo Lozano, who  
emigrated 25 years ago from Bogota. ``There's a box here where 
people are dropping things off ... food, canned goods, diapers for 
the children, medicine. We'll pack it up and send it off.''

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Seeks To Revive Tourism Ind. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The Aloha State is banking on a quarter-ton sumo  
wrestler floating in a huge inner tube and singing ``Blue Hawaii'' 
to revive its faltering tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaiian-born former sumo champion Konishiki, who weighs in at  
about 585 pounds, will have to make a big splash -- the state has 
suffered its first decline in tourism in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary cause was a 10 percent decline in Japanese visitors  
still battered by Asia's prolonged economic flu. Japan currently 
represents a quarter of Hawaii's tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Konishiki, who remains one of Japan's most beloved former  
athletes and often appears in television ads and talk shows. He no 
longer wrestles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau this week began a  
multimedia campaign in Japan featuring the Oahu native who was born 
Salevaa Atisanoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Big Relax, Big Hawaii'' campaign is part of the bureau's  
1999 marketing plan for Hawaii's $11 billion tourism industry, 
which generates about a quarter of the state's tax revenue and a 
third of its jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 16 million Japanese that travel. They love Hawaii,  
they know a lot about Hawaii, they want to come to Hawaii,'' bureau 
president Tony Vericella said Tuesday. ``We will be doing a whole 
lot more to make sure we have a bigger, more visual and fully 
integrated presence in Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They don't come much bigger than Konishiki, whose girth will  
grace TV commercials, railway station billboards and magazine and 
newspaper advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the typical toned bodies shown frolicking in bikinis  
along Hawaii's luscious coastlines, the agency's marketing budget 
for Japan -- which will triple to $10.4 million -- is betting on the 
portly Konishiki, who will be featured in a beefcake pose on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think in the summer and beyond we will see a better set of  
results from Japan,'' said Vericella, who estimated this year's 
arrivals could swing 1 percent in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high. Hawaii has been mired in an economic  
malaise since 1991 and preliminary estimates said the state 
received 6.8 million visitors in 1998, a 1.6 percent drop from 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, under a law passed last year, the visitor's bureau now has  
to compete with other agencies for millions of dollars in state 
tourism funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hawaii nearly doubled its budget for tourism  
marketing to $55 million. Of that, the bureau will get $47 million, 
a 96 percent increase from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau hopes the extra money will increase overall visitor  
arrivals by almost 2 percent to 6.9 million, make tourists stay 
longer and spend 4.4 percent more, or $11.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater emphasis also will be placed on untapped markets in  
Europe, Asia and Latin America, Vericella said. Two markets -- Japan 
and the rest of the United States -- are home to 84 percent of 
Hawaii's visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Vericella said the plan also aims to build new markets that  
complement the main markets of Japan and the West Coast. The key 
ingredient is balance among leisure and business travelers, 
first-time visitors and returning vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one part that's going to do it all anymore,''  
Vericella said. ``There isn't any one segment that's going to be 
the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another focus is on redefining Hawaii's image from a place  
solely for fun-in-the-sun to a preferred place to do business. The 
state opened a $350 million convention center last year and spent 
another $15 million renovating an exhibition hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Touring cultural programs such as ``Aloha Cities'' and ``Chefs  
of Aloha'' will be expanded to more cities. Among those on 1999's 
schedule are Denver; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco and 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen McDonough, who owns Hale Mali'e, a company that rents  
beachfront vacation homes on Oahu, she was glad the bureau was 
attempting a new strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're doing all they can do,'' she said. ``At this  
point I'm just hopeful.''

<HEADLINE> Ford-Volvo Deal Reportedly Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is set to acquire the automotive  
operations of Sweden's Volvo AB, according to published reports 
Wednesday. One account said the deal was worth $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's Automotive Reports, quoting unnamed sources, reported on  
its Web site that Ford President Jac Nasser was in New York earlier 
this week to work out the deal. The trade publication said Volvo 
had been asking $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week magazine, in a story posted Wednesday night on its  
Web site, said Ford's $6 billion offer won out over a $7 billion 
bid by Italy's Fiat SpA, which also wanted to purchase Volvo's 
commercial truck business. Business Week, also quoting unnamed 
sources, said an announcement would be made Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman John Spelich declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``We never comment on rumor and speculation regarding mergers  
and acquisitions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at Volvo's North American offices in Rockleigh,  
N.J., were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo has been one of several auto companies considering  
possible mergers or acquisitions since last year's big merger of 
Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG. Business Week said Germany's 
Volkswagen AG was among the final bidders for Volvo. Most of the 
speculation in recent weeks, however, has focused on a deal with 
either Fiat or Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has nearly $24 billion in cash, compared with Fiat's $1.5  
billion reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo presumably would retain its commercial truck operations in  
a deal with Ford. Two weeks ago, Volvo bought a 12.85 percent share 
in rival truck maker Scania, also based in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports surfaced after the close of trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where Ford fell $1 to close at $60.31 1/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquiring Volvo would allow Ford to expand its 10 percent share  
of the European market by offering a broader line of near-luxury 
sedans and station wagons. Volvo would also help Ford in its effort 
to market itself as a leader in automotive safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a lot of sense for Ford,'' said analyst Joe Phillippi  
of Lehman Brothers. ``As long as they don't overpay for it in the 
eyes of the Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford already owns Jaguar Cars Ltd., whose cars are priced well  
above Volvo's. Ford's European cars, meanwhile, are priced below 
Volvo's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing is there's so little overlap, even with  
Jaguar,'' Phillippi said. ``Volvo prices end way before Jaguar 
prices start, so that's not really an issue. In Europe, it helps 
them enormously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo sold almost 400,000 cars last year, with 100,200 of them  
in the United States, or more than a quarter of all of its sales. 
Sweden was its second-largest market, with 53,600 cars sold. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time Volvo has been involved in merger  
discussions. Stockholders blocked a proposed merger with Renault SA 
of France in 1993. Opponents, mostly small shareholders in Sweden 
and mid-level managers, were worried about control of Volvo and 
jobs moving outside Sweden, where manufacturing costs are high. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be less of a concern with Ford as an owner, based on  
the way the world's No. 2 automaker has handled its acquisition of 
Jaguar, keeping it as a largely separate entity based in England. 
Ford paid $2.5 billion for Jaguar in 1989, but pumped an additional 
$3.5 billion into the company's aging assembly plants; the British 
automaker only recently has returned to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the DaimlerChrysler merger, a Ford-Volvo deal would do  
little to address the industry's problem of too much production 
capacity. Because there is no product overlap, there would be no 
immediate need to close plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some would argue this is not necessarily good for the  
industry,'' Phillippi said. ``You need a bunch of weak players with 
a lot of excess capacity to get together and close a bunch of 
capacity. That's really going to be hard.''

<HEADLINE>  Renewed Fighting Reported in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Government troops backed by tanks  
pounded ethnic Albanian strongholds along a strategic highway 
Wednesday, while U.S. and European envoys urged Kosovo rebels to 
accept talks on a plan for self-rule that falls short of the full 
independence they seek. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 150 villagers fled their homes as fighting flared along  
the Pristina-Belgrade highway, peace monitors reported. Dozens 
piled into tractor-pulled trailers to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting came as major powers were preparing to call a peace  
conference to bring together Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government and the separatists who oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as diplomats talked of peace, the Yugoslav army and  
Serb police launched an attack shortly after dawn to push the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army away from the main highway linking the 
province with the Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the international peace monitors,  
said the offensive was directed at three villages near Podujevo, 18 
miles north of Kosovo's provincial capital of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear violation of the (cease-fire) agreement,''  
Blyth said, referring to the October accord that ended seven months 
of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed and up to 300,000 driven  
from their homes since the government launched a crackdown last 
February against separatists in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of NATO airstrikes and the Oct. 12 cease-fire stopped  
most fighting but the violence has increased in recent weeks, 
culminating in the apparent massacre Jan. 15 of 45 ethnic Albanians 
in the village of Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past month, KLA fighters have manned trenches and  
bunkers within a mile of the Pristina-Belgrade highway and had been 
reinforcing their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	When the fighting ended near sunset, it appeared the rebel lines  
were holding, but Yugoslav troops had advanced to better positions 
overlooking rebel strongholds. Columns of tanks and armored 
personnel carriers were seen moving along the main road between 
Podujevo and Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	As fighting raged, the U.S. special envoy for Kosovo,  
Christopher Hill, and his European Union counterpart, Wolfgang 
Petritsch, journeyed to this muddy village 28 miles southwest of 
Pristina to urge the KLA to endorse the peace conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has so far refused to accept any conference unless it  
would lead to full independence for Kosovo, a province of 
Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and the Europeans have proposed expanded  
self-rule for three years, after which further talks could be held 
on the province's future status. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 90-minute meeting, Hill said the two envoys delivered  
``a very strong message'' urging the rebels to accept the 
conference and interim status formula. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly speaking, we do not have much more patience with  
this,'' Hill said. ``The international community wants to see the 
process move quickly and we need the participation of all 
parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel spokesman Jakup Krasniqi refused to say whether the KLA  
was ready for talks but described the meeting with the envoys as 
``useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, government officials and political parties  
Wednesday demanded direct Serb-Albanian talks rather than an 
international conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials traveling with Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday she has developed a plan 
that would give Milosevic only a few weeks to agree to a proposal 
for Kosovo that included self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright has agreed to meet Friday in London with foreign  
ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, her 
spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six comprise the so-called ``Contact Group'' dealing with  
problems involving republics of former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, American officials said NATO was expected to come  
out with a clear warning to Milosevic on Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Fourth IOC Member Quits in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The IOC is down another member.  
</P>
<P>
	A fourth International Olympic Committee member implicated in  
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal resigned Wednesday, three days 
after he was accused of accepting payments arranged by the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Charles Mukora, one of six IOC members facing expulsion,  
proclaimed his innocence even as he quit. The IOC said Mukora, 64, 
received $34,650, but he said the cash was for ``sports development 
in Kenya'' and ``world youth sporting activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been party to any improper dealings in the last  
40 years I have been involved as a volunteer in Kenyan sports and 
sports management or as an IOC member,'' Mukora, an IOC member 
since 1990, said. ``The monies that I am alleged to have received 
as regards to Salt Lake City were monies paid towards the 
establishment of high altitude training camps in Nanyuki, and I 
have not used the monies for my personal use or personal purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest. I have decided therefore to accept his advice 
on principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Sibandze of Swaziland, Libya's Bashir Mohammed Attarabulsi  
and Finland's Pirjo Haeggman had previously quit, and five others 
have been essentially ousted pending a formal IOC vote in 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	The others facing expulsion are Lamine Keita of Mali,  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed 
Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador and Sergio 
Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said Wednesday he did nothing wrong and will not  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to resign as a member of the IOC,'' said  
Santander, who also is president of the Chilean Olympic Committee. 
``There are no cowards in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands received a warning and  
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea 
and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``complimented Mr.  
Mukora for taking the honorable path'' and called for others ``to 
follow Mr. Mukora's lead and tender their resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation concluded Keita ``knowingly permitted''  
Salt Lake City bidders to make payments totaling more than $97,000 
from 1993-97 to support his son at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fighter by nature, not someone who resigns,'' Keita was  
quoted as telling the Swiss daily Le Matin. ``I'm going to defend 
myself. The statutes give us the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze, who resigned Friday, said he believed there was  
nothing wrong with his son receiving $100,000 in scholarships and 
living expenses from the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities in the United States give scholarships all the  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he also received numerous gifts, including  
paintings and sculptures, from the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee 
while it was wooing IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he knew there was a $150 limit on the total amount  
of gifts an IOC member could receive from a city, but added: ``I 
never asked about the value of a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not my intent to let the IOC expel me,'' Sibandze said.  
``That's the manner in which the IOC has approached these problems. 
I resigned in the interests of my country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov maintained his innocence and said the scandal stemmed  
from increased commercialization of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more money is involved in big sports, the bigger is the  
temptation to touch them,'' the 63-year-old Russian said in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was asked by the  
investigators to explain his request for free medical treatment for 
former Soviet hockey star Alexander Ragulin and his receipt of a 
Browning rifle from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the IOC member from Ecuador facing expulsion, denied  
accepting bribes. He told the newspaper El Comercio it would be 
``cowardly'' to resign and it would be an ``admission that I had 
done something of which I am innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Officials in Turin, Italy, and Zakopane, Poland, both trying to  
win the 2006 Winter Games, oppose the rule changes in bidding for 
future sites. The IOC recommends a ban on visits by IOC members and 
wants a 15-member panel to choose the host. The Turin and Zakopane 
groups say this puts first-time bidders at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 2004 Athens Games said staging the Olympics  
permanently in Greece as a scandal-stopping move ``isn't the 
answer.'' Constantine Bakouris, managing director of the 2004 
Games, said it would be ``very difficult to deprive the other 
countries of organizing'' the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Federal investigators scrutinizing the scandal are searching  
for evidence to bring a case in which both bribers and recipients 
could be charged, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors and agents are looking at mail and wire  
fraud and conspiracy statutes and a racketeering law to prosecute 
what they initially see as a case of commercial bribery, rather 
than the more familiar government variety, according to Justice 
Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal inquiry is in a very early stage -- months from key  
decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. A Utah ethics panel also is not close to wrapping up its 
investigation, which has a self-imposed deadline of Feb. 11.

<HEADLINE>  Renewed Fighting Reported in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Government troops backed by tanks  
pounded ethnic Albanian strongholds along a strategic highway 
Wednesday, while U.S. and European envoys urged Kosovo rebels to 
accept talks on a plan for self-rule that falls short of the full 
independence they seek. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 150 villagers fled their homes as fighting flared along  
the Pristina-Belgrade highway, peace monitors reported. Dozens 
piled into tractor-pulled trailers to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting came as major powers were preparing to call a peace

<HEADLINE> InterMedia, Charter, TCI Swap Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Charter Communications, one of the  
nation's fastest-growing companies, is on the move again. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis company owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen  
will gain cable systems serving about 260,000 customers in a 
complicated $2.4 billion deal with Nashville-based InterMedia 
Partners and Tele-Communications Inc. of Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction announced Wednesday involves cash and trades and  
spinoffs of cable systems in nine states. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI and Charter will acquire systems that InterMedia Partners  
now uses to serve about 700,000 customers in Georgia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI, which is being acquired by communications giant AT&AMP;T, will  
give up its 49 percent stake in InterMedia in exchange for 
InterMedia's 300,000 customers in the Nashville area and Charter's 
systems in several Indiana communities; Shelbyville, Ky.; Logan, 
Utah; and Milltown, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI President Leo J. Hindery said InterMedia's recently rebuilt  
cable systems should help TCI provide the advanced communications 
services that will be available after the merger with AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has announced plans to spend billions of dollars upgrading  
TCI's cable systems to handle all-in-one packages of TV, local 
phone and Internet services. The TCI acquisition, valued at about 
$43 billion, is a major part of AT&AMP;T's push to use cable lines to 
offer local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI, currently the nation's second-largest cable company,  
already provides local phone service through its cable systems in 
Hartford, Conn., and the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter will pay InterMedia an unspecified amount of cash and  
will give it systems serving 140,000 customers in Indiana, 
Kentucky, Utah and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter will take over about 400,000 customers in Greenville and  
Spartanburg, S.C.; Athens and Gainesville, Ga.; Asheville and 
Marion, N.C.; Kingsport, Cleveland and Alcoa, Tenn.; and some West 
Tennessee communities. 
</P>
<P>
	InterMedia, now the 10th-largest cable system, will continue to  
own and manage systems serving about 465,000 customers in Kentucky, 
Georgia and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said TCI and InterMedia may strike a deal that would  
allow InterMedia to continue managing and operating the Nashville 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. It was  
ranked the eighth-fastest-growing company in the country by Inc. 
magazine last year, when it announced plans to acquire Marcus 
Cable. That deal should bump it up to No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	A definitive agreement will be finalized over the next couple of  
months and the transaction is expected to close this summer, 
pending regulatory and other approvals, the companies said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Surprise semifinalist Nicolas  
Lapentti is having fun in the publicity fishbowl, even if it means 
he has to keep saying ``we're just friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti's relationship with glamorous women's player Anna  
Kournikova has become more and more interesting to the media the 
longer he has remained in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian teen-ager was in the stands for four sets of  
Lapentti's five-set victory over Karol Kucera, which ended in the 
early hours of Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Television cameras showed almost as much of Kournikova watching  
the match as the match itself. There's Anna stretching, there's 
Anna shaking out her long hair, there's Anna eating an ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti said the pair have known each other for some time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we're very close friends,'' Lapentti said Wednesday.  
``It was really nice that she came and watched me play last 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to return the favor by watching Kournikova  
team with Martina Hingis in the women's doubles Wednesday, but 
decided to rest for his semifinal against Thomas Enqvist. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LINE CALL:* Semifinal outsiders Amelie Mauresmo and Nicolas  
Lapentti realized there's often a fine line between success and 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the No.29-ranked Mauresmo and the No. 91-ranked Lapentti  
were down two match points in their first round matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo, who will play No. 1 Lindsay Davenport in the semis,  
saved two match points in the second set of her victory over Corina 
Morariu of Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti was behind two match points in the fourth set of his  
opener against No. 16 seed Thomas Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGN OF TROUBLE:* Monica Seles wants it known that she's not  
too rude to sign autographs. Seles scored a 7-5, 6-1 victory over 
old rival Steffi Graf on Wednesday and walked off the court without 
accepting the pens and paper proffered from fans leaning over the 
walls surrounding center court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled my shoulder muscle and I just don't want to go up  
high on it,'' Seles explained. ``So I didn't sign after my previous 
match and today's match, just to be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GO FIGURE:* So much for stats. The Australian Open's host  
computer company unveiled a new statistic this year, a ``Pressure 
Player'' index to gauge how the competitors cope under stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest update came before the quarterfinals, and in four of  
the five categories the pressure players got cooked. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Rosset of Switzerland led the men's best service under  
pressure and best overall pressure player rankings. He was ousted 
in straight sets by Thomas Enqvist. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 7 Karol Kucera of Slovakia headed the best return under  
pressure and most complete player categories. He lost a five-setter 
to No. 91-ranked Nicolas Lapentti, coming apart with a couple of 
lazy half-volleys at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Pierce was called the most complete player in the women's  
draw. She looked and felt terrible in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Martina 
Hingis. Dominique Van Roost, overpowered by Amelie Mauresmo, led 
the best service under pressure category. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 Lindsay Davenport, the overall best pressure player,  
didn't follow the trend. She advanced with a win over Venus 
Williams.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Dem. Sided With GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Russell Feingold, the only Democrat to  
break party ranks on today's impeachment votes, said his decision 
should not be viewed as a signal that he intends to vote to remove 
President Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not reached a decision on that question,'' said  
Feingold, of Wisconsin. ``I believe we must continue to move 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold, just elected to his second six-year term, voted with  
the Republicans against dismissing the two impeachment articles and 
in favor of issuing subpoenas for witnesses Monica Lewinsky, Vernon 
Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. In each case, the vote was 56-44. The 
Republicans have a 55-45 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	To dismiss the case before witnesses, Feingold said in a written  
statement after his vote, would ``improperly short-circuit this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in order to dismiss the case at this point, a  
senator should be of the opinion that it is not possible for the 
House managers to show that the president has committed high crimes 
and misdemeanors,'' Feingold said. ``I simply cannot say that the 
House managers cannot prevail.''

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Vows Slew of Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's Republican leadership on  
Wednesday predicted a flurry of legislative activity after 
President Clinton's impeachment trial ends, including a 4.8 percent 
across-the-board pay raise for the military freshly endorsed by the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get a burst of activity to show that we are  
attending to the people's business,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott said in a breakfast speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do something quickly about the military,'' he  
said. ``We've got to pay attention to the fact that morale is down, 
we are losing ground in readiness and on pay and pensions we are 
shortchanging (members of the armed forces) and they are getting 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., also predicted early Senate debate on education  
legislation and on bills on the Federal Aviation Administration, 
juvenile crime, bankruptcy reform, financial services reform, a 
second round of changes in welfare programs and fast-track trade 
authority for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, the Armed Services Committee met and endorsed  
the military pay measure, which also would restructure the military 
retirement program and expand terms of the GI bill. The measure is 
now ready for a vote by the full Senate. The House is expected to 
consider a similar measure soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee leaders said the bill, a top GOP priority, could be  
the first piece of legislation passed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., who held a  
news conference with other committee members to highlight the 
military spending issue, said it would contribute to the 
``desperate need to stop, for the 14th year, a decline in defense 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has asked for a $12 billion increase in  
defense spending, including a 4.4 percent salary increase. Warner 
called that amount inadequate but praised Clinton for recognizing 
the need to turn around the decline in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay raise in both Clinton's proposal and in the Senate  
committee version would take effect next January. 
</P>
<P>
	The military pay and retirement bill starts out with a 4.8  
percent pay increase for everyone, but after July 1, 2000 allows 
additional increases of up to 10.3 percent on the basis of merit 
and ``at specific promotion points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also overhaul the retirement system,  
restoring the 50 percent basic retirement pay -- after 20 years of 
service -- that was in force before 1986, when the level was lowered 
to 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also adopted a proposal by Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.,  
that would eliminate the $1,200 contribution required of military 
members who elect to participate in the GI Bill, which provides 
subsidies for college education. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidy levels would also be increased, from $528 a month to  
$600 a month, for members who serve at least three years; and from 
$429 to $488 for members who serve less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	These benefits could, at the Defense Department's discretion, be  
transferred to another member of a service person's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also predicted early Senate consideration of measures to  
help ease Year-2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 10 days after the trial, ``we're are going to make the  
senators all come to the Senate chamber and sit down and we are 
going to get a report'' about the status of efforts to correct 
computer glitches that could cause serious disruptions in basic 
services with the arrival of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he thought the trial would be over in ``two weeks at  
the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first bills on the Senate floor, Lott said, would be  
an ``education flexibility'' bill, which would extend a program 
giving state and local governments more freedom to try innovative 
approaches to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Republicans would press for an across-the-board tax  
rate cut and would oppose administration plans to raise tobacco 
taxes and spend the budget surplus on Medicare and other programs.

<HEADLINE> Espy Aide's Conviction Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals panel on Tuesday upheld the  
conviction of Ronald Blackley, onetime chief of staff to former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackley last month  
to an unusually harsh 27 months in prison for lying to federal 
agents and failing to disclose $22,000 from Mississippi 
agribusiness interests on his 1993 public financial disclosure 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth said he departed from sentencing guidelines that called  
for only probation because at the time of the offenses Blackley was 
in a top government position of trust. 
</P>
<P>
	In his appeal, Blackley said the case was beyond the  
jurisdiction of Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz, that the 
indictment failed to adequately advise him of the nature of charges 
against him and that the jury instructions were flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge appeals panel wrote that concealment of the  
money reflected ``the perpetrator's consciousness of guilt'' and 
that Lamberth's sentence was well within his discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision confirms the obligation of senior government  
officials to be truthful and act with integrity in the discharge of 
their duties,'' Smaltz said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury acquitted Espy in December of all 30 charges  
brought against him by Smaltz. 
</P>
<P>
	With the conclusion of Espy's trial, the independent prosecutor  
is now wrapping up appellate matters, preparing a final report to 
Congress and processing records for the National Archives.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Still Champion at the Gate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson is still knocking them over at the  
box office. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion continues to be boxing's biggest  
attraction, despite a 19-month layoff from the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	If any evidence was needed, figures released Wednesday by Nevada  
boxing officials that showed Tyson's comeback fight against 
Francois Botha to be the sixth biggest live gate in state boxing 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Athletic Commission said 10,221 people paid full  
ticket prices to get into the fight at the MGM Grand hotel-casino. 
The fight grossed $7,051,800 for the live gate, dashing predictions 
by many before the bout that ticket sales would be underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	The live gate trailed only four other Tyson fights and the first  
Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez fight for total money brought 
in at the gate. The biggest grossing fight in Nevada history was 
Tyson's infamous biting of Evander Holyfield, which had a live gate 
of $14,277,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare him to anybody else, it's unbelievable,''  
said commission executive director Marc Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ability to draw fans to his fifth-round knockout of  
Botha was even more impressive because the Jan. 16 date was 
sandwiched in between two big Las Vegas weekends and the fight 
promotion was hastily put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 750,000 people paid an average of $45 to buy the  
pay-per-view of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	With a live gate tax of 4 percent and a television tax of  
$50,000, Nevada earned about $330,000 in taxes on the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a promoter or a fighter in the world that wouldn't  
love to have those type of numbers,'' promoter Dan Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the reason for Tyson's live gate success was due to high  
ticket prices, which ranged from $200 in the upper balcony of the 
hotel's arena to $1,200 at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the crowd in an arena that seats about 15,000 was far  
above what some writers had predicted when only a few thousand 
seats were sold the week before the fight. The announced attendance 
at the fight was 12,519, with the remainder getting in on reduced 
or complimentary tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reports just weren't accurate leading up to the fight,''  
Goossen said. ``I'm not pointing fingers at the media, but they end 
up looking at the glass half empty rather than half full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is scheduled to fight again April 24 at the MGM Grand  
against one of a handful of different opponents his promoters say 
they are still negotiating with.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes To End Trial in 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poised to call Monica Lewinsky and two others  
as witnesses, Senate Republicans today discussed a plan that could 
end President Clinton's impeachment trial within 10 days. The White 
House said it was concerned Republicans were trying to ``put a 
blindfold on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, said the proposed schedule to end the trial by Feb. 6 would 
not allow time for defense witnesses for Clinton. An extension 
would be needed if the White House asked to put on its own 
witnesses and the Senate agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats reacted warily to the GOP plan but left open  
the possibility of further negotiations. ``We're not going to rush 
to any conclusion,'' Minority Leader Tom Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he was concerned Republicans  
were telling the president, ``We want to have our witnesses but you 
don't need to have your witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP plan, depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, presidential  
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal would 
begin as early as Thursday. Each deposition would last six hours, 
equally divided between the White House and House prosecutors with 
two senators sitting in as mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotaped sessions and transcripts would be distributed  
Monday to senators, who would then vote Tuesday on whether to 
permit live testimony. The timetable would allow for that testimony 
and then closing statements from the House managers and White House 
lawyers, Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla.,  
acknowledged that ``we kind of need to get a little bit closer on 
some details'' before any bipartisan agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans expected to muster party-line majorities  
today to defeat a Democratic motion to dismiss the impeachment case 
and approve witness depositions. At the same time, Democrats were 
ready to demonstrate the strength to block the two-thirds majority 
that eventually would be needed to oust Clinton from office 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said today that if prosecution witnesses are  
allowed the president's lawyers deserve a chance to review some 
56,000 pages in still-secret evidence the House collected during 
the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're now trying to put a blindfold on us,'' press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said, declining to say whether the White House would 
demand to slow things down or call its own witnesses. ``We believe 
we ought to have an adequate chance to get prepared and to present 
a defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House remains convinced that the best course is to  
avoid calling witnesses altogether, he added. ``We don't want this 
to stay open-ended. We think there is enough testimony on the 
record now for members to make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After days of being blamed for considering extending the trial,  
Senate Republicans suggested their plan would turn the tables on 
the White House. ``The longer it is prolonged, the more risk to 
their client. If another shoe drops, it's there fault, not ours,'' 
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks before today's votes, Lott said, ``There is a point  
when we will complete the work we are involved in and I believe it 
could be within the next 10 days, two weeks at the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott won over some wavering Republicans on the issue of deposing  
witnesses after House prosecutors Tuesday restricted their list to 
Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center of the 
sex and cover-up scandal, and then two presidential confidants. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors on Tuesday asked the Senate to invite Clinton  
to testify, but the White House has rejected the idea and Daschle 
called the proposal ``a red herring. It is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle warned the trial would plod on indefinitely if witnesses  
were approved, and Clinton lawyer David Kendall said the White 
House would be ``faced with a critical need'' to review mountains 
of previous testimony before deciding whether to seek rebuttal 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, sensing the Senate will not remove Clinton, is considering  
a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to end the trial with 
two votes: the first on whether Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction and the second on whether he should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' that it  
was ``well-grounded both in the Constitution and precedents to have 
separate findings of fact, separate from the decision on whether or 
not the offenses ... justify removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us are concerned about whether an acquittal vote --  
what kind of message that would send to the White House and the 
American people,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., scoffed at that proposal. ``Our  
vote is whether or not to remove the president,'' he said on ABC. 
``We can admit to the fact the president has not been truthful. ... 
But the question is a judgment question: Do we believe it is 
grounds for overturning an election.The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said Tuesday that he, along with GOP  
Reps. Bill McCollum of Florida, James Rogan of California and Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas most likely would depose the witnesses for 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan about his efforts to find  
Ms. Lewinsky a job at the same time she had been subpoenaed in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal is one of the White House aides to whom the president  
falsely denied having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The article of impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says 
Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury.

<HEADLINE> Defense Keys Falcons' Turnaround </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Rich Brooks shook his head slowly, his body  
overcome by a protracted, gut-wrenching groan. 
</P>
<P>
	He was remembering the Atlanta Falcons' defense, pre-1997.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't stop anybody,'' Brooks said Tuesday, recalling the  
unit that became his when he accepted Dan Reeves' offer to take 
over as defensive coordinator of the Falcons two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Smith was so fed up playing for a defense that ranked near  
the bottom of the league for an entire decade, he spoke out angrily 
and wound up suspended for the final game of the '96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough getting up and going in to play for a defense that  
you knew didn't have a chance going into the game,'' the defensive 
end recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, when the Falcons gave up the more yards passing than  
any other team in NFL history, they had more holes than a putting 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, when they meet the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl,  
they will be relying heavily on a defense that cracked the top 10 
in run defense (second), points allowed (fourth) and total yards 
allowed (eighth). 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a remarkable turnaround, the crucial chapter in the  
Falcons' storybook rise from 3-13 mess to NFC champion in the space 
of only two seasons. Even Brooks, architect of the revitalization, 
is astounded by its haste. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is part of an overall plan,'' he said. ``It isn't  
just defense. Dan Reeves' philosophy is to play sound defense, run 
the football, don't turn it over and take it away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons led the league in time of possession (an average of  
33 minutes, 10 seconds). They led the league in turnover margin (44 
takeaways, 24 giveaways). They had the sixth-best rushing offense, 
led by 1,846-yard runner Jamal Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of wear teams down with the offense,'' Brooks said.  
``The defensive players appreciate the fact that when they come off 
the field, it's not going to be three quick passes and your fanny 
might be back on the field 45 seconds later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a not-so-subtle reference to the run-and-shoot offense  
favored by the previous regimes of June Jones and Jerry Glanville. 
While the Falcons put up some staggering offensive numbers in those 
years, the defense felt like a neglected stepchild. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1990-96, five of Atlanta's seven first-round picks were  
used on offensive players. The Falcons also traded two first-round 
picks for quarterback Jeff George, another first-rounder for 
receiver Eric Metcalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, with the Falcons finishing up a three-victory season in  
1996, Smith's feelings boiled over. He was tired of practicing 
against the run-and-shoot, which did about as much good on game day 
as taking a water pistol to the shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had never even practiced against a tight end,'' said Smith,  
who joined the Falcons in '92. ``That's why we always finished last 
in run defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the Falcons would never have a winning team until  
they hired a defensive-minded coach. That drew a one-game 
suspension from Jones, but it was Smith who wound up a prophet. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was fired the following week. His successor, Reeves,  
switched to a conventional offense and turned his attention to the 
defense -- in particular, the woeful secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The front end wasn't that bad,'' said Brooks, noting the  
Falcons still have five starters from their pre-'97 front seven. 
``But the back end was a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. Cornerback Ray Buchanan, signed to a four-year, $13  
million contract, gave the Falcons their best coverage player since 
Deion Sanders. Safety William White and cornerback Ronnie Bradford 
were bargain-basement free agents who turned out to be bargains. 
Thirty-five-year-old Eugene Robinson was brought in to quarterback 
the secondary, barking out orders and compensating for his age with 
savvy, knowledge and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	The revamped secondary bolstered the pass defense and made an  
invaluable contribution to stopping the run in the gap-control 
philosophy preached by Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two safeties and two corners have to understand where they  
fit in the running game,'' Brooks said. ``You can cut a 20-yard run 
to a 6- or 8-yard run if the secondary support is in the proper 
run-entry position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, when linebacker Jessie Tuggle -- a five-time Pro Bowler who  
used to be the lone bright spot on the Falcons defense -- sprints to 
a breach in the line, he knows there's someone backing him up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have confidence in your teammates,'' Tuggle said,  
``then you're able to go out there and play as hard as you possibly 
can and put up some great numbers.''

<HEADLINE>  Fourth IOC Member Quits in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The IOC is down another member.  
</P>
<P>
	A fourth International Olympic Committee member implicated in  
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal resigned Wednesday, three days 
after he was accused of accepting payments arranged by the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Charles Mukora, one of six IOC members facing expulsion,  
proclaimed his innocence even as he quit. The IOC said Mukora, 64, 
received $34,650, but he said the cash was for ``sports development 
in Kenya'' and ``world youth sporting activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been party to any improper dealings in the last  
40 years I have been involved as a volunteer in Kenyan sports and 
sports management or as an IOC member,'' Mukora, an IOC member 
since 1990, said. ``The monies that I am alleged to have received 
as regards to Salt Lake City were monies paid towards the 
establishment of high altitude training camps in Nanyuki, and I 
have not used the monies for my personal use or personal purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest. I have decided therefore to accept his advice 
on principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Sibandze of Swaziland, Libya's Bashir Mohammed Attarabulsi  
and Finland's Pirjo Haeggman had previously quit, and five others 
have been essentially ousted pending a formal IOC vote in 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	The others facing expulsion are Lamine Keita of Mali,  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed 
Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador and Sergio 
Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said Wednesday he did nothing wrong and will not  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to resign as a member of the IOC,'' said  
Santander, who also is president of the Chilean Olympic Committee. 
``There are no cowards in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands received a warning and  
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea 
and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``complimented Mr.  
Mukora for taking the honorable path'' and called for others ``to 
follow Mr. Mukora's lead and tender their resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation concluded Keita ``knowingly permitted''  
Salt Lake City bidders to make payments totaling more than $97,000 
from 1993-97 to support his son at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fighter by nature, not someone who resigns,'' Keita was  
quoted as telling the Swiss daily Le Matin. ``I'm going to defend 
myself. The statutes give us the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze, who resigned Friday, said he believed there was  
nothing wrong with his son receiving $100,000 in scholarships and 
living expenses from the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities in the United States give scholarships all the  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he also received numerous gifts, including  
paintings and sculptures, from the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee 
while it was wooing IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he knew there was a $150 limit on the total amount  
of gifts an IOC member could receive from a city, but added: ``I 
never asked about the value of a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not my intent to let the IOC expel me,'' Sibandze said.  
``That's the manner in which the IOC has approached these problems. 
I resigned in the interests of my country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov maintained his innocence and said the scandal stemmed  
from increased commercialization of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more money is involved in big sports, the bigger is the  
temptation to touch them,'' the 63-year-old Russian said in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was asked by the  
investigators to explain his request for free medical treatment for 
former Soviet hockey star Alexander Ragulin and his receipt of a 
Browning rifle from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the IOC member from Ecuador facing expulsion, denied  
accepting bribes. He told the newspaper El Comercio it would be 
``cowardly'' to resign and it would be an ``admission that I had 
done something of which I am innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Officials in Turin, Italy, and Zakopane, Poland, both trying to  
win the 2006 Winter Games, oppose the rule changes in bidding for 
future sites. The IOC recommends a ban on visits by IOC members and 
wants a 15-member panel to choose the host. The Turin and Zakopane 
groups say this puts first-time bidders at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 2004 Athens Games said staging the Olympics  
permanently in Greece as a scandal-stopping move ``isn't the 
answer.'' Constantine Bakouris, managing director of the 2004 
Games, said it would be ``very difficult to deprive the other 
countries of organizing'' the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Federal investigators scrutinizing the scandal are searching  
for evidence to bring a case in which both bribers and recipients 
could be charged, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors and agents are looking at mail and wire  
fraud and conspiracy statutes and a racketeering law to prosecute 
what they initially see as a case of commercial bribery, rather 
than the more familiar government variety, according to Justice 
Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal inquiry is in a very early stage -- months from key  
decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. A Utah ethics panel also is not close to wrapping up its 
investigation, which has a self-imposed deadline of Feb. 11.

<HEADLINE> Evel Knievel Gets Liver Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel received a  
long-awaited liver transplant and was recovering Wednesday at Tampa 
General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 60, was in stable condition. At the family's request,  
no further details were being released, including when the 
transplant was performed, hospital spokesman John Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel has hepatitis C, which he believes he contracted from  
one of the many blood transfusions he needed following spectacular 
crashes on the daredevil circuit in the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease destroyed his liver. Knievel announced in April that  
he needed a transplant, and he was hospitalized earlier this month 
with dehydration while awaiting a donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials estimate 4 million Americans have hepatitis C,  
some 300,000 of whom were infected by tainted blood transfusions 
before a reliable test was developed six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus affects the liver's ability to filter toxins from the  
blood and is the leading reason for liver transplants in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel was first diagnosed with the incurable disease three  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke at least 35 bones and underwent surgery 14 times during  
his stunt career, which included a jump over the 35-foot fountain 
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in 1967 when he flew 
head-over-handlebars, was knocked unconscious and crushed his 
pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his most famous stunts failed when the parachute opened  
as he was zooming over Idaho's Snake River Canyon in 1974. The 
following year, a crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in London 
watched as he soared over 13 double-tiered buses and then crashed, 
again fracturing his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended his stunt career in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Andersen Makes Up for Memorable Miss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Morten Andersen knows what it's like to be a great  
kicker known for a momentous miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, Andersen's most famous kick was a shanked chip  
shot that let Jacksonville reach the NFL playoffs in 1997, leading 
to the Jaguars' even more shocking run to the AFC championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt bad about it because it was the last kick of the season  
and I had a whole year to think about it,'' said Andersen, a member 
of the NFL's Team of the Decade in the '80s who has been just as 
good, or better, in the '90s. ``It was a humbling experience, but I 
finally realized one kick should not define a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 17, Andersen put that bad memory to bed with a 38-yarder  
in overtime that sent the Atlanta Falcons to their first Super 
Bowl. Just a few minutes earlier, Minnesota's Gary Anderson missed 
his first kick of the entire season, a field goal that would have 
given the Vikings a 10-point lead with barely two minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	That miss kept the Falcons' hopes alive, but Andersen knew just  
how Anderson felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous year for him -- not missing a field goal or  
extra point -- but I think he missed it because it was our time,'' 
Andersen said. ``I don't know if you can call it fate, but the way 
we played all year long, we willed it to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen, an eight-time Pro Bowler, has kicked more field goals  
than anyone in NFL history except Anderson. And his 17 years in the 
NFL have been nothing if not fateful. 
</P>
<P>
	An exchange program between his native Denmark and the United  
States landed him in Indianapolis, where an open tryout landed him 
on his high school team. His kicking game led him to Michigan State 
and finally to the New Orleans Saints and Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I came here was to open my mind and get good  
exposure to a different culture, language and people,'' Andersen 
said. ``I've never been what you call a `football player.' In high 
school, I would kick off and haul myself to the sideline as fast as 
I could. Covering kicks is still not something I cherish. I rely on 
the other 10 guys to do their thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, I did crush Deion Sanders when I was on the Saints  
and he was on the Falcons. Actually, I just knocked him out of 
bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's surprising run to the Super Bowl did cost Denmark its  
most famous color commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	For the previous seven years, Andersen worked on the live Danish  
telecast of the Super Bowl. But low advertising rates for the 
post-midnight broadcast prompted the nationwide station, TV3, to 
drop the game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	That is, until Andersen kicked the Falcons into Sunday's  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like the Danish people to feel like they're part of it,''  
he said. ``Even though I'm a small part of the team, I want them to 
be excited that Denmark is involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said his commentating is no threat to John Madden.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was strange because you have to work from the U.S. network  
video feed,'' Andersen said. ``Madden would circle a guy's stomach 
and you didn't know if he was talking about what he had for dinner. 
So you would be at their mercy as far as commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be on the other side of the microphones this  
year.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos, Falcons Relatively Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As has been their routine since being slapped with  
a $15,000 fine in November, the Denver Broncos issued a lengthy 
injury list on Wednesday that included 17 names. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those players were listed as probable for Sunday's Super  
Bowl game against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Why list them?  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to a game against San Diego on Nov. 8, the Broncos did not  
list quarterback John Elway on their injury report, even though 
Elway was bothered by sore ribs. Elway then aggravated the injury 
during pre-game warmups and was able to play for only one series. 
</P>
<P>
	For failing to list Elway, the Broncos were fined by the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan insisted there was ``a 99.9 percent chance  
John was going to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure not going to tell anyone before the game that John  
has sore ribs and make him cannon fodder for the opposition,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sarcastic response to the fine, Shanahan said he would  
ensure that the team wasn't fined again by listing any player who 
got near an ice pack or a Band-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' weekly injury list has ballooned as high as 24  
players this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17 players included Elway (ribs), Terrell Davis (groin),  
Steve Atwater (shoulder), Neil Smith (abdomen), Darrien Gordon 
(shoulder) and Howard Griffith (knee). 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, meanwhile, listed two players as questionable --  
defensive end Lester Archambeau and fullback Brian Kozlowski, both 
with ankle injuries. Safety Devin Bush (hamstring) and defensive 
end Chuck Smith (leg) were listed as probable.

<HEADLINE>  Hungry Colombians Loot After Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Driven by hunger, survivors of a deadly  
earthquake clashed with police and stripped supermarket shelves 
clean Wednesday as shortages of food and antibiotics worsened the 
misery wrought by one of Colombia's worst disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll from Monday's magnitude-6 earthquake in western  
Colombia reached 878 dead and more than 3,410 injured Wednesday, 
Red Cross spokeswoman Maria Perrelet said. That number was expected 
to rise as more debris was cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of residents broke into stores in Armenia, the city  
hardest hit, and carried away liquor, furniture, appliances and 
food. Some threw rocks at police in riot gear trying to stop the 
mayhem. At least six civilians, including a local TV reporter, were 
injured by stones. 
</P>
<P>
	As the chaos grew, President Andres Pastrana headed to Armenia  
to direct the relief effort himself. And authorities dispatched 
scores of additional military police to try to restore order to the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue teams arrived from Britain and the United States to help  
find survivors and pull bodies from hundreds of downed buildings in 
this city of 300,000 people. Using heavy machinery, rescuers 
uncovered corpses throughout Armenia, but hope of finding new 
survivors was dwindling fast. 
</P>
<P>
	With need overwhelming available supplies, Armenia's residents  
took matters into their own hands, breaking down the gates of a 
downtown supermarket and stealing rice, cooking oil, flour and rum. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris fell from the upper reaches of the damaged four-story  
building housing the store, sending panicked looters fleeing into 
the street in fear the building would collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 27 aftershocks have struck Colombia since Monday, and a  
5.4-magnitude quake rocked the northeast Wednesday but caused no 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Valderrama, 30, and two friends pushed a red supermarket  
cart loaded with goods toward their home in the El Pradito Bajo 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't stealing. The store's totally destroyed, and nobody  
has a house, nobody has food. All this is to share with the 
people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armenia police Chief Col. Dagoberta Garcia watched helplessly.  
``We don't have the capacity to stop it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other police expressed sympathy for the looters.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't fight against hunger,'' said police Lt. Jorge Duque.  
</P>
<P>
	Throughout Armenia, people formed block-long lines at relief  
stations for food and clothes. Others jammed the city's main access 
roads in an attempt to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to eat. There's no milk. There's nothing,''  
said Edgar Angulo, 38, who stood despondent next to a rapidly 
emptying supply jeep. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims approached any stranger asking for help.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know where I can find a doctor?'' said Fernando  
Gomez, who said his children -- who have only eaten bread and sugar 
water since Monday -- were suffering from a virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake devastated a vast area of Colombia's coffee belt.  
Search and rescue officials say they expect the death toll to 
eventually exceed 1,000 in the 17 cities, towns and villages rocked 
by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Colombian coffee crop -- second-largest in the world  
after Brazil -- was not expected to be seriously affected even 
though several coffee processing plants were damaged, agricultural 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Ministry dispatched workers to fumigate the  
hardest-hit areas to prevent outbreaks of malaria and to kill rats 
in debris-strewn sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Nestor Humberto Martinez estimated it would  
cost at least $100 million to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was bitter disappointment amid the ruins Wednesday,  
a bit of joy emerged. Onlookers cheered and clapped when a 
16-year-old boy, David Acevedo, was found alive after spending 44 
hours under heavy cement slabs. He drank his own urine to survive, 
his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pained voices of two children heard under the debris of  
one building late Tuesday had gone silent by Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still searching,'' said Cesar Augusto Giraldo, a Civil  
Defense rescue worker. 
</P>
<P>
	At one flattened apartment building, Jose Noe Lozano looked on  
as orange-helmeted workers removed slabs of concrete from atop his 
two sons. A power saw whirred and sparks flew as a man cut through 
a three-inch slab to reveal the face of 15-year-old Sebastian, his 
right arm outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Breathing deeply, Lozano looked at the sky, then dropped his  
head and shook with sobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sebastian's 10-year-old brother, Hernan, their grandmother and a  
neighbor had been on the fourth floor of the El Prado apartment 
building, having lunch when the quake struck. Officials expect to 
find at least a dozen more bodies in the building's wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Japanese technicians headed to Armenia to help in  
recovery efforts, and the United States and Mexico sent search and 
rescue teams. Russia sent searchers, doctors and aid workers, and 
the European Union offered more than $1 million in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	France and Germany were jointly sending 12 tons of supplies and  
heavy equipment to remove debris, as well as a 55-member disaster 
team. Chile and Peru dispatched tons of medicines and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, meanwhile, denounced price hikes in caskets due  
to the surge in demand, and promised free coffins. But relief 
workers were still forced to wrap many of the bodies in black 
plastic or blankets and leave them on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have enough coffins to bury the dead,'' admitted  
Quindio state Gov. Henry Gomez.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Floats $100M Salmon Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With salmon troubles in the Pacific Northwest  
growing, President Clinton proposed Wednesday spending $100 million 
next year to help bring back the precious fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which would be matched by state and local dollars,  
would help pay for state-driven efforts in Alaska, Washington, 
Oregon and California such as protecting land near streams, 
reducing stream sediment and improving water quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to help you bring the salmon back,'' Clinton told  
state officials and an Indian tribe representative in a conference 
call. ``If we work together, I'm sure that we can succeed in 
restoring this symbol of your region's heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the four states say the money is needed in part  
because the National Marine Fisheries Service could add 13 more 
salmon groups to the threatened and endangered species list in 
March. The agency has already listed 15 salmon populations since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	While past listings have mostly affected less populated areas,  
the new listings could hurt the economies of populated regions in 
western Washington and western Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that while we have a lot of money for the listing  
... we've got very few resources for ... on-the-ground watershed 
restoration and fish recovery,'' Gov. John Kitzhaber, D-Ore., told 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The state officials said they were pleased with the  
announcement, even though they had requested $200 million a year 
for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Northwest lawmakers must persuade Congress to approve the  
funds, and that won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some House appropriators sharply cut the authorization for  
salmon projects last year, complaining that past spending seemed to 
have no effect on fish populations. Northwest lawmakers later 
managed to restore most of the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who was with Clinton for the  
announcement, said he had spoken privately with Republicans and 
Democrats and was optimistic the money would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who chairs the interior subcommittee  
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, wants $310 million for the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed the amount is not larger,'' Gorton said after  
Clinton's announcement. ``But this is a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who was with Clinton during the Oval  
Office conference call, said each state would probably receive 
about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get started and you've got to ramp it up,'' he  
said. ``I think if we show we are using the money wisely, there's a 
chance we can increase the funding for this'' in future years. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the $100 million, Clinton also will request a $25  
million increase for National Marine Fisheries Service salmon 
efforts, $12 million for the removal of two dams on the Elwha River 
on Washington state's Olympic Peninsula and $1.7 million for the 
Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of the Willamette 
River temperature control project in Oregon.

<HEADLINE> S. Carolina Wants To End Photo Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The state wants to renege on its sale of  
3.5 million driver's license photos to a private company and went 
to court Wednesday to block their use following a public outcry 
about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to angry callers to radio shows and state departments,  
the governor also promised to make it easier for people to keep 
their photos from being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5,000 sale of license photos for use only in fraud  
prevention was authorized by the Legislature, but Attorney General 
Charlie Condon said the state's constitutional guarantee of privacy 
is more important. Condon filed suit to keep the photos from being 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data LLC, which is developing a fraud-prevention system,  
could get a partial refund, Condon said. A Circuit Court hearing 
was set for Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	At Image Data in Nashua, N.H., spokeswoman Lorna Christie said  
the action caught the company by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores using its system to prevent check and credit-card fraud  
can get a person's photo on a screen for eight seconds. It cannot 
be printed, modified or saved and is encrypted when it is sent to 
the store, and Image Data does not resell the photo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges said he ordered the Public Safety  
Department to create a form making it easy for drivers to put their 
pictures off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Carolina drivers will have the right to decide not to  
have their license photo sold to the highest bidder,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was signed in January 1998 under the administration  
of former Republican Gov. David Beasley, but was not publicized 
until a story Saturday in The Greenville News. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, legislators authorized the sale to raise extra money  
for Public Safety, which includes the Motor Vehicle Division and 
the Highway Patrol.

<HEADLINE> Low-Power Radio Stations Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wilmer Urgelles wants to start a low-tech,  
low-cost radio station that would air Sunday services, Bible 
studies and Christian music in Spanish, something he says would be 
useful to the many elderly members who have trouble getting around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in such need of a station like this,'' said Urgelles of  
the Iglesia Cristiana El Buen Samaritano in Princeton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 church and community members think so, too. They  
signed petitions in support of the radio station that were sent to 
the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is expected Thursday to take a first step to help  
churches, schools, city governments and community and interest 
groups get on the air, reversing two decades of policy opposing 
such licenses. Commercial broadcasters remain leery of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will offer proposals to create thousands of new  
low-power FM radio stations across the country. These ``micro'' 
radio broadcasters would operate with low power levels from 1 watt 
to 1,000 watts and would be licensed by the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an opportunity to create new alternative voices on the  
airwaves,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on the height of the antenna and the terrain, a 1-watt  
station typically serves an area with a diameter of about two miles 
-- and a 1,000-watt station an area with a diameter of up to 18 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals also address the issue of consolidation in the  
radio industry, which has made it increasingly difficult for the 
voices of minorities and community groups to be heard, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 law triggered rapid consolidation in the industry by  
relaxing limits on the number of radio stations held by any one 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would bring radio back to the neighborhood,'' said Cheryl  
Leanza, an attorney with the Media Access Project, a public 
interest law firm. ``It's a very low-technology, low-cost way to 
get your voice on the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to help regular FM stations grow and become  
financially solid, the FCC stopped licensing low-powered FM radio 
stations around 1978. As a result, just 133 mostly educational, 
low-powered FM stations now exist. The University of Maryland at 
College Park, which has a 10-watt station, is an example. 
</P>
<P>
	Some city governments have expressed interest in starting a  
low-power FM station to air transportation and weather information 
in the mornings, plus community news and city council meetings 
later in the day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	High school journalism teachers like the idea of a low-cost  
station for students to learn practical skills, and principals want 
to use it to air basketball games and other sports events. 
</P>
<P>
	But the radio industry opposes the idea, saying it would create  
interference with other radio stations, said National Association 
of Broadcasters' spokesman John Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, a strong supporter of the new licenses, countered  
broadcasters' predictions, saying his agency will protect existing 
radio services. ``We don't want to do anything that is going to 
prevent consumers from getting good, interference-free radio,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are subject to revision, public comment and  
another vote before they would take effect. The FCC is supposed to 
seek public comment on whether the stations should be 
noncommercial, commercial or a mix. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also unclear what standards any group -- including  
special-interest groups -- would have to meet to get a low-power 
license. Right now to get a higher-power license, companies 
generally must show they want to serve a particular area -- plus 
provide information about any past criminal record or 
discrimination dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a station gets a license, the FCC will investigate a  
listener's complaint about anything offensive said on-air. But the 
agency only rarely revokes licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-powered stations are cheaper to build because the equipment  
isn't as expensive. In addition to avoiding the big expense of 
building a tower for antennas, stations likely will have an easier 
time getting zoning approval for smaller rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs can be as low as $2,500 for a 1-watt station to $100,000  
and up for a 1,000-watt station, FCC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgelles said his church has raised $50,000 for a studio, which  
is already built. But he's flexible about the power level the 
church needs. ``Whatever we can get, we can use.''

<HEADLINE> Arguments End in Teen Lynching Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARFIELD, Pa. (AP) -- A defense attorney said Wednesday that  
teen-agers who accuse a 16-year-old girl of lynching a 
learning-disabled girl are liars out to save their own skin. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing 13 hours of testimony, the jury was to begin  
deliberating Jessica Holtmeyer's fate Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holtmeyer faces the death penalty if convicted in the  
killing of 15-year-old Kimberly Dotts, who was hanged in some woods 
in front of several teens before her head was smashed with a rock 
the size of a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teen-agers pleaded guilty to lesser charges and testified  
against Ms. Holtmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly was hoping to make friends when she was invited to  
sleep over at one of the teen's homes in May. But she found herself 
in the woods with a group of kids she barely knew who were planning 
to run away to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone complained that Kimberly -- short, overweight and  
learning-disabled -- might ``snitch'' on them. A noose was pulled 
over her head, the other end slung over a maple branch, and Ms. 
Holtmeyer and 18-year-old Aaron Straw yanked on the rope with all 
their strength, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Bryan S. Walk, who called just one witness,  
said in closing arguments that jurors should disregard all of the 
``unbelievable, unreliable and outrageous'' testimony the teens 
gave. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw -- who testified only after District Attorney Paul Cherry  
said he would consider not asking for the death penalty against him 
-- lied to get the deal, Walk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walk detailed numerous contradictions among the teens'  
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry, however, said the discrepancies are understandable and  
that the teens corroborate each other on every important point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beware of identical stories,'' Cherry said. ``That's the  
hallmark of a made-up story.''

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Sunday Has New Meaning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For more than three decades, Super Bowl Sunday  
meant little to the Atlanta Falcons. It was a day to spend almost 
anywhere but in front of a television set, watching two other teams 
vie for the NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than two decades, Super Bowl Sunday was downright  
painful for the Denver Broncos. It was a day for fans to stay away 
from their TV sets to avoid the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	When they meet at Pro Player Stadium on Sunday, both teams might  
spend a moment reflecting on just how far they've come in the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Broncos, their sixth Super Bowl is entirely unlike all  
the others. They've come here as champions, carrying a 
self-confidence and, yes, a swagger that they gained by finally 
winning the big game. 
</P>
<P>
	They're even keeping a light-hearted atmosphere at practices. On  
Wednesday, a light plane trailing a message of ``Broncos' Keith 
Burns at Beachplace Today 7-10 p.m.'' drew some good-natured 
razzing from his teammates, who yelled, `You Da Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, never before a championship factor, finished 7-9 in  
1997. Yet now they've come to Miami with the highest of 
expectations, a slight sense of awe mixed in with a heavy dose of 
innocence, and the recognition of how different things are this 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	While both are playing for the same reward, they are approaching  
the chance to be atop their profession from entirely different 
perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Happily for Denver, that means not having to answer all those  
``Why did you lose?'' questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot more pleasant, the fact you're not talking about  
past Super Bowl failures all the time,'' John Elway said. ``It's a 
heck of a lot more positive. From 1988 until last year, I answered 
the question whether my career would be complete without a Super 
Bowl victory. I haven't had to answer that question since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the questions are about repeats and dynasties. The Broncos  
are so self-assured that they have no problem dealing with those 
topics. In the past, they merely hoped they could win a Super Bowl. 
Now, they know they can. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you get into a game of this magnitude and lose four  
in a row, it definitely takes some wind out of your sails,'' said 
Mike Lodish, who went through his own personal Super Bowl trauma 
(0-4) with Buffalo before joining Denver and getting that first 
title 12 months ago. He wasn't even in the league when the Broncos 
lost their fourth Super Bowl in as many tries in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win it is something you can't measure, the feeling you get  
is so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That feeling has bred a boldness and created a confidence in the  
Broncos that is immediately noticeable. Where previous AFC champs 
from Denver seemed to fear what might happen in the Super Bowl, 
these guys can't wait to prove their mettle once more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we had all the questions about never having won a  
Super Bowl,'' placekicker Jason Elam said. ``We were big underdogs 
to the Packers and no one gave us a chance against them. I think 
there was more pressure on us in that game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This season, we came in expecting to go back. We're playing  
with a lot of confidence, but at the same time, we're not 
complacent. We're not taking the Falcons for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But just about everyone else took them for granted for nearly as  
long as the Super Bowl has existed. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been clear all week that the Falcons -- with the rare  
exceptions of Cornelius Bennett, Eugene Robinson and coach Dan 
Reeves -- feel privileged to be here. They might not be in over 
their heads, but they aren't exactly old hands at this Super Bowl 
stuff, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through 12 hard years of blood, sweat and tears,''  
Jessie Tuggle said, ``and to finally get here, how much sweeter can 
it be than that? I wanted to be a part of the solution for the 
Atlanta Falcons after so many years of losing. It's a long time 
coming for me, us, the organization and the whole city. Nobody at 
the beginning of the season thought the Atlanta Falcons would be 
here in Super Bowl 33.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But here they are, 14 1/2 months removed from a 1-7 record. And  
getting healthier for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Lester Archambeau (ankle) and fullback-tight end  
Brian Kozlowski, both starters, went through a full practice 
Wednesday. If there are no complications, Reeves expects them to be 
listed as probable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we practiced good,'' Reeves said. ``The tempo was  
good, the concentration was good, all the things you look for were 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't always that way for this beleaguered franchise, of  
course. But it's a measure of the Falcons' mettle that past demons 
have not cropped up in this special season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a lot to do with how do you respond when you are not in  
the playoffs and the organization is struggling,'' Chuck Smith 
said. ``How do you respond? We've shown how we respond.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Still a Major Draw at Gate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson doesn't need to be the heavyweight  
champion to be boxing's biggest attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	That was apparent Wednesday in figures released by Nevada boxing  
officials that showed Tyson's comeback fight against Francois Botha 
to be the sixth biggest live gate in state boxing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Athletic Commission said 10,221 people paid full  
ticket prices to get into the fight at the MGM Grand hotel-casino. 
The fight grossed $7,051,800 for the live gate, dashing predictions 
by many before the bout that ticket sales would be underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	The live gate trailed only four other Tyson fights and the first  
Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez fight for total money brought 
in at the gate. The biggest grossing fight in Nevada history was 
Tyson's infamous ear-biting of Evander Holyfield, which had a live 
gate of $14,277,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare him to anybody else, it's unbelievable,''  
said commission executive director Marc Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ability to draw fans to his fifth-round knockout of  
Botha was even more impressive because the Jan. 16 date was 
sandwiched in between two big Las Vegas weekends and the fight 
promotion was hastily put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 750,000 people paid an average of $45 to buy the  
pay-per-view of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	With a live gate tax of 4 percent and a television tax of  
$50,000, Nevada earned about $330,000 in taxes on the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a promoter or a fighter in the world that wouldn't  
love to have those type of numbers,'' promoter Dan Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the reason for Tyson's live gate success was because of  
the high ticket prices, which ranged from $200 in the upper balcony 
of the hotel's arena to $1,200 at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the crowd in an arena that seats about 15,000 was far  
above what some had predicted when only a few thousand seats were 
sold the week before the fight. The announced attendance at the 
fight was 12,519, with the others getting in on reduced or 
complimentary tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reports just weren't accurate leading up to the fight,''  
Goossen said. ``I'm not pointing fingers at the media, but they end 
up looking at the glass half empty rather than half full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is scheduled to fight again April 24 at the MGM Grand  
against one of a handful of different opponents his promoters said 
they are still negotiating with.

<HEADLINE> TV Execs Buoyed by Midseason Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What seemed like a dead television season has  
suddenly turned a little lively. 
</P>
<P>
	The debut of the cartoon drudge ``Dilbert'' achieved the highest  
ratings for a comedy in UPN's four-year history Monday night, the 
latest in a string of midseason success stories for viewer-starved 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's uplifting ``Providence'' is off to a faster start than any  
NBC drama since ``ER,'' Fox is pleased with its animated comedy 
``The PJs,'' and CBS has so far successfully cloned ``60 Minutes'' 
on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quieted -- at least for now -- all the talk of dying  
broadcast networks that had grown louder with a lackluster fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shows that launched this midseason all have one thing in  
common: Generally speaking, they're excellent shows,'' said UPN 
programming chief Tom Nunan. ``These shows all have an original 
voice to them and they're of unusual quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the initial success may also force executives to rethink the  
wisdom of launching dozens of new shows each September, 
overwhelming viewers with options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knew they were coming,'' said Sandy Grushow,  
president of Twentieth Century Fox Television. ``Why did everybody 
know they were coming? Well, they weren't competing with 50 other 
shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A midseason start enables networks to promote the shows one at a  
time, which Nunan said particularly helped ``Dilbert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	January is truly prime time: Winter forces more viewers indoors  
and light post-holiday advertising gives networks extra time to 
tout their own programs, said Gene DeWitt of DeWitt Media, an 
advertising buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood's tradition of starting most shows in fall is largely  
dictated by advertisers. TV executives announce a fall schedule in 
May so advertisers can buy commercial time on what they think will 
be hot shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite critical praise for ``Sportsnight,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace''  
and ``Cupid,'' none of last September's shows can be called hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all to some extent a prisoner of the system that has  
been in place for so long,'' said Lloyd Braun, chairman of Buena 
Vista Television Production. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately that tradition has eroded. ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``King  
of the Hill'' are two shows that successfully launched the last few 
winters. CBS's ``Becker'' was an early-season replacement that last 
week made Nielsen Media Research's top 10 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's lesson may mean fewer new shows next fall, Nunan  
said. His worry is that January will eventually become as crowded 
as September. 
</P>
<P>
	Midseason starts don't guarantee success, though. NBC's  
``Lateline'' failed last winter and failed again when it came back 
this month. CBS's ``Turks'' hasn't broken any records. 
</P>
<P>
	The real test for the new hotshots will be if people come back  
after the initial curiosity fades, said Preston Beckman, NBC's 
executive vice president of program planning and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's encouraging that networks can still collect a large  
number of people to watch our shows, I think it will be hard on us 
if we convince ourselves that there's something about midseason,'' 
Beckman said. ``I think there's something about great shows.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Set To Make Lewinsky a Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are ready to make Monica  
Lewinsky a witness in President Clinton's impeachment trial, 
dashing even some GOP hopes for ending the case this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But revived talks among senators offered the chance for a  
bipartisan timetable for a final vote on the articles of 
impeachment against Clinton by the middle of next month, after 
witnesses are deposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were expected to muster party-line majorities today  
to defeat a Democratic motion to dismiss the impeachment case and 
approve witness depositions. Democrats, however, can demonstrate 
the strength to block the two-thirds majority needed to oust 
Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott won over some wavering  
Republicans on the witness issue after House prosecutors Tuesday 
restricted their witness list to Ms. Lewinsky, the former White 
House intern at the center of the sex and cover-up scandal; Vernon 
Jordan, a Washington attorney and longtime Clinton friend; and 
Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
	The three would face private questioning in sessions likely to  
be videotaped, so that all senators could watch the depositions and 
determine whether to bring the witnesses in for live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the remainder of the trial, Senators from both parties  
emerged from three hours of closed-door deliberations Tuesday, 
confirming that revived negotiations were under way on a bipartisan 
timetable. If the talks were successful, the proceedings could end 
by the middle of next month, if not sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors on Tuesday asked the Senate to invite Clinton  
to testify, but the White House has rejected the idea and Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle called the proposal ``a red herring. 
It is not going anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle warned the trial would plod on indefinitely if witnesses  
were approved, and Clinton lawyer David Kendall said the White 
House would be ``faced with a critical need'' to review mountains 
of previous testimony before deciding whether to seek rebuttal 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, sensing the Senate will not remove Clinton, is considering  
a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to end the trial with 
two votes: the first on whether Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction and the second on whether he should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, interviewed today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''  
said, ``It is well-grounded both in the Constitution and precedents 
to have separate findings of fact, separate from the decision on 
whether or not the offenses ... justify removing him from office. 
Many of us are concerned about whether an acquittal vote -- what 
kind of message that would send to the White House and the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., scoffed at that proposal. ``Our  
vote is whether or not to remove the president,'' he said on ABC. 
``We can admit to the fact the president has not been truthful. ... 
But the question is a judgment question: Do we believe it is 
grounds for overturning an election.The answer is no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate, proposed  
ground rules for the witness depositions that would set a four-hour 
maximum for each sworn interrogation -- two hours of questioning by 
the House team and two hours for the president's lawyers. Witnesses 
could be questioned only about areas of factual dispute, and the 
sessions would be videotaped for senators to view. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said on CNN's ``Larry King Live''  
program Tuesday that he, along with GOP Reps. Bill McCollum of 
Florida, James Rogan of California and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas 
most likely would depose the witnesses for the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the depositions, the Senate would decide whether to  
approve live testimony in the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to question Jordan about his efforts to find  
Ms. Lewinsky a job at the same time she had been subpoenaed in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal is one of the White House aides to whom the president  
falsely denied having had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The article of impeachment alleging obstruction of justice says 
Clinton lied to his aides so they would pass on the false 
information to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors, who once talked of seeking up to 15  
witnesses, argued in the trial's public session Tuesday that 
senators should not decide the case just by reading thousands of 
pages of testimony and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demeanor, manner, truthfulness'' must sometimes be determined  
by live testimony, McCollum said, predicting that Ms. Lewinsky 
``will convey this story to you in a way that it cannot be conveyed 
off a piece of paper; it just cannot be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum also promised: ``At no point will we ask any questions  
of Monica Lewinsky about her explicit sexual relations with the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant asked: ``As triers of fact, wouldn't you want to observe  
the demeanor of Ms. Lewinsky and test her credibility? And 
remember, the president's attorneys ... have challenged Ms. 
Lewinsky's version of the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kendall questioned why the Republican team of managers  
didn't call witnesses in the House but rather ``rushed this through 
... because they had the votes. And now they want to delay in the 
Senate because they're afraid they don't have the votes. There is 
no reason .... to delay ... to drag out these proceedings and defer 
doing the business of the American people.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Pros To Play in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league baseball will allow any players not  
on 40-man rosters to participate in Olympic qualifying this year 
and at the 2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, the new executive director of baseball  
operations in the commissioner's office, said Wednesday that 
Olympic teams will have access to players about five days before 
this summer's Pan American Games, which serve as the regional 
Olympic qualifying tournament. The Pan Am Games baseball tournament 
is scheduled for July 24-Aug. 2 at Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Olympics will switch to wooden bats, following  
the rule of professional baseball in the United States and Canada. 
Baseball became an official Olympic sport for the 1992 Barcelona 
Games, and metal bats were used both that year and during the 1996 
Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said the nature of baseball made it unnecessary for  
national teams to need players for extensive preparation time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players will have been playing a full season,'' he said  
during an interview with The Associated Press. ``It's a matter of 
relay plays and cutoff throws and learning signs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the United States sending a team of college players, the  
Americans finished fourth in 1992 and third in 1996 as Cuba won the 
gold medal twice. The International Baseball Association voted in 
September 1996 to open Olympic baseball to professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the NBA, which sent Dream Teams to Barcelona and Atlanta,  
and the NHL, which sent all-star teams to represent the United 
States and Canada at last year's Nagano Winter Games, baseball has 
no intention of sending major leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Games are scheduled for Sept. 16-Oct. 1, the final  
two weeks of the American and National leagues' 2000 regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said all nations could have players who are not on  
40-man rosters for Olympic qualifying tournaments, even if it 
interrupts their minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Players not on 40-man rosters generally are in their first three  
years of professional baseball. If they are not put on a 40-man 
roster after that, they become subject to the December major league 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch to wood from metal should have a major effect on  
Olympic play. While 45 homers were hit in Barcelona, players 
combined for 110 homers in 28 games -- an average of 3.9 per game -- 
at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium during the last Olympics. Cuba 
alone hit 38 homers in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Seiler, the director of national team baseball operations  
for the U.S. Baseball Federation, said the switch to wood bats had 
not yet been put in writing but would be included in the technical 
instructions for the Pan Am Games. The U.S. team will be chosen 
jointly by the USBF, the commissioner's office and the Major League 
Baseball Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	By using minor leaguers, he said most teams would be improved,  
since Latin America is heavily represented among the 30 major 
league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all be pulling from same pool level-wise,'' Seiler said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Still a Major Draw at Gate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson doesn't need to be the heavyweight  
champion to be boxing's biggest attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	That was apparent Wednesday in figures released by Nevada boxing  
officials that showed Tyson's comeback fight against Francois Botha 
to be the sixth biggest live gate in state boxing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Athletic Commission said 10,221 people paid full  
ticket prices to get into the fight at the MGM Grand hotel-casino. 
The fight grossed $7,051,800 for the live gate, dashing predictions 
by many before the bout that ticket sales would be underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	The live gate trailed only four other Tyson fights and the first  
Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez fight for total money brought 
in at the gate. The biggest grossing fight in Nevada history was 
Tyson's infamous ear-biting of Evander Holyfield, which had a live 
gate of $14,277,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare him to anybody else, it's unbelievable,''  
said commission executive director Marc Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ability to draw fans to his fifth-round knockout of  
Botha was even more impressive because the Jan. 16 date was 
sandwiched in between two big Las Vegas weekends and the fight 
promotion was hastily put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 750,000 people paid an average of $45 to buy the  
pay-per-view of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	With a live gate tax of 4 percent and a television tax of  
$50,000, Nevada earned about $330,000 in taxes on the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a promoter or a fighter in the world that wouldn't  
love to have those type of numbers,'' promoter Dan Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the reason for Tyson's live gate success was because of  
the high ticket prices, which ranged from $200 in the upper balcony 
of the hotel's arena to $1,200 at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the crowd in an arena that seats about 15,000 was far  
above what some had predicted when only a few thousand seats were 
sold the week before the fight. The announced attendance at the 
fight was 12,519, with the others getting in on reduced or 
complimentary tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reports just weren't accurate leading up to the fight,''  
Goossen said. ``I'm not pointing fingers at the media, but they end 
up looking at the glass half empty rather than half full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is scheduled to fight again April 24 at the MGM Grand  
against one of a handful of different opponents his promoters said 
they are still negotiating with.

<HEADLINE> Air France Says It Faces Rough 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A day after the French government announced the  
partial selloff of Air France, the carrier's chairman acknowledged 
Wednesday the company faces a tough business environment in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Cyril Spinetta said Air France's revenue per passenger  
would drop by 4.5 percent this year. In 1998, airlines posted an 
average decline of 2 percent, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France plans to offset that drop with the continuation of an  
aggressive cost-cutting program, with the goal of reducing costs 
per passenger by 10 percent over the next three years, Spinetta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinetta shied away from giving specific earnings forecasts,  
saying only that results ``will be significantly positive'' for the 
year ended March 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-day strike by Air France pilots last June just as the World  
Cup was getting underway cost the airline an estimated 200 million 
francs ($35.7 million), an amount that will likely skew 1998 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinetta spoke after the French finance ministry announced late  
Tuesday that Air France would open up about one-sixth of its 
capital to outside investors as part of a long-awaited plan to 
partially privatize the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	France's transportation minister said Wednesday, however, that a  
full privatization of the state-owned carrier would not take place. 
Under the selloff plan, the state's share of Air France will 
eventually fall to around 53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Warns About Exotic Sea Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- They sound like creepy science fiction  
plots: Asian clams devouring plankton in San Francisco Bay, comb 
jelly decimating Black Sea anchovies and predatory snails 
overtaking oyster beds in Chesapeake Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	So-called ``bioinvasion'' scenarios, however, are real and may  
be coming to a coast near you. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists warned Tuesday that the number of sea invaders has  
grown exponentially -- and swelled into a multibillion-dollar 
problem -- as fishermen inadvertently dump exotic species, foreign 
bacteria and viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	The critters are often found lurking in cargo holds or in  
ballast water, pumped in to stabilize ships during their voyage and 
then pumped out when they reach their destination. Once the 
invaders take hold, they can devour native species, alter food 
chains and change whole ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of global marine hitchhikers and now is the  
time to take action,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who 
spoke at the first international Marine Bioinvasions Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bioinvasion costs government and industry $123 billion a year to  
control on land and at sea, Babbitt said, citing a study released 
at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	In the San Francisco Bay area -- where there are more than 250  
known exotic invaders -- one of the most voracious predators has 
been the Asian clam introduced in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The mud-dwelling clams feed by filtering out food particles in  
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clams have been filtering out so much of the water that we  
haven't seen annual blooms of phytoplankton since the 1980s,'' said 
Andy Cohen, a marine biologist for the San Francisco Estuary 
Institute in Richmond, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Creatures that eat phytoplankton have been stripped of an  
essential food source, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along New England coasts, a type of Japanese algae is  
aggressively taking root, while a New England organism called a 
comb jelly was exported to the Black Sea and has decimated an 
economically important anchovy fishery. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists used to introduce predator species to control  
invaders. But now, fearing new species could further threaten 
ecosystems, scientists are trying to stop the invaders before they 
make it to foreign waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt called for mandatory ballast water exchange programs and  
urged Congress to work on bioinvasion before it becomes a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballast exchange programs would require a ship coming from the  
Mediterranean, for example, to dump its ballast water in deep seas 
-- at least 200 miles from shore and about 2,000 feet deep -- then 
replace it with deep sea water. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory is that organisms found in deep sea water have a  
harder time surviving in water closer to the coasts, and vice 
versa, said Deb Tanis, a Massachusetts project manager working on a 
ballast exchange program with New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> National Forest To Protect Toad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- Concerns over an  
endangered toad prompted the closure of part of the Angeles 
National Forest, including 17 miles of off-road vehicle trails, the 
U.S. Forest Service said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers worked to seal off 3,000 acres of the 650,000-acre  
forest north of Los Angeles. The area will remain closed until 
February 2003, said Angeles National Forest Service spokeswoman 
Randi Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
	The endangered arroyo toad once hopped throughout much of  
Southern California and northwestern Mexico, but it has been driven 
from 75 percent of its range. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past three years, the Forest Service has shut down a  
much smaller area for a limited time in the hope of saving the 
toad. But after discouraging results, the closings have been 
expanded, Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The toads, which don't grow much longer than three inches, are  
distinguished by green or tan skin and warty dark spots. They live 
near rivers with shallow pools near sandy areas. 
</P>
<P>
	One group planned to appeal the closings.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to stop, I'd estimate, 99 percent of the off-road  
recreationalists there,'' said Barret Wetherby, secretary of Public 
Lands for the People.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Rise at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices rose Thursday morning spurred  
by buying of high technology blue-chip stocks. The dollar rose 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 72.27 points, or 0.50 percent,  
to 14,522.33 to end the morning session. On Tuesday, the average 
rose 68.05 points, or 0.47 percent, for a third day of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.44 yen, up 1.62 yen from its level late  
Wednesday in Tokyo but lower than its level of 115.82 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were increasingly optimistic the government will use  
public funds to help buoy the Nikkei index above 16,000 points by 
late March, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Nikkei finishes the fiscal year ending March 31 below  
16,527 -- the closing level last fiscal year -- many companies will 
be forced to report losses on their shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	However, concern over the poor outlook for corporate earnings  
was still weighing down the market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 6.65 points, or 0.60 percent, to 1,122.02. The 
TOPIX closed up 5.49 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar stayed above  
its level on Wednesday, but retreated slightly from strong gains 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the dollar moved sharply higher against the yen  
after the London-based Financial Times reported Japanese banks were 
hiding losses by making pretend-trades in Japanese Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency's dip in early Tokyo trading was due to  
profit-taking by Japanese exporters and institutional investors, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
rose to 1.835 percent from 1.810 percent late Wednesday, driving 
down its price to 99.71 yen from 99.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Faces Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- On the eve of Nagano Winter Olympics, Juan Antonio  
Samaranch bragged about the success and health of the Olympic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something isn't broken, don't fix it,'' he said. ``The  
Olympic movement is in very good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Samaranch is besieged with calls for his  
resignation. Many blame him for the worst corruption scandal in 
Olympic history, which has prompted the expulsion or forced 
resignation of nine IOC members implicated in misconduct in Salt 
Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard was appointed IOC president in 1980 and  
is the third longest-serving behind American Avery Brundage 
(1952-72) and Pierre de Coubertin, the French baron who founded the 
IOC (1896-1925). 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over in 1980 in Moscow, the Olympic movement had  
been hit by terrorism, was facing bankruptcy and was brought to its 
knees by the catastrophic boycott of the 1980 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Spanish diplomat, he used quiet diplomacy and his  
skills as a businessman to turn the Olympics into the most 
prestigious sporting event in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The success made him more recognizable than most world leaders,  
many of whom fall over each other to curry his favor and be 
photographed with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is credited with building the games into a  
multibillion- dollar industry, largely based on lucrative TV rights 
deals and the fierce competition among cities to land them. 
</P>
<P>
	With success has also come criticism about the rampant  
commercialism of the games. Samaranch has been characterized as 
``dictatorial,'' a despot ruling over an inherently undemocratic, 
self-appointed body that lacks the normal financial controls of a 
multinational corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the IOC is incapable of policing itself, suggesting  
that Samaranch's greatest legacy to the Olympics would be his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not thinking of any kind of resignation,'' he said,  
adding there wasn't ``a single'' call within the IOC for him to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to his authoritarian image, Samaranch describes himself  
as ``the conductor'' who delegates to the 11-member IOC executive 
board. ``I'm not the boss,'' he likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is a small, shy man, visibly uncomfortable in the  
public spotlight and lacking the charisma associated with the most 
powerful man in international sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He's the IOC's first full-time executive and the first to live  
full-time in Lausanne, Switzerland, the IOC's headquarters. He 
receives no salary and works essentially as a volunteer, although 
he has said the next IOC president should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC pays the rent on a small hotel suite in Lausanne, which  
costs $220 when he's there and $72 when he's away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' Samaranch said. ``I am a normal man. My  
style of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I 
have no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board member Richard Pound described his lifestyle  
as ``practically monastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former boxer and roller hockey goalie who never competed for  
an Olympic medal, Samaranch grew up in Barcelona as the son of a 
wealthy textile magnate and still holds the honorary title of 
president of the Barcelona-based La Caixa, Spain's largest savings 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed an IOC member in 1966 and came to the IOC  
presidency after three years as Spain's ambassador to the 
then-Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of his tenure came in 1992 when his native  
Barcelona played host to what's considered the most successful 
Summer Games of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	A low moment came earlier in the year with the publication of  
the book ``The Lords of the Rings,'' which charged the Olympic 
movement with being corrupt, undemocratic and consumed by 
commercialism and greed. 
</P>
<P>
	The book honed in on Samaranch's past in Spain, recounting his  
rise through the political ranks during the 36-year rule of 
dictator Francisco Franco, which ended with his death in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The book describes Samaranch as a ``dedicated Francoist'' who  
supported Franco's conglomeration of right-wing parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the people know what I did, and I am very proud what I  
did,'' Samaranch said, calling the book full of ``lies'' and 
``mistakes'' and adding that Anglo-Saxons hate the thought of a 
Latin running the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Spain know very well that I was collaborating  
with the Franco regime, like many others,'' he added. ``We are very 
proud of what we did. We went from the Franco regime to a full 
democracy in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who at the time said he was leaning toward stepping  
down in 1993, said the book gave him a reason to run for another 
term and show he had the support of the IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	He was re-elected by acclamation in 1993 and in 1995 IOC members  
pushed through a rule change raising the retirement age from 75 to 
80, which cleared the way for Samaranch to run again in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He was re-elected by acclamation to four-year term in September  
1997 -- his third re-election -- and has vowed to stay until his 2001 
mandate runs out. Prior to being engulfed in scandal, there were 
thoughts that IOC members might urge him to stand again. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch will put his leadership to a vote of confidence at a  
special IOC session March 17-18. Only if he fails to get the 
members' endorsement will he resign, Samaranch said. The chances of 
his losing the vote are remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has appointed 94 IOC members. The body had 115 members  
-- including Samaranch -- prior to the expulsion or resignation of 
the nine. Of the 14 implicated in the scandal, Samaranch appointed 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain the Olympic movement will emerge from the crisis  
stronger than ever,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leading candidates to succeed Samaranch are IOC  
members Richard Pound (Canada), Kevan Gosper (Australia), Jacques 
Rogge (Belgium), Thomas Bach (Germany) and Anita DeFrantz (United 
States).

<HEADLINE> Feds Pay Some of Detroit Snow Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The federal government will reimburse Detroit for  
part of the city's snow-clearing costs from a blizzard that buried 
the Motor City this month under about 2 feet of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	The money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will  
cover 75 percent of Detroit's snow-removal costs during a 48-hour 
period the city must select, Anthony Neely, Mayor Dennis Archer's 
spokesman, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neely said the city's Department of Public Works spent at least  
$2.5 million on clearing the snow. The department also paid about 
$1 million to independent contractors who helped plow the snow, 
Neely said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer will confer with city directors involved in the snow  
plowing and road salting to pinpoint the two-day period best for 
reimbursement, Neely said. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow clogged streets, hampered mail delivery and closed  
schools in the state's largest district. Archer was criticized by 
angry residents because the city adhered to a decades-old policy of 
not plowing residential streets.

<HEADLINE> Fourth IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A Kenyan implicated in the Salt Lake City  
bribery scandal today became the fourth International Olympic 
Committee member to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Mukora said he resigned ``on principle.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest,'' Mukora said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC on Sunday named Mukora as one of nine International  
Olympic Committee members who received an under-the-table payment 
from Salt Lake City when it bid to play host to the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Mukora, who is a wealthy man in his own right,  
received $34,650. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lausanne-based organization recommended he resign before  
being ousted at next month's IOC board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora had told the IOC panel the payments were made in support  
of ``sports development in Kenya'' and for ``world youth sporting 
activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the IOC concluded that Mukora accepted the payment for ``his  
personal benefit'' and should be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Mukora, an IOC member since 1990, has been chairman of the Kenya  
Olympics Association and first vice chairman of the Commonwealth 
Games Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Embattled IOC chief Juan Antonio Samaranch on Monday defended  
criticism of him and the Olympics, saying he had no intention of 
resigning and that he lives a modest life. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard is trying to restore his image and that  
of the IOC in the wake of the Olympics' biggest corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' he said. ``I am a normal man. My style  
of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I have 
no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like big dinners, big lunches. I am doing my best to  
try to be fit with physical exercises every morning. That's my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three members resigned last week in the scandal: Finland's Pirjo  
Haeggman, Libya's Bashir Mohammed Attarabulsi and Swaziland's David 
Sibandze. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ``exluded'' were Mukora, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador,  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed 
Abdel-Gadir of Sudan, Lamine Keita of Mali and Sergio Santander of 
Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch member Anton Geesink received a warning.  
</P>
<P>
	Three others remain under investigation and face possible  
expulsion: Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of 
South Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Morten Andersen is paying back the ones who helped  
get him to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Not the linemen who blocked for him or the guys who held the  
ball for his field goals and extra points, but the people who took 
care of him when he was an exchange student from Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen, whose overtime field goal against Minnesota lifted the  
Atlanta Falcons to the NFC championship, brought the families who 
housed him as a high school student in Indianapolis and in college 
at Michigan State to the Super Bowl this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm bring them in because they deserve to be a part of this,''  
Andersen said. ``I'm also bringing in the lady from Michigan who 
took care of me when I was in college. I want to remember people 
who were good to me when I was living on $150 a month and when I 
barely spoke English. It's payback time, and that's how I feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen never played football until his kicking prowess at an  
open tryout landed him on his high school team and ultimately to 
Michigan State and the New Orleans Saints and Falcons. He is an 
eight-time Pro Bowl kicker and No. 2 on the career list of 
field-goal kickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I came here was to open my mind and get good  
exposure to a different culture, language and people,'' Andersen 
said. ``I've never been what you call a `football player.' In high 
school, I would kick off and haul myself to the sideline as fast as 
I could. Covering kicks is still not something I cherish. I rely on 
the other 10 guys to do their thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, I did crush Deion Sanders when I was on the Saints  
and he was on the Falcons. Actually, I just knocked him out of 
bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week's overtime game-winner, Andersen's most famous  
kick was a shanked chip shot that let Jacksonville reach the NFL 
playoffs in 1997, leading to the Jaguars' even more shocking run to 
the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt bad about it because it was the last kick of the season  
and I had a whole year to think about it,'' Andersen said. ``It was 
a humbling experience, but I finally realized one kick should not 
define a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few minutes before Andersen's overtime kick, Minnesota's  
Gary Anderson missed his first kick of the entire season, a field 
goal that would have given the Vikings a 10-point lead with barely 
two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	That miss kept the Falcons' hopes alive, but Andersen knew just  
how Anderson felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous year for him -- not missing a field goal or  
extra point -- but I think he missed it because it was our time,'' 
Andersen said. ``I don't know if you can call it fate, but the way 
we played all year long, we willed it to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's surprising run to the Super Bowl did cost Denmark its  
most famous color commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	For the previous seven years, Andersen worked on the live Danish  
telecast of the Super Bowl. But low advertising rates for the 
post-midnight broadcast prompted the nationwide station, TV3, to 
drop the game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	That is, until Andersen kicked the Falcons into Sunday's  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like the Danish people to feel like they're part of it,''  
he said. ``Even though I'm a small part of the team, I want them to 
be excited that Denmark is involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said his commentating is no threat to John Madden.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was strange because you have to work from the U.S. network  
video feed,'' Andersen said. ``Madden would circle a guy's stomach 
and you didn't know if he was talking about what he had for dinner. 
So you would be at their mercy as far as commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be on the other side of the microphones this  
year.''

<HEADLINE> Trial May Determine Lott's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite his customary smiles for the cameras,  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is not having an easy time with 
President Clinton's impeachment trial, colleagues and advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, even before the proceedings began on Jan. 7, it has  
been a difficult, daily balancing act with implications for the 
Republican Party and his own political future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a political kidney stone,'' said Ed Rogers, a longtime  
Republican operative who informally has been giving Lott advice. 
``It is painful, it is all-consuming, but when it's over, it's 
over. He'll come out just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe. Day after day, Lott is being tugged by two competing GOP  
interests. Conservatives want a full-bore effort to eject Clinton 
from the White House, while pragmatists fret that Republican 
candidates will be hurt in 2000 if the trial seems too partisan and 
lasts too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Lott is in a really difficult spot,'' said Ralph Reed,  
a GOP consultant and former executive director of the Christian 
Coalition. ``But the only thing the conservative base asks for is a 
full and fair hearing, and Trent Lott hasn't stood in the way of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping for a way out of the trial of the still-popular  
president, Senate Republicans floated a plan today that could end 
it by Feb. 6. But noting that the proposal would allow no time for 
White House lawyers to question witnesses, Democrats reacted with 
skepticism. Negotiations were likely between Lott and Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's decisions on questions like calling witnesses and the  
trial's timetable are crucial for a GOP whose Senate control could 
be at stake in 2000. Nineteen Republican incumbents face 
re-election next year, including 13 from states that Clinton 
carried in 1996, many in the moderate Northeast and Midwest. Lott 
himself faces re-election next year, but is considered sure to win. 
</P>
<P>
	With a possible future run for the White House himself, Lott  
also must weigh the impact his decisions will have on conservative 
voters, who dominate Republican presidential primaries. 
Conservatives are especially sensitive to anything that could be 
viewed as letting Clinton off the hook, including making sure the 
charges are not dismissed prematurely and without witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to be Senator Lott right now,'' said Tom  
Katina, executive director of the American Conservative Union. ``I 
don't think anybody would. This is a large challenge, and it's one 
of the things that will define him as a leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott got off to a rough start. Before the trial began, he said  
he didn't think witnesses would be required. He also seemed to 
endorse an early proposal by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and 
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that could have ended the entire trial 
in a week without witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He abandoned both after they drew fire from many GOP senators,  
the 13 House Republican managers prosecuting the case against 
Clinton and outside conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Those missteps recalled past clashes he has had since becoming  
Senate majority leader in June 1996. A conservative at heart but 
deal-maker by nature, Lott has been lambasted by conservatives for 
his role in passing an international chemical weapons treaty and 
budget-balancing deal in 1997 and a huge spending bill late in 
1998, plus the GOP failure to win tax cuts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But since his unsteady beginning, Lott has drawn mostly good --  
though wary -- reviews from Republicans of all stripes in helping 
guide the Senate through a process untraversed since the 1868 
impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were upset when they saw that first proposal,'' Marty  
Dannenfelser, lobbyist for the conservative Family Research 
Council, said of the Gorton-Lieberman plan. ``But there's been more 
of a feeling lately that he's been holding the line more 
strongly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Lott has played a subtler leadership role. He  
has told GOP colleagues privately that he will not twist their arms 
to influence their decisions, participants say. Instead of guiding 
colleagues to decisions, he has been letting them reach a consensus 
before embracing it, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has avoided criticism by letting other senators float  
trial balloons about whether and how witnesses should be called and 
the steps that the proceedings should take. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's been open to shortening the process, Lott has been  
clear in his overall goal: Move expeditiously to a final vote on 
the two articles of impeachment against Clinton, subject to a 
change in Senate sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process calls for us to go through what the Constitution,  
the rules provide, and that is to go through debate,'' Lott said 
this week. ``I don't think anybody has come up with an idea, a 
justification for anything short of that.''

<HEADLINE>  Vikes' Cunningham Is Player of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two years ago, Randall Cunningham was laying tile  
during a one-year hiatus from football. No one wanted him, and it 
looked like he would never play in the NFL again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he was stunned to hear his name called as the  
league's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like Miss America sitting there,'' said the Minnesota  
quarterback, who helped the Vikings set an NFL scoring record and 
come within one victory of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the greatest achievements I've ever received. I  
was losing my breath just sitting there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham was the winner in the closest voting in the 10-year  
history of the award. He received 37 percent of the vote from a 
nationwide panel of 200 writers and broadcasters, 2 percent more 
than Denver running back Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Davis was named the league's most valuable  
player by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Other finalists for the NFL award were Indianapolis running back  
Marshall Faulk and quarterbacks Doug Flutie of Buffalo, Steve Young 
of San Francisco and Vinny Testaverde of the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, pressed into service after Brad Johnson broke his  
leg in Week 2, wound up NFL's top-rated passer with a 106.0 rating 
that ranks No. 8 in history. The 13-year veteran threw for 3,704 
yards and 34 touchdowns as the Vikings became only the third team 
to win 15 regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings finished the season with 556 points, breaking the  
record of 541 set by the 1983 Washington Redskins. However, 
Minnesota's march to the Super Bowl was stopped by Atlanta in the 
NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an empty feeling,'' Cunningham said. ``The feeling I  
have is it wasn't our time. The year 2000 looks better for us. It's 
a year of completion. I think we'll do better next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham spent 11 seasons in Philadelphia, where he set an NFL  
career record for most rushing yards by a quarterback. But his 
individual efforts weren't enough to lift the Eagles past the first 
round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out the 1996 season, returning home to Las Vegas to go  
into tile construction. The Vikings signed him before the 1997 
season, and he was content to be the backup until Johnson's injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all that you go through is a good time, so something like  
this is amazing to me,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	In connection with the award, sponsor Miller Brewing Company  
will donate $30,000 to Minneapolis-based CAUSE Ministries. 
Cunningham has been active in the organization's Christian outreach 
programs for several years.

<HEADLINE> 200-CD Piano Series Is Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the world hurtling toward mega-everything,  
even the once reserved arena of classical music is pulling out all 
its stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips Music Group has produced the largest recording project  
in the history of the industry: a 200-compact disc collection of 
the finest pianists of this century, playing at their best. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips is presenting the piano series to the Guinness Book as a  
new record, beating the company's issue of 180 CDs of all Mozart 
ever wrote, as registered in the 1998 edition of Guinness. 
</P>
<P>
	But quantity was not a factor in how the works were chosen by  
Philips' director of repertoire, Tom Deacon, for ``Great Pianists 
of the 20th Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to include recordings that changed how we thought  
about the music each pianist was playing,'' said Deacon in an 
interview from Amsterdam, where he's based. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Vladimir Horowitz recorded Tchaikovsky's Piano  
Concerto No. 1 in the 1940s with conductor Arturo Toscanini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horowitz played it hell-bent for leather, with tremendous  
gusto,'' said Deacon. ``For a whole generation, his version, his 
reading, changed the way in which people thought about that piece 
of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then along came Van Cliburn, winning the Tchaikovsky competition  
in Moscow in 1958 and recording the concerto at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``His performance was more winsome, graceful, gentle,'' said  
Deacon. ``That interpretation changed the way another generation 
thought about this piece of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in our time, Argentinian Martha Argerich put her stamp on  
the same piece, ``lighter, faster, more like Horowitz,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74 artists in the series range from Ignace Paderewski, the  
19th-century Polish virtuoso who died in 1941, to New York resident 
Evgeny Kissin, born in Russia in 1971. They are the oldest and 
youngest in the series. In between are Spaniard Alicia De Larrocha 
and British Dame Myra Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with household names like Horowitz and Artur Rubinstein,  
the series presents electrifying performances by less popular, but 
equally brilliant, pianists like Romanian-born Dinu Lipatti, 
Italian native Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and German-born Artur 
Schnabel. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting last October and continuing for a year, the work of 10  
pianists is being released each month, with one to three CDs for 
each artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Rave reviews have greeted the collection. For London's  
Independent, it's ``piano heaven.'' Newsweek called it 
``monumental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collection was presented recently across from Carnegie Hall  
under the domed frescoes of Steinway Hall, the showcase 
headquarters for pianos used by most of the featured artists. (An 
exception is Earl Wild, who apologized for being ``the infidel''; 
he plays his virtuoso transcriptions and showpieces on a Baldwin.) 
</P>
<P>
	No matter the instrument's name, the real keys to a century of  
musical fireworks lie in the hands and hearts of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	And in this lineup, one hears ``playing with long-ago rubatos or  
up-to-date precision, according to the era,'' says composer Ned 
Rorem. His Sonata No. 2 is played by New Jersey native Julius 
Katchen. The pianist had made the first piano LP record, of Brahms' 
Opus 5 Sonata in F minor, heard again on the new CD. 
</P>
<P>
	With Katchen at the keyboard, the Brahms ``is hurled at the  
listener, one of the most exciting performances of music,'' says 
Deacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rorem's 3 Barcarolles are performed by Leon Fleisher, who now  
specializes in left-hand repertoire after an incurable neuritis 
robbed him of the pianistic use of his right hand. Once considered 
an American heir to his mentor, Schnabel, Fleisher is heard here in 
two-hand classics, including Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of 
Paganini, as well as Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand. 
</P>
<P>
	As with all lists so popular today, one might argue with the  
choice of artists, compiled by a panel of a dozen pianists and 
piano experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hooray for points of view!'' said Fleisher. ``Let's just hope  
that some of these points of view will clash heads and maybe result 
in other new lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deacon made the final selection of repertoire. He got help  
especially from one featured pianist, Alfred Brendel, who dipped 
into old recordings of Alfred Cortot, Edwin Fischer and Wilhelm 
Kempff. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendel said he chose Cortot playing Chopin's 24 Etudes even  
though there are some wrong notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they don't disturb me -- they please me more than the right  
notes of many of my colleagues,'' the Austrian-born pianist said 
from his London home. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kempff's performance of Mozart's Concerto No. 23  
demonstrates that artist's ``deceptive simplicity. He let the 
spirit of the composer come down from heaven. It usually doesn't, 
if you don't do anything. In this case, it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opinions aside, there's no doubt these are ``Great Pianists of  
the 20th Century,'' a series that includes recordings from BMG, 
Deutsche Grammophon, EMI, London, Sony Classical, Decca and about 
20 other companies.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Sharpe Backs Up Bold Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe prides himself on being the best  
trash talker in the game -- a provocateur who takes opponents out of 
their games, a raconteur who delights his teammates and the media 
with his outrageous commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	A sampler:  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I'm not a good talker, I'm a great talker because I do it so  
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Ever since we knocked off Green Bay, we've been America's  
Team. The Cowboys were considered America's Team. Now they're 
considered America's Most Wanted Team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Growing up, I didn't like the Falcons. They lost all the  
time. If you had a pair of cleats on at Fulton County Stadium, 
they'd put you in the ballgame because they were getting beat so 
bad. For 20 bucks, you could sit in the luxury box with the 
owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Think about what I've done this year. I've got a guy  
suspended (Kansas City's Derrick Thomas), one guy cut (Kansas 
City's Wayne Simmons), one coach resigned (Kansas City's Marty 
Schottenheimer), another thought about resigning (Miami's Jimmy 
Johnson). I'm pretty good. I might need to go into politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he stops talking, however, Sharpe is certain of this  
essential truth: ``When my play doesn't match my quotes, people 
will stop listening to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's coming in loud and clear.  
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos tight end, who will play in his second  
straight Super Bowl on Sunday, is headed to the Pro Bowl for the 
seventh consecutive year and third in a row as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Among NFL tight ends this season, he led the league in receiving  
yards (768), ranked third in receptions (64) and shared the AFC 
lead in touchdown catches (10). 
</P>
<P>
	He also became the first tight end in league history to have at  
least 50 receptions in seven straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With 529 career receptions, he is one of just three tight ends  
in NFL history with 500 receptions, joining Ozzie Newsome (662) and 
Kellen Winslow (541). Only two tight ends have amassed more 
receiving yards than Sharpe's 6,741. 
</P>
<P>
	For a player who consistently draws attention to himself, Sharpe  
is surprisingly team-conscious. He took particular delight this 
season in contributing to the blocking that cleared the way for 
Terrell Davis to rush for 2,008 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his career, the only knock against Sharpe was his  
blocking, a phase of his game that he worked hard to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I have a guy behind me who rushed for 2,000 yards in  
a season, maybe I'll get some credit,'' he said. ``It's not like he 
gained all those yards with nobody in front of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not his blocking, of course, that gets him in the Pro Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	Until this season, Sharpe led the Broncos in receptions for six  
consecutive years. He has had three seasons with at least 80 
catches and three with at least 1,000 yards. No other player has 
caught as many touchdown passes from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been the most consistent, most reliable receiver I've had  
in my career,'' Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take Shannon out of our offense, and it hamstrings a lot of  
the things we try to do,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Not too many 
teams have been successful trying to shut him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly enough, Sharpe has excelled partly because he is, in  
essence, playing out of position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never considered myself a tight end,'' he said. ``I still  
don't. I play the tight end position, but I don't do things like a 
tight end. I don't think like a tight end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Too physical to be a wide receiver, too quick and elusive to be  
a tight end, the 6-foot-2, 230-pound Sharpe calls himself a 
``hybrid tight end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's precisely that rare combination that gives defenses fits.  
Linebackers who can match his strength don't have the speed to 
cover him. Cornerbacks and safeties get muscled off the ball or get 
run over after the catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Broncos had trouble pinpointing the right spot for  
Sharpe, a seventh-round draft choice out of Savannah State in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Projected as a wide receiver, Sharpe was moved to tight end  
mainly as an experiment his rookie season because of injuries to 
other players. He played mostly in an H-back role until the Broncos 
abandoned that scheme in the mid-90s. 
</P>
<P>
	When Shanahan became head coach in 1995, he insisted that Sharpe  
improve his work habits, even though Sharpe had caught 87 passes 
for 1,010 yards the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't always practice the way I wanted, and he would not  
do all the things I thought he was capable of doing in the running 
game,'' Shanahan said. ``Since then, he's done everything I've 
asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except tone down his remarks. Privately, Shanahan cringes when  
he reads some of Sharpe's bolder statements, such as referring to 
Miami quarterback Dan Marino as a ``loser'' after the Broncos' 38-3 
playoff rout of the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows the Sharpe tongue simply can't rest.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do any good to talk if you can't back up what you  
say,'' Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he does.

<HEADLINE> Disney Earns Fall 18 Percent in 1Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co.'s earnings fell 18  
percent during the company's first quarter, reflecting slow home 
video sales and the impact of higher costs in its broadcasting and 
movie businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney reported Wednesday it earned $622 million, or 30 cents  
per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, including a one-time gain 
from its acquisition of a 43 percent share of Infoseek, the popular 
Internet search service. 
</P>
<P>
	Minus the Infoseek gain, Disney's earnings fell 37 percent to  
$470 million, or 23 cents per share, compared to $755 million, or 
37 cents per share, a year earlier. The results were slightly below 
Wall Street estimates of 24 cents per share, according to a survey 
of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 4 percent to $6.59 billion from $6.34 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Strong box office results from hit films such as ``The  
Waterboy'' and ``A Bug's Life'' and improved theme park attendance 
were offset by rising film production and broadcasting costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from broadcasting dropped 48 percent to $265  
million, due to the increased cost of airing NFL games on ABC, as 
well as weaker ABC News ratings. ABC paid $9.2 billion for rights 
to air games from 1998 to 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from the creative content division tumbled 39  
percent to $430 million, hurt by slower home-video sales, lower 
sales at Disney Stores and declining revenue from merchandise 
licensing abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our creative content and broadcasting operating results  
continue to reflect the challenges we began facing in 1998, 
including rising programming and production costs,'' said Michael 
Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we are continuing to invest in promising new  
initiatives such as this month's launch of the Go Network,'' said 
Eisner, referring to the new Internet portal launched earlier this 
month by Disney and Infoseek. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent quarter's results were boosted by Disney's exchange  
of its stake in Starwave Corp., a Web site operator, for 43 percent 
ownership of Infoseek. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's problem at ABC reflect difficulties throughout the  
television industry with rising costs and declining viewership, 
said Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The higher programming costs, specifically sports programming  
costs, is an issue they will have to continue to deal with. In 
addition, the audience is getting fragmented, they're losing share 
to cable and the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bright spot was Disney's theme parks and resorts division,  
where operating profits rose 17 percent to $335 million. Strong 
attendance at the new Animal Kingdom park near Walt Disney World in 
Florida drove the gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released two weeks after Disney announced that  
Eisner's bonus for 1998 was cut by nearly 50 percent to $5 million 
after a year of sluggish profit growth. Disney was hurt last year 
by the Asian financial crisis, poor box office performance and 
costly new ventures such as Animal Kingdom and the Disney Cruise 
Line. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's earnings picture likely will improve later in the year.  
The company is cutting costs by reducing the number of films 
produced annually to about 15, and will benefit from a $64 million 
restructuring of its licensing operations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cycle that Disney is going through. I think we'll have  
about one more quarter of difficult comparisons and then we'll have 
some earnings gain,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Disney fell $1.62 1/2 to $32.93 3/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.
