<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Narrow 1997 Budget Deficit: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government plans
to narrow the huge 1997 budget deficit of about 86.88 billion
rupees (1.52 billion US dollars) through promoting export-led
growth and foreign and domestic borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech at parliament here this evening, Deputy
Finance Minister G.L. Peiris disclosed that the government's total
expenditure for 1997 is estimated at 281.87 billion rupees (4.94
billion dollars) while its income is estimated at 194.99 rupees
(3.42 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He explained that the rapid increase of defense expenditure
caused by the worsening of civil war in the country is among the
factors that have created a mammoth deficit.
</P>
<P>
The defense expenditure in the budget is estimated at 771.9
million US dollars, accounting for 5 percent of GDP, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Expects Clinton to Fulfill His </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said here today that his country expects
U.S. President-elect Bill Clinton to fulfill his pledge to
undertake some kind of initiative to help push forward a Cyprus
solution.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think we should anticipate the U.S. to exert
pressure on anybody. We expect the U.S. to play a positive role
toward a resolution of the Cyprus question," the president told
reporters following Clinton's electoral victory.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Clinton's re-election would safeguard a lasting and
viable solution, the Cyprus head of state said he would not make
any assessment until he knows what the U.S. would suggest and
what moves the new U.S. administration will take.
</P>
<P>
Before the election, Clinton assured Cyprus of his personal
commitment for a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said in Washington earlier that if a just and viable
solution to the Cyprus problem is not reached, he will consider it
as his own "personal failure."
</P>
<P>
The island country has been divided into two parts since 1974
when Turkish troops intervened in northern Cyprus with the
Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek Cypriots in the
south.

<HEADLINE> Beira Corridor to Hold Investment Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A major conference to highlight
the potential of Beira corridor as a conduit for economic
integration of southern Africa is earmarked here in December,
Beira Corridor Group's (BCG) Chief Executive said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Beira corridor is an important alternative route to the
sea for Botswana, Malawi, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe which
traditionally depended on South African ports for their exports
and imports.
</P>
<P>
David Zausmer said the Beira development corridor conference
would consider the role of governments in the region in
facilitating investment along the corridor, which is a lifeline
for most of the region's landlocked countries.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we are targeting the government sector because of
its power to amend regulations that inhibit free flow of goods
along the corridor as well as the business, transport, financial
and donor communities.''
</P>
<P>
Issues to be discussed would include the effect of legislation
on flow of traffic along the corridor and the incentives offered
by the Mozambican government for investments on the corridor.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held on December 2 and 3.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 SADC Citizens Apply for S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 204,000 illegal
immigrants from neighboring countries have applied for permanent
residence in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, spokesman for the
Department Hennie Meyer said about 135,000 applications have been
received in Gauteng Province. While Mpumalanga and Northern
Province each received about 30,000 applications, the Western
Cape Province had only 35.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a cabinet decision earlier this year, citizens
from the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC)
could apply for permanent residence in South Africa if they met
certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
They should be able to demonstrate or provide evidence of
continuous residence in South Africa from July 1, 1991, be
engaged in productive formal or informal economic activity, have
dependent children born or residing legally in the country, and
have no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2.5 to 4 million illegal immigrants now
believed living in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meyer said the processing of applications by the
Department's regional offices was already underway.
</P>
<P>
According to other government sources, a large percentage of
those seeking permanent residence were expected to succeed in
their applications.
</P>
<P>
SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and
South Africa.

<HEADLINE> EC Predicts Positive Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The economy in the European
Union's member states is expected to grow positively in the coming
years, the European Commission (EC) said in its autumn economic
forecasts published today.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts, presented by Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the EC
commissioner for economic, monetary and financial affairs, said
the growth was expected to reach 1.6 percent in 1996, 2.3 percent
in 1997 and 2.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Over the three years from 1996 to 1998, a net increase of 2.3
million jobs would bring the rate of unemployment in EU`s member
states down to 10.4 percent in 1998, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
The economic convergence and progress towards the Euro were
contributing to the growth, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
Most EU member states were in the process of making impressive
efforts to achieve economic convergence, particularly by cutting
excessive government deficits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other forecasts on inflation, interest rates and
public finances of member states confirmed the EC's view that
there could be a significant, and probably increasing, number of
member states capable of meeting the conditions to participate in
the Euro from January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> EC Takes Steps to Improve Financial Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today endorsed a package of measures designed to reform its
financial management.
</P>
<P>
The measures, proposed by EC commissioner Anita Gradin, were
part of a program called Sound and Efficient Management 2000 or
SEM 2000, which aims to modernize the handling of money in the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Under the measures approved today, the verification of
expenditure will be rationalized, internal audit will be improved
and control and audit will be coordinated between the EC and the
EU member states.
</P>
<P>
"The measures taken today by the commission mean that we are
taking steps towards a really sound and efficient management of
the EU budget," Gradin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the EC was creating a system to make sure that
the EU money was not only used according to the rules but that tax
payers got good value for money.
</P>
<P>
Gradin said he believed that a complicated system of rules and
regulations would leave the door open to fraud and
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
He called for an anti-fraud system established in all managing
departments in the EC, which is responsible for the execution of
the EU budget -- around 85 billion ECUs (some 110.5 billion
U.S. dollars) each year. The management of 80 percent of the
money is done in and by EU member states. However, the EC is
responsible for these payments and must make sure that the money
is properly and well spent.

Zairean Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Kamanda Wa
Kamanda made the call to Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati in a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Kamanda praised Iran's efforts in
resolving territorial dispute between Uganda and Sudan and asked
for similar moves toward resolving problems between Zaire and

</P>
<P>
The Zairean minister said that his government would like to

concerned should accept Iran's mediation."

two countries have signed a draft agreement and would have
another meeting in December.

<HEADLINE> Benazir Bhutto "Deeply Disappointed" at President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Pakistani prime
minister Benazir Bhutto said she was deeply disappointed at
President Farooq Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowded press conference at the Prime Minister
House here this afternoon, a relaxed Benazir said it was a "deep
disappointment" to her that the president dissolved the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"He broke his pledge that he would never dissolve the National
Assembly," she said, stressing that she condemned such kind of
action.
</P>
<P>
Calling the president's action a "soft revolution", she accused
him of doing things against the unity, integrity and prosperity of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Leghari dissolved Pakistan's National Assembly Tuesday and
dismissed Benazir's government at the same time, charging it of
rampant corruption, economic crisis, mismanagement, confrontation
with judiciary and extra-judicial killing of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Denying all the charges levied against her by the president,
Benazir said, "I think I've done a very fine job as the prime
minister. I've brought glory to Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Denying any economic crisis, the deposed prime minister said
the president tried to create a crisis out of nothing.
</P>
<P>
"He did his best to create an economic crisis. He did his best
to create a financial crisis," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, she blamed Leghari for the economic problems faced by
the country.
</P>
<P>
For the first two years of her government, it was the president
who thought himself an finance expert running the economy of the
country, Benazir disclosed.
</P>
<P>
She insisted that the president had long been planning to
overthrow her.
</P>
<P>
"On September 20, the president returned from a foreign tour.
On the same day, my brother was brutally killed," she said.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Benazir said in public that there was a plan to
eliminate the whole Bhutto family.
</P>
<P>
At a public meeting during her mourning period of her estranged
brother, she asked why some people were in such a hurry to
eliminate her when she was in mourning.
</P>
<P>
She said when she met with the president on September 29, "the
president looked into my eyes and said, 'There is no timetable to
remove you.'"
</P>
<P>
She told the press conference that maybe because of those words
of hers the president waited until she finished her mourning to
move.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise they would take actions when I was in the United
States of America," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the president never directly asked her to resign, but
indirectly showed that she should go.
</P>
<P>
Trying to downsize the president, she said, "He is a good
implementer. He is a good follower. When I gave him an order, he
worked out well. But he is never a good boss."
</P>
<P>
She said, "He is always number two. He never became number
one."
</P>
<P>
It was the greed for power that made him change against his
colleagues, she believed.
</P>
<P>
Benazir used strong words to accuse the president, who worked
with her for 20 years and once was her close ally, of kidnapping
her husband Asif Ali Zardari, who has been detained since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said, "My husband was kidnapped on the order of President
Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari."
</P>
<P>
Benazir said angrily that she told the authorities that if by
nine o'clock this evening (1600 GMT), she did not get any answer
on the whereabouts of her husband, she would personally file a
First Investigation Registration (FIR) against the president on
charges of illegally kidnapping Asif Ali Zardari.
</P>
<P>
When asked about her fate, she said, "I intend to go to the
court. I will definitely go to the court," challenging the
legitimacy of the president's order.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she would contest in the fresh election in case of
losing her battle in the court, she asked, "Why should I (lose)?"
</P>
<P>
"I am an elected prime minister. I will be elected again," she
said.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the army, she said, "I believed the army was
neutral."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the calm reaction of the country on her
deposition, she said, "People are mourning."
</P>
<P>
As to the reaction of her own Pakistan People's Party, she said
her party did not take any action because they are waiting for her
call.
</P>
<P>
Though deposed, Benazir seemed not to worry about the political
situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Prospects Good: British Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Trade
Secretary Anthony Nelson said here today Zimbabwe's prospects are
brighter after economic liberalization and promised to carry the
message to British business.
</P>
<P>
At a reception hosted for him by British High Commissioner
Martin Williams, Nelson singled out Zimbabwe's advantages as
being a newly-opened market, abundant natural resources and the
relative security of ordinary people which he said is much better
compared to countries like south africa.
</P>
<P>
Being part of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) meant a bigger market for British trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nelson also pledged support for some of the proposals that
came out of the G-15 Summit which ended in Harare on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 leaders complained of the extraneous issues on labor
standards and other social issues being brought into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) by the rich countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that British companies with 350 subsidiaries in
Zimbabwe are the biggest investors, Nelson predicted increased
British trade and investment as more companies are now
interested in returning to the country with the opening up of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned against putting nationalistic conditions on
foreign investment, saying Britain had attracted 40 percent of
its investment from European countries because it needed to
create jobs for its people.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Clinton Reelected President, GOP Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
won a second-term 31-state sweep while the Republicans retained
control of the Congress in Tuesday's general elections.
</P>
<P>
With the national count almost complete, Clinton won 31 states
and the District of Columbia for 379 electoral votes, well above
the required 270 and surpassing by nine his 1992 total. Dole won
19 states with 159 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
In 34 Senate races, Republicans won 20 and were leading in
Oregon, increasing their Senate majority to 54 seats, or 55 if
Oregon falls in the GOP column.
</P>
<P>
Democrats were weakened by losing two seats to shrink their
force to 45 in the Senate, if Oregon goes Republican.
</P>
<P>
In the House of Representatives, Republicans are reducing
their size of the 236-seat majority, but they still retained the
control by gaining 221 and leading for four more as the counting
was continuing.
</P>
<P>
Democrats, though recatching 11 more seats from Republicans in
the House, could not realize their dream to take back the majority
in the 435-seat House. The party won 194 seats and led for 15
more.
</P>
<P>
Independent Bernard Sanders of Vermont was reelected.
</P>
<P>
Facing a Republican-controlled Congress, Clinton tried to
appeal for unity and an end to partisanship by saying in his
victory speech, "Work together, meet our challenges, put aside the
politics of division and build America's community together."
</P>
<P>
Divided government over the past two years has led sometimes to
stalemate, sometimes to compromise. It shut down the government
but also produced ground breaking new laws on welfare, family
leave and health insurance portability.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who won office in 1992 with only 43 percent of the
vote, took 49 percent this year with 98 percent of the vote
counted. He hoped to won a clean majority.
</P>
<P>
Dole won 41 percent of the vote. Two-thirds of voters said they
didn't think he could cut a 15 percent tax while still balancing
the budget.
</P>
<P>
Taking a political curtain call after 35 years of public
service, Dole wished Clinton well. He would take a vacation, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Lifts Ban on Nigerian Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The ban by Ghana on medicines
imports from Nigeria, among other west African countries, has
been lifted, a local business committee said here today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the good news, Nigerian drug manufacturers have to be
aware that Ghana will import only quality medicines, according to
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Group of the Manufacturers
Association of Nigeria (PMGMAN).
</P>
<P>
Even with the lift of the ban, said PMGMAN Chairman Mazi Sam
Ohuabunwa, Ghana will import medicines directly from Nigeria's
drug plants up to international standards to ensure the
genuineness of the products.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the pharmaceutical product lines to be involved in
the new market opportunity in Ghana will be restricted to drugs
for uncommon ailments.
</P>
<P>
"The Ghanaian government has a protective policy for its local
manufacturing industry, hence drugs for common ailments like
malaria, cough and cold for which the country has enough
production capacity may not be included in the export list to
Ghana," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The ban by Ghana on drug imports was imposed on 1987 in
response to rampant cases of substandard drugs, especially from
Nigeria. According to the then health minister of Ghana who made
the decision, 70 percent of Nigerian drugs were fake.
</P>
<P>
With the new position of Ghana, said Ohuabunwa, the positive
market effect on Nigerian drugs will spread to other countries in
the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Port Aqaba Expected to Boost Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian southern port of
Aqaba is expected to boost its business in view of possible
implementation of a U.N. oil-for-food deal with Iraq, a port
official has said.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi authorities pledged to give absolute priority to
the port of Aqaba," Ports Corporation Director General
Mohammad Dalabih was quoted by the English-language daily Jordan
Times today as saying.
</P>
<P>
"When the oil-for-food agreement is implemented, the traffic
of the 2.3 million tons of food and medicine that Iraq will be
allowed to import will enter the country via Aqaba and (the
Iraqi port of) Basra," he said upon his return from Baghdad
after concluding a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food plan, which was signed between the U.N. and
Iraq in May, allows the sanction-hit Iraq to sell oil worth 2
billion U.S. dollars over a six-month period to buy food and
medicine, to ease the sufferings of Iraqi people from a
six-year-long U.N. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. has suspended the deal following Iraqi forces'
attacks against the Kurdish-held north of the country in early
September.
</P>
<P>
Dalabih said business at Aqaba "had suffered a 60 percent loss"
since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Heating Oil Prices Fall in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Heating oil prices have fallen
in recent weeks in the United States as refiners have begun
producing heating oil in near-record amounts.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued Tuesday by the American Petroleum
institute, refiners produced 3.56 million barrels of heating oil
and other distillates a day last week. Production is still running
at a high rate compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these growing supplies, future prices of heating
oil have tumbled from a high of 76 cents a gallon last month.
On Tuesday, heating oil for December delivery fell 0.53 cent, to
65.42 cents a gallon, its lowest price since September 16.
</P>
<P>
Still, crude prices have also retreated from their highs in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The high production, which has sent wholesale and retail prices
tumbling, has eased the fears that prices would soar this winter.
The fears began to build in September and October when inventories
of heating and diesel fuel were running about 15 percent lower
than last year.
</P>
<P>
If the trends of mild weather, surging production and plentiful
supplies continue, consumers can see more reduction in prices
coming, said Alfred Allegretti, owner of Bayside Fuel Oil, one of
the biggest wholesalers and retailers of heating oil in the New
York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
But in view of the fact that the oil market is volatile, even
with the high production, an unusually cold winter or any big
interruption of refining could still bring spikes in prices, a
report of the New York Times warned.

<HEADLINE> Deported Nigerians Return to Benin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Nigerian youths
recently deported from Benin have been finding their way back
into the republic, a survey report said today.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by Nigerian immigration officials at the
border shows that the returnees are primarily youths of between
17 and 30 years, mostly traders. Many of them have left their
businesses and families behind in the French-speaking country.
</P>
<P>
This development, according to analysts here, demonstrates
that the Benin Republic may have soft-pedalled on the deportation
embarked upon about eight weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 Nigerians were sent out of Benin during the
expulsion effort as a result of rising robbery and other criminal
cases in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here, the Nigerian embassy in Benin has
intervened in the deportation of Nigerians and Benin authorities
have promised a conducive business environment for Nigerians if
they can do away with criminal activities.

<HEADLINE> US Considering Sending Troops to Central Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials are
considering sending some American troops to Central Africa for
logistical support in an international force to protect and feed
up to 1.4 million refugees caught in the fighting between Zaire
and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted some senior U.S. officials as
saying that whether or not to dispatch troops will be decided in
the next few days, which is regarded as the last resort to
settlement of the refugee issue in that region.
</P>
<P>
American diplomats prefer establishing a lasting cease-fire so
that all aid workers could return to the area and encourage
Rwandan Hutu refugees to return home, closing the refugee camps in
eastern Zaire that have fostered tribal and regional tensions.
</P>
<P>
If that could happen, they said, there would be no need for
foreign troops to create "protected zones" for the distribution of
needed food and water for Hutu refugees there.
</P>
<P>
But most Hutu refugees have refused to return to Rwanda as it
is now led by a Tutsi-dominated government.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Contribute to Neutral Force in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia today expressed
its readiness to contribute its share to the neutral force to be
deployed in eastern Zaire so as to ensure peace and security in
the region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency, Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin said Ethiopia is committed to contributing
to the neutral force whose formation was referred to the U. N.
Security Council by the Nairobi summit of African leaders on the
crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said African leaders who met Tuesday in Nairobi, Kenya to
discuss the crisis in eastern Zaire have also the responsibility
to take part in the establishment of the neutral force.
</P>
<P>
Tusie rebels seized the capitals of the two Kivu provinces in
eastern Zaire after defeating Zairean government troops. About
one million Rwandan refugees have been caught in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Zaire accuses Rwanda of sending its regular army to fight in
the country which the latter denies, and Kinshasa refused to
attend the regional summit held in Nairobi to discuss the Zaire
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The summit called for an immediate ceasefire and the setting
up of a corridor to protect the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin added that the summit directed foreign ministers of
Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and the representative of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to closely follow up the
decisions and mandated them to visit Zaire to convey the
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi returned here from Kenya
this morning after attending the Nairobi summit.

UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China has become the
54th country signing an agreement for the implementation of U.N.

<P>
The agreement was adopted on August 4, 1995 in New York by the

from December 4, 1995. To put the agreement into force requires
the rectification of 30 countries and 30 days after the 30th
country offering its rectification.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement will have a significant impact on the
conservation and management of living marine resources, especially
fish resources in the high seas as well as on the international
cooperation in fishery," said the Chinese ambassador in a
statement presented to the Treaty Section of the U.N. for the
signature.
</P>

China's statement mainly covered the paragraphes concerning the
authorized inspection of fishing vessels and use of force during
the inspection.

Countries having not yet signed on the agreement include Japan,
India, Thailand, Chile, Peru and some coastal countries in Africa

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health
Ministry today called on pertinent bodies to join hands in the
effort to control malaria epidemic that has surfaced in some
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Head of malaria and other vector-born diseases control team of
the ministry, Tarekegne Abose, said the incidence of the epidemic
has increased two to five fold at some places compared to that of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the disease was owing to the failure of some
regions to take prompt measures immediately after the incidence,
and delay in distributing the necessary medical treatment to
local residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
The weather was also conducive for the multiplication of the
vector, he said, predicting that the malaria epidemic might last
till the end of November.
</P>
<P>
The health official urged regions to take immediate measures
upon recognising the first signs of the epidemic.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Places Peace Before Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said today the solution to problems
facing the Mideast peace process should come before further
cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meguid told reporters that he expressed astonishment at the
idea of establishing a Middle East security and cooperation
organization when meeting with British Ambassador to Egypt David
Blatherwick here today to discuss the proposal put forward by
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that he voiced appreciation for the British stance
conveyed by Rifkind.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, on a regional tour designed to give new impetus to
the peace process, told reporters in the United Arab Emirates
Monday that the Middle East would benefit from a forum that
includes all the countries in the region. He suggested it be
called the Organization for Cooperation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The British foreign secretary is keen on stressing the
Palestinian people's right to self-determination, urging Israeli
compliance with the agreements reached with the Palestinian side,
and condemning the Israeli settlement policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added he wondered how such cooperation could be established
while Israel occupies Arab lands, and differences still exist
between Iran and the United Arab Emirates on some disputed
islands.
</P>
<P>
"Such obstructions should first be overcome before talking
about further regional cooperation in the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said that the British ambassador promised to
convey the AL viewpoint to the British foreign secretary within
the framework of continuous consultations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British diplomat said that the proposal is
based on the European experience and aims to widen regional
cooperation in the area and does not run counter to current
efforts in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He added that this organization does not affect or contradict
regional organizations such as the AL, the Gulf Cooperation
Council and the Mediterranean Forum.

<HEADLINE> UK Industry Urged to Get Ready for Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's industrial
establishments as well as military bases will be potential targets
of inspections when the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) comes
into force on April 29, 1997, the British Government warned today.
</P>
<P>
Britain formally ratified the CWC on May 13, 1996. However,
entry into force will be marked by a Conference of State Parties
which will launch the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW) to implement the verification arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The CWC requires State Parties to establish a National
Authority to supervise the domestic implementation of the
Convention and to liaise with the OPCW.
</P>
<P>
The CWC aims to impose a global ban on chemical weapons. In
particular, it controls the production, transfer and use of toxic
chemicals which could be used as, or could be the precursors for,
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Countries which have ratified the convention are required to
provide detailed information on chemical weapons, chemical weapons
production facilities and activities in certain chemicals of
concern.
</P>
<P>
From mid-September, the production, possession and use of any
chemicals listed in Schedule I of the Chemical Weapons Convention
has required a license from the Department of Trade and Industry,
according to an announcement by the British government.
</P>
<P>
Many organizations will now have to provide information on the
type and amount of chemicals they hold or produce, in some cases
extending over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
From next summer, this information may be verified at short
notice by teams of international inspectors. Additionally, as part
of the confidence building measures in the convention, inspectors
may mount "challenge" inspections at 12 hours notice at any site
in any country.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rules Out New U.S. Pressure After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu welcomed today the re-election of
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who he forecast will not exert new
pressure on Israel in Israeli-Arab peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I want to extend my congratulations to President Bill
Clinton being elected for (a) second term. I think President
Clinton is a warm friend of Israel and the Jewish people. He
(has) showed that friendship time and again," Netanyahu told a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also congratulated U.S. Vice-President Al
Gore for his election victory, praising him as "a great friend
of Israel for many years."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he expected Clinton's re-election would
make it easier to ensure the continuation of the Middle East
peace process, while believing that the much-expected U.S.
pressure will not be applied.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to working with the new, old if you
want, American Administration on the process of extending peace
in the (Middle East) area. We have been doing this consistently
over the last few months, and we intend to do it in the coming
days, as well as coming months and years," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The hardline premier repeated the accusation of the
Palestinian Authority for delaying the signing of an agreement
on Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, originally
expected to return to Israel today, postponed his trip because
the Palestinians did not give the go-ahead signals.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned home last week after the failure to secure a
Hebron deal, despite three weeks of intensive mediation.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Israeli-Syrian tension, Netanyahu said Israel
viewed Syria's message as a "serious commitment", which was sent
through the U.S., Russia and France clarifying that its troop
movements were purely defensive.
</P>
<P>
Once again, Netanyahu called on Syria to resume peace
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria and other parties in the Arab world should
understand that "the date of the American elections does not
materially change their need and responsibility to enter
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk confirmed
that the Clinton government would continue playing the role of
facilitator in the peace talks, ruling out any changes in the
U.S. policy regarding its involvement in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Indyk believed an Israeli-Palestinian deal was imminent. "The
issues can be resolved, and we are close to the resolution. But
it is up to the parties themselves to make those decisions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also said that the Clinton government would
maintain its aid to Israel at the current level in order to
"minimize the risk of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Currently Israel receives 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of annual
economic aid from the U.S. in addition to 1.8 billion dollars of
military assistance.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Suspends Arms Sales to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today
announced the suspension of 18.5 million U.S. Dollars worth of
arms sales to Rwanda's Tutsi-led army which is widely believed to
be involved in the ethnic fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said the
decision was taken following a conclusion made by a regional
summit in Nairobi that Rwanda's armed forces had made
cross-border incursions into conflict-ridden Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said the suspension of arms sales would be reviewed once
cross-border invasion by Rwanda ceased and a clear understanding
emerged that the Rwandan troops were using weapons only for
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been strongly criticised by some African
countries, especially those of the Great Lakes region, for its
weapon sales to Rwanda during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
But Pahad denied that weapons made by South Africa had fueled
the fighting between ethnic Tutsi rebels and the Zairean army in
Zaire's Kivu Province.
</P>
<P>
So far only a few unarmed armoured vehicles had been delivered
to Rwanda, said the South African official.
</P>
<P>
On the call made by African leaders for a neutral force to be
deployed in eastern Zaire to help repatriate refugees in the
region to Rwanda and Burundi, Pahad said South Africa was
awaiting a decision by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African army was pondering how it could
respond to any call coming from the United Nations Security
Council, adding that once the decision is made, South Africa will
announce its decision.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, South Afrian President Nelson Mandela said
his government would respond very positively to any request from
the U.N. for help solve the refugee crisis in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi summit, attended by presidents of six countries in
the Great lakes region, had called for an immediate deployment of
a "neutral force" to set up safe corridors in eastern Zaire to
facilitate humanitarian assistance and repatriation of the over
1.2 million Hutu refugees to Rwanda and Burundi.

region since the election of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu in May.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Israel Radio, Mordechai said Israel expected
renewed tension on its borders with Syria and Lebanon after the
U.S. general elections this week.
</P>
<P>
"There are hostile forces which are waiting until the elctions
are over so they can move," the Israeli defense minister claimed.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that "there has been the political, psychologic,
and military tension in the region since Netanyahu's election."
</P>
<P>
He said that the tension, if it is aimed at exerting pressure
upon Lebanon, will not affect the firm positions which Lebanon has
taken since the peace process was launched at the Madrid peace
conference in October, 1991.
</P>
<P>
If the Jewish state wants to escape from the political dilemma
caused by its intransigent positions, "we don't think that the
wars which Israel have launched at Lebanon until today were useful
for Israel or useful for the region," Boueiz stressed.

<HEADLINE> WMO: Ozone Depletion over Antarctic Touches Bottom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) said today that the annual dramatic ozone
depletion over the Antarctic has touched bottom over the past five
years because the maximum amount of ozone has already been
destroyed there each year.
</P>
<P>
Ruman Bojkov, an ozone expert of the WMO, told a news
conference that the strength and size of the ozone destruction in
the Antarctic spring of 1996 was comparable to the previous
recording-setting four years starting from 1992.
</P>
<P>
A similar phenomenon observed during the past five years was
that ozone in the altitudes between 14 to 20 kilometers over the
Antarctic, where meteorological conditions were most favorable for
ozone depletion, had been destroyed almost completely each year
during the Antarctic spring, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that layer, ozone had also been destroyed, but at a
relatively lower rate, and therefore did not effect the whole
situation significantly.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weather agency monitors the amount of ozone depletion
during September and October each year when it is spring in the
Antarctic. Cold air temperature together with the sun's rays
combine to create the maximum ozone depletion at this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the dramatic ozone declines over the Antarctic
provide an evidence that the Earth's ozone layer is being eroded
by man-made chemicals like chloroflurocarbons. The ozone layer is
vital for the lives on the Earth as it absorbs harmful solar
ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
Globally, including the middle latitudes where most of the
world population lives, the ozone depletion had been continuing
since the early 1970s when the event started, Bojkov said.
</P>
<P>
Ozone declines between 8 percent to 10 percent has been
generally observed for the past 25 years in the middle latitudes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that if all countries met the targets of the
1987 Montreal Protocol on reduction and elimination of emissions
of ozone-destructive chemicals, the concentrations of those
chemicals in the stratosphere would peak sometime early next
century, say 2005.
</P>
<P>
After that, the concentrations of those chemicals would slowly
start to decline, and would reach the normal values only somewhere
between the year 2050 and 2070.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the most serious global ozone depletion was still
expected to come early next century, Bojkov said.

JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has made an urgent appeal to
refugees occupying offices of Botswana's Refugee Agency to leave
and return to their camps.
</P>
<P>
According to the Southern African Broadcasting Association
reported today from Gaborone, the UNHCR is not in a position to
protect refugees or asylum-seekers engaging in riotous behavior or
violating the law of the asylum country.
</P>
<P>
The refugees at the Dukwe Refugee Camp in northern Botswana,
complaining of food shortage, have occupied offices of the
Botswana Council of Refugees and blocking auditing work going on
at the site.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNHCR said it had already conveyed their grievances
to the Botswanan Government, its regional office in South Africa and
its headquarters in Geneva of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements are currently being made to resolve refugees'
complaints, said the UNHCR.

<HEADLINE> More Congo Fever Cases Reported in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Seven more people
suspected to have contracted the deadly tick-borne Congo fever
have been admitted to a hospital in Cape town.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the hospital said today that all 16 patients,
were "doing well" and are currently still being closely monitored
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Results of blood tests, due to be released by the National
Virology Institute in Johannesburg late today or early on
Thursday, would finally determine whether they were out of
danger.
</P>
<P>
Congo fever is an infectious disease which, like the viral
disease Ebola, causes body organs to worsen with massive internal
and external bleeding.
</P>
<P>
All the 16 patients were employees of an ostrich abattoir in
Oudtshoorn. The victims could have been infected at the abattoir
during skinning and de-feathering, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Beale said the health authorities were not sure how blood from
infected ostriches could infect humans, but is was possibly via
superficial wounds.
</P>
<P>
However, Beale advised people who had bought ostrich meat within
the last five days to freeze it until more information was available.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the Congo fever was first diagnosed among
workers at an abattoir where ostriches were slaughtered.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou has called on the business community
on the island to expand and diversify its markets, while
expressing cautious optimism about the economic prospects for
1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting today at the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, Christodoulou said, "Prospects for 1997 appear to
present an optimistic overview, provided we suffer no adverse or
unforeseen developments."
</P>
<P>
He urged Cypriot entrepreneurs to take advantage of the huge
opportunities that are available in the Middle East, the Balkan
region and former Soviet Union republics.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of growth for the rest of this year will range
around 2.5 percent, a satisfactory figure if one takes into
account the corresponding European indexes," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus economy registered a satisfactory growth, he
noted, adding that public debt and public deficit will continue
to be within the Maastricht criteria.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Luxembourg are the only two European countries
that meet the Maastricht criteria.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou stressed that long-standing problems the local
economy is facing must be tackled if Cyprus wants to continue its
upward trend.
</P>
<P>
"Indiscriminate allowances and grants, unproductive incentives
to troublesome business which affect the economy must come to an
end or be replaced," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on the business community to improve
the quality of its produce and services, increase productivity
and reduce costs to help maintain sound economic foundations.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Sees No Grudges with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today denied tensions rising between Egypt and the U.S. and any
knowledge of an Israeli-Palestinian deal to be signed at the Cairo
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
There is no tension but understanding and exchange of views
between the U.S. and Egypt, Mubarak said during his two-hour
meeting with the parliamentary body of the ruling National
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Different views on some issues are likely but they do
not mean tension."
</P>
<P>
The president added that there is an unprecedented European
activity at this stage on the part of France, Italy and Britain
but the American role remains the basic one.
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, Mubarak said that "we have no knowledge that a new
agreement (between Israel and Palestine) has been reached and will
be signed. We also have no knowledge that this will take place in
Cairo." There are still differences between the Palestinians and
the Israelis, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Refuting reports that Egypt incited the Palestinians to freeze
and deter the talks after the American elections, he said Egypt's
policy is based on openness and clarity with all parties and is
geared to find a just solution and fulfil obligations.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is doing its best to bring closer viewpoints of the two
sides but the final decision remains a complete Palestinian one,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that security and peace are two faces of
the same coin and peace is the right way to security and stability
in the Jewish state and the whole region.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a strategic option. Whatever the differences, it is
unwise to hint at the use of force," he stressed, saying that
continuation of the present state is fraught with danger.

<HEADLINE> US Firms Offer Solution for China's Rural Telecommunication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientific-Atlanta, a
44-year-old American telecommunications giant, and Celcore, a
young US wireless firm established in 1992, today announced their
plan to jointly explore China's market in rural telephone service.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Beijing, officials from the two
companies said they plan to help China tackle rural
telecommunication problems by combining the Skylinx satellite
telephone network of Scientific-Atlanta, and Celcore's wireless
switching system.
</P>
<P>
They held that their joint product, featuring minimum start-up
and operation costs, wireless mobility and field-proven
technology, is able to overcome obstacles that are hindering the
spread of telephone service in rural areas, both in developed and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Scientific-Atlanta is a major equipment supplier for well-known
international companies, such as CNN, and it has helped build
several telecommunication webs in China.
</P>
<P>
While Celcore has been doing well in the United States, it is
just beginning its business in China, according to its
Taiwan-based Vice President of Marketing Steve Chen.
</P>
<P>
Officials from China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
said the joint plan by the two US firms is realistic, as it is
still difficult to get access to modern telecommunication services
to the majority of the country's vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to develop its telecommunication sector by using
advanced foreign technology, and welcomes foreign companies to
provide assistance in various forms, but under some conditions,
the officials noted.

The number of "safe communities" -- where police and
neighborhood watch groups join hands to prevent crimes -- will
make up 80 percent of residential communities in cities and 60
percent of villages in rural areas, said Minister of Public
Security Tao Siju.
</P>
<P>
"Public security departments should beef up work to guarantee
people's safety, while at the same time cracking down on crime,"
Tao told a national meeting on creating safe communities.
</P>
<P>
Local police will work together with neighborhood committees
in communities to maintain public order there, he said, adding
that they will set up more police posts, establish alarm systems,
and tighten work on preventing theft and fire in residential
communities and villages.
</P>
<P>
Safe communities were established in the past several years in
Shanghai, China's largest city, and Guangdong, south China's
booming province. Many other Chinese cities followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that crime rates have dropped in communities
where public security work was tightened. In Guangdong, the rate
declined by 30 percent compared with the time before.
</P>
<P>
A survey among 1,054 people living in a "safe community" in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, showed 98
percent of them felt safer than before the existence of the
neighborhood watch groups.
</P>
<P>
Tao Siju said the drive is an important step toward improving
the country's public security situation. He urged police
departments to provide better service to local residents in order
to acquire full support from them.

</P>
<P>
The superb Jiangguantang collection of Chinese works of art
was auctioned for 80 million HK dollars (ten million US dollars).
Proceeds from the sales will be used to establish a foundation for

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hotel Workers Agree to Put off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Workers at three major
Philippine hotels agreed today to postpone their planned strike
after the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings due to
take place in the country later this month, a senior government
official said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor told reporters that labor and
tourism officials had met with representatives of the workers, who
earlier threatened to go on strike in time with the APEC meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The initial feedback is that they are OK, and they will wait
until after the APEC," Gabor said.
</P>
<P>
According to a "tripartite agreement" forged among the
Department of Tourism, hotel management and workers three years
ago, the secretary said, labor problems should be subjected to a
dialogue and there will be no strikes "unless we have used all
avenues."
</P>
<P>
The compromise came just one day after President Fidel Ramos
ordered the Cabinet to take "preemptive measures" to prevent any
strike before and during the APEC meetings.
</P>
<P>
Trade union leaders of the three hotels -- the Grand Boulevard
Hotel Sofitel, Sofitel, the Hyatt Regency Hotel -- forwarded
notices of strike to the Department of Labor and Employment last
month.
</P>
<P>
In the notices which expire this month, they demanded the
management increase workers' salaries and end unfair labor
practices.

<HEADLINE> 3 Million Benefit From MSF Projects in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Around three million
people are benefiting from projects run by ''medicins sans
frontieres'' (MSF -- doctors without borders), Dr. Meaza Tadesse
announced here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here for the fourth international day of
populations in danger and on the 25th anniversary of MSF, Dr.
Meaza, deputy country representative for MSF/Belgium said MSF
sections from Belgium, France, Holland and Switzerland are
working in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
She said the projects run by MSF in Ethiopia include sexually
transmitted disease/Aids program, capacity building/support of
local non-governmental organizations, surgical training, water
project related to health problems and technical assistance,
training and rehabilitation in hospitals and health clinics.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the ''international day of populations in danger'',
Dr. Meaza said this year's report is entitled ''world in
crisis''. The first part of the report describes tragedies of
war, famine, disease and poverty which continued to dominate
humanitarian organizations headlines.
</P>
<P>
The second part of the report focuses on refugees, civilians
caught up in war zones both in developed countries and in the
third world, as well as the isolated and excluded civilians
the western countries, she added.

said, adding that ''an organization like ours has the mandate to
alleviate human suffering wherever it exists, in third world

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Supports Philippines' Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Dutch Prime Minister
Wim Kok said here today that his country would continue to support
the Philippine government in its peace talks with the National
Democratic Front (NDF), a rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos said at a joint press
conference that Kok made the pledge when they discussed how the
government peace panel has achieved "quite a bit of progress" on
substantive matters with the NDF.
</P>
<P>
Ramos reiterated the Philippine government's gratitude for the
role of the Netherlands, which had provided the venue for the
peace talks, in the ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The Netherlands has played an important role in this quest and
we thank you for the support that you have extended thus far in
our peace efforts," Ramos told the Dutch Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Kok said before the press conference that the basic
disagreement between the Philippine government and the NDF is that
the government requires all agreements to be implemented in line
with Philippine laws.
</P>
<P>
However, the NDF is asking for a belligerent status that would
allow it to have its own set of laws.
</P>
<P>
In response to reports that exiled NDF leader Jose Maria Sison
is appealing a Dutch court decision to expel him from the country,
Kok said the executive and judicial branches in the Netherlands
"have a very clear distinction as far as responsibilities are
concerned."
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government signed a final peace agreement with
the Moro National Liberation Front in September and is pursuing
peace talks with other rebel groups including the NDF.

<HEADLINE> China to Finish Selecting Firms for Overseas Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China will soon announce the
fourth batch of enterprises to be listed overseas, a senior
securities official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are accelerating the pace to choose the fourth group of
enterprises, with the final result scheduled to come out in
December," Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, China's securities watchdog, told an
international securities seminar here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that firms in agriculture, transportation and
industries that manufacture key raw materials will more likely be
selected for listing abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Top priority will be given to enterprises in the production of
iron and steel, petrochemicals, medicine and building materials,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The chairman stressed that only large and well-performing
enterprises with good prospects are qualified for selection.
</P>
<P>
To list overseas, companies must hold a minimum of 400 million
yuan of assets, and be show profits for at least three consecutive
years. Generally, the state has to hold a dominant stake in
companies listed overseas; its shareholding proportion in some key
industries must exceed 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has redoubled its efforts to explore the world capital
market since 1990, when the country's securities market was
established. A total of 24 Chinese enterprises had listed on
overseas stock exchanges by the end of October, raising foreign
capital of 4.44 billion US dollars.

SINGAPORE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said today that the current economic slowdown is no
cause for alarm as the country's economy "is fundamentally sound".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he was confident that growth would
be healthy next year and that Singapore should still be able to
achieve steady growth rate of six to eight percent in the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
The Trade and Industry Ministry is monitoring the situation
closely and is also in contact with key industry players to get
first-hand feedback, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 90th anniversary dinner of the Singapore
Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Goh said however that he was
concerned over the slower pace of retail business.

The market has changed and there is an over-supply of
retailers, he added. The prime minister urged all businesses
including the retail industry to tap government schemes to
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
Goh's comments came ahead of the third quarter economic survey.
Preliminary details released earlier this week showed that the
economic growth rate fell 3.2 percent, the lowest quarterly gain

<HEADLINE> Explorers Remove Garbage from Sand-buried City in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- An intrepid Sino-Japanese
expedition team has trekked to the ruins of the Buddhist city of
Loulan, which has been buried beneath the Taklamakan Desert for
1,600 years, to remove more than 100 kilograms of garbage left by
explorers and tourists over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Shell casings, partially full bottles of mineral water, and
cans of rotten mutton and beef were among the piles of trash,
discarded by both Chinese and foreigners, including four Japanese
tourist groups who traveled to the site this year.
</P>
<P>
The garbage collectors included six Chinese and seven Japanese,
who for the first time rode two desert cruisers -- rather than the
traditionally used camels -- into the Loulan ruins.
</P>
<P>
Yasukata Kojima, the leader of the Japanese side who returned
to Beijing on Tuesday from Loulan, said that only in recent
decades have automobiles and helicopters been used for trips to
Loulan, and even then people had to leave their vehicles nearly 50
km away and walk for a day and a half to reach the site.
</P>
<P>
"This time we drove as close as 600 m from the major Buddhist
pagoda in the ruins," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kojima, a Buddhist monk and a cultural advisor of the Xinjiang
regional government, has made eight expeditions in the past decade
to the ruins of another sand-buried city, Niya in Taklamakan. He
traveled to Loulan on his way home from Niya.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese group arrived at Loulan on Oct. 29 after a
three-and-a-half-day drive from Ruoqiang County, some 360 km away
from Loulan.
</P>
<P>
It took them three hours on Oct. 30 to collect the garbage from
the ruins and cram it into six sacks, which they hauled back to
Ruoqiang.
</P>
<P>
Loulan, located northwest of Lop Nur in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, was the local government seat
of the Western Regions during the third and fourth centuries, and
was the most prosperous town in the Lop Nur area 1,700-years ago.
</P>
<P>
Numerous written documents, lacquers, and silk and wooden items
were looted from the area by British and Japanese explorers, who
retraced the path of a Swedish explorer who discovered Loulan in
1900.
</P>
<P>
Loulan attracted the limelight again in the early 1970s, when a
well-preserved female mummy was found there.

BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji
told visiting Zimbabwean Vice-President Simon Muzenda today that
he hopes the friendly cooperation between the two countries will
be more fruitful in the future.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said in a meeting this afternoon that the two countries'

cooperative relations since they forged diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier hailed this as a "result of the joint efforts
of the two countries' leaders, governments and peoples," adding
that the exchange of high-level visits will surely advance
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We treasure our traditional friendship and expect that our two
sides continue efforts to make our cooperation more fruitful," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier expressed appreciation for the Zimbabwean
government's policy of "one China," and its refusal to have any
official contacts with Taiwan, as well as its support to China's
reunification drive, and its assistance to China in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He praised Zimbabwe's active role in the affairs of the south
African region, and said he appreciated the achievements of the
Zimbabwean government, under the leadership of President Mugabe,
in exploring paths of development, safeguarding national unity,
maintaining political stability and enhancing economic development.

He wished the Zimbabwean government and people new and
continuous achievements as they build their country.

hard to push forward the peace process in Angola, and are moving
toward an integrated regional economy.

bilateral relations, adding there remains great potential for the
two countries' friendly cooperation in the fields of economics,
trade and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Police Uncover Group Trading Human Beings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian police have
uncovered and partly dismantled a criminal network that forced at
least 4,000 people from the Philippines into prostitution or
manual labor by promising them a bright future in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Police say that a dozen members of the gang had been arrested
by the end of October and further arrests would be made, said the
local press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The police said some of the suspects had been charged with
"trade in human beings" under a 1995 law enacted to cope with
trafficking of women who were tricked into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The network had been doing the illegal business for at least
four years, the police said.
</P>
<P>
They promised some people from the Philippines bright futures
in Western Europe for a price. The emigrants were then usually
taken to Italy, where instead of seeing the bright futures, the
men were pressured to work in restaurant kitchens and quarries and
most of the women turned to prostitution when they faced no other
choice in making a living.
</P>
<P>
The police said the group ran people through the gates of
Amsterdam airport every day for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were awaiting a full report which would include
details from Italy and the Philippines, where the recruiters
sought out people who wanted to emigrate and for 8,000
U.S. dollars offered them a plane ticket and a "probably false"
tourist visa for several European countries.
</P>
<P>
The homes of a few employees of the Belgian Consulate in the
Philippines had been searched in order to trace the source of the
issued visas, a Belgian police spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> 50th Anniversary of UNESCO Celebrated in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A symposium was held in Beijing
today to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of UNESCO, and
the 25th anniversary of the restoration of China's membership in
the United Nations organization.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to continue cooperation with UNESCO and make more
contributions to world peace and the development of human society,
said Wei Yu, chairperson of the Chinese National Commission for
UNESCO, at today's event.
</P>
<P>
She said that China and UNESCO have conducted effective
cooperation in many fields, including national education,
illiteracy elimination, environmental management and protection,
scientific and technological information and development, and
protection of China's cultural and natural heritage.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has UNESCO organized activities in the fields of
education, the sciences, culture and communication, it has also
participated through inter-disciplinary research, training and
public information programs in many current major programs, such
as peace, development, environment, population, drug abuse, and
prevention of HIV," said Wei Yu, who is also the vice-minister in
charge of the State Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Half a century ago, UNESCO, the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization, was founded during the
worldwide reconstruction after World War II.
</P>
<P>
With 185 member countries, UNESCO currently organizes and
promotes international intellectual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's legitimate seat in UNESCO was not restored until
October, 1971. The founding of the Chinese National Committee for
UNESCO in 1979 marked a new era of Sino-UNESCO cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shikon Takei, UNESCO Representative to China, Mongolia and
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said that China is one of
the UN group's founding states. And UNESCO is the first UN
specialized agency to be involved in the restoration of China's
legitimate seat.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National Commission is considered to be one of the
most capable commissions within the UNESCO system, said Takei.
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremony also included a picture exhibition, which
illustrates the history of cooperation between China and UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
Among the 100-plus people attending the commemorative symposium
were representatives from China's educational, scientific and
cultural departments. Officials from Beijing offices of UNESCO,
the United Nations Development Program, and United Nations
Children's Fund also attended the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Rao Applies for Anticipatory Bail in Bribery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- India's former prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao today filed an application for anticipatory
bail in the bribery case of four MPs.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court will start hearing of Rao's application
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The former Rao government was reported to have won over four
tribal MPs with big money and defeated no-confidence motion tabled
by the opposition in the Parliament in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested all the
four MPs and filed chargesheets against Rao and other former
ministers for their involvement in the bribery case.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rao pleaded innocence while seeking bail in
the St. Kitts forgery case today.
</P>
<P>
Justice S.K. Mahajan today heard the arguments of the counsel
for Rao, and some others involved, all of whom approached for
bail.
</P>
<P>
Rao's counsel R.K. Anand told the court that prior to Rao's
direction for attestation of the allegedly forged documents the
newspapers had published the report regarding an secret account of
former prime minister V.P. Singh and his son Ajeya Singh in the
First Trust Corporation on St. Kitts Island in West Indies and the
reputation of Mr. Singh was already harmed.
</P>
<P>
A Delhi court Wednesday granted bail to Rao in the Pathak
cheating case of 100,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the moment Rao was involved in three criminal cases. He is

cases.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Strives to Join WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia pledged to
try every effort to satisfy trading partners and commit itself to
observing rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in a bid to
join the world trade body by 1997.
</P>
<P>
The official Kuwait News Agency reported that Saudi Arabia
made the promise Wednesday at a WTO working party meeting held in
Geneva to study Saudi Arabia's application to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia held its first talks with the WTO in Geneva in
May.
</P>
<P>
Experts and diplomats said Riyadh thought the advantages of
joining the WTO outweighed disadvantages even if it placed Saudi
economic policies under international scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
They cited several reasons behind Saudi's desire to join the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The membership would give Saudi Arabia's petrochemical
industry access to wider international markets.
</P>
<P>
It would give Saudi Arabia a better stage from which to press
for more favorable tariffs on its products and eventually the
removal of energy taxes, which it sees as discriminative.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh hopes that the Western oil-importing countries will
abolish taxes on imports of energy products, saying they are an
obstacle to fair trade.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which groups Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and
Oman, estimates the Gulf Arab states would lose 17.7 billion
U.S. dollars by the year 2000 due to a carbon tax.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts said that in return for joining, Saudi
Arabia would have to introduce major changes to its economic
policies. They include commitment to and practical steps on
intellectual property rights, adjustment of import tariffs and
settlement of legal disputes with many foreign firms which insist
on using international law in trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was on the U.S. watch list for nations violating
intellectual property rights and it charges 12 percent duty for
90 percent of its imports while some manufactured imports are
subject to a 20 percent duty.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, observers here noted that it was not yet
clear whether the world biggest oil producer and exporter would
be allowed to join as a developing country. This would give Saudi
Arabia extra time to conform to WTO rules on copyright
protection and to adjust its import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia considers itself as a developing country.
</P>
<P>
GCC permanent representative to the U.N. in Geneva Dharar
Razzooqi urged Wednesday the WTO's 125 members to approve Saudi
Arabia's membership to the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Gulf region members watch and learn from the
experiences of Saudi Arabia. Its continuous five-year plans have
been models of success for us."
</P>
<P>
He said Riyadh "is not only a key player, it is also a major
contributor to the world economy."
</P>
<P>
But diplomats here believe it is too early to say when Saudi
Arabia will become a formal member of the WTO. The whole process
is just getting under way.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Holds High Hopes But Moderate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- With the Middle East and North
Africa economic conference approaching near, Jordan hopes it will
attract some foreign investment for its projects, but the general
expectations are rather moderate.
</P>
<P>
"We are not promising anyone it is going to be something
big," the English-language weekly The Star published here today
quoted Reem Badran, assistant general manager of Jordan's
Investment Promotion Corporation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But we are working hard to make our national projects appeal
to private investors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 25 national projects, which have an estimated
cost of 3.7 billion U.S. dollars, to be presented at the Cairo
conference, are still subject to re-adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said the project list, which includes the
industry, telecommunications, energy, water, transport and
tourism sectors, seems well designed to attract investors'
interest, because most of the sectors included are not directly
affected by the regional political climate.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's government representatives to the Cairo conference
will be headed by Minister of Trade and Industry Ali Abul Ragheb,
who will underline progress in Jordan's reform program since the
Amman conference held in 1995, the weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian businessmen have become increasingly
reluctant to consider ventures with Israeli partners in protest
against Israeli policies in the West Bank and Lebanon and its
continuing barriers to Jordanian trade with Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The mood in general in the business community here is not
positive and there are certainly no as high expectations as that
of 1995, given the fact that the results of the Amman conference
have not yet been materialized.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Petroleum has become the most
important industry in a Chinese prefecture where oil prospecting
business started during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of local revenues now flow from the industry in
Yan'an prefecture, a former revolutionary base in northern Shaanxi
Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an, the first area of China to exploit oil, boasts the
first oil well, which was drilled during the Qing Dynasty in
Yanchang County.
</P>
<P>
The state has given greater support to the local petroleum
industry since an inspection tour by Premier Li Peng to the area
in 1990, giving greater impetus to development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an has 10 oil-drilling companies, as well as refineries,
employing 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has 430 million tons of oil reserves, with
coverage reaching 1,325 kilometers, taking in 10 cities and
counties.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, Yan'an produced more than three
million tons of crude oil, over three times the total extracted
prior to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an produced 830,000 tons of crude oil in 1995, an increase
of 21 percent over the previous year. Its crude oil refining
capacity surpassed one million tons, to hit 1.18 million tons last
year, up nearly 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an achieved more than 730 million yuan in output value last
year, and earned more than 178 million yuan in profits for the
petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
This year, Yan'an is expected to produce more than one million
tons of crude oil, and refine 1.5 million tons of crude oil, to
give a boost to its economy.

<HEADLINE> Prospects For Helicopter Manufacturing In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Demand for non-military
helicopters in China is expected to be 200 to 300 by the year
2000, according to an authoritative market survey released today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, supplies of helicopters for military use will
keep their steady growth, says Wu Faling, an official with the
China Helicopter Service Company, at the '96 China International
Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition being held in the Zhuhai Special
Economic Zone.
</P>
<P>
Wu predicts that the next 10 to 15 years will witness a big
rise in both quantity and variety of helicopters for civilian use,
with demand growing rapidly in the wake of sustained national
economic development, providing a good opportunity for cooperation
between Chinese and overseas manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Future customers will be tourism, power, armed police, traffic,
fire control, customs, forestry, post and telecommunications, and
petroleum departments.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, ten helicopters will be needed for oil
and gas exploration, and forest farms in the northeast and
southwest will need 38 of them.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications is planning to
establish a postal service that is expected to purchase 100
helicopters for express-mail delivery, while tourism departments
will buy a large number for sightseeing and rescue work.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters for scientific studies, mineral exploration, aerial
photography, air seeding, aerial pest-control, sports and marine
rescue will be in great need, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
China made its first helicopter in the 1950s with the help of
Soviet technology, and in early the 1980s, imported the French
"Dauphin" model to improve production of Chinese helicopters,
marking the start of an era of cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The first EC-120 helicopter, an advanced model jointly-produced
by China, France and Singapore made its maiden flight in June of
last year, and co-development of an S-92 model is under way.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Aircraft Company is negotiating with Boeing company
to co-produce 234-model helicopters.

<HEADLINE> 22 Call Girls Drowned in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- At least twenty two call
girls or prostitutes were reported drowned overnight when they
were trying to reach a cargo vessel anchored out in the Sierra
Leone seas.
</P>
<P>
A twenty-two horse power canoe loaded the girls at the
National Fisheries Jetty at Kissy in the east end of Freetown for
the ship to secure sexual contract for the night when the engine
lost fire and sank, according to a survived sailor.
</P>
<P>
A policeman at the fisheries harbor confirmed the accident,
adding that it has not yet been reported officially as he
considers "the sex trade as illegal".
</P>
<P>
However, the sex trade is now a common phenomenon in Sierra
Leone, especially with the effects of the ongoing war which has
caused hardship and the loss of lives of the male folk in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
Past governments have attempted to abolish this ugly trade,
but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The apparent economic difficulties have left girls, especially
teenagers, to hang around hotels, restaurants and pubs. This has
resulted in a very high teenage pregnancy and labor deaths in
recent times in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,500 girls are dying every six months during
pregnancy and child labor in the war torn country.

<HEADLINE> Systematizing Multinational Corporations' Investment In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists noticed some
time ago that foreign investment was sparsely scattered and not
systematic, but it was not until the second half of 1994 that
multinationals actually did something about it.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey has shown that investment by multinationals in
China is becoming more systematic, even as it grows in scale. To
invest systematically in China, multinationals have set up bases
for product development, after-sales service, and personnel
training, while investment scope has expanded from manufacturing
to banking, insurance, consultation, transportation and other
interrelated industries.
</P>
<P>
Ji Chongwei, a research fellow with the Research and
Development Center of the State Council, says that many
multinationals believe that China is an ideal place to invest, and
more than 200 of the best known, including ten of Germany's
largest industrial giants, and 17 of Japan's top 20, are in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhile, an economist who has studied more than 50
multinationals now operating in China, says that most have
joint-stock investment companies in China, which is regarded as an
important step toward systematic investment. He has found that
joint-stock companies with agencies, marketing, personnel
training, financial aid and information services can co-ordinate
scattered investment and build a unified system.
</P>
<P>
Omron Corporation of Japan was the first to open an investment
joint-stock company in China, followed by Japan's Hitachi,
Matsushita, Sanyo, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Alps and Isuzu, and Germany's
Siemens, Hoechst, Bayer and Henkel.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that many transnational corporations have worked
out realistic development strategies, emphasizing the localization
of parts and spares, technology development and qualified
personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Siemens has so far set up more than 30 joint ventures in China
and the number will soar to 50 at the end of this century. By
then, Siemens will have an investment of one billion dollars, have
30,000 employees here, and annual sales of as much as 10 billion
US dollars, while German chemical giant BASF plans to establish a
petrochemical base in China.
</P>
<P>
Most investment by multinationals is now in the Pearl River and
Yangtze River deltas, and along the Bohai rim. But China's
westward push in its development strategy has caused some
multinationals, like Siemens, to begin paying closer attention to
the country's interior.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, said here today that the Afghan Taliban
Militia have agreed in principle to withdraw troops from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here this afternoon, Holl said
that the Taliban also intended to withdraw its heavy weapons from
the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, there exist big differences between the Taliban and
the anti-Taliban alliance on the detailed plan of the retreat, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban raised the question of how far away its troops
should retreat from Kabul, which has not been answered yet, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to a two-step initiative for peace, the first
of which is a ceasefire, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, both sides will hold political
consultations, the topics of which may include the
demilitarization of Kabul and organization of a neutral force to
safeguard the capital, he added.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance comprises the Uzbek Militia led by
Rashid Dostum, the ousted government forces led by Ahmad Shah
Masood, the Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili group), the Hezb-i-Islami
(Hekmatyar group), the Inqilab-i-Islami led by Sayed Ahmed
Gailani, and local forces loyal to former Herat Governor Ismael
Khan.

<HEADLINE> Six Taiwan Fishermen Rescued from Rough Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Six fishermen of a Taiwan
fishing vessel were brought to safety as a result of the
co-ordinated effort by the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Center
(MRCC) of the Marine Department, the Government Flying Service and
the captain of a merchant ship.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of MRCC, at about 4 p.m. Wednesday,
the MRCC received a report saying that a Taiwan fishing vessel
with six men on board had developed an engine trouble in rough sea
about 186 nautical miles south east of Waglan Island.
</P>
<P>
He said a search and rescue operation was immediately mounted
and ships in the vicinity were requested to render assistance. A
fixed-wing aircraft from the Government Flying Service deployed to
provide air support located the fishing vessel shortly before 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
A merchant ship, World Umpire, which responded to MRCC's
appeal, sped to the scene to assist.
</P>
<P>
As the fishing vessel did not have any life saving apparatus on
board, the fixed-wing aircraft dropped a dingy to her, he said.
</P>
<P>
After four hours of battle with strong wind, the six crew
members managed to make their way to the merchant ship by the
dinghy. They are now heading for Singapore on board the merchant
ship.

<HEADLINE> World's Leading Optical Fair Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Optical Fair
will play a more important role in serving the industry worldwide
with the steady shift of optical industry towards Asia, said Tsang
Hin-chi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Hong Kong
Optical Fair today, Tsang said that the competitive edge of local
optical companies is flexibility and adaptability to changing
market trends and consumer demands.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's small and medium-sized enterprises are ideally
positioned to quickly change product designs and materials to meet
international requirements," said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The three-day fair held at the Hong Kong convention and
Exhibition Center is organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 optical manufacturers and traders worldwide are
featuring an extensive array of novelties and new production
techniques at the fair. Exhibits range from frames and glasses to
machinery, packaging materials, related chemicals and services for
the industry.
</P>
<P>
Overseas participants account for more than 40 percent of the
total number of exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
And to meet increasing demand of international optical
companies, the fair had changed into an annual event from the
biennial one starting this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are now better positioned to help buyers and manufacturers
worldwide keep abreast of the latest trends and developments in
the optical industry in Asia and around the world," said Tony
Chow, the president of the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers
Association.
</P>
<P>
As the world's major center for the manufacturing and
distribution of optical products, Hong Kong last year recorded
nearly nine billion HK dollars (1.15 billion U.S. dollars) worth
of exports of optical goods, optical instruments and apparatus.

<HEADLINE> China To Stay Out of Hong Kong's Securities Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The idea that the China
Securities Regulatory Commission will set up a representative
office in Hong Kong after its return to China next year is not
true, a senior industry official said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"The CSRC will never intervene in the Hong Kong securities
market after its return to China in 1997," Zhou Daojiong, chairman
of China's securities watchdog, said at an international seminar
held today by the 36th General Assembly of the International
Federation of Stock Exchanges (FIBV).
</P>
<P>
He went on to say, "the Shenzhen Stock Exchange will not merge
with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong after its return to China in
1997."
</P>
<P>
The current status of the CSRC, the Hong Kong Securities and
Futures Commission, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong will not
change, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China will continue to choose
better-performing enterprises to list in Hong Kong, and that
supervisory boards on the mainland and in Hong Kong will continue
to cooperate for a prosperous securities market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"China's securities market is still imperfect in many ways,"
he said, citing inadequate legislation and supervision, and
speculation, as examples.
</P>
<P>
A total of 467 companies were listed on China's two stock
exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzen by the end of October. Their
stock market capitalization exceeded 980 billion yuan (about 118
billion US dollars), about 17 percent of China's gross domestic
product last year. Two dozen Chinese firms have also been listed
on overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar was attended by more than 200 representatives
from 42 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the FIBV will have a look at the Shanghai and
Shenzhen bourses, to evaluate the feasibility of China's
membership in the FIBV, which China has expressed a wish to join,
although it has not filed a formal application.

ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, today ruled out the possibility of
deploying UN peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan in the near

</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the office of the UN peace
mission to Afghanistan in Islamabad this afternoon, Holl said,
"deploying the UN peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan is not a
practical matter at this moment."
</P>
<P>
However, the UN will discuss this issue in the future, he said,
adding that one of the preconditions is that the Afghan factions
must agree to such deployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that an international conference on the
Afghan crisis will be held in New York on November 18 under the
auspices of the UN.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the UN organize a meeting specific
on Afghan issue, which will be attended by many important
countries.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time for the UN Security Council to adopt
a resolution on the Afghan issue on October 22, he added.
</P>
<P>
These signs showed the growing awareness of the Afghan issue in
the UN and the international community, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I will go to the conference to be held on November 18, and
present a detailed report on Afghan situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the UN peace efforts to Afghanistan
will be further strengthened when he comes back from New York.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Unemployed Reach 6.3 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
warned that unemployment was getting out of hand with rising open
unemployment and a steady rise in the number of unemployed
university graduates, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Open unemployment last year was estimated at 6.3 million people
or 7.24 percent of the country's 86.4 million-strong workforce,
Minister of Manpower Abdul Latief was quoted as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the country's workforce increased 16.91
percent to 86.4 million in 1995 from 73.9 million in 1990, while
the number of job-seekers (openly unemployed) increased to 6.3
million from 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
He said 218,473 of the unemployed in 1995 were university
graduates, up 1,293 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Only 36 percent of our university graduates annually have been
absorbed by the labor market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latief defined openly unemployed as those working less than one
hour a week.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide financial incentives to encourage
private firms to employ more people, and will temporarily employ
university graduates in government projects, he added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expects to Reach Accord With Russia on Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana expressed here today the wish to reach an agreement with
Russia on NATO's eastward expansion by mid 1997.
</P>
<P>
After talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, German Defense
Minister Volker Ruehe and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Solana
said he hoped that an agreement could be reached with Russia on
NATO's eastward expansion before the NATO summit in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
He believed that NATO's internal structural reform, the
admission of new members and the NATO-Russian Partnership for
Peace would get mature by mid 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Russia has not accepted the "safety
charter" proposed by NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization),
which was negotiating with Russia on the issue through
multi-channels.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who was on a one-day visit here preparing for the
forthcoming winter session of the NATO ministerial council, said
NATO wants to establish a reliable and positive relationship with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
He also said he hoped that the 33 countries sending troops to
the international peace implementing forces in Bosnia would
continue their missions there next year.
</P>
<P>
After the talks with Solana, Ruehe said that in principle,
Germany supports France's demand that the United States hand over
the post of Commander of the Southern European allied forces to a
European and European nations hold the post in rotation.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is up to the NATO leaders to make a decision on
the divergence between the European countries and the United
States on the leadership of the NATO Southern European allied
forces.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM's Cairo Visit Continues Peace Dialogue, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohamed Bassuini said Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy's visit
to Egypt today will come within the context of sustained
political dialogue between Egypt and Israel at all levels.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Sawt al-Arab radio here this morning,
he said that Cairo and Tel Aviv need to continue political
dialogue on the Palestinian file, talks on Israeli forces
redeployment in Hebron, resumption of negotiations on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy's membership in the Israeli higher committee on peace
talks makes the visit so important and will have its effect on
the progress of the peace march, he said.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to cancel Madrid conference principles are
unacceptable, he said, adding that the peace negotiations will
continue on the land-for-peace formula together with the
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process is facing a black specter as the
negotiations have virtually stuck on all tracks since the
hardline Israeli Likud government took power in June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ambassador said Levy's visit here will also
cover the Cairo economic conference slated for November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
The imminent Middle East and North Africa economic conference,
which is aimed at closer regional cooperation and integration,
also bodes ill for peace, as Israel and Palestine have so far
failed to clinch a deal on the Israeli troop redeployment from
Hebron, a sticking point among the 30 or so issues on which the
two sides still split apart.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has played a major role in coordinating
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, is trying to put the peace
process back to track.

<HEADLINE> 8 Thai Fishermen from Capsized Vessel Rescued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight Thai fishermen were
rescued after their trawler sank in heavy seas off Pulau Redang
east of Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia, this morning.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, aged between 30 and 33, kept afloat by holding
on to drums for about four hours before they were rescued by
another fishing boat, the Malaysian national news agency reported,
quoting Terengganu Fisheries director Johari Ramli.
</P>
<P>
Johari said the vessel had since been resurfaced and refloated
and the fishermen were now back in their boat, in good condition.
</P>
<P>
He said the Fisheries Department wanted to bring back the
fishermen, crew of a Pahang fishing boat, to Kuala Terengganu but
they refused saying they were waiting for a boat from Pahang to
pick them up.
</P>
<P>
Johari said several fishing boats which were in the area rushed
to the scene to rescue the fishermen in the sea which was rough at
that time with waves of more than two meters high and winds of
between 30 and 35 miles an hour.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Presidential Nominee Opposes Ties With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's presidential nominee
today held high the anti-U.S. banner, claiming "any secret or
open contact with the U.S. is religiously forbidden."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi Reyshahri, Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei's
representative in hajj and former information minister, declared
last week to run for the 1997 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian daily Jumhuri Islami published the statement
made by Reyshahri at a gathering of Tehran University. He said
based on the holy Koran any contacts or friendship with
"oppressive powers" who conspire for the destruction of Islam
and Moslems are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Reyshahri, 50, did not specify the United States by name, but
"oppressive powers" is a term used by the Iranian officials and
hardliners to refer to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that hatred and animosity of late Iranian leader
Khomeini and his successor Ali Khamenei toward the United States
have Islamic basis and founded in Islamic teachings.
</P>
<P>
Reyshahri stated last week that his faction will "defend the
values of the Islamic Revolution" and is opposed to the
relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, today's English daily Tehran Times said in its
editorial "the ball is for sure in the U.S. court" in regard to
relations between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the U.S. stops its interference in our internal
affairs, refuses to submit to the Zionist lobby, respects Iran's
sovereignty and independent line in foreign policy, recognizes
the values upheld by the Islamic Revolution and releases our
frozen assets, the icy relations between the Islamic Republic of
Iran and the United States will not begin to thaw," the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
On November 4, 1979, Iran's radical students took over the
American Embassy in Tehran and 62 Americans were held as
hostages, which led to the crisis between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iran and the United States have remained hostile
to each other. The United States now accuses Tehran of
supporting international terrorism and seeking nuclear
weapons. It even threatened to launch a military strike against
Iranian targets.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had recently rejected the
call by the American government officials for dialogue with
Tehran and called the whole nation to fight against the United
States as a religious duty.

<HEADLINE> hke110733 - Rate of Asian Suicides on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Suicide rates in Asia are
increasing and the trend is worsening even though many countries
in the region are witnessing spectacular economic development.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the annual suicide rate is currently 15 per
100,000 people, according to Udomsil Srisaengnarm, a leading
psychiatrist of the Samaritans Society of Thailand, a private
organization that helps people who are feeling suicidal.
</P>
<P>
There are 24 suicide cases a day in the country, the newspaper
The Nation today quoted Udomsil as saying.
</P>
<P>
The annual number is about 10,000, although this figure does
not reflect the real picture as many suicides are not identified
as such, according to Udomsil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of suicidal people seeking advice from
Samaritan's hot-line service rose by about 15 percent last year,
according to Lucie Tan-Atichat of the society.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of suicide in other parts of the region is also
on the rise, Udomsil said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is second only to Hungary in the suicide rate.
</P>
<P>
The suicide rate in Sri Lanka is about 35.8 per 100,000 people
per year, compared with Hungary's 38.6, he cited a World Health
Organization (WHO) report for 1993 as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many Sri Lankan men committed suicide because they could not
bear insinuations that their wives working abroad were engaged in
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Japan has also seen a rise in suicides, especially among its
youth, resulting from, among others, the highly competitive
educational system and intimidation and physical attacks from
older students.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore there are also frequent reports of suicides.
</P>
<P>
On WHO's 1993 suicide list, Japan ranked 12th, Singapore 15th
and Thailand 26th.
</P>
<P>
Udomsil said early detection of depression reduces the chances
of suicide and he called on doctors and government organizations
to pay more attention to people's mental health.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Welcomes Clinton's Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand welcomes U.S.
President Bill Clinton's re-election and hopes it will lead to
closer bilateral relations, caretaker Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa said in a message released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand attaches great importance to her relationship with
the United States and looks forward to continuing to work closely
with the Clinton administration to strengthen the existing strong
ties of friendship between our countries," said Banharn.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to pay a state visit to Thailand on
November 25-27 after attending the informal leadership meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said he looked forward to "warmly welcoming" the U.S.
president and his wife, Hillary, although he may not be the new
prime minister after Thailand's November 17 election.
</P>
<P>
However, Banharn is likely to meet Clinton in his capacity as
the caretaker prime minister, as the new prime minister may not
have taken office by the time.

<HEADLINE> Tourists to Israel Down 15 Percent From 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists to
Israel is likely to drop by 15 percent in 1996 compared with that
of 1995, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Moshe Rigel, deputy director-general of
Israel's Ministry of Tourism, as saying that the picture for 1997
looked even worse.
</P>
<P>
If reservations for the rest of 1997 do not improve compared
with the number of tourists received so far for next spring,
tourists to Israel in 1997 are likely to fall by an additional 20
percent compared with 1996, Rigel told the Knesset State Control
Committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Israel received some 2.5 million tourists, a record
high, thanks to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rigel, who described the industry as in need of what he
called "intensive care," said that the ministry urgently required
another 100 million shekels (about 33 million U.S. dollars) to
promote the tourism industry in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hadar Segel, an official of the budget division of the Finance
Ministry, said the ministry would be willing to give additional
funds to the Tourism Ministry for this purpose, though she did
not specify the figure.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Diet Picks Hashimoto as Premier for Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Diet reelected Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for a second term today.
</P>
<P>
The reelection is expected to pave way for the inauguration of
the first Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government in more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto won the premiership vote with the support of the
LDP's outgoing coalition partners -- the Social Democratic party
(SDP) and New Party Sakigake, which suffered humiliating defeats
in the October 20 lower house election.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto got 262 votes in the 498 House of Representatives
votes cast. The 59-year-old premier, who has been in office since
January as head of the tripartite ruling coalition, was also
reelected in a separate vote held later at the House of
Councillors.
</P>
<P>
Both the SDP and Sakigake have agreed to cooperate with the LDP
in policy matters but will not take any cabinet posts in the new
Hasahimoto government, leaving the LDP in sole control of the
government for the first time since it lost its 38-year hold on
power in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
The LDP partially returned to power in June 1994 by forming an
alliance with the SDP and Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and his LDP lieutenants hammered out a broad outline
of the new cabinet lineup shortly after the three-party coalition
resigned earlier in the day to pave way for the reelection.
</P>
<P>
News reports here said there would be only two survivors in the
new Hashimoto cabinet. Seiroko Kajiyama, an influential LDP
member, will keep his job as chief cabinet secretary while
Yukihiko Ikeda will stay on as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the prime ministerial election, Soichiro Ito, a former
Defense Agency Chief, was elected speaker of the Lower Chamber,
and Kozo Watanabe, a senior member of the New Frontier Party, vice
speaker.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Prime Minister Warns of Corruption Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet has called for more efforts to fight corruption, smuggling,
the lavish use of public funds and other social vices, saying they
are threatening the country's development, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is the most critical issue raised for discussions
at the current session of the National Assembly which regards it
as a dangerous threat to the nation at present," Kiet told the
National Assembly (NA) deputies Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He urged all government institutions and businesses to
participate in nation-wide efforts against corruption. He asked
the NA's commissions to make regular inspections to ensure the
effective operation of the government in the fight against
corruption, and law-enforcing bodies to give severe punishments in
line with the laws, not yielding to any outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called for revising provisions of the
country's civil code relating to corruption and other social
vices, saying the existing penalties are not tough enough to
prevent people from committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
Warning of the widespread lavish spending of public funds, Kiet
called on the party, government and people to strictly practice
thrift, and reaffirmed the nation's determination to fight
against corruption, smuggling and wastefulness.
</P>
<P>
In regard to social evils, he noted that drug abuse at school,
rape and trafficking of children increased at an alarming rate,
calling for drastic measures to stop the spread of these crimes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Africa Prepares for Zaire Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is hurriedly preparing plans to take part in an
international peace- keeping force to intervene in the conflict
in Zaire, if asked by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to announcements made by government officials during
the past two days, South Africa will contribute personnel,
logistics and equipment, rather than combat troops, to support
the peace-keeping move.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is actively participating in a wide-ranging
series of international diplomatic initiatives aimed at creating
such a force, establishing safe corridors for Hutu refugees
staying in eastern Zaire to return to Rwanda or Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between Hutu refugees and Zairean Tutsis in
eastern Zaire has already sucked in the Zairean and Rwandan
armies and threatened to engulf the region, South African Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said yesterday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The government announced yesterday that it had suspended the
18.5 million U.S dollar weapon sales to the Rwandan government
because of the reported incursions by Rwandan armed forces across
the border into Zaire to fight along-side ethnic Zairean Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations report on the sale of weapons to Rwanda has
implicated South Africa as one of the suppliers of arms to the
Hutu militia who were responsible for the massacres in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report, released in New York on Tuesday, said a large
consignment of South African weapons were supplied to Hutus, via
a company registered in the Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said South Africa was "an important part of the continent"
and that it was in its broad interest to try to contribute to the
solution of its problems.
</P>
<P>
But the deputy minister said he did not think his country's
troops were ready to participate in a peace-keeping force as they
were still being trained for that role.
</P>
<P>
Other officials said that various government departments have
met over the past few days to sketch out scenarios for South
Africa's possible involvement in a Zairean rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
South Africa could, they said, contribute to the mission by
sending support personnel such as technicians or medial
servicesmen, or by providing equipment such as aircraft to carry
the troops of other southern African states to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
This would be South Africa's first active participation in
such a force, although it may turn out to be an observer status
at the UN peace-keeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria announced yesterday that former Tanzanian president
and Burundi mediator, Julius Nyerere, would visit South Africa on
Saturday to discuss the crisis with President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said two days ago that he would respond very
positively to any request from the UN for help in solving the
crisis in Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Talks Stalemated: Palestinian Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian talks
on Hebron redeployment are deadlocked and even the
U.S. intervention may not get the process moving again, a
Palestinian source was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is happening. The contacts (with Israeli officials)
are not moving anywhere," a senior Palestinian Authority (PA)
source told the English daily The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official made the comments when the heads of
the joint Israeli-Palestinian steering committee met Wednesday
night in Jerusalem to resume the Hebron talks suspended for a
few days.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the current stalemate could lead to another
disasterous situation. "If something doesn't happen soon it will
be a catastrophe for both sides," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat has been holding meetings with his
senior advisers in Ramallah since Tuesday, trying to decide on a
reaction to the present deadlock in the talks. The Palestinian
source described Arafat as being "angry and depressed."
</P>
<P>
He added that Arafat had little hope in the recent efforts by
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross to bridge the gaps with the
Israelis. At this stage, earlier hopes about the possible
signing of a Hebron agreement before the November 12 Cairo
regional economic conference seem to be fading away.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports expected that Ross, who went home last week
after three weeks of fruitless mediation, would return here
Wednesday to finalize the Hebron deal. Ross did not come back
for reasons that were described by the Israelis as the PA's
refusing to give green light to the signing of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side insisted that the Hebron deal could be signed
at any time, blaming the other side for holding up the process
in order to squeeze more concessions from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat urged Wednesday the newly reelected
U.S. President Bill Clinton to give a "quick push" to get the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks back on track. Nevertheless, he
acknowledged that Clinton would not be willing to exert more
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also warned that the deadlock could be used by the
extremists on both sides to sabotage the peace process. "It's a
good opportunity for the extremists on the two sides to sabotage
more and more the peace process," he told the U.S. television
news network CNN.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian sources echoed Arafat's warning against
possible extremist activities to destroy the peace process if
the talks continue to be deadlocked. "Israelis must realize that
the fact that there have been no bombings since Netanyahu was
elected has a lot to do with Arafat. He has been putting a lot
of pressure on Hamas and Islamic Jihad," the source said.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat didn't want to give Netanyahu any excuse to halt the
peace process or to blame the PA for not doing its job. Israel
must understand why there have been no explosions for the past
130 days," the source said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Israeli security forces have been kept on high
alert since last month in anticipation of attacks by Islamic
militants. In addition to the continuation of full closure of
the Palestinian territories, Israeli police set up roadblocks
earlier this week around major cities to prevent the
infiltration of militants, causing heavy traffic jams across the
country.

left for Kunming in southern Yunnan province on Wednesday for the
third Sino-Japanese joint effort to scale 6,740-meter Mount Meili,
on which 17 people died five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The team, including two Chinese climbers, will assault the
mountain, located on the border of Yunnan and the Tibetan
Autonomous Region, in mid-November or December.
</P>
<P>
The mountain is shrouded in mystery after the previous two
attempts made in 1989 and 1991, also by Chinese and Japanese
climbers, failed, with the 1991 effort ending in disaster.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Japanese and six Chinese climbers disappeared in what
was thought a sudden avalanche on January 3, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers only found a camera and films in the lowest camp
before their further rescuing work was aborted due to bad
weather. No body was recovered.

<HEADLINE> China's Oriental Venice Sets New Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 7 (Xinhua)-- China's own "Oriental Venice"
has decided to drop anchor on its 2,500 year history as a water
city.
</P>
<P>
Economic development has brought traditional highways in its
wake - grounding the water taxis in Shaoxing, in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Shaoxing is famed for its large number of rivers and lakes, and
its one time major fleet of boats used as water taxis.
</P>
<P>
But time and tide wait for no man - and the city has been
forced to expand its highway transportation system.
</P>
<P>
Shaoxing water taxis became a part of the local culture and
every year tourists are attracted to the city to experience its
"oriental Venice" magic.
</P>
<P>
In the prime period of river transportation, there were over 60
water-borne routes, carrying 2.6 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the local economy, highway
transportation has taken the place of boats, with the advantage of
convenience and speed.
</P>
<P>
But the water legacy of Shaoxing will not be totally
submerged. With a target of building an international tourism city
by the year 2010, Shaoxing is expected to sail into the 21st
century with its image of China's "oriental Venice" - by having
boats as floating reminders of its watery culture.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Multimedia Display Network to Replace Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- People crowding to exhibitions
in China could become a thing in the past, in the world's most
populated country.
</P>
<P>
The latest exhibition in Beijing will allow people to view the
exhibits on show ... without leaving their homes or offices.
</P>
<P>
They will be able to "tour" the event with the help of a
multi-media network. It will display China's achievements on state
major science and technology development projects launched in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech project, one of the state major science and
technology development projects during Eighth Five Year Plan (1990
 to 1995) period, has been developed by experts from Qinghua
University's Optical Memory Engineering Research Center, Computer
Center, Multimedia Art Research Center and Computer Network Center.
</P>
<P>
Authorized by departments concerned, users can inquire about
details of any of the 180 state major science and technology
development projects launched in the past five years in any place,
with a multimedia computer and a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
The network, with its nearly 100 video compact discs,
introduces the 180 projects covering agriculture, resources
prospecting, industrial technical upgrading, ecological
environmental protection and achievements in other fields.
</P>

The projects, with a total of nine million yuan (1.1 million
U.S. dollars) of investment, has created over 60 million yuan of
direct profits.
</P>
<P>
Lu Da, Deputy Director of Optical Memory Engineering Research
Center, said compared with a traditional large exhibition, the
multimedia network overcomes time and space limits, and its data
bank can permanently preserve its 'exhibits', and statistics can
be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
He said the network has been developed with cooperation from
dozens of state departments. Conservatory of Chinese Music has
specially composed music for the multimedia display.
</P>
<P>
The network will be shown at Great Hall of People in Beijing on
November 12, during a conference being held to sum up achievements
of China's major science and technology projects in the past five
years.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Prime Minister Warns of Corruption Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet has called for more joint efforts to effectively fight
corruption, smuggling, the lavish use of public funds and other
social vices which are threatening to undermine the development of
the country, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
" Corruption is the most critical issue raised for discussion
at the current session of the National Assembly which regards it
as a dangerous threat to the nation at present", Kiet told NA
deputies Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He urged all legislative and managerial bodies as well as the
administrative apparatus and businesses to raise their sense of
responsibility and actively participate in nation-wide efforts
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Kiet asked the NA's commissions to make regular inspections to
ensure the effective operation of the government in the fight
against corruption, and law-enforcing bodies to give severe
punishments in line with the laws without yielding to any outside
pressure.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called for the revision of provisions
of the country's civil code relating to corruption and other
social vices, saying the existing penalties are not strong enough
to prevent people from committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
Warning of the widespread lavish spending of public funds, Kiet
called on the party, government and people to strictly practice
thrift, and reaffirmed the state's determination to fight hard
against corruption, smuggling and wastefulness.
</P>
<P>
In regard to social evils, he noted that drug abuse at school,
rape and trafficking of children has increased at an alarming
rate, calling for drastic measures to be taken to stop the spread
of these vices.

<HEADLINE> China Plans World's Largest Radio Telescope  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China wants the world's largest
radio telescope to be built by the international community in a
moon-like natural crater area of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have singled out the Karst region in Guizhou
Province, southwest China, as the ideal site for the giant-sized
installation, covering one square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
They say the moonscape-type mountain environment forms a
perfect natural setting.
</P>
<P>
And scientists say it will help earthlings find out if
extra-terrestrial life has existed well out of range of existing
telescopes, by scanning billions of lights years into unseen
galaxies.
</P>
<P>
Now China is making strenuous efforts to convince the
International Large Telescope Working Group to back the idea. Its
bid is already winning more and more international support.
</P>
<P>
A radio telescope array, made up of more than 30 of the world's
largest spherical-reflector radio telescopes, would appear in the
Karst region early next century, if China's efforts turn out to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
"It is an enormous scientific project involving wide-range
international co-operation," said Professor Nan Rendong, director
of the organization promoting the radio telescope in China.
</P>
<P>
"At present the largest radio telescope in the world has a
diameter of 305 meters, but if the plan is realized, each of the
more than 30 radio telescopes will have a diameter of more than
300 meters, it will enable earth to receive information from ten
billion light years away, and greatly enlarge the range for people
to search for extraterrestrial Intelligent Life," said Professor
Nan, who also is vice-director of the Beijing Astronomical
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
Professor Nan and his colleagues began their promoting work,
when astronomers from 10 countries, including China, Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, Britain and the United States,
co-established the working group in 1993. The plan involved an
investment of between 200 million to one billion US dollars in
building a radio telescope array, with a collected area of one sq
km and an expected sensitivity of two orders of magnitude more
than the current sensitivity level, using the most advanced radio
astronomical techniques.
</P>
<P>
According to the group, the overall design work, engineering
research and development, the choice of the construction site, and
the fund-raising are all expected to be completed by 1998.

<HEADLINE> China Plans World's Largest Radio Telescope (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"After three international working conferences of the working
group, various kinds of project designs have been discussed and
discarded, leaving only two choices. One is the adaptive phased
array, and the other an arecibo type," said Dr. Peng Bo, deputy
director of the promoting organization.
</P>
<P>
"If the final choice goes to the arecibo, the telescope has to
be built in the remote large Karst areas of the Pingtang and
Puding counties in southwest China's Guizhou Province, because the
arecibo must be based in such an area, and the site is the best
choice as far as the natural conditions are concerned," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Research in the area has been conducted frequently by the
promoting organization, which has set up a database of landform and
terrain for 391 optional Karst depressions, and conducted
three-dimension imaging analysis on 15 depressions.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the United States, the Netherlands, and Canada,
have also been to the areas on survey tours in recent years,
expressing their satisfaction with the landform and terrain, and
China's research and development work.
</P>
<P>
"The field inspection of the Karst region in Guizhou has
deepened the impression gained from the maps formed from satellite
surveys, which shows the region's landform is very suitable for
building a radio telescope," said Robert Braun, chairman of the
large telescope working group.
</P>
<P>
Besides this, the different height levels of the site provide
a natural support for the feed system of the huge antenna, and the
Karst terrain acts as a natural screen to protect the site from
radio interference.
</P>
<P>
"A silent environment is a large asset for any country, which
can be used to its most important advantage for building an
international radio telescope," said Professor Andrzej Kus, director
of Torun Radio Observatory in Poland.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to convince the working group to confirm the
arecibo project, and the site by the year 1998, and then we will
try to launch a pilot prototype, such as a single spherical radio
telescope, with diameter of 300--500 meters, which is the only way
leading to the establishment of the large radio telescope," said
Professor Nan Rendong.
</P>
<P>
Arecibo telescopes were named after an area of the United
States where the current largest spherical-reflecting telescope is
positioned.

<HEADLINE> Eye In The Sky Zooms In On China's Mystery Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Eye in the sky technology has
given China more farmland and hundreds of islands it didn't know
about.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese satellite recently returned to earth with a gentle
bump - and a parcel of startling facts that will mean
statisticians going back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the satellite has revealed:
</P>
<P>
-- That acreage of farmland in the country is 125.3 million
hectares, rather than the published 104.6 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
-- The number of China's islands is 5,000, instead of the
previously announced 3,300.
</P>
<P>
Other statistics gained by a space-age camera zooming down on
China by the satellite show new results on geological forecasting,
oil exploitation, mineral prospecting, and national land survey in
China.
</P>
<P>
China has successfully conducted a "piggyback" service on
remote-sensing satellites on seven occasions, sending 300
varieties of 51 crops into space. Details were given at an
international aviation exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Practice proved that seeds returned from the space were
more productive, providing a new answer to solve grain
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Satisfactory results have been achieved by 300 experimental
devices taken into space as part of the piggyback service. They
have helped in the study of the science of materials and of
life. All these devices, developed by Chinese and foreign
scientists, have safely returned to earth, playing an important
role in research and production of new materials and new
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
China has built, since 1984, a large number of satellite ground
stations which have greatly improved telecommunication services in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous Region and Qinghai
Province, and southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of number of people able to watch television
thanks to satellite transmission in the total population in China
has increased from 30 percent to 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has built the largest satellite TV education network in
the world, which has trained 1.37 million college graduates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Culture Minister Liu
Zhongde says that there are three problems in rural cultural
development: lack of facilities, lack of money and lack of
personnel to provide farmers with more films, plays, and books.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that improving people's standard of living means
improving both their material and cultural lives. If the cultural
lives of farmers, who make up 80 percent of the Chinese
population, cannot be improved, then the overall economic and
social development campaign will fail.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that the culture gap between cities and
villages is widening as Chinese society changes from a traditional
to a modern one, with negative consequences for the quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
"China Culture News" quoted Liu as saying that one of the
ministry's major tasks in the next few years is to create a large
number of model counties that can help farmers learn to read more
and allow them to go to theaters more frequently.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Shanxi
province official, a cradle of many controversial novelists in
modern China, has asked writers to center on the themes of the
reform, opening up and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ronghui, deputy secretary of the Shanxi Provincial
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said at a recent meeting
that the theme is the most important choice for writers.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that they should use different artistic means to
depict the current era marked by great changes, and take more
social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Marxism, realism, and a serious manner in literary criticism,
should be held, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, in northwest China, has become the most famous province
for the creation of novels in the country since the
mid-1980s. Several novelists have published controversial
best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
Liu criticized the trend of learning from "negative aspects" of
western literature, as well as the decadent sentiments, and
anti-lofty mood shared by some writers.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, there have been stronger voices among
Chinese leaders and many other people, urging that socialist
culture be upheld.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Construction of an elevated
road will help Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, solve massive traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, the largest commercial center in the whole of south
China, has unveiled a plan for the construction of a 26-kilometer
beltway on stilts.
</P>
<P>
The elevated inner-city highway will cost a huge amount, but
so far officials have not specified the total bill.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be finished by the year 2001, and
will help the city ease its serious traffic congestion problems.
</P>
<P>
The elevated ring-road will cross 12 overpasses, and for most
of its length the highway will be a dual carriageway of six lanes,
built on pillars. Less busy parts will be a four lane dual
carriageway.
</P>
<P>
The traffic speed on the highway is designed to be 60
kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The inner beltway is expected to protect the city center, by
reducing the number of vehicles passing through it. Allowing cars
to travel faster will cut air pollution, improving the city's
environment and air quality.

<P>
During their almost one-hour talks, Premier Li and President

<HEADLINE> Savings Deposits Continue to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people continued to
deposit more of their money into banks in the first three quarters
of this year, despite two recent interest rate cuts, according to
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the People's Bank of China show that
outstanding urban and rural savings deposits had reached 3.708
trillion yuan (about 446.8 billion US dollars) by the end of
September, a rise of 737 billion yuan over the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Urban savings deposits increased by 613 billion yuan, while
rural savings deposits grew by almost 124 billion yuan in the
first three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts contributed the steady increase in savings deposits
mainly to rising incomes and a declining inflation rate, which
dropped to 6.6 percent for the January-September period from 21.7
percent for 1994 and 14.8 percent for 1995.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the second interest rate cut, on August 23,
has been followed by a reshuffling of the financial resources of
Chinese individuals, with personal investment on the capital
market growing fairly rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Chilean Leaders' Talks Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Chilean President Eduardo Frei expressed satisfaction with their
talks today, saying the Chinese Premier's first Chile trip would
promote future bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In his toast at the banquet this evening given in Li's honor,
Frei said that the "positive talks touched almost all the issues
related to bilateral relations and yielded fundamental consensus."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, for his part, described the talks as "warm, friendly
and fruitful," saying that his Chile trip had played an important
role in promoting mutual understanding, economic and trade
cooperation and the overall development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Frei said Chilean-Chinese relations had been promoted with the
signing of a number of important documents on such fields as space
and agricultural cooperation, which would facilitate further
cooperation and valuable dialogues between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Chile and China are far away geographically, but this should
not prevent the two countries from sharing the determination and
desire for developing political and economic relations, Frei said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chile has over the past dozen of years pursued a
policy of closer ties with and integration into the Pacific
region, actively involving itself in the cooperation and
coordination organizations of the region, especially the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
Frei noted that relations between Chile and China have been
developing rapidly, featured by more scientific and technological
cooperation, growing trade and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade between Chile and China shot up 850 percent
from 1990 to 1995, Frei said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the two countries move on forward on
the basis of mutual benefit, saying China's rapid economic
development has enabled it to become one of the world's largest
markets and that Chile's rapid and stable economic development
would help it become a gateway for China to enter the Latin
American market.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng arrived here earlier today on the first stop of a Latin
American tour that will take him to Brazil and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Orders Cabinet to Prevent Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos on
Wednesday ordered his cabinet to take "preemptive actions" to
prevent strikes before and during the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meetings due to be held in the country this
month.
</P>
<P>
At a regional cabinet meeting, Ramos also directed Task Force
Lily, an interagency task force based in the presidential palace,
to "monitor the infiltration of certain elements into the APEC
fora."
</P>
<P>
"We must take some preemptive actions with their (the firms')
cooperation of course, well before the first drove of high
officials of APEC come around," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos gave the order after workers in at least three big hotels
and other firms, including the Philippine Airlines (PAL) and the
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., threatened to go on strike
before the APEC meetings.
</P>
<P>
The president also appealed to the people for more
understanding in the face of tight security measures being carried
out for the APEC meetings.
</P>
<P>
The measures are only temporary and activities in the affected
areas will return to normal after the conference, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Retired Gen. Lisandro Abadia, head of the APEC National
Organizing Committee, said that no protesters would be allowed in
Subic during the APEC meetings.
</P>
<P>
The hotels reportedly involved in the planned strike are Grand
Boulevard Hotel Sofitel, the Hyatt Regency Hotel, and the Manila
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The labor unions in the three hotels warned last month of
possible walkouts before the APEC if their calls to increase
salaries and to solve unfair labor practices by the management
were ignored. Their notices of strike presented to the Department
of Labor and Employment will expire before the APEC summit opens
on November 25.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, just one day after PAL ground workers ended their
four-day strike, more than PAL 2,000 pilots, flight attendants and
stewards threatened to go on strike over the management's failure
to heed calls for higher salaries and better working benefits.

<HEADLINE> Italian Inflation Falls to 3 Percent In October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy's annual inflation rate
dropped sharply to three percent in October, the lowest for the
past 36 years, giving a boost to Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi's efforts to join the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which has been falling steadily for the last few
months, dropped 0.4 percentage points from the annual rate of 3.4
percent in September, the Central Institute of Statistics (Istat)
said today.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due partly to the macro economic policies of the
government, which has made great efforts to get its economy in
shape to join the European Union's single European currency in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Italy is one of four countries which are at risk of not meeting
the requirements set down by the 1991 Maastricht Treaty to join
the currency.
</P>
<P>
The treaty sets down tough criteria on inflation, budgetary
deficits, public-sector debt and interest and exchange rates. EU
member states must meet these requirements by 1997 to qualify for
membership of European Monetary Union (EMU) to be launched on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But Italy faces a tough job in meeting the criteria. The
government, led by Romano Prodi, is trying to push a draconian
austerity budget through parliament to help it qualify for EMU.
</P>
<P>
Italy must bring its budget deficit down to three percent of
gross domestic product. Under the 1997 budget plan, Italy's
deficit will fall from 6.1 percent of GDP in 1996, to 4.5 percent
next year and 2.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is forecast to fall to 2.5 percent in 1997, which is
low enough to satisfy the EMU criteria.
</P>
<P>
Italy also plans to re-enter the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism, which stabilizes the exchange rates of member countries
within certain limits, by the end of the year.

living in slums in Dhaka do not have minimum facilities for
healthy growth, the local daily The Financial Express reported

<HEADLINE> Complete Dinosaur Skull Found in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The world's first complete
skull of a titanosaur was found in the southern Argentine province
of Neuquen, said the Plaza Huincul provincial museum today.
</P>
<P>
The titanosaur, of a type of large, plant-eating, amphibious
dinosaur of the Cretaceous, roamed in the Patagonic region 80
million years ago, said museum director Rodolfo Coria.
</P>
<P>
The skull of the species was initially discovered by residents
of Rincon de los Sauces, some 150 kilometers northwest of Neuquen,
the capital of the province bearing the same name.
</P>
<P>
The importance of this finding, said Coria, lies in that a
complete skull of titanosaur, which was once the most common and
widely scattered species in the world, had never shown up before.
</P>
<P>
Coria, who directed the dig, said the 15-meter-long titanosaur,
with its skull intact, was found lying "belly up".
</P>
<P>
The discovery is expected to contribute to the research on the
characteristics of the type of dinosaur thanks to the
well-conserved state of the titanosaur's whole body, he noted.

<HEADLINE> 800 Million Face Food Shortage in World: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 800 million people in the
world suffer from food shortage and one quarter of them are
children under five years of age, an official of the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The condition occurs not because there is no food but because
the food distribution is not even," FAO representative in
Indonesia Dato A. W. Jalil said prior to a world food summit,
which will be held later this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the condition is also caused by the increase in the
world population, which stands at 6 billion now and is estimated
to grow to 9 billion within 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The five-day world food summit is scheduled to take place
between November 13 and 17 at the FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy.
At least 173 heads of state and representatives of international
organizations are expected to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Jalil said the summit aims to renew government commitment to
fighting against hunger, poverty and malnutrition and to
increasing food security of the global society through policy and
action.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Soetatwo Hadi Wigeno, secretary general of the
Indonesian Agriculture Ministry, urged donor countries not to use
the food issue as political and economic pressures, particularly
in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Aid for developing countries dropped from 10 billion U.S.
dollars in 1982 to 7.2 billion in 1992 while agriculture's
contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) in developing
countries fell from 24 percent to 16 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO statistics, 88 countries are categorized as
Low Income Food Deficit Countries -- 44 in Africa, 23 in the Asia
Pacific region, nine in the Latin American and Caribbean region
and 12 in Europe.

MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police seized 200
kilos of methamphetamine hydrochloride, the biggest prohibited
drug haul in the country in 24 years, in a raid Tuesday night,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
During the raid, police arrested a foreigner, whose nationality
was not immediately known, in Tagaytay city and confiscated from
him the enormous amount of the illegal drug, called "shabu" in
Filipino, the reports said. A second suspect eluded arrest.
</P>
<P>
Also found in the men's hideout were four blocks of
heroin-based morphine estimated at 1.4 kilos and 75 liters of
uncooked shabu.
</P>
<P>
Clyde Fernandez, chief superintendent and police chief for
Southern Tagalog, said the seized drugs have an estimated street
value of more than 650 million pesos (25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the biggest single drug bust in the country,"
Fernandez said.

Police said the two suspects could be members of an
international drug trafficking syndicate based in southern Metro
Manila.

MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate Wednesday

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Cabinet Resigns to Pave Way for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and his coalition cabinet resigned en masse today,
paving the way for his re-election at the Diet later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP), is certain to be re-elected prime minister without a runoff
at a special Diet session to be convened in the afternoon
following the October 20 House of Representatives election.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, 59, is expected to form his second cabinet shortly
after the re-election and vow into office tonight.
</P>
<P>
Although his party lacks a majority in the decisive lower
house, Hashimoto is assured of being re-elected prime minister in
the first voting round because the Social Democratic Party (DSP),
an alliance partner of the LDP, agreed on Wednesday to vote for
him instead of its leader Takako Doi.
</P>
<P>
New Party Sakigake, another coalition partner, will also vote
for Hashimoto in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Following humiliating defeats in the general election, both the
SDP and Sakigake have decided to maintain their alliance with the
LDP but not to take any cabinet posts in the new government.
</P>
<P>
The stance of the alliance partners will leave the LDP in sole
control of the government for the first time since it lost a
38-year hold on power in July 1993.

<P>
HANOI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The year-on-year inflation rate
in October was registered at 2.9 percent, the lowest since
economic reforms began in 1987, the Vietnam Investment Review
reported.
</P>
<P>
Food prices in October changed little despite typhoons and
floods that plagued northern Vietnam over the summer, the report
quoted the Vietnamese general statistical office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Food prices nationwide rose by 1.7 percent year-on-year, while
in Hanoi the prices rose by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate in Ho Chi Minh city was 6 percent,
nearly twice that in Hanoi, where the figure was 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The staple food prices dropped by 3.3 percent on a
year-on-year basis and those of building materials by 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fuel prices rose by 13.5 percent after Vietnam
increased retail gas prices last month to help the state-run
Petrolimex.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an economist from United Nations Development
Program as saying that the low inflation rate stems from a
combination of factors including the tight monetary policies and
the build-up of inventories in some sectors.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Unable to Settle Fleet Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine cannot sign a treaty with
Russia on the Black Sea Fleet dispute under political pressure
from the latter, President Leonid Kuchma's closest aide said today.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing negotiations between the two sides are at a
critical moment but the atmosphere is tense, Security and Defense
Council Secretary Vladimir Horbulin told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to take a decisive step in the near future at a time
when neither side wants to compromise on its interests and both
want to avert fierce political differences, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has been persistent in its policy in handling relations
with Russia, and will not deviate from the treaty it signed with
Russia in 1994 which includes an accord on the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Horbulin said that the power struggles in Russia at present
makes it impossible for Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
to come for his planned visit and sign a treaty of friendship and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, agreed in
Moscow late last month that Chernomyrdin would pay an official
visit to Kiev before November 5.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, a major part of the former Soviet Union's
naval force, is based on the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia
and Ukraine both claimed the fleet after the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have reached a tentative agreement on
dividing the fleet, but there have been disputes over the status
of Sevastopol, the headquarters of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Late October, however, Russia's State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, adopted a resolution claiming that the fleet was
Russia's property and banning the disputed division of the fleet.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Depletion to Continue Over Lower Latitudes: WMO Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A World Meteorological
Organization expert today warned that ozone depletion will
continue over lower latitudes though it has come to an almost
standstill over the Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Rume Bojkov, an ozone expert of the United Nations
meteorological institution, said that the ozone level over lower
latitudes except for over the equator had been decreasing all year
round ever since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The ozone level has been reduced by an average 8 to 10 percent
over areas populated by human beings, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ozone level over the Antarctica remained roughly the same
as that registered in the previous four years. A hole in the ozone
layer bigger than the area of the United States appears every
September and October in the stratosphere about 14 to 20
kilometers from the Earth's surface over the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer is the Earth's protective shield against
ultraviolet and other high-energy radiation that causes skin
cancers and other diseases as well as a drop of agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
Though scientists and government officials have been urging the
control over the emission of man-made ozone-depleting chemicals as
used for refrigeration and air-conditioning, the concentration of
these chemicals in the atmosphere is expected to reduce and reach
normal levels in 2050 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Ozone Protection Protocol, signed in 1987, and
several of its later amendments are now serving as the guidelines
in the fight against ozone depletion.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Urges Post-IFOR Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana today urged all the 33 countries that contributed
peacekeeping forces to Bosnia to back a post-IFOR mission in the
country which is being rebuilt after nearly four years of war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel, Solana said, "I do hope that countries
which have been participating will continue to participate in
1997."
</P>
<P>
IFOR's current peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is due to end
next month and its international troops are due to pull out by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But there have been calls for the international community to
maintain a military presence in Bosnia next year to help ensure
the country's peaceful reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Solana welcomed Germany's plan to supply ground troops to a
post-IFOR mission. Germany has contributed 4,000 troops to the
current mission and German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the
country would probably contribute 3,000 troops for the new mission.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel told reporters he is expecting the United States to
decide on supplying ground troops to the post-IFOR mission soon.
</P>
<P>
Washington had denied rumors that it planned to send 5,000
troops to Bosnia as part of a post-IFOR mission. But with the
U.S. presidential election now out of the way and incumbent Bill
Clinton back in the White House, a decision should be announced
soon.

<P>
TOKYO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- One in every six Japanese is a
subscriber to personal handy-phone systems (PHS) and cellular
phones, making Japan the second in the number of subscribers,
after the United States, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of subscribers to PHS and cellular phones reached
20.47 million at the end of October, the reports quoted the Posts

</P>
<P>
Subscribers rose to 10 million in February and gained an
increase of another 10 million in the following eight months.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Arrest Anti-APEC Britons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Four Britons were arrested by
the Philippine police Wednesday for participating in a rally
organized by militant groups in protest against the upcoming Asia
Pacific Economic Conference (APEC) meetings in the country.
</P>
<P>
Police said Wednesday that the Britons were arrested in San
Antonio in northern Zambales Province while joining about 200
anti-APEC demonstrators in a march to Subic, where President Fidel
Ramos was holding a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Britons were the second group of foreigners rounded up by
state agents for their association with militant groups planning
to stage street protests before and during the APEC leadership
conference due to start on November 25 in Subic.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, immigration agents arrested two African trade
unionists when they arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International
Airport to attend two anti-APEC meetings in Manila. But after
being held for six hours, the two were allowed into the country
after organizers of the two meetings interceded on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
The Britons were on the watch list of the Bureau of
Immigration, which was informed by the International Police, or
Interpol, that they were members of "subversive" organizations in
Europe, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were interrogating the Britons to determine
whether they have links with terrorist groups widely reported to
be planning to assassinate some heads of state or government
attending the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, police said they will plant moles among the
waiters and bellboys who will attend to the APEC delegates at the
luxury villas in northern Pampanga Province near the Subic Bay to
make sure that no saboteurs would try to poison the delegates'
food or drinks.
</P>
<P>
In San Isidro town in Bulacan Province north of Manila, police
arrested the alleged leader of the rebel Philippine Communist
Party and four guerrillas when they were attending an anti-APEC
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, an official said Wednesday that
the government has reduced the number of potential "troublemakers"
during the APEC meetings from about 100 to just 45.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 45
people, mostly East Timorese, will be denied entry because their
presence here "may not be in the best interest of the country at
the moment."
</P>
<P>
But the official stressed that the watch list of the 45
troublemakers is different from a separate list of terrorists
already placed in the government's "order of battle."

<HEADLINE> Where Dinosaurs Walked Earth - In Great Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Zigong in southwest China's
Sichuan Province has been known as the hometown of the
dinosaur. Now scientists have confirmed that a fossil found in the
city is proof that the long extinct earth dwellers inhabited the
area in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
The fossil is in a piece of rock less than four square meters
in size, and contains more than 200 dinosaur footmarks. Each of
the three-toe footprints is as large as a name card.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a fossil with so many dinosaur
footmarks has been found in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, believe
that they are footmarks of small meat-eating dinosaurs that lived
in the area more than 180 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fossil was originally unearthed by Professor Ye Junlin of
China Geological University in 1972. But it is until now that the
fossil has been affirmed by experts from the Zigong Dinosaur
Museum and other dinosaur research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The footmarks of dinosaurs may shed light on the character,
habits and walking manner of the dinosaurs.

<P>
FUZHOU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province, is aiming for a one billion yuan catch in earnings this
year, by producing more than 90,000 tons of feed for aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
The feed industry for aquaculture in Fujian, one of the
country's leading producers of aquatic products, has lifted its
output from 10,000 tons in 1991 to 72,000 tons in 1995. It now
leads the world in its high-quality feed, and even beats Japan and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Since its launch, the local feed industry has had a target of
catching up with the high standard of Japan, giving greater
impetus to the local leading aquatic products industry.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey shows that more than 80 percent of feed for
prawns and 85 percent of feed for eels meet the high standard.
</P>
<P>
The industry provides a varieties of feed for aquaculture,

<HEADLINE> Obstructed Sensors May Have Caused Oct. 2 Plane Crash in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The deadly October 2 crash of a
Boeing 757 passenger plane off Peru's Pacific coast may have been
caused by the obstruction of altitude and speed sensors.
</P>
<P>
The possible cause of the tragedy, which killed all 70 people
aboard the Aeroperu jetliner flying from Lima to Santiago, was
discussed in a Peruvian Transport Ministry report today.
</P>
<P>
Three static sensors recovered from the bottom of the sea were
still covered with adhesive tape used by maintenance mechanics to
protect them when the plane's exterior is being cleaned.
</P>
<P>
The obstruction of the sensors, on the left side of the
fuselage, could explain the erroneous and confusing information of
altitude and airspeed received by the pilots, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The doomed airplane's computer did not receive correct data
from the sensors regarding changes in atmospheric pressure to tell
the crew about the airspeed and altitude, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On a Boeing 757, three pairs of static sensors and four dynamic
ones form three separate information systems respectively for the
pilot, the copilot and a third alternative for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Even if other sensors had functioned normally, the blockage of
one of them was enough for the Boeing 757-200 to receive erroneous
information about altitude and airspeed, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Culture Is Impetus of Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Chinese Communist
Party ideologist has urged the use of literature and art to speed
up the expansion of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Su Xing, vice president of the Party School of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, said that because culture
belongs to the category of ideology, it can generate a great
motivating force in the development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "China Culture News," he cited the
Renaissance in Europe, which was universally regarded as a
critical element when a capitalist system replaced a feudalist
system, and also the development of technology and the economy.
</P>
<P>
But he disagreed that culture and ideology themselves are
productive forces, and called for respect for the law governing
literary and artistic creation.
</P>
<P>
Historically, the relationship between culture and the economy
has been a hot topic in China's theoretical community, but
disputes have resulted in controversy in both social and economic
sectors.
</P>
<P>
A recent Party meeting decided to attach even greater
importance to the promotion of socialist ethics and culture, and
ensure that the economy and culture will develop in harmony.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Tightens Security in Face of Sandinista Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan police have
tightened security in the capital Managua ahead of a planned
demonstration by the Sandinistas on Friday against alleged
electoral fraud in last month's general election.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said measures were being taken to prevent
possible disturbances and occupation of public buildings during
the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations and public rallies are banned until the Supreme
Electoral Council (SEC) announces the final results of the October
20 election for a new president and parliament.
</P>
<P>
So the Sandinista National Liberation Front (SNLF) would need
permission from the National Police to hold their demonstration.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sandinistas believe the SEC will announce the
results of the election on Thursday, leaving them free to hold the
rally on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
called for calm. She said, "I am not in agreement with calling on
people to rise up and I ask all Nicaraguan people among whom there
is peace, harmony and reconciliation: one must know how to win,
how to lose and to wait for the SEC's decision."
</P>
<P>
The SNLF is protesting against what it claims was electoral
fraud in the poll.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary count by the Supreme Electoral
Council, Sandinista presidential candidate Daniel Ortega was
defeated by Arnoldo Aleman, the candidate for the Liberal Alliance
and the former Managua mayor.
</P>
<P>
After initial protests by the Sandinistas and 10 other parties,
the SEC agreed to a recount of the votes and hence delayed the
final announcement of the results.

UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
today elected five judges to International Court of Justice in
Hague.
</P>
<P>
A Brazilian supreme court justice and a former Dutch foreign
minister were voted to the international tribunal for the first
time. The other three judges were re-elected Wednesday to the
15-member court.
</P>

<P>
Pieter Kooijmans, 63, who served as Dutch foreign secretary in
1993-1994, is a professor of public international law at the
University of Leiden.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's Mohammed Bedjaoui, the United States' Stephen

<HEADLINE> Clean Sweep For Public Toilets in China Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- People wanting to spend a penny
in China have been given the chance of a lifetime. Dozens of
public toilets are going under the auctioneer's hammer.
</P>
<P>
Fuyang city in northwest Anhui Province, east China, plans to
give the toilets a new and cleaner future, by selling management
contracts of some 30 public toilets to the highest bidders.
Experts say this is the first auction for public toilets in China.
</P>
<P>
The first group of 18 toilets in downtown areas of the city
have already been auctioned. Delighted officials say the
individual contracts have led to the environment and image of the
toilets being greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
The bottom price for each toilet had been set at 760 yuan
(about 91 US dollars) per month. But the auction was flushed with
success when the going price reached a minimum 1,520 yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, contractors will pay management
fees to the local toilet administration, and be in charge of the
cleaning work.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 12 will soon be auctioned, and more people are
already joining the queue for a chance to run the toilets as
mini-enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the past low pay for cleaners led to poor management of
the toilets in downtown areas, causing poor hygiene conditions and
widespread complaints.
</P>
<P>
It prompted the local toilet administration to decide to auction
contracts of the toilets.
</P>
<P>
Earler this year, a public toilet revolution was sparked in
Beijing, when the municipal government vowed to improve all its
60,000-plus public toilets. But so far the idea of auctioning any
of the capital's toilets has not been considered.

<HEADLINE> Fish Disappears in Fishing Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Lake fishermen expecting a prize
catch of whitebait this season have returned to shore with empty
nets.
</P>
<P>
They have not seen a single whitebait in landlocked Daihai
lake, in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 motorized fishing boats at the Daihai Fish Farm
set out to catch Taihu Whitebait in the fishing season this year.
</P>
<P>
The fish suddenly vanished in its original place of Taihu Lake
in east China's Jiangsu Province several years ago, but settled in
Daihai lake.
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago 700,000 Taihu Whitebait eggs were transplanted
from Taihu into Daihai lake, and a year later five whitebait were
found in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Around ten million eggs were put into the lake in 1990, and in
1994, 1.5 tons of whitebait were harvested, and eight million eggs
were released into the lake. Last year the harvest reached 291
tons.
</P>
<P>
The locality increased input in the lake last winter and this
spring, expecting another bumper harvest. But all of the fish have
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts attributed the phenomena to environmental
changes and excessive fishing last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 60 motorized fishing boats fished the lake
daily for 45 consecutive days. This violently disturbed the water
body, brought up silt from the bed of the lake, and reduced the
oxygen content in the water, they analyzed.
</P>
<P>
They have suggested that a reserve area be set up for the
propagation of the fish, and that fishing be banned in up to a
fifth of the lake area.

<HEADLINE> Role Model District: School without Walls (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- It is known in China as a
school without walls. Enrolled are 500,000 students -- every one
of the citizens living in this 'university of life'.
</P>
<P>
Its name is Heping District, an everyday community in north
China's port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In the district, everyone is a teacher, and everyone is a
student, according to Fan Benzhang, deputy head of the district, a
role model community, famous for its excellent ethics and culture.
</P>
<P>
In the district, citizens always enjoy going to schools they
themselves have created.
</P>
<P>
Quanye Primary School was not paid for by the educational
authorities of Tianjin, but run by a small resident committee in
the district. Resident committees are the grass-roots semi-official
organizations to help ease people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Seventy children eat, play and study in the school, at a cost
of just two yuan (24 cents) per day.
</P>
<P>
Many people from outside Tianjin have asked the question: why
does a resident's committee bother to do this kind of thing?
</P>
<P>
"Because it is our business to do so," answers Shi Huimin, head
of the committee.
</P>
<P>
She said that to promote education is not merely the
responsibility of the government.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in our district is working hard to create a good
educational environment," she noted.
</P>
<P>
That is because a good education leads to the cultivation of
a good citizen, she explained.
</P>
<P>
The district has formed a complete network of education,
comprising of institutes overseeing juvenile education, family
education, and re-education for various personnel.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of an educational center, a total of 256
resident committees have created special groups to promote
education in the district.
</P>
<P>
Different government departments in the district have
undertaken the task of teaching people. For example, police
bureaus and courts have launched publicity campaigns to spread
knowledge of law, women's federations have helped families members
to get along with each other in harmony. Even troops have run
small camps to receive students who want to have some military
knowledge.

<P>
Even ordinary people enjoy playing the role of educators. On
one occasion a retired man saw a primary school student throw a
loaf of bread on the roadside. He approached the child and
delivered a roadside lesson. He told the student that saving food
is a merit that everyone should possess.
</P>
<P>
Several days later, he received two self-criticism letters. One
from the child, the other from the child's parents.
</P>
<P>
The retired man is not singled out as a role model, many other
people do similar acts.
</P>
<P>
Yu Qinhua, a retired army officer, has spent more than 10,000
yuan (1,200 US dollars), equivalent to one year's salary, buying
patriotic textbooks, and distributed them to the children in the
district.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yangshan, another retired man, even established a small
library for children at his own cost.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years, the educational center in the district
has given 790 lectures to young people, with almost four million
attendances, teaching the young how to act as good citizens.
</P>
<P>
Children are the most important group targeted by the
district's educators. A program named "Project 168"
has been launched to meet this need.
</P>
<P>
In China, students have 168 holidays every year. Many children
have nothing to do except, play electronic games during these
"empty time" holidays. Their parents are afraid that their sons
and daughters might become obsessed with gambling or change into
game addicts.
</P>
<P>
The district decided to do something to fill the vacuum in
childrens' lives.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhonglin, a retired man, was the founder of the first
"Children's Family in Holidays" in the district. Children visit
his house every Sunday to read books, to learn painting and take
photos, and enjoy themselves in other ways.
</P>
<P>
Many other resident committees have opened classes to spread
computer and environment knowledge to children during after-class
periods.
</P>
<P>
For handicapped children and children whose families are
broken, the district set up archives to record their experiences
and organize them to take part in social activities.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of "Schools out of Campuses" have been created, with
the help of 2,000 officials, social celebrities, scientists who
give subsidiary courses.

<P>

Ion Zaharia, who had coached Galati club to national championship
final, died on Thursday after committing suicide.
</P>
<P>

during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
He worked as coach in several clubs after his retirement,
having the most successful career in Galati.

"We do not know what would happen if we let our children live in
an environment without proper education," said Fan Benzhang,
deputy head of the district.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays in China, most middle and primary school students are
from one-child families. They usually lack the sense of helping
others, and are self-centered most of the time. To help
overcome their weakness, the district has set up many volunteer
organizations to attract children.
</P>
<P>
In the organizations, every child is asked to choose a senior
person, or a handicapped child, to aid. By doing this, children
come to know other's difficulties, and their ethics are improved.
</P>
<P>
The very first donation to arrive for a family in Xingan Road,
whose home suffered a fire, was from children. Every
Children's Day, many children buy books with their petty cash and
mail them to poor rural children.
</P>
<P>
Night school is another place for people to improve themselves
in the district.
</P>
<P>
Every night, Shen Xiaoru went to a special school for parents,
where she learned how to teach youngsters in a scientific way.
</P>
<P>
"Now I can understand that there is a great learning in
teaching children. In order to bring up my child successfully, it
is worth my while going to school again," she said.
</P>
<P>
The district has so far opened 185 parent schools, attracting
200,000 fathers and mothers every year.
</P>
<P>
There are other night schools: schools to spread family
planning knowledge for newlyweds; schools to give law courses for
people newly released from prison, and schools to train the
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shuqin attended a labor training class after she lost her
job. With her newly acquired techniques, she was re-hired by a
kindergarten. Zhao Yujuan attended a cooking class after lost her
job and now runs a fast food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
"To give us knowledge is better than to give us food and
money. Community education has provided me with certain
professional skills and ways to live better," she said.

<HEADLINE> China Denounces Western Media Criterion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A major Chinese
representative today firmly denounced some western countries
practising power politics in mass media.
</P>
<P>
It is an important task of the international community and the
United Nations to use media to facilitate the settlement of common
problems of mankind in the post-cold war era and promote social
development, said Wang Xuexian, Deputy Permanent Representative of
China to the United Nations, at a U.N. meeting on the questions
relating to information proliferation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some people who are used to cold war ways of
thinking are taking advantage of or even manipulating mass media
under the pretense of "freedom of information" in violation of the
principles of the U.N. Charter. They spare no money in
establishing the so-called "Freedom Radio" to "peddle everywhere
cliches of a cold war smell."
</P>
<P>
Wang said those people try to impose their own values on other
countries, interfere in their internal affairs, provoke chaos in
an attempt to subvert the political systems and legitimate
governments of other countries.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the "double standards" imposed by those in
the field of information. While attacking others, they either
"prettify or turn a blind eye to their own problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "freedom of information" advocated by those people is, in
the final analysis, freedom of submission rather than that of
resistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must firmly resist and oppose such manifestations of power
politics in the field of information and never accept the practice
of using public media to gravely trample on international law and
norms governing international relations," the senior Chinese
representative said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to formulate certain code of conduct relating
to riding on "information super highway" to prevent anyone from
playing the bully on that highway, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also urged developed countries to supply new technology
and funds to developing countries to help improve their
communication infrastructure and capabilities so as to "accelerate
two-way flow of information for the achievement of mutual
understanding and harmony of the whole mankind."

<HEADLINE> Mobutu Agrees to Deployment of Multinational Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko today agreed to the deployment by the United Nations of a
neutral multinational force in the Great Lakes region and eastern
Zaire, said Raymond Chretien, the special U.N. envoy on the
Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, who held a half-an-hour meeting with Mobutu in the
latter's private villa in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in southeast
France, told the local media that Mobutu had made it clear that he
agreed to the sending of a multinational force by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The president will do everything so that the present lull in
the region will be maintained and a multinational force could
rapidly arrive in the region, in order to bring aid to the
refugees and facilitate their gradual return to their country of
origin, as has been called for by the Nairobi summit," said
Chretien.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state or government of eight African countries in
the Great Lakes region and the Organization of African Unity
Tuesday called on the United Nations to send a neutral peace
keeping force to the Great Lakes region in Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The (Zairean) president is very worried about the integrity
of the frontiers of his country. I am aware of the reservation he
has expressed, but I will have a very frank discussion with the
Rwandan government which has also accepted the idea that the
refugees go back to their home countries," said Chretien.
</P>
<P>
Zaire has accused Rwanda of aggression against its territory
over the past three weeks, during which time the Banyamulenge
Tutsi rebels took most of the Kivu region in eastern Zaire from
government forces.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1.6 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees in
eastern Zaire were driven out of their refugee camps by the
fighting between Zairean troops and Banyamulenges in the past
three weeks, resulting in a huge human exodus.
</P>
<P>
"All the world has agreed upon the objectives (of sending a
multinational force). So, we should from now on agree upon the
means to attain the objectives," said the U.N. envoy.
</P>
<P>
He said that an international force must be dispatched to the
region immediately to set up a human corridor for the refugees to
get humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is expected to fly to Rwanda Thursday to meet Rwandan
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Leftist Coalition Wins Victory in Parliament Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The leftist coalition in
Serbia has won the majority of seats in the lower house of
Yugoslav Parliament at Sunday's elections, according to official
results Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The leftist coalition, consisting of ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia, the Yugoslav United Left and New Democracy, has won 64
seats out of 108 in the Chamber of Citizens (lower house) of the
federal parliament. The Chamber of Citizens has 138 seats, of
which 108 for Serbia and 30 for the other republic of Yugoslavia
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Complete and official results made public Wednesday by the
Federal Election Commission showed that 10 parties or coalitions
have gained seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together), comprised of four
major parties, won 22 seats, the Democratic Party of Socialists of
Montenegro 20, Serbian Radical Party 16, National Party of
Montenegro eight, Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians three,
Coalition Vojvodina two, and the list for Sandzak, the
Social-Democratic Party of Montenegro and Montenegrin Democratic
Action Party one seat each.
</P>
<P>
Commission President Rajko Nisavic said that 4,605,783 voters
(60.7 percent) took part in November 3 elections in all 36
election districts (29 in Serbia and seven in Montenegro).
</P>
<P>
About 65 percent of the eligible voters in Yugoslavia went to
the polls to elect federal parliament and municipal authorities.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of voting slips were valid, Nisavic added.
</P>
<P>
Run-off elections will be held in eleven polling stations, but
they will not have much influence on the definite results due to
the small number of voters (4,000), he said.
</P>
<P>
Nisavic added that the elections were well organized, free and
democratic and foreign observers had no objections on their
regularity.

<HEADLINE> UK Central Bank Urges Fresh Base Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's central bank, the Bank
of England Wednesday urged the government to raise interest rates
again if it wished to meet its inflation target of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank made it clear in its quarterly Inflation Report which
was released today that the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's surprise
move to raise interest rates from 5.75 percent to 6.0 percent last
week, the first rise since February 1995, was not enough to
control inflation.
</P>
<P>
"There is now much less chance of inflation being below 2.5
percent during 1997. Achievement of the inflation target remains
elusive," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's economists believed that underlying annual inflation
could edge back above three percent next month from the 2.9
percent level in September.
</P>
<P>
The central bank added that to achieve the government's
inflation target in the medium term, "some further rise in
interest rates is likely to become necessary in due course".
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that Clarke would be reluctant to raise rates
again before the general election in the spring.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Conference to Give Push to Egypt's Reforms: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo economic conference
will give Egypt a good chance to enhance its structural
adjustment program and to brief foreign investors on its
investment and trade chances, said an International Monetary Fund
(IMF) official today.
</P>
<P>
Howard Handi, head of the IMF's Middle East Department, who is
visiting Egypt, expressed his welcome to the third Middle East
and North Africa Economic Conference due to be held here on
November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
The first and second conferences were held separately in
Casablanca, Morocco, in 1994 and Amman, Jordan, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The IMF regards the conference as a main step on the road to
strike a political and economic reconciliation among countries
in the region and fostering regional economic cooperation in the
Middle East, he said in a statement available here today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Handi told reporters that Egypt's economy will grow
at least 6 percent a year by the turn of the century if the
government continues to liberalize trade and privatize the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that inflation in the country will also fall to
about 5 percent a year from current levels of above 7 percent
once the IMF-backed reform program is realized.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, the Egyptian government has tried
with IMF help to restructure its public-sector-dominated economy.
</P>
<P>
Some IMF officials are to take part in the upcoming economic
conference to discuss their contribution to a number of regional
economic cooperation projects.

<HEADLINE> Top Cyprus Official Concerned over Pressure on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus parliament speaker Spyros
Kyprianou today expressed concern that pressure would be exerted
"for Dayton-type meetings" within the framework of initiatives
being undertaken for a settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, who is currently visiting Greece at the invitation
of his Greek counterpart Apostolos Kaklamanis, said that he hoped
he would be proved wrong and expressed fear that "there will be
blackmail connected even with Cyprus' accession to the European
Union".
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou was speaking at a joint press conference with
Kaklamanis following talks between the two men.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent developments regarding the Cyprus problem,
Kyprianou predicted that the British initiative for a settlement
would eventually become one with an anticipated U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
There have been speculations that the U.S. would undertake a
new "vigorous initiative" on the Cyprus problem following the
re-elections of president Bill Clinton, which the local press
claimed would be similar to the "Dayton Agreement" for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Alertness and awareness is necessary on the part of all
Greeks in order to confront initiatives which distort the
physiognomy of Cyprus and fail to secure broad guarantees from the
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,"
Kyprianou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
surged strongly and closed sharply higher, boosted by US President
Bill Clinton's election victory, a strong Wall Street and a firmer
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The London market ended the session with the least gains as
much of its early rising inspired by the US election was wiped out
by new fears of more interest rates hikes following the Bank of
England's call today for higher rates to control inflation in its
quarterly Inflation Report.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market was the best performer, with the DAX-30
share index ending 1.41 percent, or 37.9 points up at 2,729.19,
cheered by Clinton's win, Wall Street's overnight gains and the
stronger dollar.
</P>
<P>
French shares in the Paris bourse also ended well over one
percent up, or 26.05 points higher at 2,213.37, a new high for
1996, as investors were inspired by Clinton's re-election and went
on a buying spree of 7.3 billion franc (1.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 leading British shares ended 14.6 points
higher at 3,935.7. The Frankfurt DAX-30 share index closed up
37.90 at 2,729.19. The Paris CAC-40 share index finished up 26.05
at 2,213.37.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William
Perry and Secretary of State Warren Christopher have told
President Bill Clinton that they will resign, administration and
military officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, 71, informed Clinton of his decision Tuesday night
in Little Rock, Arkansas, as election returns were showing the
president had won a second term, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who was reluctant to take the job three years ago, said
he would stay on until a replacement is found.
</P>
<P>
Word of both men's resignations came from officials who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
There might be four to six Cabinet changes, aides said, as
Clinton prepares his team for a second White House term.
</P>
<P>
Energy's Hazel O'Leary is considered almost certain to depart.
O'Leary, her reputation smudged by excessive travel expenses, was
"given the clear impression" that Clinton wants her out, one
official said.
</P>
<P>
Even when Clinton wrapped up his successful campaign, White
House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta was meeting one by one with
Cabinet members to discuss their futures.
</P>
<P>
For some, like Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala, Panetta offered the president's strong support. For
others, he listed the president's grievances and hoped the
secretary "would take the hint," said one administration official.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor plans to resign, but is
angling for a new post. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena has
a shaky hold on his seat at the Cabinet table, but could still
stay, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Many at the highest levels of the White House reportedly would
like Janet Reno to leave, but it would be difficult to fire the
popular attorney general, they said.
</P>
<P>
Panetta, who will soon leave the White House himself, hopes to
announce the departures all at once sometime after a Cabinet
meeting Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> Airbus, USAair Sign Historic Contract on Plane Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The European airspace consortium
Airbus Industrie and the American air company USAir today signed a
historic contract on the purchase of 400 Airbus planes by USAir,
announced Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that this contract, estimated at 18 billion
U.S. dollars, scores a significant victory for Airbus Industrie in
its decade-long strategy to enter the North American market, a
natural playground of the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
USAair, the fifth largest U.S. air company, will buy 120 Airbus
planes of the single corridor family: Airbus A319, Airbus 320 and
Airbus 321. It also orders 120 planes of the same sort, and 160
planes of other options from Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the fierce competition
among plane makers could allow the air company to buy planes at a
lower price and enjoy a kick-back.
</P>
<P>
Some sources told AFP that Airbus Industrie could offer a 20
percent discount to USAir for such a big deal.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has been gaining ground in its competition with the
world number one plane maker the Boeing by obtaining a contract
buying 30 planes from China in April and another buying 45 from
the U.S. leasing company GECAS in July.
</P>
<P>
However, Airbus, which has sold 288 planes since January, still
lags behind the Boeing, which sold 500 for 37 billion dollars in
the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser is the McDonnell Douglas and its new-born
MD95, a plane with 100 seats. The Airbus 319, Airbus 320 and
Airbus 321 have 122, 144 and 168 seats.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus spokesman said that Airbus Industrie will deliver
about 130 planes this year, which is a little bit more than 1994
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus workshops in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany,
are expected to increase their production from nine planes per
month by the end of the year to 14 next year and 18 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For USAir, which flies 5,000 flights each day to 200
destinations around the world and in the United States, the
purchase of Airbus planes will bring about a structural
improvement in its 400 plane fleet, which consists of DC-9, Fokker
F-100, Fokker F-28, and Boeing 737.

<HEADLINE> Monitoring Committee: Israel Responsible for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation group monitoring
the cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon has found the Jewish
state responsible for the wounding of a civilian in shelling at
southern Lebanese villages Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a verdict issued at the end of a marathon meeting today,
the committee also admitted that it has failed to persuade Israel
to allow the return of 21 Lebanese deported September by Israeli
forces from their homes in a southern Lebanon border strip
occupied by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives from the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was set up under a
cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel in
April, which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Held at the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in
the southern Lebanese border town of Naqoura, the meeting started
Tuesday morning and lasted until today's midday.
</P>
<P>
In a complaint filed to the committee, Lebanon said that five
120mm mortar shells hit the village of Louwaizeh Sunday, wounding
a Lebanese woman and damaging three houses, a mosque and its
cemetery and a car.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon also refuted an Israeli allegation that the
bombardment was for self-defending against guerrillas attack on
Israeli forces from the village.
</P>
<P>
On military actions by Israeli forces, the verdict said "it
(the Israeli side) should have taken more cautions in order to
avoid the wounding and damages."
</P>
<P>
However, the verdict noted a difference of view points among
the five delegations on the complaint lodged by Lebanon over the
deportation of the 21 Lebanese from the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone" in September.
</P>
<P>
The delegations disagree "on whether the complaint was within
the competence of the (April cease-fire) understanding," the
verdict said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued later today, the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry also said the committee "agreed to treat the issue in
spite of strong opposition by Israel on the grounds that the
April understanding does not include the problem of deportation."

<HEADLINE> Tension Still High in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEBRON, The West Bank, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Tension
remained high in Hebron today despite optimism about a
breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the
future of the only West Bank city still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers heavily guarded the entrances to the Hebron
Mosque where an extremist Jewish settler shot dead 29 Moslem
worshipers more than two years ago, and security check was
reinforced amid rumors of terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Around Ibrahim Avino, one of the two Jewish settlements inside
the city, troops were preventing any Arab from approaching,
keeping the controversial vegetable market closed.
</P>
<P>
The market, 100 meters long at most, constituted one of the
pending issues in the three weeks of hard bargaining between the
Palestinians and Israelis last month. The Jewish settlers claim
that it was built on Jewish property while the Arabs say that
they have the right to reach the narrow street.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlers were warned of possible suicide attacks in
retaliation for the assassination of an Islamic Jihad leader a
year ago, while fears were fanned up among Arab residents in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip for violence.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, a Jewish settler attempted to set an Arab
house on fire, thus injuring members of the family, the local
press reported.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very tense," said Mustafa Natshe, mayor of
Hebron, who blamed the Israeli government for the far-delayed
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
According to the interim agreement, also known as Oslo II, the
Israeli army was originally supposed to pull back from
approximately 80 percent of Hebron by March 28, 1996. However,
the assumption of power by the Israeli right-wing parties in June
indefinitely put off the the Israeli pullout from the city,
where 450 Jews live among some 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Pressed hard by Washington, the two sides returned to the
negotiating table early last month, but three weeks of
bargaining led to nowhere before U.S. peace coordinator Dennis
Ross left for home empty-handedly by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis wanted to divide the city for Jews and Arabs and
preserve the right of hot pursuit of "terrorists" into the city
if necessary. But the Palestinians seek a strict implementation
of the signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
Washington has announced that it wanted an agreement to be
signed on November 12 and Dannis Ross would return to the region
Wednesday, giving rise to speculations that a breakthrough might
be within reach.
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Natshe remained cautious. "There are many problems
left unresolved and the only way out is to implement the Oslo
accords by Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor ruled out the possibility of making compromise by
the Palestinians and said he had detected no flexibility in the
Israeli stands since he was out of the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
intended to prolong the peace process by taking no concrete steps
forward.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Ross will succeed in his mission to convince the
Israeli government to implement the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor proposed that the Jews and Arabs alike would be
disarmed and only let the Israeli army and the Palestinian police
carry firearms in their designated areas.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israeli soliders are armed with rifles, the
Palestinian police should be given the same weapons," he
demanded, rejecting an early Israeli request that the Palestinian
police be armed only with pistols.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat was busy consulting with the legislative Palestinian
Council members in Ramallah on possible changes in the Mideast
situation following the reelection of U.S. President Bill
Clinton. But few details were available.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans ought to put more pressures on Israel after
Clinton secured his continued stay in the White House," said a
lecturer of the Hebron University, which was closed down eight
months ago by the Israeli security authorities following waves of
suicide bombing attacks inside the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important for the Americans to play a fair game,"
said the middle-aged lecturer who asked not to be named.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Rules out US Policy Change in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Richard Jones, ambassador of
the United States to Lebanon, ruled out here today a change
of his country's policy in the Middle East after the re-election
of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. administration is making big efforts
in finding a "common field" for a resumption of the peace
process between Israel on the one side and Lebanon and Syria
on the other.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz, the U.S. diplomat said that the peace talks
on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks will continue, noting that
Washington will enhance its efforts following the U.S.
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Jones told reporters that the U.S. administration had been
seeking ways for the resumption of the two tracks and
currently "we are concentrating on the problem of an Israeli
redeployment from Hebron."
</P>
<P>
"These negotiations will resume soon," the U.S. envoy
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether the U.S. will change its
policy in the Middle East after the general elections, Jones
said the U.S. has taken a "balanced and firm policy and
we will continue following this policy in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said that the events in the region have been affecting
the U.S. policy, but "I don't expect a sharp change in our
policy and we are working with patience and we will continue
to do so."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat also ruled out an escalation of tension
in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Take Retaliatory Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cypriot regime
today barred enclaved Greek Cypriots from returning to their
villages in the northern Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
This action came as a retaliation to a protest at the Ledra
Palace check-point by Greek Cypriots who try to dissuade tourists
from visiting the north.
</P>
<P>
The regime closed earlier today the Ledra Palace check-point,
the only crossing point between the south and the north. And two
Greek Cypriot couples and a child trying to return home in the
north were turned back.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told his daily
press briefing today that such behavior was "totally unjustified
and a serious violation of the human rights of enclaved Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot excuse any measures which may affect the human
rights of the enclaved. We shall protest such moves worldwide
and we shall respond in a firm manner," Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that the government does not
encourage the type of protest Greek Cypriots are staging at the
Ledra Palace check-point, near the U.N. buffer zone, and will
attempt again to persuade protesters, led by parliament member
Marios Matsakis, to change their manner of protesting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) has already expressed great concern to the government
over the protest.
</P>
<P>
Matsakis, assisted by Greek Cypriot refugees and relatives of
four unarmed Greek Cypriots killed by Turkish troops in the past
few months, have staged a sit-in protest at the Ledra Palace for
the past three weekends in a bid to dissuade foreign tourists
from visiting the northern areas and spending money there.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Matsakis described today's
incident as "blackmail" and said organizers of the protest will
not give in to it.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides is expected to meet the
organizers of the protest again tomorrow to prevent further
protests.
</P>
<P>
The East Mediterranean island has been divided into two parts
in 1974 when Turkey sent in troops following a short-lived Greek
Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
