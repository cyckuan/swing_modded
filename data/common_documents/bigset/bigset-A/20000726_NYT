STUDY LOOKS AT NURSING HOME COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With the nursing home industry facing greater
scrutiny, an arm of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. has
reported that the average cost of a nursing home stay in the United
States is $153 per day.
</P>
<P>
   But the study by MetLife Mature Market Institute noted big cost
variations for private rooms in different metropolitan areas. The
most expensive rooms can be found in New York City, where the
average cost is $295 a day. The least expensive rooms, at an
average of $90 a day, were found in Hibbing, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing home rooms in the Kansas City area were found to have an
average daily cost of $117, which made Kansas City the
16th-most-affordable metropolitan area in the 90-city study.
</P>
<P>
   The study also looked at the cost of home health care, which it
calculated at an average cost of $16 an hour nationally. Home
health care costs from licensed agencies ranged from an average of
$12 an hour in San Antonio to $24 an hour in Hartford, Conn. The
average cost in Kansas City was calculated at $16 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Deanne Lenhart, executive director of the nonprofit Kansas
Advocates for Better Care, based in Lawrence, said the nursing home
cost figures are relatively high because they are based on rates
for private rooms. But most nursing home residents in the United
States actually have semiprivate rooms, which are not as expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Lenhart said, the majority of nursing home residents
around the country have their costs paid for by Medicaid, the
state-federal health program for people who have used up their
financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   However, nursing home care still presents a financial burden for
many, Lenhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some places will nickel-and-dime you to death for charges on
certain things, because different nursing homes have different
definitions on what constitutes standard supplies or standard
care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lenhart said, some nursing homes charge extra to
serve residents meals in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The average stay in a nursing home is 2 1/2 years, said Sandra
Timmermann, director of the MetLife Mature Market Institute, in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
   The cost figures were released at a time when elderly adults
represent the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, and
more senior citizens and their families are having to make
decisions about long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Timmermann said the cost figures could help consumers decide
where they should retire and whether they should obtain long-term
care insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projected average cost for one person is $55,000 per year,
or $139,500 for the average 21/2 years, causing many families to
spend down their assets,'' Timmermann said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted this year in the 48 contiguous states.
More than 435 nursing homes and 219 home health agencies were
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   There are 17,000 nursing home facilities in the United States,
with 1.8 million beds and 1.6 million residents, according to the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Problems involving nursing homes have attracted wide attention
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials recently concluded that most nursing homes are
understaffed to the point that patients may be in danger. Kansas
and Missouri were cited among the states in which understaffing is
the most severe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Missouri officials said low wages were
driving down the quality of care at Missouri nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Several big nursing home operators around the country have filed
for bankruptcy protection in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is recommending strict new rules that
would require thousands of nursing homes to hire more nurses and
nurse's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing home officials have said it is unrealistic for the
government to specify minimum levels of staffing when they are
receiving what they characterize as inadequate payments under the
Medicaid and Medicare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Like hospitals and other health care providers, nursing homes
are lobbying Congress to restore money cut from Medicare in 1997.

CANDIDATE BENEFITS FROM EVOLUTION DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ During the last year, Kansas' flap over
evolution has represented a question of local control to some and a
statewide embarrassment to others.
</P>
<P>
   But for Linda Holloway's re-election campaign for the Kansas
Board of Education, it has meant one more thing: money.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who led the board last August when it approved new
science standards omitting references to some aspects of
evolutionary theory, raised almost $90,000 in campaign
contributions from January through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's nine times as much as Holloway, a conservative Republican
from Shawnee, Kan., raised when she first ran for the board in
1996. And it's more than twice the amount raised by her current
challenger, moderate Republican Sue Gamble of Shawnee, with
$36,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising by Holloway, 50, and Gamble, 58, makes their
2nd District race the most expensive ever for the state board.
</P>
<P>
   Contests for seats on the 10-member board usually attract little
or no attention. But this year, elevated by the battle over
evolution, races for the five seats up for grabs are as
high-profile as some congressional contests.
</P>
<P>
   The money flowing into the campaigns is proof of that, said
Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exceptional situation where you have national
attention being focused on this race,'' Loomis said. ``A lot of
people clearly found this an important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway agreed. She said her successful fund-raising validates
her August 1999 vote on the science standards, guidelines for
teaching and testing..
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of support for what we did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a lot of opposition, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, a 13-year member of the Shawnee Mission school board,
raised almost twice that of the next most successful fund-raiser,
moderate Republican Carol Rupe of Wichita, Kan. Rupe is challenging
incumbent conservative Republican Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita in
the 8th District state board primary.
</P>
<P>
   By pulling in more money than Gamble, Holloway has reversed a
state trend _ moderates usually out-raise conservatives, Loomis
said.
</P>
<P>
   The money allowed Holloway to buy $35,000 worth of television
ads and an advertisement in a national Christian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The figures come from state campaign finance reports the
candidates filed Monday with the Kansas secretary of state's
office.
</P>
<P>
   According to the reports, 37 Holloway donors ponied up the $500
maximum; 22 of those were from outside the 2nd District, which
includes eastern Johnson County, Shawnee and Lake Quivira.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one Gamble donors _ six from outside the district _ gave
$500.
</P>
<P>
   But Gamble said she was pleased nonetheless. She said she raised
as much as she expected to when she went into the campaign last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble reported $29,175 in itemized donations, or those over
$50; $5,100, or 18 percent, came from outside the district. That
amount included $1,300 from outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very grass-roots,'' Gamble said. ``It's very hands-on.
It's very personal. I probably know 75 percent of these people that
have sent me money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble listed every donation on her form, even those less than
$50.
</P>
<P>
   Included among her more prominent donors is Linda Graves, wife
of Gov. Bill Graves, who contributed $100. Current state board of
education members Val DeFever of Independence, Kan., and Janet
Waugh of Kansas City, Kan. each gave the Gamble campaign $100;
board member Sonny Rundell of Syracuse contributed $75.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway received more than four times as much money from
contributors outside the 2nd District as Gamble did.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Holloway reported $43,980 in itemized donations. Of
that amount, $22,370 _ or 51 percent _ came from sources outside
the district, including $2,925 from donors outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   Her $89,632 total includes a $15,000 personal loan to her
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among Holloway's more prominent donors is intelligent design
supporter Phillip Johnson, a University of California-Berkeley law
professor, who gave $500, and former state board member Kevin
Gilmore of Olathe, Kan., who along with his wife, Julie, donated
$1,000. The Discovery Institute, a national thinktank that espouses
intelligent design, gave the Holloway campaign $500.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway counts grass-roots support, too. She listed $30,447.12
in unitemized contributions _ those under $50.
</P>
<P>
   But the massive fund-raising could have a down side, even for
the winner of Tuesday's contest, said Mark Tallman, a lobbyist with
the Kansas Association of School Boards and a longtime state board
observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it becomes more of just a national battleground over who is
in control, I don't think that's healthy,'' Tallman said. ``Is it a
deterrent (to future candidates) if they spend too much?''

TEAM OF LAWYERS TO LEAVE BLACKWELL FIRM TO JOIN SHOOK HARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A group of environmental lawyers at Blackwell
Sanders Peper Martin is leaving the firm and joining Shook Hardy &AMP;
Bacon, which has been busy trying to diversify its practice by
recruiting lawyers in hot growth areas.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which may consist of as many as nine lawyers, makes
up most of Blackwell's environmental practice group. The group
plans to hook up with Shook in the next few days and practice out
of the firm's Corporate Woods office in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental law has been a very active area for us, but it's
an area where we haven't had the depth and strength we needed to
support a practice like this on a national level,'' said Robert
Grossman, a Shook lawyer who manages the firm's Corporate Woods
office.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell is wasting little time trying to fill the breach
created by the lawyers' exodus. The firm quickly imported an
environmental lawyer, Brad Hiles, from its St. Louis office and is
trying to recruit environmental lawyers from other legal shops in
Kansas City and elsewhere. The firm also hopes to persuade a couple
of lawyers to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's industry, attorneys are very mobile,'' said
Blackwell partner Dave Fenley. ``Firms who are growing will always
seek to find people from other law firms, just as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell, with more than 300 lawyers, is the second-largest law
firm based in Kansas City and is best known for its corporate work,
particularly on behalf of long-time client UtiliCorp United Inc.
The firm has an active environmental practice and most recently
represented property owners in a class-action lawsuit involving the
Amoco refinery in Sugar Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Shook, with 460 lawyers, is the city's biggest law firm and is
widely known for its tobacco and pharmaceutical defense work. The
firm represents three of the Big Five tobacco companies, including
top cigarette maker Philip Morris Co., and has been one of the
leading industry defenders for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Shook had never lost a tobacco case until a couple of years ago,
when the seemingly impregnable legal fortress constructed by Shook
began to crumble in the face of disclosures that the industry had
concealed the dangers of smoking for decades.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a long-term strategy to broaden its practice beyond
its mainstay tobacco and drug work, Shook in recent years has
ventured into a variety of growth-oriented practice areas,
particularly intellectual property, energy and telecommunications
law. The firm also has expanded geographically, opening several
offices abroad and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Shook grossed $170 million in 1999, according to the magazine
The American Lawyer, good enough to rank 75th among the top
grossing law firms in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shook, as an offshoot of its product liability work,
has handled major environmental matters _ including toxic tort and
propane gas litigation _ its environmental practice has been
relatively small. The influx of as many as nine lawyers doing that
kind of work _ in addition to the recent recruitment of a couple of
prominent environmental lawyers at its Miami office _ will more
than triple the size of its environmental department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a continuation of our strategic plan to have national
capabilities in all significant areas of litigation,'' said Shook
managing partner Pat McLarney. ``Environmental law is a very active
area, and we saw this as an opportunity to really strengthen our
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the group of lawyers joining Shook are Blackwell
partners David Erickson and Mark Anstoetter, who submitted their
resignations to Blackwell on Friday. Although they hope to join
Shook this week, Blackwell may not let them do so because their
partnership agreement has a 90-day notice provision.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Erickson and Anstoetter at Shook are Blackwell senior
counsel Sarah T. Sullivan and four to six associates.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' departure comes about a month after six Blackwell
lawyers left the firm to form a new in-house legal department at
UtiliCorp. That group was led by Les Parrette Jr., who headed
Blackwell's international practice group.

EDITORIAL: DICK CHENEY'S POLITICAL RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 26:
</P>
<P>
   Because he never served in Congress, Gov. George W. Bush does
not have a voting record. But he acquired one on Tuesday with the
selection of Richard B. Cheney as his running mate. Republicans
were cheering the sound judgment and broad foreign policy
experience that Cheney, a former secretary of defense and White
House chief of staff, brings to the Republican ticket. But
Democrats were eyeing the hard-line conservative votes that Cheney
cast during a 10-year House career. From Vice President Al Gore's
perspective, Cheney adds weight to the GOP ticket, but he also
opens up promising lanes of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes that his running mate brings a resume and a
personality that will outweigh any ideological vulnerability.
Indeed, Cheney's vaunted toughness comes wrapped in a genial,
Nebraska-born, Wyoming-honed personal manner. His deep experience
clearly allows Bush to argue that he has passed a threshold test
for any presidential candidate by picking a partner who would make
a plausible successor. On that score, Bush did a much better job
than his father did in 1988 by choosing Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cheney's competence cannot soften a stark legislative
record. Several times in his congressional career he got a 100
percent favorable rating from the American Conservative Union and
zero from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action. He was
consistently pro-life, and his opposition to abortion, even in
cases of rape or incest, will help Gore argue that the Bush-Cheney
ticket represents a threat to women's right to choose. Cheney also
voted against gun control legislation that came his way, including
a bill regulating cop-killer bullets that many other conservatives
backed.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's environmental views will also be a tempting target for
Gore. Cheney was among the few who voted not to override President
Reagan's veto of a Clean Water Act reauthorization in 1987. Then as
now, he supported opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to
oil drilling, a talismanic issue among conservationists. He is also
on record as opposing the Kyoto agreement on global warming, which
Gore helped to negotiate, as a potential threat to America's
national security.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney never demonstrated the mean streak associated with
Newt Gingrich conservatives, his selection indisputably pulls the
Republican ticket to the right. This comes after several weeks when
it appeared that Bush would pick a Northeasterner like Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania to put his party nearer the political center.
Now it will be up to Bush himself to pull in the moderate voters he
will need to carry swing states outside his Southern and Western
base.
</P>
<P>
   That positioning exercise may not be easy, especially with Gore
sniping away. A New York Times/CBS poll on Tuesdayy suggested that
the public, which in February divided equally between
``conservative'' and ``moderate'' when asked to describe Bush's
ideology, now increasingly regards the Texas governor as a
conservative. Cheney's selection is sure to reinforce that
impression. In the days ahead, Cheney will be marketed as someone
who brings sound judgment and safe hands to the executive branch.
That is a reasonable depiction. By virtue of experience and
temperament, he does represent a responsible choice. But the voters
will also be asked to factor ideology into their selection this
fall. And Gore, waving a long list of House votes, will not allow
Bush's picture of Dick Cheney to go unchallenged.

EDITORIAL: DRIVING UP DRUG PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 26:
</P>
<P>
   Two recent antitrust actions by the Federal Trade Commission and
a related federal court decision have exposed the way some
pharmaceutical companies conspire to keep low-price drugs out of
reach of consumers. Manufacturers of patented drugs are paying tens
of millions of dollars to manufacturers of generic drugs if they
agree to keep products off the market. The drug companies split the
profits from maintaining a monopoly at the consumer's expense. The
commission is taking aggressive action to curb the practice. It
needs help from Congress to close loopholes in federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied with the supply of generic drugs, Congress passed
the Hatch-Waxman act in 1984 to encourage manufacturers to
challenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs. The act
grants temporary protection from competition to the first
manufacturer that receives permission from federal authorities to
sell a generic drug before the patent on a brand-name drug expires.
For 180 days, the federal government promises to approve no other
generic drug.
</P>
<P>
   But as reported Sunday by Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jeff Gerth of
The Times, drug companies are undermining Congress' intent. Hoechst
Marion Roussel, the maker of drugs to treat hypertension and
angina, agreed in 1997 to pay Andrx Pharmaceuticals to delay
bringing its generic alternative to market. The commission brought
charges against the companies last March and a federal judge
declared last month in a private lawsuit that the agreement
violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a second case, Abbott Laboratories paid Geneva
Pharmaceuticals to delay selling a generic alternative to an Abbott
drug that treats hypertension and enlarged prostates. Geneva's drug
could have cost Abbott over $30 million a month in sales. In both
cases, the manufacturer of the generic drug used its claim to the
180-day grace period to block other generic drugs from entering the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies deny that their agreements violate the
antitrust laws, presenting them as private preliminary settlements
between companies engaged in patent disputes. That is untenable.
The agreements are overly broad, temporarily stopping all sales of
generic drugs. Typically in settlement of a patent dispute, the
company infringing on the patent would pay the patent holder. In
these cases it is reversed, stunting competition. The agreements
are also private, going into effect before a court reviews the
public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Not all private settlements are anti-consumer. That is why the
commission has taken a careful case-by-case approach. It could use
a little help from Congress. The 180-day grace period was designed
to encourage generics to enter the market. Since it is being
manipulated to impede competition, the grace period needs to be
fixed so that the production of generic drugs cannot be blocked by
a single company that decides not to compete.

METS SHUT OUT EXPOS, 5-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ General Manager Steve Phillips sat comfortably in the
first-base dugout at Shea Stadium, answering questions about his
wishes and his hopes for making the New York Mets better. Phillips
never mentioned Curt Schilling's name, but he talked about a
specific starting pitcher who would immediately improve the Mets,
and it was obvious that he was referring to Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch is not Curt Schilling. When you mention Schilling
to Rusch, the 25-year-old Mets left-hander gets an innocent look
because he knows Schilling is in another echelon. Still, four hours
after Phillips discussed a superb pitcher without mentioning his
name, Rusch was the only pitcher worth mentioning in the clubhouse
on Tuesday night because he had just guided the Mets to a 5-0
victory over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch's results were as impressive as those Schilling or any
other pitcher could have provided; on a night in which Rusch felt
listless, he still stopped Montreal on three hits over seven
innings. While Rusch did not have a crisp repertory and walked four
batters, as many as he had walked in his preceding six starts, he
pushed and plodded on this windy night until he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a determined young man who wants to make his mark,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He works harder between starts to
get better. He's been a godsend for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to overlook how dependable Rusch has been at the back
end of the Mets' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, he came into the season with a 12-25 career record and
was not even guaranteed to be in the majors. Rusch is quiet and he
does not throw hard, but he has worked at least six innings in 15
of his 18 starts, he has allowed three earned runs or less 13 times
and he is a deceiving 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone would have predicted Glendon to be the
kind of pitcher he has been for us,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Rusch. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had confidence going into spring training,'' Rusch said. ``I
thought I could help the team. It's tough to predict what you can
do in a season. But I thought I could help the team every time out
there.''

 COMPANY HALTS CALAVERAS CLEAR-CUTTING PROJECT  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing increasing opposition to its plans to clear-cut
timberland in the Sierra Nevada, Sierra Pacific Industries has put
a moratorium on logging in Calaveras County and plans to reassess
its harvesting strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day moratorium covers about 900 acres of proposed
clear-cuts near the small mountain town of Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   When Sierra Pacific began logging near Arnold earlier this year,
it galvanized fierce opposition from local residents and focused a
spotlight on the company's long-term plans for its land in the
Sierra Nevada.

<P>
   Sierra Pacific owns 1.5 million acres of land in California _ 1
percent of the state's surface area. Its basic logging plan calls
for clear-cutting and replanting about 1 million acres of its
holdings during the next 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   The company maintains that its plans will actually improve
forest cover. Many areas that have already been selectively logged
one or more times will be converted into well-stocked stands of
young conifers, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the huge clear-cutting project will
destroy the biological integrity of the Sierra Nevada, turning vast
regions of rich, mature forest into tree plantations and driving
several endangered species of wildlife into extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the company's policies has swelled steadily in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Protests have been going on not only in Arnold, but also in the
watershed of the Middle Fork of the Yuba River on the border of
Sierra and Nevada counties. There, Sierra Pacific is logging 1,300
acres by a variety of methods, including clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   The two areas of protest represent different constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yuba watershed, the protesters _ who call themselves Yuba
Nation _ are similar to those who fought the Headwaters Forest
battle on California's North Coast: generally young, often
affiliated with uncompromising groups such as Earth First, and
disposed to guerrilla disruption tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a group of Yuba Nation protesters briefly occupied
Sierra Pacific's Grass Valley office complex.
</P>
<P>
   But in Arnold, real estate agents, small-business owners and
retirees are leading the fight against Sierra Pacific. They are
representatives of the ``New Sierra'' _ well-educated immigrants
from metropolitan areas, including the Bay Area and Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the two groups of protesters, Dan Tomascheski,
Sierra Pacific's vice president of resources, said the moratorium
decision was made after determining ``who had legitimate concerns
and who came from the environmental fringe and wouldn't be happy
unless we gave them the entire forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomascheski said Sierra Pacific will re-evaluate all the areas
the company was planning to log in the next three years. ``We'll
look at modifications that might be appropriate,'' he said, noting
that clear-cutting may be reduced in favor of selective cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have other harvest plans'' that have not yet been
approved by the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection, which oversees logging on state and private forest
lands, Tomascheski said. ``We'll be looking at those as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Alford, a conservation organizer for the Sierra Club who
has helped lead the opposition against Sierra Pacific in the Arnold
area, said the moratorium is extremely significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tiny mountain community unified against a giant timber
baron, and the giant blinked,'' Alford said. ``The reason this
means so much is that they have always thumbed their noses at their
critics. This represents a tremendous departure from their standard
way of doing things.''

VAUGHN GETS A BREAK _ NOT THAT HE WANTED IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For the Anaheim Angels' first 100 games, Mo
Vaughn's name could be found in the starting lineup without fail.
For game No. 101 on Tuesday night at the Ballpark in Arlington,
however, Vaughn's name was not in the starting lineup. Not at first
base, not as the DH.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong. Manager Mike Scioscia just decided it
was a good time to give Vaughn a break. Asked what Vaughn's
reaction was when told he wouldn't be in starting, Scioscia said:
``He looked at me like I had four heads.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands the grind of the whole season,'' Scioscia said.
``He's been on a mission to play every day. He is an everyday
player, but to me, an everyday player doesn't mean playing in all
162 games. Mo needed a day to catch his breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he understood. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking care of all of us,'' said Vaughn, who began the
day hitting .298 with 25 homers and a team-leading 77 RBI. ``Nobody
on the ballclub will ask for it (a day off). Do I like it? No. I
want to play every day I can possibly play. I know it's best for
the team over the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's starting pitcher for the Rangers was Darren Oliver,
the same pitcher who hit Vaughn in the head with a pitch last week
in Anaheim. But Scioscia said: ``It's a day off, plain and simple.
It was my call, he did not ask for it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More records for Erstad: Darin Erstad is having a
record-breaking season, and he added another in Monday's wild game.
Erstad had 12 outfield putouts, tying the major-league mark
accomplished 12 times previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I celebrated by sleeping,'' Erstad said. ``I noticed by the
sixth or seventh inning I was getting a lot of fly balls. But when
I'm 50, I'm not going to look back on it and have a smile on my
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad remains on a pace to establish the all-time record for
hits in a single season. Going into Tuesday's game, he had 163 hits
in the team's first 100 games, a pace for 264. The major-league
record is 257, held by George Sisler of the St. Louis Browns _ set
in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   In order to break the record, Erstad needs to average 1.54 hits
per game in the final 62 games. Through the first 100, he averaged
1.63.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis was activated from
the DL after Tuesday's game and will start tonight. . . . Pitcher
Kent Mercker threw two innings of a simulated game Monday and says
he's ready to pitch in the majors. But Scioscia said he's ``very
close'' to a rehab assignment, but there's a chance he'll need
another simulated game. . . . Shortstop Benji Gil is expected to
rejoin the team today in Texas. He returned to Orange County on
Monday for the birth of his first child, a boy, Mateo Elijah Gil,
born Monday night.

YANKEES CRUSH ORIOLES, 19-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Los Angeles Dodgers needed a shortstop this year
and they had Jose Vizcaino, but they wanted to give the job to Alex
Cora instead. When Cora floundered in spring training, the Dodgers
hired Kevin Elster, the twice-retired infielder and actor. And when
the Dodgers needed a second baseman, they didn't use Vizcaino; they
moved shortstop Mark Grudzielanek to the position.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Dodgers packaged Vizcaino and $500,000 in cash
to convince the New York Yankees to take him, in return for Jim
Leyritz. It's safe to say the Dodgers were sure Vizcaino couldn't
help them.
</P>
<P>
   But Vizcaino is helping the Yankees, substantively, wearing
protective goggles that no image-conscious high school student
would be caught wearing in gym class. Making his 13th start at
second base for the Yankees, Vizcaino slapped four hits and scored
four runs as the Yankees scorched the Orioles, 19-1, at Camden
Yards, their third consecutive triumph and 15th in 21 games. The
Yankees (53-42) are in first place by three games.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander Andy Pettitte became the team's first 10-game
winner, shutting out the Orioles for seven innings. Pettitte worked
almost without incident until the sixth, Baltimore loaded the
bases, but then Pettitte struck out Charles Johnson and retired
Will Clark on a grounder to first baseman Tino Martinez, who made a
diving stop and threw to Pettitte to close the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were in control by then, their lead in
double-digits. Bernie Williams crushed a grand slam and drove in
five runs, leaving him with 94 runs batted in, only 36 short of the
single-season record for switch-hitters, shared by Mickey Mantle
and Ken Caminiti. Derek Jeter had two hits, including a two-run
homer, and Paul O'Neill, Ryan Thompson and Clay Bellinger also hit
homers. The Yankees had 20 hits, a season high.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offense has surged since the All-Star Game break,
compiling 90 runs in 13 games, an average of almost 7 a game _ more
than a run over their average in the first half of the season.
David Justice has added stability to the middle of the order;
Jeter, Williams and O'Neill have recently produced hitting streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, batting barely over .200 when the Dodgers dumped him,
is hitting .348 for the Yankees, his average increasing 37 points
with his four hits tonight _ although none of the singles would
inspire awe from the likes of Ted Williams. Vizcaino beat out an
infield single to lead off the game, rolled a hit through the
middle in the third, hustled to first and beat out a grounder to
short in the fourth and slapped a single through the left side of
the infield in the sixth. In other words, the distance of his hits
combined wouldn't match one modest Mark McGwire home run.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees are more than satisfied with Vizcaino, who is
taking on a greater role than expected. They got him on June 21,
about a week after Chuck Knoblauch's three-error game against the
Chicago White Sox, and at the time, it seemed that he might play
late in games, taking over for Knoblauch when the Yankees were
trying to protect a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino doesn't have any errors in his 25 games, and the
confidence with which he catches and throws the balls is markedly
different from the way in which Knoblauch fields his position. More
and more, Torre has started Vizcaino at second base and used
Knoblauch as his designated hitter. If the Yankees cannot acquire a
front-line left fielder before the July 31 trade deadline, that
trend will continue, with David Justice playing left instead of
serving regularly as the D.H. Torre remarked before tonight's game
how solid Vizcaino had been, how steady.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino started in place of Knoblauch tonight, after Knoblauch
felt soreness in his right elbow, and scored in the first inning,
on O'Neill's single. With the Yankees holding a 1-0 edge after two
innings, it appeared that Pettitte and Baltimore's Scott Erickson
(5-8) were settling in for a duel of sinkerball pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees added three runs in the third inning and four
more in the fourth, O'Neill drilling a three-run homer that
increased the Yankees' advantage to 8-0. Jeter slammed his homer in
the sixth _ his 10th of the year _ before the Orioles collapsed in
the seventh. The Yankees loaded the bases against Chuck McElroy,
and after two runs scored, Williams lined a grand slam into the
left-field stands, the ninth grand slam of Williams's career.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' only run came on a homer in the eighth by B.J.
Surhoff, whom the Yankees are seeking to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Torre cleared his bench for the last innings, using Wilson
Delgado at shortstop and Bellinger in left, and calling on Darrell
Einertson to throw the eighth inning and Randy Choate to pitch the
ninth.

THE SPORTING MUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's news-and-views edition of The Sporting Muse, dedicated
to all smack-talking, hamstring-grabbing sprinters:
</P>
<P>
   News: The U.S. Olympic track and field trials come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Huh? You mean I missed them?
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a statement on the status of track in America that
the trials could come and go with nary a buzz. Aside from a story
here or there about Marion Jones and the fastest tongues in the
West (all our male sprinters), the event barely registered.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a past generation, the trials was the kind of Big
Event that would dominate the attention of sports fans and the
media. Fans wanted to know about all of our great sprinters and
would speculate over how many gold medals America would win. We'd
all wince whenever the trials process, perhaps the most grueling,
desperate competition in all sports, would claim a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Now? Track is deader than T. Rex. Quick now, name our gold medal
candidates in the 110-meter hurdles and high jump. Bzzz, time's up.
They happen to be Allan Johnson and Charles Austin, who also happen
to be the defending Olympic champs. Alas, the number of Americans
who know either, outside their immediate f would fit in a four-unit
apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? Everybody. American track started to stagger in
the '80s because of mismanagement, but no one really noticed
because the '84 Games in L.A. were such a rush and the Ruskies and
their friends stayed home. We're just now noticing because there
are no stars out there to replace Carl Lewis and Jackie
Joyner-Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee played its role by
overplaying its hand and putting the Games on an every-two-year
schedule. Summer is different than winter, yes, but it's still
diluted the special quality of ``the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the sports landscape has also played a role. Every
time a nouveau sport like soccer and women's pro basketball is
shoved at editors, programmers and fans, it comes at the expense of
other sports on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   TV has done what it does best, which is aggravate viewers. NBC
goes from plausibly despicable coverage in 1996 to an all-delayed
TV schedule in 2000. And how are we supposed to become interested
in the top American athletes when the network devotes so little
coverage to the trials? Based on NBC's coverage the last week, we
have three track athletes, Jones, Michael Johnson and Maurice
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The final shovel of dirt figures to come during the Games
themselves. NBC is geeked for big Nielsens, but the Sydney Games
will be contested in mid-September, when there is head-to-head
competition from baseball's pennant races and football. Plus, the
no-live TV policy figures to backfire. Fans who do care about
Olympic sport will get their information from the Internet, where
there are no deadlines, press runs or prime-time TV hours.
</P>
<P>
   Long before NBC gets around to playing their Olympic theme each
night, the real fan will know who won and what happened, and have
made a decision on whether they'll tune in, leaving NBC relying on
sports looky-loos with five hours to kill each night.
</P>
<P>
   My heart won't bleed for NBC, but it does for track, a great
sport that can't get a witness.
</P>
<P>
   News: Johnson, Greene blow tires in the 200-meter final.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Their fate is the best example of how fraught the trials
process is. Neither was particularly well-served by the pressure of
their ``rivalry,'' which was manufactured. Johnson's 19.38
200-meter world record notwithstanding, he is essentially a great
quarter-miler who can also run the 200. Greene is a great 100-meter
man who can sustain his speed over 200. Rather than spotlight each
for their strength, they got caught in a made-for-TV ``rivalry''
that was nonsensical.
</P>
<P>
   They both got what they deserved for so freely participating,
though I can't blame Johnson for letting it happen. U.S. track put
a lot of pressure on him to help them revive interest in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   News: U.S. track bullish on medal chances in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Tie me kangaroo down, sport, those projections are mad.
The best sprinter in the world isn't Greene, it's Ato Boldon from
Trinidad. Michael Johnson is odds-on to win the 400, but America
may not medal in any distance longer than 400 meters, male or
female. Regina Jacobs (women's 1,500 and/or 5,000) has the best
chance.
</P>
<P>
   America has produced the long jump gold medalist every Olympics
save three (1924, 1964, and the boycotted 1980 Games), but could
get shut out of medals entirely in Sydney. Our best field eventers
are Austin, Jones (even though her long jump technique is abysmal)
and Stacy Dragila, the world record holder in the relatively new
women's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   News: NBA Players Association coming to terms with players
facing paying back 10 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   Views: That's the result of the players capitulating to David
``union buster'' Stern on salary cap terms two seasons ago. Fearful
of the finality of a hard cap, instead agreed to an escrow tax and
rookie salary minimum.
</P>
<P>
   NBA bean-counters then rolled out numbers showing that 62
percent of all 1999-2000 revenue went to salaries, higher than the
agreed upon 55 percent maximum. Thus, the owners get rebates. That
sound you hear is Donald Sterling and his accountant having a good
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bleed too much for the players. They still had enough
change in their pocket to hold their annual meetings in the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   News: Tiger Woods wins fourth major and completes Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Views: The ultimate record for Woods is Jack Nicklaus' mark of
18 major titles. Woods now has four at the age of 24. If he wins
just one a year from here on, he'll top Jack in 2015 at the age of
39.
</P>
<P>
   The real record to watch may be Nicklaus' 70 PGA titles. Woods
has won 21, including six already in 2000. If he averages eight a
year, he could break Nicklaus' mark before he's 30.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could keep Woods from owning all the records
is his motivation. If he has everything he could want by the time
he's 30, what's the motivation to keep playing? By then, he'll
probably own Nike and a few other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll run for president, assuming he has the patience to
wait until he's 35.

FUTURIST I ZONE SALON GOES BEYOND HAIRCUTS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Sebastian International, a prominent beauty care
products manufacturer, has taken its futurist philosophy a step
further by opening what it calls the ``salon of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000-square-foot i Zone -- the ``i'' stands for
individuality -- is designed on Feng Shui principles to create a
positive energy flow. Curved translucent walls allow soft light to
filter through. Three large waterfalls and musical sound zones
contribute to the effect.
</P>
<P>
   Salable art objects are scattered throughout the i Zone, and
purchases include informational time with the artist who created
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to give the customer more than just a hair
service,'' said Anthony Guthmiller, director of advanced learning
and i Zone creator. ``The physical service is secondary to who you
are as an individual. We want to go further into you -- not just
stay on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Any consumer business in today's climate needs to incorporate a
special experience for the customer, Guthmiller said. The i Zone is
reaching for the next level beyond experience, which is
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   At the i Zone salon in Woodland Hills, customers are offered a
variety of services that go beyond the traditional ``beauty shop.''
They can get a 10-minute scalp massage as they decompress in the
shampoo area. They can also get a facial, a manicure, a makeover,
aromatherapy or a full-body massage, shop for cosmetics, buy a
cappuccino, access wellness information or surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A retail area called the Trucca Buffet features the Sebastian
cosmetics line. Shoppers take a special tray and slide it on a long
counter while making their choices -- much like in a food buffet.
Hair care products and logo items are also available.
</P>
<P>
   The i Zone doesn't want to be categorized as a day spa. It is
more fluid, Guthmiller said. Services are offered a la carte. The
objective is to provide a flexible environment where a customer can
spend pleasant hours, or just escape for a lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   Guthmiller said it is designed for individuals who have a
creative mindset -- who are forward-thinking and like to explore --
regardless of age or income group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will draw heavily from the (San Fernando) Valley, because
the Valley doesn't have as much culture and art as the people who
live here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The i Zone is not only for the front-line consumer: It's a model
to inspire other salons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is that salons will be influenced, to the extent that
we want them to copy everything they see here and stretch
themselves into a new area of consumerism that transcends a salon
-- to broaden who they are or who they perceive themselves to be,''
Guthmiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the i Zone area doubles as an advanced learning academy
for salon professionals. Classes are offered in traditional
subjects such as haircutting. But even with that, Sebastian
attempts to surpass the expected. Its classes can help salons spot
trends; relate art, language, fashion and design to create ``a
look;'' understand makeup for all nationalities; and push the
fashion envelope with classes in extreme makeup styling, including
techniques such as the use of face wax and cosmetic jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The official grand opening of i Zone is set for Aug. 7, but
proceeds from all services sold during July go directly to the
Planet of Hope, a charitable organization that helps homeless
children and families.

   The i Zone is not only for the front-line consumer: It's a model
to inspire other salons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is that salons will be influenced, to the extent that
we want them to copy everything they see here and stretch
themselves into a new area of consumerism that transcends a salon
-- to broaden who they are or who they perceive themselves to be,''
Guthmiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the i Zone area doubles as an advanced learning academy
for salon professionals. Classes are offered in traditional
subjects such as haircutting. But even with that, Sebastian
attempts to surpass the expected. Its classes can help salons spot
trends; relate art, language, fashion and design to create ``a
look;'' understand makeup for all nationalities; and push the
fashion envelope with classes in extreme makeup styling, including
techniques such as the use of face wax and cosmetic jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The official grand opening of i Zone is set for Aug. 7, but
proceeds from all services sold during July go directly to the
Planet of Hope, a charitable organization that helps homeless
children and families.

AT&AMP;T TOPS IN J.D. POWER SERVICE STUDY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the long-distance telephone service market,
customer satisfaction has declined overall, but among high-volume
residential users, AT&AMP;T leads the pack in giving customers what
they want, according to a just-released study by J.D. Power and
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Agoura Hills-based research firm, which
surveyed 12,000 households across the nation during April, ranked
Sprint second for customer satisfaction among those who spend $50
per month or more on long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Excel, MCI WorldCom and Qwest finished below the industry
average in the high-volume customer satisfaction category.
</P>
<P>
   The study reported below-industry averages in alphabetical order
rather than by ranking.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T did not fare as well among customers who spend less than
$50 per month. In that category, Southern New England Telephone, or
SNET, placed first for the fourth year in a row. ALLTEL,
CenturyTel, Frontier, GTE, Quest and Sprint followed.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing below the industry average in the lower-volume
category were: AT&AMP;T, Citizens, Excel, MCI WorldCom and Tel-Save,
also in alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, customers who had problems with their
long-distance service rose steadily -- from 51 percent in 1996 to
59 percent in 2000, said Kirk Parsons, director of
telecommunications at J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Timely resolutions dropped from a high of 92 percent in 1996 to
79 percent in 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Billing issues create the largest number of calls, followed by
calls from people shopping for the best rate plan, Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey said cost was secondary to good customer service in
determining customer satisfaction.

POLICE SAY SHOOTING WAS IN SELF-DEFENSE &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what investigators said Tuesday was a case of
self-defense, an off-duty LAPD sergeant fatally shot a neighbor
when police said the man tried to run him down after crashing into
at least 10 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 13-year department veteran Sgt. Steve Ulrich killed
27-year-old Chris Oliver, a movie and television crewman, late
Monday when the officer went to investigate the sound of crashing
cars outside his home in the 23300 block of Friar Street in
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's family and friends said he would never try to hurt a
police officer, and called it a case of a cop who shot too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his fingers are faster than his mind,'' said
20-year-old Jennifer Jacobson, a former girlfriend of Oliver's.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich was at home just before 11 p.m. Monday when he heard a
vehicle collision outside, police said. He saw a white pickup truck
stopped at the intersection of Friar and Jackie Avenue, and
approached the car, asking the driver to get out, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Oliver accelerated the car in an attempt to run the
officer down, police said. Ulrich fired at least four rounds from
his 9 mm handgun, fatally wounding Oliver, who was pronounced dead
at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place in front of Oliver's home, and down the
block from Ulrich's home.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver reportedly drove his white pickup truck into as many as
10 cars on Victory Boulevard, Berquist Avenue and Friar before the
confrontation with Ulrich.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Jason Lee said they do not know why Oliver ran into the
vehicles, but tests will be run to determine whether he had been
using alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ulrich has been in Los Angeles Police Department's
ombudsman office for one year, but did not say how long it had been
since he worked as a street cop.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich was off duty Tuesday, but could return to work as early
as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on preliminary indicators, there is no reason to believe
the officer acted irresponsibly,'' said Lt. Horace Frank. ``The
investigation is ongoing, the nuts and bolts take time, and we're
still interviewing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's friend and neighbor, Mike Trentini, said he was at home
when he heard the sound of a crash outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might've been a hit-and-run because I could hear
the squeal of metal as the car tried to drive away,'' Trentini
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trentini said he tried to catch the car and get a license plate
number by following the sound on his bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see Chris or anything but I saw the truck with its
door open,'' he said. ``Then I heard someone yelling, `Get on the
ground right now,' and it wasn't more than two seconds later that I
heard the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Trentini and Jacobson said they believe Oliver knew he was in
trouble for hitting the cars, but would've taken responsibility for
his actions. Both insist he was not violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Chris and I can't see him trying to hurt someone
deliberately,'' Jacobson said. ``He was probably scared and was
trying to get back to his house.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver worked as a grip for television and film productions, and
had recently gotten a new job, Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was happy. It was a fairly long-term job and that made him
feel secure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a family man, his son meant everything to him and he
wouldn't have done anything to jeopardize that. They didn't have to
shoot him, It could've been handled differently.''

SAN FRANCISCO'S SHARE OF AIDS MONEY TO BE SLASHED IN NEW FEDERAL 
 PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ The House is poised Wednesday to slash San
Francisco's share of funds under a big federal AIDS program that
sent $35.2 million to the city this year.
<P>
   The city could lose up to 25 percent of its AIDS prevention and
care funding in five years under the Ryan White Care Act, which the
House of Representatives is expected to renew Wednesday by a near
unanimous vote. The bill contains a change in the funding formula
that determines where AIDS money goes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who sponsored the bill,
argued that if San Francisco is no longer the epicenter of the AIDS
epidemic, then the city should no longer be the epicenter of AIDS
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make sure the money goes where the epidemic
is, and today it's not,'' Coburn said. ``Today it's going where the
epidemic was.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, a physician who has treated AIDS patients, said San
Francisco receives twice as much federal money per individual AIDS
case as other cities where the rate of HIV infection is rising
faster, particularly among minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   Data released by the House Commerce Committee show that under
the current formula, San Francisco receives $4,938 in Ryan White
funding per AIDS case, while Oakland receives $2,430.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would gradually change the funding formula to target
HIV infections rather than full-blown AIDS cases in an attempt to
shift funds to areas where the disease is rising. The provision
most directly affecting San Francisco would allow funding levels
for any city to drop by up to 25 percent if the number of AIDS
cases declines sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The bill enjoys broad support from Democrats, including Los
Angeles Rep. Henry Waxman, a chief co-sponsor who helped write it,
and many African American and Latino members whose districts
receive about half of the money per individual AIDS case as San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justify why somebody in San Francisco who is HIV positive has
$5,000 spent on them and somebody in Wyoming has $100 spent on
them,'' Coburn said. ``You can't justify that. And you can't
justify the fact that on average everybody else in the country has
$2,500 spent on them, and somebody with HIV in San Francisco has
$5,000 spent on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, plans to vote for the
overall bill, which extends the Ryan White Care Act, but strongly
objected to the changes in the funding formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said that when the House and Senate bills are melded
together, she will push for the Senate version, which calls for a
more modest formula change that would narrow San Francisco's
potential loss to 10 percent over five years and does not shift to
HIV tracking.
</P>
<P>
   But a big fight is sure to ensue when the two versions are
hammered together, pitting cities that stand to lose under a
formula change against those that would gain.
</P>
<P>
   If the House version prevails, Pelosi said she will lobby for
much higher increases on overall AIDS funding to keep San Francisco
from losing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our needs are not reduced,'' Pelosi said. ``I don't want
anybody to have any illusion that we can absorb any cut in our
funding on care.'' If the new formula threatens such cuts, she
said, ``We'll have to continue to increase that pot dramatically to
compensate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sentiment that there are so many more communities
that need to provide care, and we want them to have it,'' Pelosi
added. ``We just don't think it's fair for them to take money from
one place to give it to another, but instead to increase the size
of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending on the Ryan White program has more than doubled already
_ to $1.6 billion _ over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn insisted that those trends will continue as the number of
nationwide HIV infections continues to swell, so that San Francisco
will at least stay even with its current federal funding even if
its share of overall funding declines.
</P>
<P>
   If spending continues to soar, he said, San Francisco could even
wind up with more money even as it gets a smaller share of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Dillon, public policy director for the San Francisco Aids
Foundation, a nonprofit group that provides services to AIDS
patients and receives Ryan White money, said such huge increases
are unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the portion of Ryan White funds that San Francisco
receives would have to double over the next five years for San
Francisco to stay even, Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be protected from those cuts unless there's an
enormous increase that is virtually unforeseeable in the next five
years,'' Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's AIDS care and prevention funding has fallen since a
previous formula change four years ago, Dillon said, even as other
cities have seen double-digit increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't disagree that as much as possible, the formula should
direct money to new pockets of the epidemic,'' Dillon said. ``But
we firmly believe that any cuts in any area need to be made in a
reasonable manner, so that the existing system of care is not
destabilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn praised San Francisco's AIDS services, saying he is not
trying to degrade them but to improve services elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been working on the issue for the past two years
because as a doctor, he has ``had patients die and babies die, and
I'm interested in making sure the dollars go where the disease is.
And I've seen where an African American woman can't have available
to her the same things that somebody that lives in a large city
does, and that should not be the case.''

MARCHERS REV UP FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several hundred D2KLA protesters marched in
downtown Pershing Square on Tuesday to assert their rights to
demonstrate during the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters marched, danced and sang to celebrate a recent
court ruling that allows them to rally at Pershing Square and march
to Staples Center during the convention, which will run Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would now like to officially declare the retaking of
Pershing Square and our First Amendment rights,'' D2KLA spokeswoman
Margaret Prescod said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said they are concerned about the massive police
presence expected at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Don White, D2KLA coordinator of logistics, permits and legal
affairs, said protesters plan to use their own ``very, very large
and well-trained security team'' to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, 100 security people would be necessary at a
minimum,'' White said. ``We don't accept the concept that our
marches are under the control of the police. However, we will have
a well-trained security team who will monitor, usher and facilitate
our marches.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Lt. Horace Frank said if security team
members carry weapons or protesters march without a permit, police
will take the appropriate action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event they refuse to follow lawful orders, we would
make arrests,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zinzun, spokesman for the Coalition Against Police
Abuse, said protesters plan to use legal observers and cameras to
monitor the police during the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe in the right to self-defense,'' Zinzun said.
``I'm not going to stand there and allow you to knock me upside the
head without defending myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters accused the Democratic Party of allowing major
pollution by corporations in areas with heavy minority populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this legalized killing of our children is happening, the
decision-makers in this country just stand by and do nothing,
collecting blood money for their campaigns,'' said Fidel Rodriguez,
community organizer for Communities for a Better Environment.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, a Los Angeles judge on Tuesday
extended the cooling-off period for Metropolitan Transportation
Authority bus and rail workers to Sept. 4, preventing them from
striking during the convention, MTA spokesman Marc Littman said.
</P>
<P>
   Littman said the MTA plans to reroute 17 Metro bus lines that
serve downtown near the Staples Center beginning Saturday because
of the convention.

 HEARD THE ONE ABOUT THE SHOES?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I bought a pair of shoes. I always buy shoes
that way.
</P>
<P>
   I bought them at one of those factory outlet mystery malls.
Name-brand stuff is cheap there because the items have slight
factory defects, but you can never find the flaw, thus the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   You never see T-shirts there with two necks, or sunglasses with
the mirror lenses installed backwards.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes look fine. They're name brand. The heels are nailed to
the proper ends of the shoe bottoms, the shoelace holes are fully
punched, everything seems to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wore them to work. They squeak. Major squeakage, like a
squirrel being interrogated at a POW camp.
</P>
<P>
   New shoes sometimes squeak. But after several wearings, the
squeaking seems to be getting louder. Walking down a hallway, I
sound like two naked people wrestling on a Naugahyde couch.
</P>
<P>
   In the elevator, any slight shift of my weight causes eerie
sounds, like I'm prying open an ancient Pharoh's tomb. Or worse.
Fellow riders must fear that the elevator cables are about to snap
and send us plummeting into the Chronicle basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, it's just my shoes,'' I want to say, but I don't
like to talk in elevators.
</P>
<P>
   The squeaks aren't quick, but rather drawn out, not unlike the
sounds the Blob makes in the old Steve McQueen movie, ``The Blob.''
That evil gooey mass creaks as it grows and oozes, devouring
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes with squeaky shoes it's possible to walk around the
squeak, to limit the noise by slightly altering your gait, or
twisting your feet here and there. Not these shoes. Born to squeak.
</P>
<P>
   However, in experimenting I find that they don't squeak if I
walk on my tippytoes. As an added benefit, if I walk around that
way a lot, I might develop buns of steel, or at least of pig iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you might also throw out your back,'' a co-worker points
out.
</P>
<P>
   Curious expression, ``Throw out your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminds me of the old song, ``I Gave My Heart to the Junkman,''
which was prophetic, because that is probably what you actually do
with your old heart after you undergo a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   That's the shoe story. I'm glad I didn't buy a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   THE LONGER I don't have a cell phone, the more often I need a
pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   I am resisting the cell phone thing. This is not a personal
statement or philosophical stand. I just don't want to be hooked up
everywhere I go, like I'm on life support.
</P>
<P>
   The cell thing does get silly. People who climb Mt. Everest
carry cell phones. How romantic! You reach the top _ or ``summit,''
as the climbers call it _ and you get a call from Blockbuster
reminding you that ``Smokey and the Bandit'' is two weeks overdue.
</P>
<P>
   One man who died while climbing Everest was able to phone his
wife back home and say goodbye just before he froze to death. Fine,
I guess, but what if he'd gotten the baby-sitter?
</P>
<P>
   I don't want a cell phone, but it would be nice if the phone
people would leave a few pay telephones around for us phonosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of pay phones are being removed because supposedly they
are too often used by criminals, like prostitutes and drug sellers.
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy that. What self-respecting whore, pimp or crack
dealer doesn't have his or her own cell phone these days?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, driving around desperately searching for a pay phone,
I'm tempted to find a hooker and offer her five bucks to make a
call on her cell phone. Certainly there are more hookers in San
Francisco than there are pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   The few pay phones that remain generally are no day at the
beach. They tend to be sticky, stinky and on-the-blinky.
</P>
<P>
   And pay-phone companies, probably to cut costs, have shortened
the receiver cords so that you have to hunch way over as you're
calling, making you look suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, we can put a man on the moon but we can't invent a
pay-phone-directory holder that is even remotely functional. You
have to bend over so far to read the book that now the cord is too
short the other way. And half the listings are lost in the metal
binding apparatus, which could hold up a circus tent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a small price to pay for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   TWENTY FAMOUS songwriters picked the 10 greatest songs ever
written. The top three were ``In My Life'' (Beatles),
``Satisfaction'' (Rolling Stones) and ``Over the Rainbow'' (Judy
Garland).
</P>
<P>
   Stop right now and make your own list. Carry it in your wallet
with a note stipulating that these songs be played at your wake.
</P>
<P>
   Off the top of my head (where else?), I'm going with these
(artist, if I know it): ``Six Days on the Road,'' ``Take Five''
(Dave Brubeck), ``Guitar Town'' (Steve Earl), ``Love TKO'' (Teddy
Pendergrass), ``She Was Hot'' (Stones), ``Pancho &AMP; Lefty'' (Emmylou
Harris), ``Kansas City'' (Wilbur Harrison), ``Texas Flood'' (Stevie
Ray Vaughan), ``This Could Be The Start of Something Big'' (Steve
Allen), ``Don't Be Cruel'' (Elvis).
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, why should I dictate what people listen to at
my wake? Or select the snacks? I should be grateful to anyone who
bothers to show up, now I'm going to impose my music on them?
</P>
<P>
   It's not like my ashes are going to get up and dance. Play
whatever the hell you want.

AMGEN EXPECTED TO MEET ESTIMATES &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A quarterly earnings report to be released
Wednesday will likely show Amgen's steady ascent continuing,
analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of analysts estimates
the Thousand Oaks biotechnology leader will post second-quarter
earnings of 27 cents per share, exceeding the company's net income
of 25 cents per share in the second quarter of 1999. Individual
analysts are mixed on the company's potential to do better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough call in the short run, but I think they'll be on
target,'' said Edward Jones analyst Bob Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Harp of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown believes the company
will match or exceed his 26 cents-per-share earnings estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Harp said the company's strong second-quarter sales will be
tempered by its investments as it gears up for next year's
production of at least two new drugs in addition to mainstays
Epogen, an anemia medication, and cancer drug Neupogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real reason investors should be excited about Amgen is its
pipeline of drugs coming to market,'' said Harp.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock finished Tuesday down $1.13 to $73.63. It
peaked over the weekend at $80.44 before dipping to the $74 range
as investors sought to cash in on Amgen's highest share price since
splitting in November.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby thinks the company has benefited from a rediscovery of
biotech stocks by investors in recent weeks but added Amgen is a
victim of high expectations. Any failure to meet them could send
its share price tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have very little room to disappoint,'' Kirby said.

DISABLED SAY THEY ARE STILL IN FIGHT FOR RIGHTS 10 YEARS AFTER  ADA

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cross the curb cut, enter the wide automatic doors, slide down
the ramp, hit the Braille-coded elevator button, and you are in a
physical landscape altered by a landmark law signed by President
George Bush 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans with Disabilities Act _ a law so sweeping that it
was hailed at passage as an Emancipation Proclamation for the
disabled _ made a promise: that 43 million Americans would have a
civil right of access to employment, to public places and to the
mainstream of American society.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, a walk down most any street will attest to the
progress made. But get past a curb cut or two, and the transcendent
spirit of cooperation so widely hailed July 26, 1990, is dissolving
into an increasingly bitter fight between the disabled and the
business community.
</P>
<P>
   Disability rights groups say that despite much voluntary
progress, a routine, widespread and often blatant disregard for the
law is making a mockery of their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses say that much good has been achieved but that the ADA
is lining the pockets of lawyers and making a mockery of common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that whatever progress has been made on
removing architectural barriers in everyday life, the ADA has
failed in one of its highest goals: to increase the number of
disabled who work, still stuck at roughly one-third of the disabled
population.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the fight more visible than in California, which gave
birth to the disability rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   From actor Clint Eastwood's Inn at Carmel to the biggest names
in corporate America _ Macy's, Safeway, Chevron, Disneyland, United
Artists theaters _ businesses are being sued for not providing
access for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Governments and public agencies get sued too, from BART to the
city of Sacramento, from San Francisco's 3Com Park to the San
Mateo, Oakland and Mount Diablo school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Wolinsky, director of litigation for Disability Rights
Advocates, an Oakland nonprofit organization which has filed more
ADA lawsuits than the Justice Department, said the long list of
high-profile defendants is testament to a broad failure to comply
with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find people who use wheelchairs who could not get to work
or school because the BART elevators would not work,'' Wolinksy
said. ``There is no excuse, 10 years after the ADA, for a major
business establishment like Macy's, for example, continuing to have
architectural barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Royster, executive director of the Disability Rights
Council of Greater Washington (D.C.), agreed, noting that her group
is suing the Ames department store chain for lack of store access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enforcement has been appallingly lacking,'' Royster said.
``The rules are simple, they're easy to follow, and people aren't
following them.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses say the rules are anything but simple and easy, They
insist that they want to comply but that the law is oftentimes
vague.
</P>
<P>
   Does the ``readily achievable'' physical alteration the ADA
requires mean $100 worth of paint to mark off disabled parking or
$20,000 to put an elevator to a restaurant mezzanine that already
offers tables at ground level?
</P>
<P>
   Does ``disabled'' include employees with back pain or
depression? Those two complaint categories lead, by a wide margin,
the 125,946 ADA cases filed at the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission since the law was implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Bush signed this bill in the Rose Garden, the
people standing and sitting behind him and around him were not
people with back injuries and depression,'' said Pat Cleary, vice
president of human resource policy at the National Association of
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA, Cleary said, is ``a constant nuisance'' and a source of
``an awful lot of mischief'' for large employers.
</P>
<P>
   Disability rights groups say Congress clearly intended the ADA
to cover back injuries and depression along with cancer, learning
disabilities, allergies, manic-depressive disorder and other
``invisible disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the law's very preamble cites 43 million disabled _
roughly 1 in 5 Americans _ a number that far exceeds the mobility-,
sight- and hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Disability rights groups acknowledge the occasional frivolous
suit, but they point to surveys showing that employers win 92
percent of disability cases that go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of
disability rejecting claims in three decisions involving two truck
drivers, one blind in one eye and another with high blood pressure,
and myopic twin sisters applying for commercial airline pilot jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although attention gets paid to people who test the ADA's
boundaries _ like the 410-pound job applicant who sued the New York
subway to enlarge its conductor cabs, a case dismissed in court _
the courts have proved to be strict on ADA employment claims,
Wolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have a single employment case in this office,'' he
said, ``because they're so risky and difficult to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses argue that despite victories, defending the suits
costs a small fortune. ADA suits and their complicated interactions
with other employment laws, like workers compensation, have become
a big headache, many businesses say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving them crazy,'' said Michael Lotito, who as a
partner at the San Francisco firm Jackson Lewis advises corporate
clients in labor law. ``Since the correct answer under the ADA is
always, `it definitely depends,' that is going to be a wonderful
opportunity for individuals who want to take advantage of the
system to file claims.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, both sides agree that the ADA has failed to
lift employment among the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell University economist Richard Burkhauser said the data
show that employment of the disabled ``has not gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's gone down since 1993,'' he said. ``That is a
very disturbing trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The employment drop has coincided with the 1992 implementation
of the ADA, and some economists argue that the law contributed to
the decline by raising the cost of hiring a disabled worker.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhauser rejects that idea, saying that an expansion of Social
Security disability benefits and lack of health insurance could
explain the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disabled say they cannot find work, small
businesses, mostly exempt from the ADA's employment provisions,
complain about its rules requiring access. They accuse lawyers,
mainly in California and Florida, of ``drive-by lawsuits'' in which
attorneys go up and down strip malls charging stores with ADA
violations.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the law _ intended to help the disabled police
its compliance _ requires losing parties to pay all attorneys fees.
But, as a result, some lawyers now specialize in ADA suits.
Businesses have a strong motive to settle quickly rather than
contest the charges and rack up thousands of dollars in legal
costs, their own and those of the opposing side.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Batelaan and her husband David, who both use wheelchairs,
run a small store selling mobility equipment in Lake Worth, Fla. In
May, they testified to Congress that they were sued by a woman
saying their store lacked disabled parking.
</P>
<P>
   Batelaan said her store has to be accessible or she and her
husband could not run it. But she conceded that the parking spaces
outside her store were not marked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We striped the parking lot for less than $100, and paid the
woman's attorney $2,000,'' Batelaan said.``We should have complied
with the law. But is slapping a lawsuit on somebody the way to do
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla, introduced a bill in Congress _ strongly
opposed by disability groups _ that would require a 90-day
notification before an ADA suit can be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody tells me that there have been over 300 suits
filed on one street, that would tell me that someone is not
necessarily looking out for a plaintiff but is looking out for
themselves,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   John Dunlap, president of the California Restaurant Association,
said the number of lawsuits against his group's 14,000 members has
jumped in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants ``are committed to the spirit of the ADA, without
reservation,'' Dunlap said. ``What these lawsuits seem to be more
about is `gotcha,' rather than `hey, let's work together, let's
find a way so we can have access.'''
</P>
<P>
   But voluntary compliance is not always forthcoming and some
businesses need to be sued, said Kim Blackseth, an access
consultant in Novato who is quadriplegic. He has served as an
expert witness on more than 500 disability cases for both
plaintiffs and defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Blackseth concedes that some lawyers have been taking advantage
of ADA enforcement procedures ``and quite frankly are making a
small business out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of the litigation involves real disputes over what
constitutes compliance. Ironically, parts of the law written to
shield small businesses from onerous costs cause the most problems
_ like the mandate that barriers be removed if doing so is
``readily achievable.''
</P>
<P>
   And the few court decisions have not clarified the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that all these things settle, but it leaves a
very bitter taste in businesses' mouth, because they feel they've
been railroaded,'' Blackseth said. Likewise, people with
disabilities are left ``in a position where they're angry. All
they're asking for is modifications that, quite frankly, the law
gives them, and they're made out to be bad guys by trying to get
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff could foment a backlash ``that ultimately will
cause us trouble,'' he said. ``I think when the pendulum swings, it
swings violently.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Reich, head of the National Organization on Disability,
said earlier civil rights laws went through a similar legal
sifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take a lot of approaches _ like Ho Chi Minh
said, `Fight, fight, talk, talk,''' said Reich. ``Sure we're going
to pursue more than one avenue, and where necessary, of course we
are going to be initiating and encouraging lawsuits. At the same
time, when you look at the sweep of this legislation, the number of
people affected and the results, so much more is happening because
people are obeying the law than is not happening because they
aren't.''

LEWIS TO STAY WITH SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Several teams expressed interest in getting to know
Rashard Lewis better, even dangling lucrative contracts to grab his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one knew Lewis like the Sonics. And money was never
an issue, which is why the free-agent small forward ultimately
decided to stick with what he knows best.
</P>
<P>
   Citing his comfort level with the city, coaches and players,
Lewis made a verbal commitment Tuesday to return to the Sonics when
the signing period begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where I started, and I always knew Seattle was at the top
of the list,'' Lewis said in a telephone interview from his home in
Houston. ``The Sonics really showed me how much they need me, and
it made me feel good about staying. I'm glad (the free-agent
process) is over. Now I can start working out with my coaches and
prepare for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who turns 21 on Aug. 8, said he will return to Seattle
next week to sign a contract. Financial terms were not disclosed,
because the NBA prohibits deals before Aug. 1. It is believed that
Lewis will agree to a two-year deal worth at least $7.8 million _
the most the Sonics could offer. The package likely will give Lewis
an option to pick up the second year.
</P>
<P>
   After this contract expires, Lewis will become an unrestricted
free agent, and could receive the maximum reward: a seven-year deal
starting at $9 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics president Wally Walker acknowledged immediate
gratification when he received Lewis' phone call early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted with the answer,'' Walker said. ``Signing
Rashard was a well-publicized and stated priority. ... Rashard has
always made good decisions since we've been around him. Our
emphasis was what a great situation this is for him. I think he
recognizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Lewis has panned out better than expected when
the Sonics took him from Alief Elsik High School in Alief, Texas,
in the second round of the 1998 draft, 32nd overall.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 10, 215 pounds, Lewis is expected to return in a
starting role at small forward. He earned the position ahead of
Ruben Patterson near the end of last season. Lewis put on a number
of eye-popping performances, including his 30-point, 12-rebound
game against Dallas on Feb. 9. His stock skyrocketed with strong
outings in four of five first-round playoff games against the Utah
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've told me I can have the starting job as long as I keep
playing like I did last season,'' said Lewis, who is versatile
enough to play guard and power forward. ``Starting is important to
me to become the type of player I want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have showered Lewis with affection since he became a
restricted free agent July 1. Each member of the coaching staff
visited Lewis at his home in Houston, while Walker negotiated with
Lewis' agent, Carl Poston.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis decided to commit after talking with his mother, Juanita
Goodman, and assistant coach Nate McMillan over dinner Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a good situation, knowing we have a good coaching staff
and good crop of young guys they're going to grow for the future,''
Lewis said. ``I grew really comfortable with coach McMillan and
coach (Dwane) Casey. They've helped me a lot, and I like being
around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said listening to offers from Toronto, Orlando and Chicago
was simply a matter of ``looking at my options.'' The Raptors were
the only team Lewis visited. In the anticipation of losing swingman
Tracy McGrady to Orlando, Toronto was prepared to offer Lewis a
contract worth about $40 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls inquired about Lewis as other top free agents turned
down their offers. The Magic courted Lewis in case McGrady did not
sign. Only Toronto, Orlando, Chicago and the Los Angeles Clippers
had enough money to exceed the Sonics' offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is going to come,'' Lewis said. ``I'm only 20 and I
have a long time to play in the NBA.''

IT'S OFFICIAL: BUSH PICKS CONSERVATIVE CHENEY AS HIS RUNNING MATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The nation's worst-kept secret went public Tuesday when Texas
Gov. George W. Bush introduced former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
as his running mate as the Republican presidential nominee.
<P>
   ``I believe you're looking at the next vice president of the
United States,'' Bush told a crowd of cheering supporters at the
University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former Wyoming congressman and senior official in two
GOP administrations, made it clear early on that he won't fit into
the attack-dog role reserved for most vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with you, governor, to change the
tone in Washington, to restore a spirit of civility and respect and
cooperation,'' he said. ``It's time for America's leaders to stop
pointing the finger of blames &LR;  and to begin sharing the credit for
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea for a cease-fire did not register with Democrats, who
quickly jumped on Cheney's votes in Congress against the creation
of the Department of Education, against legal abortions and against
a ban on ``cop killer'' bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, California Sen. Barbara Boxer
repeated what will likely be the Democratic mantra on Cheney's
selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought Bush was going to move toward the center,''
she said. ``Instead, he picked someone whose record in the House
was far out of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is a nice man, Boxer said, ``but I want to see someone
who will fight for people when they're hungry, sick or out of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The former defense secretary has spent 25 years in public
service and is a well-known and respected figure in GOP circles.
His intimate knowledge of both foreign and domestic issues will
reassure swing voters worried that Bush's political expertise might
end at the Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney's biggest value to the Republican ticket probably
could be seen when he stood on the stage next to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Peering owlishly through his glasses, with lights reflecting off
his balding head, he looked every day of his 59 years. He also
appeared decades older and far more serious than the exuberant
Bush, who at 54 has the relaxed and casual manner of a man far
younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick is a grown-up and an adult,'' Ken Duberstein, former
chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan, said in a CNN
interview. ``He is a member of the governing class and adds to the
gravitas and seriousness of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney fills in the holes in Bush's resume, adding his expertise
in foreign affairs and his knowledge of the inner workings of the
nation's capital, said Sal Russo, a veteran Republican consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helps round out the Bush package; you can see him being
president,'' Russo said. ``While it's not an uproarious, dancing in
the streets type choice, everyone agrees that Cheney is solid. Bush
didn't hurt himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's selection also brought a sigh of relief to many
Republican conservatives, who were never comfortable with Bush's
father as president and were worried that the Texas governor would
choose a more moderate, pro-life Republican as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question this is good news for conservatives,''
said Ken Khachigian, a GOP consultant and former speechwriter for
Reagan. ``To some point, you have to dance with the one who brung
you, and the governor wisely recognized the conservatives in our
party had a lot to do with his nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney originally joined the Bush campaign earlier this year to
run the vice presidential search committee. But the focus shifted
from the sought to the seeker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually, I realized that the person who was best qualified
to be my vice president was working by my side,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who was making a salary of $1.3 million a year plus
bonuses as head of a Texas oil services company, at first was
uninterested in joining the GOP ticket, but in July agreed to talk
it over with his family. By last Friday, the cat was out of the
bag.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the applause Cheney received from Republicans
Tuesday, no one was pretending that he is the dynamic, exciting
choice that Bush had been seeming to promise for months.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than take a chance with Arizona Sen. John McCain, who is
popular but unpredictable, or pro-choice Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge, Bush opted for Cheney, a safe, comfortable choice who will
attract little criticism from the party activists at next week's
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It was a choice based on personality and ability, not politics,
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral
votes _ though we want them and will work hard to earn them,'' Bush
said. ``I picked him because he is without a doubt fully capable of
being president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the easy pick in the vice presidential choice could come
back to haunt Bush later in the campaign, suggested Bruce Cain, a
political science professor at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Bush) missed a big opportunity by not going with a
riskier choice,'' Cain said. ``He opened up a whole line of attack
on his `new kind of Republican' promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is the pick of a confident politician who believes things
are going to keep going his way, Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the choice you make when you think you've already won,''
he said. ``If Bush was behind 7 points in the polls, I think he
would look more seriously at throwing the long pass.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney is a westerner, that might not be much help in
California, a state where Bush is trying to steal from the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's selection ``doesn't really carry a regional punch to
it,'' said John McGraw, state Republican party chairman, but ``he
brings leadership and integrity and honesty to the White House. A
lot of voters are striving to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   While his record on such issues as abortion, gun control and the
environment might not mesh with the feelings of many Californians,
McGraw said, voters really are asking if ``the Bush-Cheney team ...
(can) run this country effectively. They may disagree with Dick
Cheney on specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Gray Davis sees Cheney's selection differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a step backwards,'' Davis said of Bush's chances
in California. ``It would be an uphill battle anyway and this just
reinforces the more conservative aspects of Governor Bush's
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   While Vice President Al Gore's campaign characterized Cheney as
``a retro pick ... showing that Bush would take the country
backward rather than forward,'' it was also good news for the
Democrat's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had made a surprise choice like former General Colin
Powell or New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, Gore could have
been forced to make a surprise selection of his own, Democratic
insiders said Tuesday. But with Cheney as the Republican pick,
Gore's options are wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore will now do what he was going to do all along,'' Boxer
said. ``He'll find someone in the mainstream of American
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney will make a day-long visit to Cheney's home
state of Wyoming Wednesday.

TEENS' SLAYING SUSPECT LIKELY HAD HELP, POLICE SAY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONNA HUFFAKER and JENNIFER HAMM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   GLENDALE _ The 15-year-old boy accused of bludgeoning two
teen-agers to death at a Glendale school knew the youngsters and
may have had help carrying out the brutal crime, which has rocked
the community, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the arrested youth was an ``acquaintance'' of
the slain boys -- Blaine Talmo, 14, of Glendale, and Chris
McCulloch, 13, of La Canada Flintridge -- but he did not attend
school with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite possible that we may eventually focus on more than
one suspect. We do believe that we will arrest at least one more,''
said Glendale police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing leads us to believe the murders were racially
motivated or gang-related. But we're not ruling out any
possibilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched the 15-year-old's La Crescenta home Monday, a
night after a neighbor found the bloody bodies at Valley View
Elementary's playground.
</P>
<P>
   As detectives widened their investigation, new details about the
teen-agers began to emerge from friends and family members who
gathered at a makeshift memorial at Valley View Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch's stepfather, Scott Bristow, said he believes more
people would be implicated in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it was just one kid unless it was a kid the
size of a hulk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristow said his stepson loved skateboarding and riding
bicycles. His 5-year-old brother idolized him but had not been told
of the killing, Bristow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved his friends. He would do anything for them. That may
have been what killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch was born in Stirling, Scotland, where Bristow met the
boy's mother. McCulloch was 6 when the family came to the United
States and moved to La Canada Flintridge because it was a good
neighborhood with good schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``But trouble finds you wherever you are,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread about the 15-year-old suspect, local students
began to wonder whether they know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing that kept reappearing was the students are
really concerned it was another student who did it,'' said Denise
Jones, head counselor at Crescenta Valley High School. ``They felt
creepy and betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   At Valley View Elementary, waves of teen-agers dropped flowers,
lighted candles and signed posters under the police tape still
draped across the school fence. Many wrote poems and prose --
including Talmo's grandmother -- and some scrawled ``Chris'' on
their arms in green marker.
</P>
<P>
   Friends described both boys, who were entering ninth grade this
fall at Crescenta Valley High School, as ``jokesters'' who liked to
ride skateboards and had had misdemeanor brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch's family reported him missing to the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department just after midnight Sunday,
Keuroghelian said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of months, McCulloch attended ACTION
meetings, a parent and teen-ager support group that counsels
adolescents for a variety of problems, such as drug and alcohol
addiction, said chief executive officer Cary Quashen.
</P>
<P>
   Talmo, whose father is a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant,
had begun football practice at Crescenta Valley High School.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys were seen sleeping in a park off New York Avenue on
Saturday morning by Ashley Calvillo and Javiera Olmeado, Crescenta
Valley ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-olds were practicing cheerleading when they spotted
the boys, who told them they had gone to a party the night before
and had not gone home. The girls saw them sleeping under a tree,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch's 14-year-old friend Chris Hutchins depicted the boys
as average kids, adding, ``They were clowns.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said McCulloch had been having a tough time lately and
gotten ``screwed up'' with the wrong crowd. The boys sometimes
participated in skateboard competitions at Crescenta Valley
Community Church, said youth pastor Mark Yeager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good boys. They had their challenges, but I enjoyed
chatting with them,'' he said, noting ``this is all just so hard to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of teen-agers backed away from the shrine and threw down
their bikes to hug McCulloch's best friend, Michael Hamami, who
brought a basket of flowers and teared up when he set it down.
Wearing a necklace McCulloch used to own, Hamami said, ``I don't
know who could do this. It's not human.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,600 students attending summer classes at Crescenta
Valley High School, about 40 met with counselors individually or in
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Pain manifests itself in a lot different ways,'' said Gary
Talbert, co-principal. ``This is not a time for silence to be
golden. This is a time for the students to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   District officials may remove the playground equipment at Valley
View, some of which was splattered with blood, said Vic Pallos,
Glendale Unified School District spokesman. ``We don't want them to
continue to have images of where this horrendous murder occurred.''

GAGNE'S WOES DON'T RILE GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ If Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Eric Gagne was
getting blasted in every start, general manager Kevin Malone might
be more inclined to burn a few prospects to get a
middle-of-the-road veteran starter.
</P>
<P>
   While Gagne is 1-6 and the Dodgers are 4-12 in his starts, the
club is taking solace in his ability to at least keep the team in
games. Gagne has allowed four or more earned runs in only four of
his 14 starts and has allowed the first run of the game 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   So while the high-priced Steve Trachsels and Ismael Valdeses and
Scott Ericksons of the world remain available, the Dodgers are
content with Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort, Carlos
Perez and even the rookie, Gagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to find out certain guys aren't available,
and the guys that are available, we're not sure it's an upgrade,''
Malone said. ``It's hard to find better than our starting five. At
any time we think Eric's going to have that type of game he's
capable of. He only made a couple of bad pitches (in his last
start). It's not like he's been real terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are growing pains connected with development. And people
say, `Should you be developing at this time of the year?' Well,
you'd prefer not to, but we also know this guy can click at any
time and we've got five pretty good starters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers talked about converting right-handed reliever Matt
Herges into a starter to help the back end of the rotation, but
they have shelved that idea. Herges is 7-0 with a 3.26 ERA and is
tied with Terry Adams for the team lead with 40 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's just too valuable where he's at,'' Malone said.
``He's so versatile. There's been talk, but I think we like him in
the role he's in at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Meeting in Florida: Dodgers officials met with Vero Beach
(Fla.) and Indian River County officials regarding the ``memorandum
of agreement'' as it relates to the ongoing negotiations to keep
the Dodgers spring-training home at Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   However, city and county officials decided to postpone a vote on
the matter after they requested some of the language be changed.
Instead, city and county officials are expected to vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the county commissioner's office is asking for a
public session for comment on the plan of purchasing the facility
and leasing it back to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dodgers, at the urging of officials in Las Vegas,
have delayed signing the agreement so Las Vegas can make a
last-ditch pitch to attract six teams to a mega-complex, a team
official said. A Dodgers official said Las Vegas remains ``a real,
real long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson is impressed
enough with backup catcher Paul LoDuca that even when catcher Todd
Hundley returns from his fractured right thumb, it likely won't be
LoDuca heading to the minors. ``He's my fifth outfielder, my third
second baseman, (a) third baseman. I'd like to keep him and I know
how he feels about it,'' Johnson said. Instead, it is more likely
Chris Donnels would either return to the minors or be designated
for assignment when right-hander Gregg Olson returns in the next
few days. . . . When F.P. Santangelo is eligible to return from his
left-hand contusion, Dodgers officials have discussed sending the
struggling utility player to Triple-A Albuquerque for a few weeks
until Sept. 1 call-ups. He went 1 for 3 with a stolen base at
Single-A San Bernardino on a rehab stint. . . . Eric Karros' 17
homers at Coors Field are more than any non-Rockies player. ``It
just means I've played a lot of games here,'' Karros said.

 COMMENTARY: IT AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the collapse of the Camp David peace talks there
will be a great temptation to pronounce the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process over. That would be a great, great mistake. The truth
is, it has just begun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton accomplished something very important at Camp
David _ and hats off to him for having the courage to try. He
brought the issues of Jerusalem, refugees and real territorial
compromise down from the heavens _ down from the airy mantras and
dreamlands where they have resided for 33 years _onto the
negotiating table. As one Palestinian negotiator remarked to the
Americans just before the Camp David talks broke up: ``This was
revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was right. In their talks, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel offered the Palestinians a real state in virtually all of
the West Bank and Gaza; he put forward a credible solution for the
Palestinian refugee issue; he offered Yasser Arafat a mosaic of
Palestinian administrative control and sovereignty over the Arab
areas of Jerusalem and Muslim holy sites. Arafat offered Israel
security arrangements that were unprecedented; he proposed
adjusting the 1967 borders to accommodate some Israeli settlements
in the West Bank; and he was ready to cede Palestinian sovereignty
over Jewish areas in the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Folks, none of these issues have been broached between these
parties before. Oh, op-ed writers broached them aplenty; think
tanks broached them aplenty. But the leaders never did. These were
all taboo issues, and breaking those taboos is a legacy Clinton can
be proud of, because it was the necessary condition for solving
these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been carrying around their positions on
Jerusalem, refugees and territory in a sealed box. At Camp David
the seals were opened, the issues were laid out and prospective
trades were made. And there were plenty of Palestinian negotiators
at Camp David who were urging Arafat to take the package on the
table, and plenty of Israelis ready to back Barak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately Arafat, in the end, could not pull the trigger and
take what Barak was offering _ an offer the U.S. side felt went a
long way toward meeting Palestinian needs. This isn't surprising.
There is probably no way Arafat could cede any degree of Arab
sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the holy sites on the Temple
Mount without an Arab-Muslim consensus _ that is, without the
approval of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Morocco. And he
did not have that green light.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Clinton told Arafat that he was sacrificing the
future of his people for the approval of Arab countries and
Palestinian radicals who would sell him down the river in a second.
Arafat told Clinton he knew that. But he still couldn't pull the
trigger _ a sad reminder that the Palestinians don't not have a
state for nothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is going to have to decide whether his loyalty is to the
Palestinian cause or the Palestinian people. If his loyalty is to
the Palestinian cause, he has left Camp David as a hero, and he
will no doubt receive high-fives all around the Arab world. If his
loyalty is to the Palestinian people, well, that's another matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs and the Palestinian opponents of peace have always
been able to get the benefit of Arafat's compromises without taking
any political or moral responsibility,'' noted the Middle East
expert Stephen P. Cohen. ``The Arab states got a reduction in the
threat from Israel, but without ever paying the price of saying to
their people that we have truly passed to a new era. And the
Palestinian intelligentsia got land back, but they never had to get
their hands dirty. This never stopped Arafat before. But this time,
at Camp David, he has decided to do it their way _ putting dogma
before pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get around this,'' added Cohen, ``is for
Clinton to call the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco
and Syria and say, `Guys, put up or shut up. There is no more free
ride here. Either you guys share the responsibility with Arafat _
and admit you are sharing Jerusalem with the Jews, who are also at
home there _ or you are leaving the Palestinians at the mercy of
the Israeli right, because Barak either won't be around or he will
be around saying that the Palestinians are hopeless.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is already tough talk coming from Palestinian radicals
about how they are going to declare their own state on Sept. 13, or
mount another intifada. Guys, here's some free advice: The days of
the intifada are over. The Palestinian police now have guns _ and
that changes everything.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The intifada worked for the Palestinians,'' observed the
Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, ``because they had stones
and the Israelis had guns and the Israelis could not really shoot
back, they could not use their superior force without restraint. If
the Palestinians use guns, there is no intifada option anymore.
This won't be defined as a people's movement with stones against an
army with guns. It will be defined as a war between two armies, and
Israel will use all its force without restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Palestinians used guns against Israeli guns
was in a place called Lebanon, and it ended with the PLO on a boat
to Tunis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Israel, one can already hear the yapping on the
political right: Ariel Sharon and Natan Sharansky blathering on
about how they could get more for Israel and give up less. They
speak utter nonsense. The important thing about what Clinton did in
singling out Barak as having been willing to compromise, to a
degree that Arafat was not, was to signal that there is in the U.S.
view a level of Israeli compromise that is right and fair, and
beyond which Israel should not be expected to go. It is not just a
bottomless pit of giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a big push in Israel now to form a national unity
government, but thanks to Camp David it is going to be a very
different debate. Because the question will be on what basis
national unity will be forged. On the basis of the compromises
Barak tabled at Camp David, or on the basis of the Israeli right's
delusion that by just hanging tough with unrealistic positions the
Palestinian side will fold _ and there will be no price with
America, the Arabs or the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   The first Mideast peace talks at Camp David, in 1978, brought
the Arab world over the threshold of acknowledging that Israel was
there to stay, and it brought Israel over the threshold that
endless war was not inevitable. Camp David II has brought Israelis
and Palestinians up to a similar threshold, but not over it. It has
been clarifying nonetheless, because both sides now can see clearly
what their options are: Going forward means accepting the full
implications of sharing the land of Israel-Palestine and Jerusalem.
Going backward means a life on the barricades in which the future
of both peoples is completely uncertain. Most of all, neither side
can ever again return to the bliss of thinking that it doesn't have
a real choice.

ANGELS, GLAUS NOT UP TO SPEED

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Bill Haselman's scorching line drive whizzed
past the glove of Anaheim Angels third baseman Troy Glaus into left
field Tuesday night, and with it went the game for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an inning-ending double play, Haselman's hit led to a
three-run eighth inning for the Texas Rangers and a 9-6 victory
before 34,272 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from a 5-1 deficit to tie the game at 6 on
Darin Erstad's RBI single in the sixth. It was still tied at 6 when
the Rangers' David Segui singled with one out in the eighth.
Segui's hit off Mike Holtz snapped at 12 a string of consecutive
batters retired by the Angels bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek came in to replace Holtz and face Haselman. With
pinch-runner Scarborough Green going from first on the pitch,
Haselman's liner went past Glaus' left ear and into left field. Had
Glaus caught the ball, Green easily would have been doubled up at
first.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Green raced for third and Erstad's throw from left
field deflected off Green's helmet and went to the backstop. Erstad
was charged with an error, Green scored and Haselman went all the
way to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a bad read on it and I missed it,'' Glaus said. ``That's
the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball was hit real hard,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``I thought he had a bead on it. He just didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said he was surprised his throw came too late to get the
speedy Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw it at the glove and the next thing I know it skipped
out,'' he said. ``That play was crazy. He obviously runs faster
than I throw a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to Dave Martinez, Gabe Kapler (Taft
High of Woodland Hills) ripped a two-run double to give the Rangers
a 9-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the ninth, Erstad came about 10 feet from a home
run to right-center field. Erstad had a single, double and triple
in the game, just missing hitting for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get into that too much,'' said Erstad, who said he's
never hit for the cycle at any level. ``Especially after what
happened in the (eighth) inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz (0-2) got the loss and Rangers reliever Doug Davis (4-2)
earned the win. John Wetteland, one night after blowing a three-run
lead, pitched the ninth for his 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   Angels pitcher Seth Etherton had the worst start of his major-
league career, and it came one start after his best. Last week
against the same Rangers, Etherton gave up one run in 7 innings in
a 6-1 Angels win.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, he failed to go at least five innings for the
first time in his nine major-league starts. He gave up six runs in
3 innings. Of the seven hits he yielded, four were home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanatto led off the first with a homer, and one batter
later Rafael Palmeiro hit a two-run homer. In the third inning,
Rusty Greer hit a two-run homer, and in the fourth, Kapler hit a
solo homer. All six runs allowed by Etherton scored on home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a team the second time around can make it tough on
pitchers, especially young ones. But Etherton would not use it as
an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big a deal,'' Etherton said. ``I didn't make
pitches, that's cut and dry. I didn't hit my spots and that's what
happens.''

CHANG LOOKS FOR UPSWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Chang wasn't so worried about Australian
Paul Kilderry, his opening-round opponent in the Mercedes-Benz Cup
at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center on Tuesday. Chang proved that much
with a relatively easy 6-4, 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's other battle _ with his own reputation as one of the
world's best players _ looms larger.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Chang is seeded fourth in this tournament, and at 28 he's
amassed more than $18 million in prize money. But the cold fact is
Chang hasn't won a tournament since October 1998, and last year was
the first time in his 13-year career he didn't qualify for a final.
</P>
<P>
   So how much does Tuesday's victory against the relatively
unarmed Kilderry mean? After all, Kilderry, an unseeded qualifier,
entered with an 8-20 career ATP record.
</P>
<P>
   It's a start.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Chang had spring in his step, and that same tenacity
that has always been his calling card in the wake of a shortage of
power. Against Kilderry he double-faulted just once, won 61 percent
of second-serve points _ compared to Kilderry's 34 percent _ and
saved 8 of 9 break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been frustrating and very disappointing and
discouraging for me,'' Chang said. ``I've tried my best to fight
through these times, and I'm hoping and praying I can pick myself
up. I don't know what the future holds, but I feel I'm on the right
track. I'm constantly struggling to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang's victory in the first set was decisive but not routine,
as an 11-minute opening game _ won by Chang _ set the tone.
</P>
<P>
   Kilderry then got a bit sloppy and didn't pose a particularly
terrific challenge in the first two games of the second set,
falling behind 3-0. The last point of the third game was the
highlight of the match, a grueling rally that saw both players
range from side to side and from baseline to net. It was the kind
of rally Chang needed to stay in command, and indeed Tuesday's most
important moments belonged to him; he clinched the game with a
nifty passing shot as a large, appreciate crowd loudly approved.
</P>
<P>
   Chang did a nice job seizing the early momentum in the second
set. Up 4-2, he broke to move ahead 5-2. Kilderry remained game for
a bit, cutting the gap to 5-4 by breaking Chang's serve. But Chang
avoided a prolonged set by breaking Kilderry's service for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's first-round loss aside, Chang always has performed
well in Los Angeles, winning this tournament in 1996 and appearing
in three other finals in 1989, 1990 and 1993. However, after
ranking as high as No. 2 in the world, he finished 50th last year.
</P>
<P>
   His decline can be traced back to September 1997, when he lost
in straight sets to Patrick Rafter in the U.S. Open semifinals. At
the time, Chang was seeded No. 2 and Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi
_ Chang's measuring sticks _ both had been eliminated from the
tournament. A knee injury in 1998 didn't help Chang's cause,
especially when baseline quickness is his primary asset. In 1999 he
failed to win a tournament for the first time in 11 years and
didn't make it past the second round of the U.S., French and
Australian opens.
</P>
<P>
   Chang entered this tournament with a 23-15 singles record in
2000 _ this from a man who was 541-198 from 1984-1998. In the seven
tournaments preceding the Mercedes event, Chang failed to advance
past the final 32 five times. He appeared to be on a minor upswing
_ reaching the semifinals June 12 in Halle, Germany, and June 19 in
Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands _ before falling in the second round
at Wimbledon to 114th-ranked Alexander Popp.

DODGERS GAIN GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ There are things Adrian Beltre does that amaze, like
fielding bunts barehanded and throwing out a speedy runner like
Colorado's Neifi Perez.
</P>
<P>
   He also backs up on balls that would be double plays if he were
more aggressive, and puts pressure on himself to hit in the clutch.
Lately, the lack of the latter was getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers took the good and bad the 21-year-old
third baseman offers, and they used the good to continue their
charge toward Arizona. Beltre's bases-loaded single in the eighth
inning broke a tie and lifted the Dodgers to a 6-4 win against
Colorado on Tuesday night in a peaks-and-valleys kind of game for
Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (53-46) have won three straight and eight of their
last 10. They're within 2 games of the front-running Diamondbacks
in the NL West, the closest they've been since June 22, and within
1 games of second-place San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Beltre's) going to be a great player,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``He's a good player now, but he's going to be a
great player. It's just a few little things. This is the second
year I've had him, and I guess I just expect so much. The way he
handles himself, I expect him to be the true professional and know
all the intricacies of playing third.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Beltre's fielding error in the second inning on Ben
Petrick's grounder that led to the Rockies scoring three runs, and
he said that was on his mind in the later innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies reliever Jose Jimenez pitched around Eric Karros, who
hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning to tie it 4-4, to load
the bases and face Beltre, who was 2 for 15 with a homer with the
bases loaded. Beltre's troubles extended to runners in scoring
position. He was 5 for his last 30 with runners in scoring
position, but he singled to center to score Todd Hollandsworth and
Shawn Green and give the Dodgers a 6-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the guy who was responsible for the first couple of
runs, and to see my chance to get the runs back and give Chan Ho
(Park) a chance to get his win . . .,'' Beltre said. ``When I saw
the bases loaded with two outs, I thought this was my big moment
and my chance to step up and fix what I did early in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers needing big efforts from their big three _
Kevin Brown, Park and Darren Dreifort _ in the second half of the
season, Park continued a run. They are a combined 6-0 in their last
six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Park (11-7) won his second straight and took over the team lead
in wins after allowing four runs (two earned) in seven innings at a
ballpark where he traditionally gets hammered. Park entered the
night with a 9.36 ERA in seven games at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Relief was provided by Terry Adams and Jeff Shaw, who each
allowed two hits but no runs in scoreless innings. For Shaw, it was
his 15th save, but it came with some drama. And meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker and Tom Goodwin had one-out singles, and at that
time Mike Fetters began warming up. But Perez surprised the Dodgers
with a sacrifice, which Beltre fielded and threw to Karros for the
second out. It brought up Larry Walker, and brought a visit from
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'What do you want to do? Do you want to pitch around
him or go after him?' `' Johnson said. ``He said 'I want to go
right after him.' I said that was fine with me. I wanted to hear it
from him, and I knew that's what he was going to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw retired Walker on a comebacker to end the game, but there
was also some significance with it. Shaw and Fetters are considered
co-closers at this juncture, mostly because Shaw is still
rebuilding everyone's confidence in him after he blew seven of his
first 20 save chances.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Johnson went to Fetters in the Dodgers' 4-1 win Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I was shocked (Monday) night and I was
shocked the day before,'' Shaw said. ``That's just me because I
expect to go out there in the ninth inning every night. That's what
I'm getting paid for, and that's what I've worked my tail off for
and I don't want to lose that.''

ANOTHER GALAXY PLAYER INJURED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ With Cobi Jones and Robin Frasier playing with soft
arm casts and Kevin Hartman at home recovering from arthroscopic
knee surgery, Tuesday night's U.S. Open Cup game was a matchup of
MASH against Flash.
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder and Olympic Team
hopeful Pete Vagenas would become the next casualty.
</P>
<P>
   But even with that, and with the core of its regular starting
line- up diluted by injuries, aches and the scalpel, the Galaxy
mustered enough fortitude to upend the A-League's San Diego Flash.
</P>
<P>
   Sasha Victorine's 50th-minute tally and and an insurance strike
in the 67th minute from Ivan Polic provided the depleted Galaxy the
ammunition it needed for a 2-0 victory over the Flash in
round-of-16 U.S. Open Cup action at San Diego Mesa College.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Galaxy advanced into the quarterfinal
round of the nation's oldest professional soccer tournament _ it
will face the San Jose Earthquakes on August 9th at a site to be
determined. MLS teams have now secured seven of the eight
quarterfinal-round berths, with DC United facing the defending U.S.
Open Cup champion Rochester Rhinos of the A-League tonight to
determine the final spot in the bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But the most pressing date on Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid's mind is
this morning, when he'll know the health status of Vagenas, who
crumpled to the field in pain after harsh contact with San Diego's
Geoff Huber in te 42nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a knock, it could be the Achilles' (tendon),'' said
Schmid, fearing the worst. ``It was right at the back of the ankle
and he said he heard something pop. It's bad timing for him (with
the Olympics coming up) and bad timing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A sullen Vagenas had little to say afterward, also fearing his
Olympic Dream hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really saying much until I know what it is,'' said
Vagenas, who played at St. Francis High and UCLA. His lower left
leg was heavily bandaged. ``It's hard to talk about. The ball
wasn't even near us. (Huber) just whacked me as we were running
along. He got me right near the Achilles and I heard it pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As ominously as the night ended, events unfolded well for the
Galaxy at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy controlled most of the run of play on the diminutive
field, threading balls which continaully perforated the lash
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Victorine, however, eventually got the only goal the team would
need early in the second half, one-timing a goal-mouth header of
Cobi Jones' corner kick past Flash goalie Tom Tate. Jones' service
was to the near corner of the goal box, where Victorine wriggled
free of two defenders to finish the set piece.
</P>
<P>
   Polic scored 17 minutes later on a counterattack keyed by
midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos' alertness.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cienfuegos who gathered possession for the Galaxy near
midfield, then quickly spotted Polic run up the left side.
Cienfuegos passed to Polic, who beat one defender and shot from 30
yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Tate, who was well off his line, had the ball carom off his
hands before bouncing over his head and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   As if Schmid needed any more lineup worries, Polic was tossed
from the game in the 90th minute, with the referee ejecting him for
a strong tackle, his second offense of the game. As a result, Polic
will not be available to play in the team's next U.S. Open Cup
game.

SECOND HALF CARRIES SPARKS PAST MIRACLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks struggled a bit early
on, but in the end they had too many weapons for the Orlando
Miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks turned up the heat in the second half, beating the
Miracle 78-63 before 6,462 at the Forum Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed by eight midway in the first half, but they
wore down the Miracle in the second half, leading by as many as 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're blessed we're a deep team,'' said Sparks coach Michael
Cooper. ``We have too many players that can start on any other
team. . . . Fatigue is going to be a factor for a lot of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue was a factor for Orlando, whose bench contributed only
two points. On the other hand, Sparks reserves accounted for 17
points, with seven each from Allison Feaster and Nicky McCrimmon.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie led the Sparks with 17 points, DeLisha Milton and
Tamecka Dixon had 14 points apiece and Mwadi Mabika had 11. The
Sparks improved to 21-4 to stay a half-game ahead of the Houston
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed 24-16 midway through the first half, but
Milton scored eight points to get the Sparks back in the game. She
made two shots from 18 feet out and a four free throws to cut the
Sparks deficit to two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struggling offensively as far as my outside shot
goes, but Lisa and coach (Glenn) McDonald have been working with me
to be consistent,'' she said. ``Tonight, it was working well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks regained the lead, 31-30, on a basket by Mabika with
two minutes to play. Lisa Leslie, who is on a tear from the free
throw, increased her streak to 48 with a pair. Dixon turned a steal
from Shannon Johnson into a score and scored again to give the
Sparks a 37-30 margin at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to figure out what they were doing
defensively,'' Cooper said.

   ``They were running a triangle-and-two and that caught us off
guard in the beginning,'' said Leslie, who also had 11 rebounds and
four blocked shots. ``Once we adjusted that really opened it up for
us in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton and Leslie combined for 20 points in the first 20
minutes. Adrienne Johnson, who scored nine of the Miracle's first
11 points, had 13 at the half. She didn't score again. Cintia dos
Santos had 14 points for Orlando (14-11).

A-ROD RETURNS, BUT MARINERS FALL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He slapped the first pitch thrown to him for a double,
gloved the first ball hit to him for an out.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Rodriguez still wasn't Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Back from a knee strain and concussion that put him on the
sidelines two-and-a-half weeks ago, the Mariners' All-Star
shortstop appeared stiff and tentative. He chugged around the bases
like Edgar Martinez. To resume his place in the galaxy, he's going
to need more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adjustment,'' Rodriguez said. ``The body has its guard
up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's OK with the Mariners. They rarely break stride these
days, though their Jay Buhner-led finishing kick fell short Tuesday
night in an 8-7 defeat to Oakland before a crowd of 42,377 at
Safeco Field. Seattle's AL West lead was lopped to four games over
the A's, who try to narrow the gap even more in the series-ender
Wednesday at 1:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lending to Mariners intrigue, Buhner slugged two home runs _
including his 300th _ to draw a long ovation, while Edgar Martinez
contributed his major league-leading 95th and 96th RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, Buhner unloaded his milestone, a two-run
shot over the center-field fence that was struck so hard the bald
outfielder stood at home plate and watched it disappear into the
night. The ball traveled 428 feet and pulled Seattle within one
run. The resulting ovation was so heartfelt, Buhner emerged from
the dugout and made a emotional curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally overwhelmed,'' said Buhner, who traded a bat,
cap and a couple of gloves to the fan who caught the ball. ``I just
grabbed whatever I had and gave it to him. It was a pretty special
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had the tying run on base in the ninth as Rickey
Henderson slapped a one-out double, but he stayed there. The game
ended when Rodriguez flied deep to the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, all eyes were on the gimpy shortstop as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners didn't post their starting lineup until 5:30 p.m.,
two hours later than usual, uncertain if their superstar would get
medical clearance to play. With a trainer monitoring his every
move, Rodriguez took batting practice, loped around the bases and
backpedaled in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was ready to play,'' head trainer Rick Griffin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little apprehensive, but I'm eager to play,'' Rodriguez
said before the game. ``It's like getting on the bike for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez can run straight ahead; it's circling the bases that
makes him step lightly. The knee hasn't experienced swelling in 10
days, but he's not ready to cut loose. He's been through this
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like last year, it was three or four days before he was
running well,'' reminded Griffin, referring to a torn knee ligament
that sidelined Rodriguez for six weeks early in the 1999 season.
``It will take a few days, then the adrenaline will kick in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez initially had no problems swinging the bat, swatting
the first pitch from A's starter Gil Heredia into the left-field
corner, putting runners on second and third. He scored on Olerud's
homer as the Mariners took a 3-1 first-inning lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Rodriguez was responsible for Oakland's third
out, sliding to his left and gobbling up a Sal Fasano grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez struck out and grounded out twice in his next three
times up, leaving Henderson on second base in the middle at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   He botched his only other attempt in the field, letting Miguel
Tejada's hard-hit grounder get tangled in his feet in the fourth
inning. Rodriguez had a chance to throw the Oakland runner out, but
he pulled Olerud off first with his hurried effort, allowing the
A's second run to score. It was just the shortstop's fourth error
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners starter Aaron Sele, who lost his third consecutive
decision, also had problems with some of his throws. To start the
game, he could barely get one over the plate. The first two
hitters, Terrence Long and Randy Velarde, reached on singles, Long
scoring with the aid of a wild pitch. The next two A's, Jason
Giambi and Ben Grieve, walked on 10 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (11-6) escaped major damage by striking out Matt Stairs and
inducing a double-play grounder from Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't quite so fortunate in the fifth inning. Jason Giambi
took Sele deep with a two-out, two-run homer just inside the
right-field foul pole, pulling the A's into a 4-4tie.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the A's broke the stalemate with four runs and
sent Sele to the clubhouse, a two-out single up the middle by
Grieve barely eluding a diving Rodriguez and providing the go-ahead
score.
</P>
<P>
   In another week, the Mariners headliner makes that play. And
later, probably launches a game-winning homer over the fence.

STILL AT 113

<P>
   GONESSE, France _ Working in a dull gray mist, investigators and
medical workers Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   began sifting through the blackened wreckage of a chartered Air
France Concorde that crashed near Paris minutes after take-off
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As attention turned to the supersonic aircraft's engines, the
airline said that its mechanics worked on one of the plane's
engines just before take-off. The airline would not say whether the
work was done on the No. 4 engine, the one that apparently caught
fire and streamed flames as the aircraft plunged to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said Wednesday that it would resume its Concorde
flights between London and New York, while Air France said it would
seek more information about the cause of the fatal crash before
making a decision. The two airlines are the only airlines to fly
the supersonic transports. The first British Airways Concorde
Wednesday took off from London at about 10:45 a.m. London time
(5:45 a.m. ET).
</P>
<P>
   Here in Gonesse, a small town north of Paris, forensic experts
were examining the charred bodies of the 113 victims _ mainly
German tourists _ to determine their identities. Relatives began to
arrive into Paris.
</P>
<P>
   A prayer service for the victims was held Wednesday at a chapel
in Hanover, Germany, on the grounds of the World's Fair. ``Today
Germany is shaken,'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said at the
service.
</P>
<P>
   The swan-like supersonic aircraft crashed into a small hotel
near Charles de Gaulle International Airport near Paris after one
of its four engines burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Nine crewmembers and 100 passengers were killed in the fiery
crash that sent smoke high into the suburban Paris skies for hours.
Also killed were four people at Hotelissimo, which was engulfed in
the blaze fed by the aircraft's full fuel tanks. Another 14 hotel
guests were hospitalized, police said.
</P>
<P>
   French television showed clips of the aircraft struggling to
maintain altitude with its left engines spewing flames. In images
that suggested the pilot's battle to keep aloft, the needle-nosed
plane banked before striking the hotel. The 45-room Hotel Relais
Bleu next door was unscathed. ne crash, told French TV that the
pilot seemed to be trying to turn the Concorde around. ``The pilot
realized there was an enormous problem and tried to turn around but
the plane fell straight down,'' she said. ``When it tried to
accelerate it caught fire behind. It fell directly on its wing. It
wanted to turn around and boom, it just fell. Everything was
shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, investigators recovered the flight data
and cockpit voice recorders _ the so-called ``black boxes'' _ which
will provide vital data to help determine what caused the accident,
the first crash in the 30 years that the supersonic transport has
been flying. Officials said the recorders were damaged but
apparently functional.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the French and British investigators, the U.S.
National Transportation Safety
</P>
<P>
   Board sent at least one investigator from Washington because the
Concordes fly into New York.
</P>
<P>
   After the intense blaze that took firefighters hours to
extinguish, there was little recognizable in the wreckage early
Wednesday morning. However, a bit of the blue Air France logo was
visible on a piece of fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were taken to a makeshift morgue set up at the
Jacques Brel amphitheater nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger list included 96 Germans, two Danes, one Austrian
and one American, as well as nine crewmembers, Air France said. The
American was a retired Air France employee, but the company did not
release a name.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eyewitnesses was Air France President Jean-Cyril
Spinetta. ``It seems there was a fire in one or more of the engines
on take-off,'' Spinetta told reporters at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   The crash did not appear to be linked to cracks found recently
in both British Airways and Air France Concorde jets. Air France
said this particular plane, in service since 1980, did not have
reported fissures.
</P>
<P>
   A former Concorde pilot told the BBC that he believed it would
take more than an engine fire to bring the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an engine fire you simply shut the engine down,
fire the fire bottles which put the fire out, dump fuel and come
down and land,'' John Hutchison said. ``The pictures I have seen
indicate something beyond a normal engine fire. That great long
plume of flame which is about as long as the airplane itself, a
couple of hundred feet, implies some sort of a catastrophic
failure, when the engine breaks up and blows apart.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France _ the only airlines that fly the
Concorde _ grounded their fleets Tuesday and said they would wait
until Wednesday to announced whether they would resume operations.
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of Anglo-French cooperation, the first Concorde flew in
1969. With the crash, there are now 12 of the distinctive
delta-wing jets in the Air France and British Airways fleets. The
plane that crashed had flown 12,000 hours and had its last
mechanical checkup July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police said three people on board the flight were under 18 years
sold. Five people on the ground were injured, police said. French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who visited the scene, said their
condition was ``good from a medical standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   British businessman Darren Atkins told SKY-TV News that he was
aboard another aircraft behind the Concorde on the tarmac. ``As it
accelerated down the runway the engine was already smoking,'' he
said. ``Before it started to take off the left-hand engines were
visibly on fire. They were burning very heavily. So much so in
fact, on the tarmac was some debris that had clearly fallen off the
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Lucas of Paris, who was at the airport waiting for her
children, also said she saw the plane on fire before it lifted off.
``We were waiting to hear the explosion because we thought it was
going to fall here (at the airport),'' Lucas told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers had been on a trip meant to savor: champagne on
the Concorde, then a leisurely cruise on the MS Deutschland through
the Panama Canal to Ecuador. Tour operator Peter Deilmann said the
cruise, which had a total of 510 passengers booked, would not be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional ad follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which crosses the Atlantic at 1,350 mph, has been
considered among the world's safest planes. Its only major scare
came in 1979, when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires. The
incident led to a design modification.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is popular with celebrities, world-class athletes and
the rich. It flies above turbulence at nearly 60,000 feet, crossing
the Atlantic in about 3 1/2 hours, much faster than regular
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   A round-trip Paris-New York ticket costs $9,000, roughly 25
percent more than first class on a regular jet. A London-New York
round-trip runs $9,850. Air France officials have said in the past
that their current fleet was fit to fly safely until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, visibly moved, and French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot visited the crash scene. ``It's a terrible moment,''
Gayssot said. President Jacques Chirac promised to pay homage
Wednesday to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokeswoman, Agathe Sanson, said Chirac was leaving
the airport at the time of the crash, having just returned from the
Group of Eight major industrial nations summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences poured in from all over, including German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and President Clinton. ``I wanted to extend the
deepest condolences of the American people to the families of those
who are lost,'' Clinton said.

 &HT;    Cell Phone Games seek competitors
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the feds have noticed that it's dangerous to drive and
talk on a cellular phone at the same time (well, duh), why not give
people who jabber while driving a competitive outlet to show off
that skill by holding a special Cell Phone Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   Not only would these games get these cyber yakkers off the
highway for a couple of weeks each summer, it would also give them
a chance to showcase their talents and give the rest of us a few
good laughs watching road stunts that usually just tick us off.
</P>
<P>
   We could hold the games at a NASCAR track, and dot-coms could
sponsor the entries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cell Phone Olympics would consist of events that require the
driver to perform several real-life tasks simultaneously at high
rates of speed while operating a cell phone. I'm sure you've seen
some of these games being performed in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the 18-Car Pileup Clean and Jerk, drivers would
have to drive a minivan full of screaming children, use the cell
phone to order a three-topping pizza, balance the checkbook on a
Palm Pilot and fire up the laptop to check today's stock market
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Has it ever occurred to the people who perform these daredevil
maneuvers that it might be simpler to pull off the road and call
from a parking lot?
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you about the kind of unathletic oaf we're NOT looking
for to enter the Cell Phone Olympics. We're not looking for the guy
who was driving in front of me a few days back. This guy couldn't
even do two things at the same time _ that is, talk on a cell phone
and drive.
</P>
<P>
   This guy was sitting at a flashing red light while talking on
his cell phone. We were the only people at the intersection. Last
time I looked that up, a flashing red light meant stop, look, then
split. But this guy stopped, looked, talked and sat there. I was
beginning to wonder if he'd run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, buddy, you ain't in a phone booth,'' I said loudly, with
my windows rolled up. (I'm pretty darned mean with my windows
rolled up.) Finally, to herd him out of my way, I honked. If I
hadn't honked, he might still be there, talking to his broker or
checking to see if his shirts were ready from the cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of Cell Phone Games that I could suggest.
In the Hop, Skip and Careen, cell phone talkers would be required
to use their electronic mapping system to determine their exact
location (for example, a ditch next to the highway), call ahead to
make reservations at a restaurant, check their e-mail, buy a copy
of Harry Potter for junior on amazon.com, fix their hair and,
finally, cut somebody off for a parking place.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the Cyberelay, in which speeding cell phone users
would have to steer the car while eating a breakfast taco without
spilling salsa out either end (no small feat by itself), make the
kids stop pestering the dog, and do their nails at 70 mph?
</P>
<P>
   If you've done this kind of work and you're pretty good at it, I
want you on my team because we're going to win several gold medals.

 &HT;    Anne, Harry are doors to another world
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget The Patriot, Gladiator or any of the summer blockbusters.
In my family, the summer's command performance was the new
installment of PBS' ongoing Anne of Green Gables series.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been better. With the arrival of the
hungrily-awaited fourth Harry Potter book, I had been thinking a
lot lately of Anne Shirley and my other childhood favorites. What a
glorious sight: kids sneaking off to midnight bookstore parties,
hunkering down for weekend readathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be habit-forming,'' I thought as I watched my
12-year-old nieces compete to be the first to finish the ponderous
tome. Could the Harry hysteria carry over into a revived interest
in other children's literature?
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores and libraries have done their best to lure the
newly-spun bookworms to other classic children's tales, from A
Wrinkle in Time to The Chronicles of Narnia. One bookstore has
sponsored a ``Harry Potter Withdrawal Club''; libraries have posted
numerous ``If you love Harry Potter, you'll like this'' lists.
</P>
<P>
   None of the lists that I saw contained Anne of Green Gables. Too
old-fashioned, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Not for my family. Sunday night, at 8:55 p.m., EDT, my mother,
my sister Anne and I plopped ourselves in front of the TV for the
latest installment. In her youth Mom had been an ardent Anne of
Green Gables fan, a passion she passed on to the oldest and
youngest of her five daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Since Anne is named for the flame-haired, pigtailed orphan _
including a spelling with that all-important ``e'' _ she can hardly
be blamed for having a proprietary interest in the tale.
</P>
<P>
   She was dismayed to realize that the new episode had taken some,
er, small liberties with the original series by L.M. Montgomery.
Such as the entire script, in which a newlywed Anne searches
desperately for her husband, Gilbert Blythe, on the French front in
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean they made it all up?'' asked Anne indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they did,'' I said. ``Anne's children went into
World War I; she would have been well into middle age by then.''
</P>
<P>
   But hey, it's television, and even public television, perhaps,
is wary of the drama of the everyday, the poetry of the pedestrian,
that L.M. Montgomery so lovingly depicts. Instead, the classic
story had been transformed into a beautifully acted, beautifully
costumed melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   It struck me, in fact, that Harry Potter bears a greater
resemblance to the ``real Anne.'' Both children are orphans. Both
have an undeniable personal magnetism. Both, enduring cruelty and
emotional neglect during childhood, enter a whole new world at age
11 _ Anne to the enchanting Prince Edwards Island, Harry to the
enchanted Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Anne pines for a ``a kindred spirit'' in whom ``I can confide my
inmost soul;'' Harry longs for magical spirits, or at least those
very unlike the ``Muggle'' _ non-wizard _ relatives who have reared
him with little respect and less affection.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to what makes both tales so universal, so
irresistible to children. The PBS folks didn't need to jazz up
Anne's story with battlefield scenes and missing husbands.
</P>
<P>
   There is drama enough in the quest for identity, for friendship.
There are battles enough in finding your way in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And that, more than any sorcery, is what keeps kids turning
every last page _ 734, count 'em _ of Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope they don't wait till the next Harry Potter fix to
capture the same magic.

 &HT;    Ancient oak's giving way shows the hand of fate
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I heard, within seconds of each other, two sounds that
rose above the roll of thunder and splatter of rain: crrrraaaack!
Whuuump! In the kitchen of our 110-year-old house, I felt a thud,
but it did not begin to prepare me for what lay in front of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminated by a fast-returning sun and lightning's persistent
flash, a giant hand cradled the garden, the most amazing sight I've
ever seen in a growing space. The big old oak next door, a tree
that probably predates the Civil War, had lost half of itself; our
side of the split trunk, always a concern, had fallen away,
brushing the top of our house, crashing into the wrought iron
fence, spreading across the driveway, reaching even the house
beyond ours. On what remained of the once mighty water oak, the
broken trunk jutted upward about 8 feet, a jagged reminder of the
once imposing half: bright wood with a telltale rotted heart.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the half-tree landed in the garden and on the sidewalk
and street. So much tree for such a small garden space. The oak had
become a grounded treehouse, complete with a maze of branches,
thickly leaved, fruited with new acorns that, for the past 11
years, rat-a-tat-tatted on our roof.
</P>
<P>
   So precise was the tree's placement that its lichened fingers,
some well over a foot around, rested right in the middle of the
postage-stamp-size garden, squashing some prized old friends, to be
sure, but apparently doing no harm to others. The cherry was
decapitated, but hydrangeas, azaleas, dogwood, redtip, a Japanese
maple remained unbroken.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just amazing that it missed so many plants,'' Lyn said
after recovering a bit from the shock of the sight. ``It's as if
that old tree was saying goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Our elation was short-lived. In removing the big hand last week,
apologetic tree people finished off the wrought iron fence and just
about destroyed the front garden: The tree didn't want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Unger, our real estate agent, always quick on the quip,
noted that trees usually fall next door, not on their own property
(which means the victim's insurance pays). And she understood my
removing the for-sale sign: ``The house probably wouldn't show too
well with that tree lying in the front yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the fall, a sweet fragrance wafted, even through
the house. But it was more than newly broken wood; it evoked the
sensory pleasure of fresh-sliced watermelon, a soothing,
life-affirming counterpoint to the death and decay so evident in
the tree that, like so many oaks in Atlanta, has been dying
inwardly for years and whose falling apart was hastened by
debilitating drought and yet another violent blow-down.
</P>
<P>
   The July 12 fall-down was, of course, a Peeples Street
happening, bringing out the best in neighbors who brought awe,
sympathy and chain saws. It could have been much worse, we all
agreed. And we told stories of other lost trees, the oak across the
street, the pecan in our neighborhood parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Too, the fall-down brought out the best in carriers of letters
and newspapers; they navigated the maze. They delivered.
</P>
<P>
   This loss has brought much new light to house and garden,
pleasing some plants but disconcerting others. Disconcerting too is
the view from my office window upstairs; where I used to view the
twin towers of oak, I now see one trunk and a gash.
</P>
<P>
   More light may be on the way, as the great but weakened oak
seems destined for a saw-down; no one wants to know what will
happen if the tree's second half slams a house. In some ways,
that's a sad prospect, as that old oak had been a good part of my
gardening life, providing shade and many sightings of wildlife,
including flitting birds and cavorting squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the downed half lay drying, it continued to attract
birds that, under cover of thick foliage, hopped and chirped and
dashed about wildly. Perhaps they were confused at the familiar
tree's unfamiliar location.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they were doing what the tree and those of us who love
it have been doing in a big way lately: saying goodbye.

 &HT;    The idea that veeps should excite is funnier than some
monologues
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, are
Yalies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got gentleman Cs at Yale where he was known to be something
of a party animal. Bush, at least, went straight through to get his
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who already is getting roasted on late-night talk shows
for his lack of excitement, could make Bush's partying look like a
society tea party.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney got booted out of college twice for failing grades before
he finally settled down and breezed through undergraduate and
graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound like the man David Letterman, the host of
CBS' late-night talk show, referred to when he joked, ``So now
we'll get some of that Dick Cheney-mania.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman joked, ``This might be nice to have someone in the
Oval Office whose arteries are hard, for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney suffered three mild heart attacks by the time he was 48.
He also had coronary bypass surgery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors now give Bush's new vice-presidential selection
a clean bill of health, Jay Leno, host of NBC's late-night talk
show, joked about Cheney's former heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the time it took me to walk out here, Dick Cheney had five
more heart attacks,'' Leno said.
</P>
<P>
   The old ``funny-as-a-heart-attack'' routine always has 'em
rolling in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be hard to make a living on Cheney jokes. The man
is not known as Mr. Excitement. He is known as Mr. Steady, Mr.
Reliable, Mr. Tough, Mr. Loyal, Mr. Brainy and Mr. Friend.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is a friend of the Bush family. He served in the
administration of President Bush, who also went to Yale. There's a
definite Yale connection here.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore went to Harvard where he made grades even worse than
Bush's gentleman Cs. Bush may have the loyal Yale vote wrapped up,
but Gore does not necessarily have the loyal Harvard vote in his
pocket. Bush also has a graduate degree from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Bush earlier said his vice-presidential choice would make ``your
eyes will light up with excitement.'' His choice of Cheney proves
how far removed Bush is from his party days at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who thought Bush should have chosen someone
with more excitement, few people can name anything exciting about
George Clinton, George Dallas, Dan Tompkins, Hannibal Hamlin,
Schuyler Colfax, Garret Hobart, Levi Morton, Charles Dawes, Charles
Curtis or Alben Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   These men were all vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidents seldom make a lot of difference either at the
polls or later in office. There are exceptions, of course, but the
job mostly requires staying out of the way and not doing anything
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My country has in its wisdom contrived for me to the most
insignificant office (the vice presidency) that ever the invention
of man contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do
neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and meet the
common fate,'' wrote John Adams, the nation's first vice president.
</P>
<P>
   American humorist Finley Peter Dunne wrote that the vice
presidency ``isn't a crime exactly. Ye can't be sint to jail f'r
it, but it's a kind iv disgrace. It's like writin' anonymous
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Texan John Nance Garner, who served two terms as vice president
under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, knew something about the
job. ``The vice presidency,'' Garner said, ``isn't worth a pitcher
of warm (bodily fluid).''
</P>
<P>
   Garner also said that once he left Washington, D.C., he would
never again set foot north of the Pecos River. He kept his word.
</P>
<P>
   If the public wants Mr. Excitement for vice president, Gore
might consider Bill Clinton as his running mate. Leno and Letterman
would love it.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: Mosquitoes in New York State have infected birds and people
with the West Nile Virus. Can the AIDS virus be spread by a
mosquito?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no evidence of such a thing ever happening, said
Kathryn Bina of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   When an insect bites a person, she added, it injects saliva, not
its own or a previously bitten person's or animal's blood. Thus,
even if the virus enters a mosquito, the insect doesn't become
infected and cannot transmit HIV to the next human or animal it
feeds on or bites.
</P>
<P>
   Since the onset of the HIV epidemic, that there has been concern
about transmission of the virus by biting and bloodsucking insects,
the CDC says in a fact sheet about HIV and AIDS prevention.
However, studies have shown no evidence of HIV transmission through
insects, even in areas where there are many cases of AIDS and large
populations of insects such as mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow fever and malaria, incidentally, can be transmitted
through the saliva of specific species of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A listed several U.S. presidents who were
related to other presidents. Although it wasn't mentioned, I
believe Jimmy Carter was related to Presidents William Henry
Harrison and Benjamin Harrison. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Facts About the Presidents'' doesn't mention this,
but it's possible that there was a relationship. Just not a close
one.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Harmon, spokeswoman for the Carter Presidential Center,
explained that Jimmy Carter's first Carter ancestor in America was
Thomas Carter, who came to Virginia about 1635. There is
``uncertainty among genealogists'' regarding his background, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Debrett's Peerage Limited believe that Thomas
Carter came from a prominent family with connections to British
royalty, Harmon said, adding: ``If this is the case, then later
generations would have been related to prominent Virginians such as
George Washington and the Harrison family. But we can't find if any
closer relationship has been established with the Harrisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Thomas, a historian at the Historic Preservation
Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and a
genealogy expert, said any link between Carter and the Harrisons is
``very distant and unproved in the final analysis, and should not
be overemphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   Q : Some media reports said Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia was
the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate, and others said
fifth-ranking. Which is correct, and what do the rankings refer to?
</P>
<P>
   A: The terms refer to elected leadership positions among the
Senate's Republican majority. No. 1 is Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi. No. 2 is Majority Whip Don Nickles of
Oklahoma. No. 3 is Conference Chair Connie Mack of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there's some disagreement about what comes next. On
his Web page, Policy Committee Chair Larry Craig of Idaho says he
has held the fourth-ranking position for years. A Coverdell aide
told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Coverdell's position _
secretary of the Republican Conference _ was considered the No. 5
position.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Washington consider conference secretary to be the No.
4 position, and most seem to have settled on No. 4 for Coverdell.
The Washington Post said Coverdell was expected to assume the
third-ranking post as conference chairman next year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before Paul Coverdell, who was the last U.S. senator to die
while in office?
</P>
<P>
   A: John Chafee (R-R.I.), 77, who served 23 years in the Senate,
was the last. He died Oct. 24, 1999, of heart failure. His son,
Lincoln Chafee, was named in November to serve out the remaining 14
months of his father's term. Lincoln Chafee, mayor of Warwick,
R.I., had been running to succeed his father, who previously had
announced plans to retire at the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the biographical information reported after Sen. Paul
Coverdell's death, there has been no mention of any religious
affiliation. Did he have such an affiliation?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was a Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have read that the only reasons organ donors are rejected
are because of HIV/AIDS and a form of hepatitis. I also have have
read that donors who are gay or suspected of being gay are rejected
automatically without regard to medical history and sexual activity
(or lack thereof). Organs from such donors are not even accepted
for tests. Is there any truth to this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each potential donor is looked at on a case-by-case basis,
said Jeff Al-Mashat of the Georgia Coalition on Donation and
LifeLink of Georgia. He added: ``Homosexual activity among males
falls under the category of high-risk behavior, according to the
CDC. That does not automatically rule someone out for potential
organ and/or tissue donation.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since 1937, the Social Security Administration has been
issuing numbers in the sequence of 3-2-4 digits. When will we run
out of individual numbers using that system?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration says the current numbering
system will provide enough new numbers for several generations into
the future _ this despite the fact that more than 400 million
numbers have been issued, with 6 million more issued a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was a child, the March of Dimes issued small cardboard
folders or cards that we used to collect dimes. It was a way to
raise money. What happened to that program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although ``dime'' is still part of the organization's name,
and it's forever etched in people's minds, the March of Dimes seeks
larger contributions now, said spokeswoman Michele Kling at the
organization's White Plains, N.Y., headquarters. The campaign to
collect dimes in cardboard folders and in cans has been replaced by
WalkAmerica an annual event staged in some 1,500 communities
nationwide. People of all ages participate and ask friends,
neighbors and co-workers to pledge a certain amount of money to the
March of Dimes in exchange for their walk.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the March of Dimes organization evolved from ``March
of Time,'' a popular newsreel in the 1930s, Kling said. Eddie
Cantor, a popular entertainer, suggested to President Franklin D.
Roosevelt the idea of a fund-raising campaign that involved asking
people to send a dime to the White House. People sent in millions
of dimes, and they became symbolic of the campaign and the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, March of Dimes initiated the first concerted efforts to
save babies from birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who won the Spingarn Medal at this year's NAACP convention?
</P>
<P>
   A: TV personality Oprah Winfrey was awarded, in absentia, the
NAACP's highest honor at its convention in Baltimore earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The medal, first given in 1914, has gone to such people as
retired Army Gen. Colin Powell, author Maya Angelou, Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall, actor Bill Cosby, publisher Earl Graves,
the Revs. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson, and Myrlie
Evers-Williams, former NAACP chair and widow of Medgar Evers, who
also was given the medal posthumously in 1963. Evers was an NAACP
field director in Mississippi who was shot to death in front of his
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Spingarn Medal is named for Joel Spingarn, NAACP treasurer
from 1919 to 1930 and its president from 1930 until his death in
1939.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the protocal for flying U.S. flags at half-staff?
</P>
<P>
   A: As stated in ``The Flag Book of the United States,'' the
practice of flying the U.S. flag at half-staff as a sign of
mourning and honor for the dead has created some confusion in the
public mind.
</P>
<P>
   A 1954 proclamation issued by President Eisenhower establishes
the number of days the flag should be lowered as a mark of respect
after the death of major officials: 30 days for a president or
ex-president; 10 days for a vice president, chief justice of the
United States or a retired chief justice, or the speaker of the
House of Representatives; from the day of death until burial of an
associate justice, a Cabinet member, a former vice president, the
governor of a state, territory or possession, and a number of
others specified by title.
</P>
<P>
   The flag also flies at half-staff in Washington on the day of
death and the following day for a U.S. senator or representative, a
territorial delegate, or the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico.
And it flies at half-staff in a state from the day the governor or
one of the state's U.S. senators dies until burial.
</P>
<P>
   There also are occasional special presidential proclamations
calling for the half-staffing of flags, as in 1968, when the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``half-mast,'' by the way, is sometimes used, but in
general refers to flags aboard ships.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have been hit by lightning three times in the past year
and a half. It got only a tree the first two times, but the last
time it struck our house and set it on fire. Is there anything we
can do to prevent this?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should consider installing one or more grounded lightning
rods above your home, said meteorologist Gregory Forbes of the
Weather Channel. While they aren't foolproof, they tend to offer
about a 45-degree cone of protection to objects below them, kind of
like an electrical ``umbrella'' or shield.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, you were more unlucky than you realize, Forbes
added. Not every lightnes. The longer-duration current allows
enough time for the contacted substance to heat up to flammable
temperatures _ similar to the principle by which the elements in
your toaster heat up as the electrical current flows through them _
except there's a lot more current.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Ralph Nader's status in getting on the ballot in all
the states?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We've got about 29 in the bag,'' said Laura Jones of the
Nader for President campaign headquarters in Washington. She added
that the campaign expects to have him on the ballot in 45 states by
election day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do the Phillips screw and screwdriver get their name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Henry F. Phillips, a Portland, Ore., businessman with a
penchant for gadgets, invented the screw with the recessed cross in
1933, as well as the screwdriver needed with it. They were designed
for use on automobile assembly lines to hold tighter than slotted
screws when driven by automated, high-torque screwdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by The Wall Street Journal in 1988, General Motors
Corp.'s Cadillac Division was the first to give his invention a try
in the 1930s. And, as the newspaper added, ``The Phillips screw
took hold and never let go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Screw Co. actually never produced the screws or
drivers. Instead, it licenses others to do that under its patents.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips died in 1958 at age 68.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the story on world's fairs? Are they held on a regular
schedule? When and where are the next ones?
</P>
<P>
   A: Under the rules of the Bureau of International Expositions,
which regulates world's fairs, only one major fair can be held each
decade, and it can last no longer than six months. But the BIE also
approves smaller events that can be held more often.
</P>
<P>
   The first world's fair was the Great Exhibition of 1851 in
London. More recently, fairs have been held in many places,
including Okinawa, Japan, in 1975; Knoxville, Tenn., 1982;
Vancouver, B.C., 1986; Brisbane, Australia, 1988; Osaka, Japan,
1990; Seville, Spain, 1992; and Lisbon, Portugal, 1998. An
exposition in Manila, Philippines, originally planned for 2002 was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Other current and future World's Fairs ``events'' listed on the
official Web site _ www.worldsfairs.com/events.html _ are the
Millennium Exhibition in Greenwich, England, all this year; the
Swiss National Exhibition in the Swiss cities of Biel-Bienne,
Murten-Morat, Neuchatel and Yverdon-les-Bains, May 3-Oct. 29, 2001;
Floriade, the once-each decade international garden show, at
Gemeente Haarlemmermeer, Netherlands, April 1-Oct. 15, 2002; and
Seto 2005, an expo in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan, March 25-Sept.
25, 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Information: World's Fair, Inc., P.O. Box 339, Corte Madera, CA
94976 (415-461-6695).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The label on a bottle of J&AMP;B scotch says ``By Appointment to
Her Majesty the Queen.'' What is this all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're thinking Queen Elizabeth II might enjoy the occasional
wee drop? Could be, but not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   That statement is a ``Royal Warrant.'' The queen's Web site _
www.royal.gov.uk _ says warrants are a ``mark of recognition that
tradesmen are regular suppliers of goods and services to the Royal
households.'' They are granted to people or companies that have
regularly supplied goods or services for a minimum of three
consecutive years to the queen; the duke of Edinburgh; Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother; or the prince of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Warrant holders represent a large cross-section of British trade
and industry (and a few foreign names as well), ranging from dry
cleaners to fishmongers, agricultural machinery to computer
software. There are about 800 Royal Warrant holders and about 1,100
Royal Warrants (some holders have more than one warrant).
</P>
<P>
   About J&AMP;B: If online, look at this site _
www.royal.gov.uk/faq/warrants/qlist.html _ and under the J list
you'll find Justerini &AMP; Brooks Limited, Wine Merchants, London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Years ago, we used to attend the pageant ``Unto These Hills''
in Cherokee, N.C., every summer. I haven't seen it advertised or
mentioned lately. Has it been disbanded?
</P>
<P>
   A: The outdoor drama is by no means disbanded. It's in the midst
of its 51st summer season in a 2,800-seat outdoor theater in
western North Carolina. The season runs through Aug. 26.
Information: For tickets and dates, call 828-497-2111. General

</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to Robert Chambers, the so-called ``preppy
killer'' in New York? Is he out of prison?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. He is still incarcerated at the Auburn Correctional
Facility in New York. He is serving a sentence of 5-to-15 years in
the strangling death of Jennifer Levin in August 1986 after being
convicted of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the New York Board of Paroles said Chambers
will not see the parole board again before December. The board
denied his bids for freedom in 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers got his nickname because he was a prep school graduate.
His victim also attended exclusive schools. Chambers initially
claimed he accidentally killed Levin, 18, during ``rough sex'' in
Central Park. In 1988, he interrupted jury deliberations in his
second-degree murder trial to plead guilty to first-degree
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former Atlanta Brave Denny Neagle was traded by the
Cincinnati Reds to the New York Yankees for four prospects,
including Double A third baseman and Michigan starting quarterback
Drew Henson. Is Henson one of those people who plays both sports?
</P>
<P>
   A: Henson is indeed a two-sport star. After he was traded from
the Yankees, Henson said the deal may force him to decide between
baseball and football.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who saw Henson as a top prospect since drafting him
out of high school in 1998, dealt the 20-year-old after he refused
to commit to one sport. As reported by the Associated Press,
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was said to have offered Henson
as much as $3 million to stick with baseball, although Henson said
no dollar figure was floated. ``I am disappointed that I could not
stay with the (Yankees) organization,'' Henson told reporters after
the trade. He added that Steinbrenner was prepared to make him a
Yankee ``for life,'' but he wasn't prepared to make that
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are high at Michigan for Henson to follow in the
footsteps of Tom Brady, who guided the Wolverines to a 10-2 record
last season. With Henson as the starting quarterback for his junior
season, the Wolverines are the preseason favorite to win the Big
Ten.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ It struck me, in fact, that Harry Potter bears
a greater resemblance to Anne of Green Gables. Both children are
orphans. Both have an undeniable personal magnetism. Both, enduring
cruelty and emotional neglect during childhood, enter a whole new
world at age 11 _ Anne to the enchanting Prince Edwards Island,
Harry to the enchanted Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.
(McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ Both George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick
Cheney, are Yalies. Bush got gentleman Cs at Yale where he was
known to be something of a party animal. Bush, at least, went
straight through to get his degree. Cheney, who already is getting
roasted on late-night talk shows for his lack of excitement, could
make Bush's partying look like a society tea party. (Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED

<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ Now that the feds have noticed that it's
dangerous to drive and talk on a cellular phone at the same time
(well, duh), why not give people who jabber while driving a
competitive outlet to show off that skill by holding a special Cell
Phone Olympics? (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   NEWS-QUESTIONS _ Q&AMP;A on the news, in two takes. (Bessonette,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (EDS: Moving on l (Lifestyle) and a

</P>
<P>
   HOME AND GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   PERGOLAS _ When Michele Burns wants to savor her garden, she
simply looks up. In spring, wisteria drips its heady scent over her
outdoor dinner table and not long after, pink roses take center
stage. In summer, lush foliage forms a cool canopy for sundown
suppers.
</P>
<P>
   Structures like Burns' arbor are cropping up in back yards
everywhere as homeowners spend more time outdoors. Arbors and
pergolas lend not only shady retreats for relaxing and entertaining
but also the kind of structure, focal points and transitonal areas
that yards and gardens so often need. (Flanders, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   GARDENING-LIFE _ Within seconds of one another, I heard two
sounds that rose above the roll of thunder and splatter of rain:
Crrrraaaack! WHUUUMP! In the kitchen of our 110-year-old house, I
felt a thud, but it did not begin to prepare me for what lay in
front of the house. The big old oak next door, a tree that probably
predates the Civil War, had lost half of itself; brushing the top
of our house, crashing into the wrought-iron fence, spreading
across the driveway, reaching even the house beyond ours. Minutes
after the fall, a sweet fragrance wafted, through the house. But,
it was more than newly-broken wood; it evoked the sensory pleasure
of fresh-sliced watermelon, a soothing, life-affirming counterpoint
to the death and decay so evident in the tree that, like so many
oaks in Atlanta, has been dying inwardly for years and whose
falling apart was hastened by debilitating drought and yet another
violent blowdown. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH PHOTOS.
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSET-DOORS _ Few things make a bedroom seem shabbier than a
beat-up sliding closet door that's hanging crooked or that won't
open and close smoothly. A reasonably handy person can correct most
minor closet door problems fairly easily. And if the door is too
far gone or too ugly to save, replacing a closet door is also a
simple project. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 26.

   KITCHEN-CONVERSATIONS _ Chicken on the grill has never been a
favorite of mine. It's hard to cook properly, often served under
done or dried to the bone. But a little beer has changed my mind.
Pop a top on a can of beer, drink half of it (or pour it out) and
lower the cavity of a whole fryer over it. Place the can/bird over
indirect heat on the grill for little more than an hour and you'll
get the best bird from the grill you've ever tasted. The skin will
be crisp _ the meat steamed from the inside from the beer.(Walker,

   Q: Mosquitoes in New York State have infected birds and people
with the West Nile Virus. Can the AIDS virus be spread by a
mosquito?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no evidence of such a thing ever happening, said
Kathryn Bina of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   When an insect bites a person, she added, it injects saliva, not
its own or a previously bitten person's or animal's blood. Thus,
even if the virus enters a mosquito, the insect doesn't become
infected and cannot transmit HIV to the next human or animal it
feeds on or bites.
</P>
<P>
   Since the onset of the HIV epidemic, that there has been concern
about transmission of the virus by biting and bloodsucking insects,
the CDC says in a fact sheet about HIV and AIDS prevention.
However, studies have shown no evidence of HIV transmission through
insects, even in areas where there are many cases of AIDS and large
populations of insects such as mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow fever and malaria, incidentally, can be transmitted
through the saliva of specific species of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A listed several U.S. presidents who were
related to other presidents. Although it wasn't mentioned, I
believe Jimmy Carter was related to Presidents William Henry
Harrison and Benjamin Harrison. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Facts About the Presidents'' doesn't mention this,
but it's possible that there was a relationship. Just not a close
one.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Harmon, spokeswoman for the Carter Presidential Center,
explained that Jimmy Carter's first Carter ancestor in America was
Thomas Carter, who came to Virginia about 1635. There is
``uncertainty among genealogists'' regarding his background, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Debrett's Peerage Limited believe that Thomas
Carter came from a prominent family with connections to British
royalty, Harmon said, adding: ``If this is the case, then later
generations would have been related to prominent Virginians such as
George Washington and the Harrison family. But we can't find if any
closer relationship has been established with the Harrisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Thomas, a historian at the Historic Preservation
Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and a
genealogy expert, said any link between Carter and the Harrisons is
``very distant and unproved in the final analysis, and should not
be overemphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   Q : Some media reports said Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia was
the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate, and others said
fifth-ranking. Which is correct, and what do the rankings refer to?
</P>
<P>
   A: The terms refer to elected leadership positions among the
Senate's Republican majority. No. 1 is Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi. No. 2 is Majority Whip Don Nickles of
Oklahoma. No. 3 is Conference Chair Connie Mack of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there's some disagreement about what comes next. On
his Web page, Policy Committee Chair Larry Craig of Idaho says he
has held the fourth-ranking position for years. A Coverdell aide
told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Coverdell's position _
secretary of the Republican Conference _ was considered the No. 5
position.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Washington consider conference secretary to be the No.
4 position, and most seem to have settled on No. 4 for Coverdell.
The Washington Post said Coverdell was expected to assume the
third-ranking post as conference chairman next year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before Paul Coverdell, who was the last U.S. senator to die
while in office?
</P>
<P>
   A: John Chafee (R-R.I.), 77, who served 23 years in the Senate,
was the last. He died Oct. 24, 1999, of heart failure. His son,
Lincoln Chafee, was named in November to serve out the remaining 14
months of his father's term. Lincoln Chafee, mayor of Warwick,
R.I., had been running to succeed his father, who previously had
announced plans to retire at the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the biographical information reported after Sen. Paul
Coverdell's death, there has been no mention of any religious
affiliation. Did he have such an affiliation?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was a Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have read that the only reasons organ donors are rejected
are because of HIV/AIDS and a form of hepatitis. I also have have
read that donors who are gay or suspected of being gay are rejected
automatically without regard to medical history and sexual activity
(or lack thereof). Organs from such donors are not even accepted
for tests. Is there any truth to this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each potential donor is looked at on a case-by-case basis,
said Jeff Al-Mashat of the Georgia Coalition on Donation and
LifeLink of Georgia. He added: ``Homosexual activity among males
falls under the category of high-risk behavior, according to the
CDC. That does not automatically rule someone out for potential
organ and/or tissue donation.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since 1937, the Social Security Administration has been
issuing numbers in the sequence of 3-2-4 digits. When will we run
out of individual numbers using that system?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration says the current numbering
system will provide enough new numbers for several generations into
the future _ this despite the fact that more than 400 million
numbers have been issued, with 6 million more issued a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was a child, the March of Dimes issued small cardboard
folders or cards that we used to collect dimes. It was a way to
raise money. What happened to that program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although ``dime'' is still part of the organization's name,
and it's forever etched in people's minds, the March of Dimes seeks
larger contributions now, said spokeswoman Michele Kling at the
organization's White Plains, N.Y., headquarters. The campaign to
collect dimes in cardboard folders and in cans has been replaced by
WalkAmerica an annual event staged in some 1,500 communities
nationwide. People of all ages participate and ask friends,
neighbors and co-workers to pledge a certain amount of money to the
March of Dimes in exchange for their walk.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the March of Dimes organization evolved from ``March
of Time,'' a popular newsreel in the 1930s, Kling said. Eddie
Cantor, a popular entertainer, suggested to President Franklin D.
Roosevelt the idea of a fund-raising campaign that involved asking
people to send a dime to the White House. People sent in millions
of dimes, and they became symbolic of the campaign and the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, March of Dimes initiated the first concerted efforts to
save babies from birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who won the Spingarn Medal at this year's NAACP convention?
</P>
<P>
   A: TV personality Oprah Winfrey was awarded, in absentia, the
NAACP's highest honor at its convention in Baltimore earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The medal, first given in 1914, has gone to such people as
retired Army Gen. Colin Powell, author Maya Angelou, Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall, actor Bill Cosby, publisher Earl Graves,
the Revs. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson, and Myrlie
Evers-Williams, former NAACP chair and widow of Medgar Evers, who
also was given the medal posthumously in 1963. Evers was an NAACP
field director in Mississippi who was shot to death in front of his
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Spingarn Medal is named for Joel Spingarn, NAACP treasurer
from 1919 to 1930 and its president from 1930 until his death in
1939.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the protocal for flying U.S. flags at half-staff?
</P>
<P>
   A: As stated in ``The Flag Book of the United States,'' the
practice of flying the U.S. flag at half-staff as a sign of
mourning and honor for the dead has created some confusion in the
public mind.
</P>
<P>
   A 1954 proclamation issued by President Eisenhower establishes
the number of days the flag should be lowered as a mark of respect
after the death of major officials: 30 days for a pme it struck our
house and set it on fire. Is there anything we can do to prevent
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should consider installing one or more grounded lightning
rods above your home, said meteorologist Gregory Forbes of the
Weather Channel. While they aren't foolproof, they tend to offer
about a 45-degree cone of protection to objects below them, kind of
like an electrical ``umbrella'' or shield.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, you were more unlucky than you realize, Forbes
added. Not every lightning bolt is capable of starting a fire.
Some, like the one that hit your house, have a longer-duration flow
of current within the lightning channel that can start fires. The
longer-duration current allows enough time for the contacted
substance to heat up to flammable temperatures _ similar to the
principle by which the elements in your toaster heat up as the
electrical current flows through them _ except there's a lot more
current.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Ralph Nader's status in getting on the ballot in all
the states?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We've got about 29 in the bag,'' said Laura Jones of the
Nader for President campaign headquarters in Washington. She added
that the campaign expects to have him on the ballot in 45 states by
election day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do the Phillips screw and screwdriver get their name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Henry F. Phillips, a Portland, Ore., businessman with a
penchant for gadgets, invented the screw with the recessed cross in
1933, as well as the screwdriver needed with it. They were designed
for use on automobile assembly lines to hold tighter than slotted
screws when driven by automated, high-torque screwdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by The Wall Street Journal in 1988, General Motors
Corp.'s Cadillac Division was the first to give his invention a try
in the 1930s. And, as the newspaper added, ``The Phillips screw
took hold and never let go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Screw Co. actually never produced the screws or
drivers. Instead, it licenses others to do that under its patents.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips died in 1958 at age 68.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the story on world's fairs? Are they held on a regular
schedule? When and where are the next ones?
</P>
<P>
   A: Under the rules of the Bureau of International Expositions,
which regulates world's fairs, only one major fair can be held each
decade, and it can last no longer than six months. But the BIE also
approves smaller events that can be held more often.
</P>
<P>
   The first world's fair was the Great Exhibition of 1851 in
London. More recently, fairs have been held in many places,
including Okinawa, Japan, in 1975; Knoxville, Tenn., 1982;
Vancouver, B.C., 1986; Brisbane, Australia, 1988; Osaka, Japan,
1990; Seville, Spain, 1992; and Lisbon, Portugal, 1998. An
exposition in Manila, Philippines, originally planned for 2002 was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Other current and future World's Fairs ``events'' listed on the
official Web site _ www.worldsfairs.com/events.html _ are the
Millennium Exhibition in Greenwich, England, all this year; the
Swiss National Exhibition in the Swiss cities of Biel-Bienne,
Murten-Morat, Neuchatel and Yverdon-les-Bains, May 3-Oct. 29, 2001;
Floriade, the once-each decade international garden show, at
Gemeente Haarlemmermeer, Netherlands, April 1-Oct. 15, 2002; and
Seto 2005, an expo in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan, March 25-Sept.
25, 2005.
</P>

   Information: World's Fair, Inc., P.O. Box 339, Corte Madera, CA
94976 (415-461-6695).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The label on a bottle of J&AMP;B scotch says ``By Appointment to
Her Majesty the Queen.'' What is this all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're thinking Queen Elizabeth II might enjoy the occasional
wee drop? Could be, but not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   That statement is a ``Royal Warrant.'' The queen's Web site _
www.royal.gov.uk _ says warrants are a ``mark of recognition that
tradesmen are regular suppliers of goods and services to the Royal
households.'' They are granted to people or companies that have
regularly supplied goods or services for a minimum of three
consecutive years to the queen; the duke of Edinburgh; Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother; or the prince of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Warrant holders represent a large cross-section of British trade
and industry (and a few foreign names as well), ranging from dry
cleaners to fishmongers, agricultural machinery to computer
software. There are about 800 Royal Warrant holders and about 1,100
Royal Warrants (some holders have more than one warrant).

   About J&AMP;B: If online, look at this site _
www.royal.gov.uk/faq/warrants/qlist.html _ and under the J list
you'll find Justerini &AMP; Brooks Limited, Wine Merchants, London.

<P>
   Q: Years ago, we used to attend the pageant ``Unto These Hills''
in Cherokee, N.C., every summer. I haven't seen it advertised or
mentioned lately. Has it been disbanded?
</P>
<P>
   A: The outdoor drama is by no means disbanded. It's in the midst
of its 51st summer season in a 2,800-seat outdoor theater in
western North Carolina. The season runs through Aug. 26.
Information: For tickets and dates, call 828-497-2111. General
information online: www.dnet.net/(tilde)cheratt/unto.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to Robert Chambers, the so-called ``preppy
killer'' in New York? Is he out of prison?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. He is still incarcerated at the Auburn Correctional
Facility in New York. He is serving a sentence of 5-to-15 years in
the strangling death of Jennifer Levin in August 1986 after being
convicted of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the New York Board of Paroles said Chambers
will not see the parole board again before December. The board
denied his bids for freedom in 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers got his nickname because he was a prep school graduate.
His victim also attended exclusive schools. Chambers initially
claimed he accidentally killed Levin, 18, during ``rough sex'' in
Central Park. In 1988, he interrupted jury deliberations in his
second-degree murder trial to plead guilty to first-degree
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former Atlanta Brave Denny Neagle was traded by the
Cincinnati Reds to the New York Yankees for four prospects,
including Double A third baseman and Michigan starting quarterback
Drew Henson. Is Henson one of those people who plays both sports?
</P>
<P>
   A: Henson is indeed a two-sport star. After he was traded from
the Yankees, Henson said the deal may force him to decide between
baseball and football.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who saw Henson as a top prospect since drafting him
out of high school in 1998, dealt the 20-year-old after he refused
to commit to one sport. As reported by the Associated Press,
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was said to have offered Henson
as much as $3 million to stick with baseball, although Henson said
no dollar figure was floated. ``I am disappointed that I could not
stay with the (Yankees) organization,'' Henson told reporters a

 &HT;    Tis' the season for ozone, haze and political hot air
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ It's almost been too hot to think and too hazy
to see.
</P>
<P>
   We have five seasons in East Texas: football, winter, spring,
summer and ozone. We are now in ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like one thing always does manage to break through
whatever artificial or natural barriers that might surround us,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting to hear the clarion call for the $1.8 million
in ``savings'' the city of Longview is claiming during the last
year. Oops, make that cost avoidance, or is it donations?
</P>
<P>
   Can you make out the new buzz? You have to pedal fast to keep up
with these great minds. By my calculations, once the city formally
accepts property that has been donated for new soccer fields, city
staff may get another break. Similarly to Heritage Plaza _ a
project originated outside city hall and funded through private
donations that represented $500,000 of the touted $1.8 million _
we'll apparently be able to count the value of the athletic fields
donation as savings, or cost avoidance or whatever the most
politically expedient term happens to be at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   On a wider political front, the fax machine has been spewing
forth some intriguing information from candidates for area
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago we received a one-page fax trumpeting a
news conference to be held by Noble Willingham at which he would
announce his new energy policy, the ``Gas Price Stabilization
Act.'' Willingham is the GOP challenger to U.S. Rep. Max Sandlin,
who represents the First Congressional District of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil for debt'' it said. The ``Gas Price Stabilization Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Our reporter showed up at the appointed time as did one from the
Tyler paper, but Gregg County GOP headquarters was locked up tight,
not a soul there. Phone calls to the number listed on the
announcement (not the local
</P>
<P>
   GOP number) were answered by a recording saying the number had
been changed to another, but that the new number wasn't working
yet. A few days later we did hear from a party spokesman that they
had sent a fax to us canceling the event. Apparently both
newspapers' fax machines were on the blink at the same time. I
blame it on the ozone.
</P>
<P>
   More political haze followed:
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, we received another faxed notice, almost a
twin to the previous one, about a break-through wonderful new
energy policy, the ``Gas Price Stabilization Act.'' Same quotes and
everything. Same thing Noble, best known for his role in the TV
series ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' apparently would have unveiled if
he had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   One slight change, though. This time the candidate's name on the
letterhead was Jon Newton, who is running against Congressman Ralph
Hall of the Fourth Congressional District. Newton showed up.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still wondering how he got the energy policy and Noble
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Turning toward the rest of our ozone-challenged state, I firmly
believe that Al Gore might be the best thing that could happen to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Did you see how fast our projected budget surplus grew the
closer the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee got to San
Antonio?
</P>
<P>
   By golly, let's bring that boy back out here a few more times.
</P>
<P>
   It won't hurt Bush; he'll win Texas anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander's calculator was
shooting sparks refiguring an ever-growing surplus of money for the
newest state budget. That surplus went from $1.1 billion to $1.4
billion in just days, since news of a projected
</P>
<P>
   shortfall hit the streets and the Democrats started howling _
and George W. Bush began to be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore came to visit more often, we could end up being able to
afford a computer for every school child in Texas. Teachers could
have their health insurance and retirement all fixed up. Taxes
would plummet. We could maybe help pay for a summer lunch program
for hungry kids in Longview that lasts past June.
</P>
<P>
   What do those several thousand children who took part in the
nutrition program do for food the rest of the summer anyway? Did
anyone else wonder about that?
</P>
<P>
   Season's greetings.

Complaints Director Mary Dunlap said her investigation into John
Smart's Oct. 6, 1998, killing _ he was shot more than 15 times by
police as he tried to flee in his car _ had been repeatedly delayed

165,000-acre military base, including the Hacienda, to the Army in

   TEN-ANNA-KOURNIKOVA (Stanford, Calif.) _ Just call it
Anna-proofing. There is a large window at the main entrance to the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium behind which the press room is located.
Last year, when Anna Kournikova made her Bank of the West Classic
debut, the area in front of that window was home to a veritable
throng of fans _ OK, men _ with their noses pressed against the
glass, knocking and waving as the Russian teen made her postmatch
remarks. This year, there is a small wooden picket fence extending
out about 5 feet away from the window and a security guard manning
the location to ensure against a repeat of Anna-mania. By MICHELLE
SMITH.

   BBO-HALL-OF-FAME (Cooperstown, N.Y.) _ Consider all the negative
axioms you hear about baseball stadiums today. And when you have
heard enough, come here, to Cooperstown. Come to its signature
stadium, Doubleday Field, where baseball is so revered that no one
would dare to complain about anything. By TIM REYNOLDS.

   FBN-NINERS (Stockton, Calif.) _ Nearly half an hour after
practice, with most of the 49ers in the locker room, Jerry Rice
runs 40-yard sprints and Terrell Owens runs pass routes, catching
balls from quarterback Jeff Garcia. ``These guys want to be nothing
less than the best,'' said George Stewart, in his first year as the

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Let's play Republican role

around. If Dick Cheney were nominated for president, he'd be too
conservative, have too bad a heart, be too aged for his 59 years,
and be too highly paid an oil-company executive ever to get
elected. So if a Cheney/Bush ticket would be a complete loser, why
is a Bush/Cheney ticket any better? By ROB MORSE.

   MOSCOW _ The menace returns, like clockwork, as soon as the
weather warms in Moscow, gripping Russia's capital in panicky
bursts of conversation about who has found the small, handwritten
note that marks you as the next victim of the cold water creep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait in dread. It's like a mad serial killer stalking town.
You never know when you and your family are next,'' says Marina
Kazakova, the 73-year-old mother of one of my Russian friends.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer the hot water in this city of 10 million is turned
off, district by district, block by block, for almost one month at
a time, so that workers can examine the steel pipes responsible for
transporting people's bath water, dishwater and drinking water and
replace them if they are leaky or rusty.
</P>
<P>
   It's an annual tradition that I remember from my first visit to
the Soviet Union in 1986. Then, I thought it was an exotic learning
experience, and after my 21-day trip, I went back to my parent's
home in Oklahoma City for a long, hot soak in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   The fun evaporated on my next trip, when I studied at a
university in the Russian Far East in 1991. At that time, my
Russian roommate and I would come home from classes, stand outside
our dormitory and count which floors the light was on. When there
was light on our floor, there would be hot water. When there
wasn't, Rita and I would walk over to a friend's home for the
evening, cursing the sadistic bureaucrat who had flipped the switch
again.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, names my friends hurl at the head of Moscow's
utility system, the department in charge of heat, electricity gas
and sewage, when they wake up that fateful morning to only cold
water are strong enough to make your hair stand on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clock that devil for me,'' my friend Natasha Petrovna told me
when I told her who was going to meet last week. ``Tell him he's a
murderer. Last summer both my husband and my grandbaby got sick
taking cold showers!''
</P>
<P>
   When I walked into his office, Mikhail Lapir, the 86-year-old
head of the city's public works, hardly resembled the horned
misanthrope we imagined him to be. The sprightly engineer looks
more like a trim Santa Claus, except for the drawn look of remorse
on his face that tells a listener that he actually does feel your
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine walking up the stairs to your apartment and your
neighbors giving you looks that pierce your heart. For those 23
days, how can I relax?'' he says, sighing deeply in his cavernous
office in downtown Moscow that is adorned with nothing except an
equally enormous map of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want explanations when they long for a hot
bath,'' he says. ``They complain, and complain. It's a cry from the
soul, and after hot, sweaty weekends, it becomes a cry from other
parts of the body, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's heat and hot water system came on line in 1924, as part
of Stalin's push to modernize life in Russia. After the dictator
died, few upgrades to the system were made.
</P>
<P>
   Today, like then, most of the city's hot water comes from the
town's electric power stations. The steam used to run the
electricity-producing turbines is redirected to heat water, which
is then piped through a 9,000-mile-long centralized pipe system to
people's kitchen and bathroom faucets. The hot water travels at
near-boiling temperatures, which requires a whole section to be
turned off and cooled before any work can be done.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't defend the system, Lapir, who started work at
the city utility company more than 50 years ago, knows it inside
and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a model of collectivization when it was built,'' says
the director, whose clear, blue eyes matched the color of his tie,
which was given to him by his colleagues on his last birthday. ``It
was, and still is, highly efficient and very cheap. But it's also a
real monster, when there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat and water system was built very quickly, with little
thought given to the length of time needed for maintenance, he
said. Moscow only has one diagnostic tool, an expensive
computerized piecnd Thereafter.

thought given to the length of time needed for maintenance, he
said. Moscow only has one diagnostic tool, an expensive
computerized piece of machinery, that allows workers to locate
leaky sections of pipe without turning the system off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same system heats radiators and buildings in the
winter, the only time to turn off the system is the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people would really have my head if this system broke down
in the depths of winter. People actually would die then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of living a quiet life in retirement, like other men his
age, Lapir says he won't stop working until he gets a new heating
system installed around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a dream,'' he says. ``I dream that some day we won't
have to switch it off for so long. That would make me feel my life
was worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   I've been in Russia long enough to know that change doesn't
happen very fast, but at least I'll escape the cold water this
year. Lapir let it slip that my neighborhood's hot water would be
turned off the first week of August, and I've re-arranged my
vacation accordingly.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Bands of heavily armed guerrillas and
right-wing paramilitary groups roam the countryside, warring
against each other over ideology and control of the illegal drug
trade. Rural peasants, caught in the middle, have fled by the
thousands, their homes destroyed, businesses ruined, their children
lured or taken at gunpoint to join the groups of fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The large cities appear tranquil, but with Colombia suffering
the highest rate of kidnapping in the world, pedestrians hurry
along, never entirely sure they are safe. The rich hire bodyguards
and ride in armor-plated vehicles, while many in the middle class
hope to flee the country. The poor get by as best they can.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is a nation living in fear and uncertainty. Peace talks
to end the 36-year-old civil war are underway, but so far there has
been little progress.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is suffering through its worst downturn in 70 years,
with official unemployment topping 20 percent and unofficial
estimates doubling that number.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana has launched a bold new
initiative called ``Plan Colombia,'' which hinges on $1.3 billion
in American aid, most of it destined for military hardware to fight
the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts about the plan abound within Colombia. Critics fear
it will only trigger an escalation of the war, along with a new
wave of internal displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the problems, average Colombians go on with their lives,
looking for work, struggling to hold onto their jobs, hoping for a
better future for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Few are untouched by the country's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The following stories give brief glimpses into the fears that
grip many Colombians' lives.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families arrive each Friday afternoon,
standing quietly in the dim hallway of Radio Nacional de Colombia,
faces etched with sadness and tension.
</P>
<P>
   Most clutch handwritten notes they will soon read into the
microphone, while others cluster in a corner or near the stairway,
whispering among themselves and scribbling words of hope tinged
with pain.
</P>
<P>
   Torn by civil war, drug trafficking and a terrible crime wave,
Colombia has the highest kidnapping rate in the world, with nearly
3,000 reported victims last year.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has become so common in this nation of 39 million that
several radio stations now broadcast messages each week from
families hoping to reach their missing loved-ones. Many may never
know if the messages are heard, but they come anyway because they
don't know what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps because you feel you are doing something,'' said
Deisy Gonzalez Castillo, 30, a Bogota lawyer whose uncle was
kidnapped in April. ``We never thought this would happen to us. It
leaves you so upset. You can't eat or sleep and you get
bad-tempered. You just want to go outside and run away.''
</P>
<P>
   While the drug war and the civil war have paralyzed parts of
Colombia, the wave of kidnapping _ an average of eight people per
day _ has touched nearly everyone here: rich and poor, rural
peasants and the urban middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a business,'' said Olga Lucia Gomez, a
psychologist who works with ``Pais Libre'' _ ``Free Country'' _ a
group that aids families of the victims and has organized a
national campaign against kidnapping. ``But the impact is brutal.
It's like ripples in a pond when you throw in a stone. The victim
is damaged, his family is damaged, their friends are damaged and
all of society is damaged. It breaks down trust and creates
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the crimes are committed by Colombia's leftist
guerrilla and right-wing paramilitary groups, which use the ransoms
to fund their armies. Common criminals also nab people, often
selling their victims to the guerrillas or paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ransoms range from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of
thousands. Families are forced to sell their homes and businesses
and borrow every peso they can find, while businesses are extorted
for the return of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Most shocking to many is that of the 2,945 kidnap victims in
1999, 7 percent were children.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's government has recently made the kidnapping of
children a major issue in its talks with the leading guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The
group's leaders have denied taking children, but defend kidnapping
as a legitimate means to fund their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Deisy Castillo's family is typical of the victims. Her uncle,
Silvio Castillo, wasn't a guerilla or a paramilitary. He wasn't
political at all, and he certainly wasn't rich.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver, he was on a routine trip from Bogota to Medellin
to deliver auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jeep cut him off and men got out with guns,'' said Deisy
Castillo. ``Another driver who was ahead of him saw it happen. We
have heard nothing from Silvio or the kidnappers since he was
taken. They never found his truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Families often wait for months before a ransom note arrives _ a
tactic that increases the pressure, leaving them desperate and
willing to pay whatever it takes to recover their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Many report their loss to the National Police, but often little
can be done but wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't express the pain you're feeling, and how can you
expect anyone to understand?'' said Sylvia Lopez, 36, whose brother
Jorge disappeared in May 1999 while driving a delivery route in
Bogota. ``These kidnappers are people without hearts or
consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are happy moments when families are reunited. Just
recently, the radio station was buoyed by visits from four released
victims, who came to encourage the families with loved ones still
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept me with a rope around my neck and my hands tied, all
day and all night,'' said Nidia Velazco, who was held for six
months. ``It was the FARC. They didn't treat me badly, but they
watched us and kept us tied up even when we went to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government estimates that in 1999 68 percent of
kidnapping victims were released after ransoms were paid, 26
percent were rescued and 6 percent were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Velazco was kept in a house in the mountains outside Bogota with
several other victims. Meeting with the wives of two kidnapped men
after her release, she gave them encouraging details, describing
their health, eating habits and long hair from months without
visiting a barber.
</P>
<P>
   The wives of the missing men listened intently to every detail,
often laughing and making jokes. But the warm scene was etched with
uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, the psychologist, worries that the crime has become so
common that Colombians now simply accept it as a normal part of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks it's just the rich who are the victims, but
it's not,'' she said. ``They come from every walk of life. The
worst part is there is no one to answer for this. It leads to a
lack of trust, to a perception that there are enemies everywhere.
The social fabric is torn apart. How can you have a society when
people can't trust each other?''
</P>
<P>
   Deisy Castillo's life has been changed since her uncle was
nabbed. Once optimistic, a freshly-minted law school graduate, now
she struggles to find hope. She has no job, nor does her husband,
also a lawyer. They get by doing legal work for friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the kidnapping, the tough times have become edged with
fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let my children outside to play,'' she said. ``I'm
scared for them. We're scared to own anything because we fear
someone will come for us if they think we have things. If we could
leave Colombia we would. There's no future here for my children.''

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona remembers the day clearly _ a
Tuesday in July of 1998 _ when the sound of the trucks echoed
through her small town of Mapiripan(CQ), a remote village 200 miles
southeast of Colombia's capital of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks carried about 100 armed members of a paramilitary
group, who had come looking for leftist sympathizers _ families
whose sons or fathers might be supporters of the Marxist rebels
trying to overthrow the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rounded up everybody at 5:30 a.m.,'' said Barahona, 60, a
widowed mother of five who ran a small restaurant and store. ``They
stuck a machine gun in my chest and asked where the guerrillas and
the guns were. I told them I didn't know anything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   With no police and no army soldiers around, the paramilitaries
had their way in remote Mapiripan for weeks. Suspected informants
and sympathizers were rounded up, questioned and beaten, their
hands tied behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona, her children and the rest of the townspeople were told
to stay in their homes with the windows closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were torturing and killing people,'' she recalled. ``We
couldn't even count the number of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In war-torn Colombia, Barahona's story is all too common.
Colombia's military has ceded huge swaths of the countryside to the
guerrillas or right-wing paramilitary gangs. Both groups sweep
through rural towns looking for recruits and enemies, conducting a
reign of terror funded by tribute they collect from Colombia's drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle are poor campesinos like Barahona, most of
whom hide any political opinions they might have in a desperate bid
for survival. Whipsawed between the warring parties, many wind up
fleeing the countryside, heading for the larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   Official government figures list more than 1 million Colombians
as displaced from their homes in the past five years, but human
rights advocates say the number of ``desplazados'' _ the displaced
_ is closer to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has spread over the last two years to areas not
traditionally affected,'' said Albeiro Salazar, a researcher at the
Center for Investigation and Education, a human rights group based
in Bogota. ``The guerrillas and the paramilitaries want the civil
population to take sides, and they enforce their will through
massacres and torture. Now we have whole regions of the countryside
that are depopulated.''
</P>
<P>
   While the poor have fled within Colombia's borders, the
better-off have fled the country altogether. As Colombia's woes
have grown, they have formed long lines outside foreign embassies,
applying for visas to move to Spain, Canada, the United States,
Costa Rica and other nations. There are fears that Colombia is
losing its professional class of doctors, lawyers, engineers and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   But for the poor like Barahona, the only escape is a bus ticket
to Bogota, Medellin or the like. Hoping to find work in the
relative peace of the cities, many stumble from the crisis of the
countryside into lives of poverty and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Few can find work; Colombia is now enduring its worst economic
crisis of the last 70 years, with official unemployment topping 20
percent and unofficial estimates ranging up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to living in the city,'' Barahona said recently
as she stood aimlessly outside a building she has occupied with
more than 100 other displaced people. ``I feel trapped here. Where
I lived before, I knew everybody. Here, the rich people walk past
and insult us. We want to work and get on with our lives, but there
are no jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barahona now spends her days looking for work, applying for
government assistance and hoping something will happen. Her nights
are spent reliving the terror of the past few years, longing for a
home she fears she will never see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second of August, 1998, the guerrillas arrived and
there was a terrible shoot-out,'' she said. ``The paramilitaries
were dug in beside our house and the shooting went on for hours. It
started at 2 a.m. and went on until the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Huddling in her house with her children, Barahona eventually
escaped during a lull in the shooting, running for the nearby
woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back two days later and everything from the store and
restaurant was stolen,'' she said. ``I saw more than 40 dead,
guerrillas and paramilitary.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocked townspeople buried their dead and tried to go on, but
the war wouldn't leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Nov. 3, the guerrillas came again and they killed three
young boys they said were accomplices of the paramilitaries,'' she
said. ``They told us then to leave or die. We left with just the
clothes we were wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   After living several months in a nearby town, Barahona returned
to Mapiripan yet again when she heard that things had quieted down.
This time she stayed until the guerrillas returned in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted my three oldest children,'' she said. ``They
wanted them to join the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   This time she fled all the way to Bogota, only to find thousands
of other refugees like herself, homeless and desperate for work.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona knows little of plans by Colombia's President, Andres
Pastrana, to fight the drug lords _ and the guerrillas that prey on
them _ with nearly $2 billion in foreign aid _ more than $1 billion
from the United States. She doesn't know that critics fear the
plans will just lead to a huge new wave of displacement of poor
peasants like herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that this plan will make the war intensify and
will create more forced displacement,'' said Salazar, the human
rights investigator. ``It's a military plan that does very little
in the way of social investment that is needed to fight the
underlying causes of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Barahona hopes only to find work, a home, some way out of the
living nightmare her life has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no place to go,'' she said.

 &HT;    SOUTH PHILLY AN EAGER HOST FOR GOP CONVENTIONEERS
 &HT;    Moving in (p) politics and (l) lifestyle categories.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Yo! Republicans! South Philly is ready with the
cheese steaks and water ice and rock 'n' roll memories.
</P>
<P>
   The First Union Center, where the Republican National Convention
will be held next week, is located in the fabled neighborhood where
American Bandstand's original couples choreographed the Stroll and
the Bop. An Italian heritage lingers. Thursday night is spaghetti
night all across South Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky'' ran the streets here, training for his first cinematic
title fight. Joey Bishop and David Brenner practiced comedy
routines on the corners. Fifties teen idols Frankie Avalon, Bobby
Rydell and Fabian grew up listening to local doo-wop groups and
eating soft pretzels on the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   A strong sense of community has survived the decades since then,
said Barbara Capouzzi, a neighborhood activist. Families have
stayed, generation after generation, despite having the economic
means to move to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place like South Philly,'' said Michael Italiano,
the third-generation owner of Pop's Homemade Water Ice on Oregon
Avenue, a few blocks from the new arena where the Republicans will
convene.
</P>
<P>
   Italiano's grandfather, Philippe, was the ``Pop'' who started
selling the fruit-flavored confections from a pushcart in 1932.
Eaten with a spoon, slushy water ices are a summer staple in an
area where food is a passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the kids that even if they make $20 million, they'll
never eat better than they did growing up in South Philadelphia,''
said Italiano. ``First off, their mamas are all great cooks. Then
there are wonderful bakeries and delis on every corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Another local claim to culinary fame is the cheese steak hoagie.
It was 1930, said Frank E. Olivieri, when his great-uncle, Pat,
concocted the sandwiches of grilled beef and onions and melted
cheese on a long, soft loaf of fresh-baked bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dubbed himself 'the King of Steaks' because no one else was
selling them,'' said Olivieri, who operates Pat's King of Steaks,
still located at the intersection of Passyunk Avenue and Ninth
Street.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, cheese steak hoagies are sold on practically every
block in South Philly.
</P>
<P>
   If you want cheese, order it ``wit','' warned Frank DiCicco, the
Democratic councilman who represents the area. Four generations of
his family have lived on the same block.
</P>
<P>
   South Philly is where the Mummers live, said DiCicco. They meet
and practice year-round in clubhouses for their traditional
costumed parade on New Years Day. They'll hold a special parade
during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the neighborhood has been home to a few
goodfellas, of course, and some blocks still look like a movie set
from ``The Godfather.'' But the narrow streets and neat row houses
are now decked out for the city's first national political
convention since 1948. A banner welcoming the GOP is stretched
across Passyunk Avenue, and state flags hang from the street lights
along Broad Street. Pink hydrangeas are blooming in tiny front
yards, and potted plants adorn well-scrubbed stoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's welcome _ protesters, Republicans, Democrats,
reporters,'' said Italiano.
</P>
<P>
   But few of the 4,150 GOP delegates and alternates or 15,000
journalists and media technicians will be staying in South Philly.
Most hotels are located in the bustling, renovated center city or
in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The fenced-in Free Speech Zone, set up by police for protesters,
is in South Philly's FDR Park, near the First Union Center. Up to
20,000 demonstrators are expected, but their leaders have vowed not
to be confined to this ``protest pit.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention ``is definitely the talk of the town,'' said
Keith Henderson, 31, a taxi driver who has lived all his life in
Philadelphia. ``It'll be good for business, but there is a lot of
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic city administration and Philadelphia 2000, the
host committee, have worked for months to use the convention
promote a revitalized Philadelphia and to show the visitors a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that hasn't had a GOP mayor for more than half a
century, local Democratic office-holders promised to wear T-shirts
saying ``Republican for a Week'' during the convention _ and then
to ceremoniously burn them at its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Horticultural Society has arranged thousands of
flowering plants on sidewalks and storefronts in areas to be
visited by delegates and reporters. Municipal tow trucks removed
more than 30,000 abandoned cars from city streets. Volunteers have
scrubbed graffiti from walls likely to be seen by conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the Philadelphia skyline glows with red, white and
blue lights atop the twin glass towers of Liberty Place. At ground
level, a 60-ton sand sculpture of Abraham Lincoln reminds the
Republicans of their roots. Dick Clark has been booked to host two
American Bandstand-themed parties, with performances by
Philadelphians Rydell, Avalon and Chubby Checker. Fireworks will
illuminate the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the sort of protests that plagued Seattle and
Washington during international trade meetings, the city council
passed an ordinance outlawing the wearing of masks by anyone
intending to intimidate or commit a crime. The anti-globalist
protesters often wear bandannas soaked in vinegar to ward off tear
gas, or all-black outfits with ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   But Philadelphia's image-molders suffered setbacks this summer.
First, the nation watched TV news videotape of police from the City
of Brotherly Love kicking and beating a carjacking suspect. The
Philadelphia Daily News put a photo of the incident on the front
page with the headline ``Welcome, America.'' Then an Amtrak
policeman shot and killed a homeless, deranged man after he
attacked another office with a chair in the 30th Street Station,
the hub of the city's rail transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   A strike by city workers was averted this week, however, and
spirits were up in South Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a friendly place,'' enthused Paul Giordano, whose family
has operated a fruit and produce market in the neighborhood since
1917. It's where somebody tossed an orange to Sylvester Stallone
(another South Philly native) in the first ``Rocky'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia is the biggest small town in the country,'' said
Giordano. ``It's a place where everybody knows everybody. It's a
town of distinct communities that all have names. We're in the
heart of South Philly. Then there's Queen Village, Society Hill,
Northern Liberties, the Old City, Fish Town, Chestnut Hill. There
are dozens of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I love Philadelphia?'' he asked. ``I adore Philadelphia.''

   The Philadelphia Horticultural Society has arranged thousands of
flowering plants on sidewalks and storefronts in areas to be
visited by delegates and reporters. Municipal tow trucks removed
more than 30,000 abandoned cars from city streets. Volunteers have
scrubbed graffiti from walls likely to be seen by conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the Philadelphia skyline glows with red, white and
blue lights atop the twin glass towers of Liberty Place. At ground
level, a 60-ton sand sculpture of Abraham Lincoln reminds the
Republicans of their roots. Dick Clark has been booked to host two
American Bandstand-themed parties, with performances by
Philadelphians Rydell, Avalon and Chubby Checker. Fireworks will
illuminate the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the sort of protests that plagued Seattle and
Washington during international trade meetings, the city council
passed an ordinance outlawing the wearing of masks by anyone
intending to intimidate or commit a crime. The anti-globalist
protesters often wear bandannas soaked in vinegar to ward off tear
gas, or all-black outfits with ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   But Philadelphia's image-molders suffered setbacks this summer.
First, the nation watched TV news videotape of police from the City
of Brotherly Love kicking and beating a carjacking suspect. The
Philadelphia Daily News put a photo of the incident on the front
page with the headline ``Welcome, America.'' Then an Amtrak
policeman shot and killed a homeless, deranged man after he
attacked another office with a chair in the 30th Street Station,
the hub of the city's rail transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   A strike by city workers was averted this week, however, and
spirits were up in South Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a friendly place,'' enthused Paul Giordano, whose family
has operated a fruit and produce market in the neighborhood since
1917. It's where somebody tossed an orange to Sylvester Stallone
(another South Philly native) in the first ``Rocky'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia is the biggest small town in the country,'' said
Giordano. ``It's a place where everybody knows everybody. It's a
town of distinct communities that all have names. We're in the
heart of South Philly. Then there's Queen Village, Society Hill,
Northern Liberties, the Old City, Fish Town, Chestnut Hill. There
are dozens of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I love Philadelphia?'' he asked. ``I adore Philadelphia.''

&HT;     BASEBALL DREAMS COME ALIVE IN DOUBLEDAY FIELD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ For a moment, consider all the negative
axioms you hear about baseball stadiums today. Veterans Stadium is
rundown. Olympic Stadium has no atmosphere. Safeco Field is too
expensive. So on. And so forth.
</P>
<P>
   If you have heard enough, come here. Come to Cooperstown. Come
to its signature stadium, Doubleday Field, where baseball is so
revered that no one would dare to complain about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs are cheap. Beer is not for sale. There isn't much
parking. The seats have no leg room.
</P>
<P>
   If you want amenities, go somewhere else. If you want baseball,
come here.
</P>
<P>
   Come here, where players actually mingle with fans before the
game and between innings. Come here, where pitchers never seem to
throw at someone's head, where no one flunks drug tests, where no
one's spikes come in too high while breaking up a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday Field is a park where the outfield fences are
ridiculously close to home plate _ 296 feet down the line to left,
312 to right, 336 and 350 to the left- and right-field alleys,
respectively _ and no one minds that, either.
</P>
<P>
   This is sacred ground, this place that has the sign out front
saying, ``Welcome to the birthplace of baseball.'' If baseball is
your religion, Cooperstown is your pilgrimage, and if you ever
played the game, Doubleday Field is your mecca.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians and Arizona Diamondbacks were here Monday,
playing the annual Hall of Fame Game at Doubleday Field, the
meaningless _ er, exhibition _ game that caps off every year's
induction weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't call it meaningless,'' Diamondbacks manager Buck
Showalter said. ``Call it an exhibition. No game ever played
anywhere is meaningless, especially here.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter should know. His managerial career started 22 miles
from here, in tiny old Oneonta, where he managed the Yankees'
short-season Class A New York-Penn League team in 1983 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   That was a wonderful time for Showalter; his teams won more than
70 percent of their games, and he could come to the Hall of Fame
whenever he wanted. He didn't get paid much, but other than that,
is there a better managerial job in baseball, where you win every
day and then can visit the Hall every night?
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting four homers in the first round of Monday's annual
Hall of Fame Game home-run contest, Richie Sexson stepped out of
the batting cage and asked the people standing around: ``Can we
play here every day?''
</P>
<P>
   Former Indian Bob Feller turned to Sexson, the current Indian,
and said: ``No one's that lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Hear that, and know how this place is revered. Somehow, a tiny
brick stadium, where any crowd bigger than 10,000 almost literally
sends people to Susquehanna Avenue to watch the game, has captured
the hearts and minds of all who step inside its gates.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say that the ``Birthplace of baseball'' story is a
myth, that the cow pasture once owned by Elihu Phinney and known
today as Doubleday Field is not the birthplace of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even if those historians are correct, it's doubtful that
Cooperstown's legacy will ever change. The place has an aura.
</P>
<P>
   Main Street has it. The Hall of Fame building has it. And
without question, the old cow pasture where youngsters come to feel
old and oldsters come to feel young certainly has it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in here,'' 2000 inductee Sparky Anderson says of
the Hall, ``you're in the house where you'll live forever.''
</P>
<P>
   And whether baseball was born here or not, Doubleday Field is
the house where the sport's roots will live forever, along with its
dreams.

&HT;     BEACH BOY BACK ON FAMILIAR TURF WITH NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HECTOR SALDANA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian Wilson's latest album, the two-CD ``Live at the Roxy
Theatre'' (Brimel Records), opens with the Beach Boys' gem ``The
Little Girl I Once Knew.'' And that is telling because he has
changed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is not the genius we once knew.
</P>
<P>
   The man who led the Beach Boys, the group responsible for the
most all-American soundtracks of the '60s, takes his ``Pet Sounds''
concert Thursday to the Backyard, near Austin, Texas, one of the
stops in his current tour.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, Wilson was famous for his competitive drive _ in
his mind, he toiled against wall-of-sound producer Phil Spector,
the Beatles and his father. The former Hawthorne (Calif.) High
School athlete concedes that part of him is dead.
</P>
<P>
   He is no longer Mike Love's ``Stalin of the Studio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it went out of me. That went out of me a few years back,''
Wilson said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   But his recent performances of ``Pet Sounds'' live onstage (with
an orchestra in some cities) are blowing minds; some rock critics
have described the shows as a religious experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the people in the audience think it's great,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he never surfed, and was actually afraid of the ocean (it
was his late brother, Dennis, who loved the sea), Wilson can't help
describing singing songs from the 1966 album, which sent shock
waves through the Beatles' camp, in salt-water terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a powerful surge, a very powerful surge,'' he said.
``It's very satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Wilson said the Beach Boys wouldn't have performed
``Pet Sounds'' live when the record came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, they wouldn't have wanted to,'' he said, explaining
that the band's teeny-bopper fans wouldn't have accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   He adds, however, that the boys had the talent to deliver the
songs in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said being back on the road is ``a good move in a tried
and proven method.'' This is no ill-advised ``Brian Is Back''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My voice is fine, and my spirits are fine, too,'' he said.
``I'm in a good place.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is so into it that he signs autographs after shows.
</P>
<P>
   That's extraordinary access to a man who has been a recluse most
of his adult life and spent a depressed three years in bed in the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked my head off,'' he said about doing interviews
during the current tour. ``It's fun to get into it. I like it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing to hide,'' added Wilson, who travels these
days with his wife and their adopted daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The early Beach Boys was his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big project. It was a big, emotionally secure idea.
And then it just got rough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs, dysfunction and destiny took their toll. But even in his
darkest times, Wilson managed ``Sail On, Sailor,'' ``'Til I Die,''
``Do It Again'' and ``Darlin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's greatest influence remains the Four Freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I analyzed the harmonies,'' he said. ``And I realized that I
could do that. It gave me confidence. If I could copy a Four
Freshmen arrangement, then I could do anything on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   He collected Phil Spector records and took those famous singles
apart, as well. ``Yeah, I studied them. I really would study
them,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's ego was enormous in his heyday. The ``Pet Sounds''
track ``I Know There's an Answer'' was originally titled ``Hang On
to Your Ego.'' Still, he never felt he topped his heroes' music.
``It was never that way at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For his current tour, Wilson went through the Beach Boys'
catalog and handpicked the songs he wanted (including exquisite,
rarely performed tracks off Capitol Records' newly reissued
``Sunflower'' and ``Surf's Up'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that simple,'' he said. ``I made sure they were songs
that made me feel secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he continue to tour? ``I think so. We're going out in
September, too.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he balance the perfectionist and studio producer side
of himself with the shy live musician?
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened today, I had to let it go. The perfectionism in
me _ I had to let it go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his brother, Carl, prayed together every day before
the making of ``Pet Sounds.'' What is the message now?
</P>
<P>
   ``The same as in the '60s,'' he said. ``A lot of spiritual love.
There's love in my band's voices and there's love in my voice, so
we're covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he plans to record a new album in October and writes
songs every day. On the outside, at least, it seems the surf is
indeed up.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, he's still into pop vocalists. ``I like Ricky Martin
and the Backstreet Boys,'' he said, adding that he's seen both acts
perform. ``I like their energy and their youth, their `youth-ness.'
They're good-looking guys.''

 &HT;    Chutneys
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, many food trend watchers tapped chutney as the
accompaniment to watch in the new millenium. Chutney would become
``the next salsa,'' many said. Sure enough, chutney has been
popping up all over the pages of slick food magazines and in the
scripted recitations of white jacketed waiters in upscale
restaurants. Chutney this, chutney that. Chutney sounds a whole lot
more high brow than pickle relish or Aunt Cora's chow chow. But the
fact is, chutney is just a fancy (read British) way of saying
relish.
</P>
<P>
   Chutney which has been around forever came to England via India
where the word actually means relish. And what does relish mean?
According Websters....``an appetizing flavor..pleasing
taste...pleasure...enjoyment...zest.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what chutney and relishes are all about. In the
chemistry of a dinner plate a little dab of chutney or relish can
be the catalyst that puts the taste buds on high alert and becomes
the counterpoint that ignites the flavors and textures of
everything else on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Now that fresh fruits and vegetables are available year round,
chutneys and relishes no longer have to involve complicated canning
and preserving procedures. While chutney emerges into the culinary
spotlight, chefs everywhere are experimenting with an amazing
number of creative variations that can be made fresh and stored in
the refrigerator for up to three weeks. Chutneys and relishes,
after all are mainly chopped fruit and vegetables with vinegar and
spices added. The difference is primarily in texture.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the familiar cucumber, onion, carrots and peppers now
you will see chutneys made with banannas, tomatoes, blueberries,
strawberries, rasberries, peaches, pears, plums, apples,
cranberries, mangos, papaya, pineapple, cherrys and coconuts all
being used to accompany hot and cold meats, fish, shell fish, fowl,
egg, cheese and vegetables in a host of combinations.

   Spicy Tomato Chutney
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 1 1/2 cups
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30-35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   This recipe originally accompanied Roast Beef, Basil, and Spicy
Tomato Chutney LaVash Sandwiches. It would pair well with grilled
fish or chicken, or would be a nice pasta topping.
</P>
<P>
   1pound vine-ripened tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, stem, ribs and seeds removed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons mustard seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chopped scallions, green parts only
</P>
<P>
   Chop tomatoes and bell pepper into medium dice. In a medium
saucepan, bring vinegars to a boil with sugar, salt, mustard seeds,
black pepper, and red pepper flakes, stirring occasionally. When
the sugar and salt are dissolved, stir in the tomatoes, pepper, and
scallions. Simmer mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about
1 1/4 hours, or until thickened and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups.
Cool chutney completely. Chutney keeps, covered and chilled, 2
weeks.

   Pineapple and Mint Chutney
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 3 cups
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 45 minutes or less, with 1 hour resting time
after preparation
</P>
<P>
   This is closer to relish than a chutney, as it is not cooked. It
is very fresh-tasting and is a crowd-pleaser. Can be used with
grilled fish or meat (pork tenderloin would be especially nice), or
as a small side offering.
</P>
<P>
   1cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves, rinsed, spun dry, and
chopped fairly fine
</P>
<P>
   1 (4 1/2-pound) pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/3-inch
dice
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup minced red onion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar, or to tast
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl combine the mint with the pineapple, the onion, the
sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir the mixture until it is well
combined. Let the chutney stand, covered, for 1 hour. The chutney
may be made 1 week in advance and kept covered and chilled.

 &HT;    Splitting bark gives way in heartfelt wave goodbye
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I heard, within seconds of each other, two sounds that rose
above the roll of thunder and splatter of rain: crrrraaaack!
Whuuump! In the kitchen of our 110-year-old house, I felt a thud,
but it did not begin to prepare me for what lay in front of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminated by a fast-returning sun and lightning's persistent
flash, a giant hand cradled the garden, the most amazing sight I've
ever seen in a growing space. The big old oak next door, a tree
that probably predates the Civil War, had lost half of itself; our
side of the split trunk, always a concern, had fallen away,
brushing the top of our house, crashing into the wrought iron
fence, spreading across the driveway, reaching even the house
beyond ours. On what remained of the once mighty water oak, the
broken trunk jutted upward about 8 feet, a jagged reminder of the
once imposing half: bright wood with a telltale rotted heart.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the half-tree landed in the garden and on the sidewalk
and street. So much tree for such a small garden space. The oak had
become a grounded treehouse, complete with a maze of branches,
thickly leaved, fruited with new acorns that, for the past 11
years, rat-a-tat-tatted on our roof.
</P>
<P>
   So precise was the tree's placement that its lichened fingers,
some well over a foot around, rested right in the middle of the
postage-stamp-size garden, squashing some prized old friends, to be
sure, but apparently doing no harm to others. The cherry was
decapitated, but hydrangeas, azaleas, dogwood, redtip, a Japanese
maple remained unbroken.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just amazing that it missed so many plants,'' Lyn said
after recovering a bit from the shock of the sight. ``It's as if
that old tree was saying goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Our elation was short-lived. In removing the big hand last week,
apologetic tree people finished off the wrought iron fence and just
about destroyed the front garden: The tree didn't want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Unger, our real estate agent, always quick on the quip,
noted that trees usually fall next door, not on their own property
(which means the victim's insurance pays). And she understood my
removing the for-sale sign: ``The house probably wouldn't show too
well with that tree lying in the front yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the fall, a sweet fragrance wafted, even through
the house. But it was more than newly broken wood; it evoked the
sensory pleasure of fresh-sliced watermelon, a soothing,
life-affirming counterpoint to the death and decay so evident in
the tree that, like so many oaks in Atlanta, has been dying
inwardly for years and whose falling apart was hastened by
debilitating drought and yet another violent blow-down.
</P>
<P>
   The July 12 fall-down was, of course, a Peeples Street
happening, bringing out the best in neighbors who brought awe,
sympathy and chain saws. It could have been much worse, we all
agreed. And we told stories of other lost trees, the oak across the
street, the pecan in our neighborhood parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Too, the fall-down brought out the best in carriers of letters
and newspapers; they navigated the maze. They delivered.
</P>
<P>
   This loss has brought much new light to house and garden,
pleasing some plants but disconcerting others. Disconcerting too is
the view from my office window upstairs; where I used to view the
twin towers of oak, I now see one trunk and a gash.
</P>
<P>
   More light may be on the way, as the great but weakened oak
seems destined for a saw-down; no one wants to know what will
happen if the tree's second half slams a house. In some ways,
that's a sad prospect, as that old oak had been a good part of my
gardening life, providing shade and many sightings of wildlife,
including flitting birds and cavorting squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the downed half lay drying, it continued to attract
birds that, under cover of thick foliage, hopped and chirped and
dashed about wildly. Perhaps they were confused at the familiar
tree's unfamiliar location.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they were doing what the tree and those of us who love
it have been doing in a big way lately: saying goodbye.

   Q: I have been looking for Physicians Formula Gentle Cover
Concealer Stick. Any idea where I can find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Doris Brown, Covington, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We have you covered. Available at Ulta stores, we found this
yellow-toned concealer stick at the 3495 Buckhead Loop N.E.
location (404-266-3559). A 15-ounce tube is $4.29. Applied before
makeup, this concealer works to hide dark under-eye circles, even
out skin tone and conceal bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find Cinch, the 2 in 1 cleaner for glass and
windows?
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Warwick,
</P>
<P>
   Canton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a cinch to find Cinch. We discovered this cleaner at
the Big Kmart store, 2581 Piedmont Road N.E. (404-261-6900). A
32-ounce spray bottle is $2.69. A spokeswoman for the manufacturer,
Procter &AMP; Gamble, says it's also available at Kroger, Publix and
Target stores. In addition to cleaning ``windows to a streak-free
shine,'' Cinch takes a shine to appliances, chrome, stainless
steel, fiberglass and walls. And note: Cinch contains no phosphate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to find Barq's diet root beer. I see the regular
version but not the diet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laurie Thomas, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another Barq's request: I'm having withdrawal! Since moving
to this area, I can't find Barq's diet root beer. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark McElroy, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Yet a third query: I am looking for Barq's diet root beer. I
don't have trouble finding the regular but the diet is almost
impossible to find.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cessie Walls,
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree City, Ga.,
</P>
<P>
   A: Lovers of Barq's Olde Tyme diet root beer will be delighted
to know their low-cal favorite is available at Publix, 7525 Roswell
Road (678-443-8980). Six 12-ounce cans are $2.09. The diet root
beer has also been spotted at Harris Teeter and Kroger stores in
Peachtree City. It was created in 1898 by Edward C. Barq Sr. in
Biloxi, Miss. Coca-Cola bought the brand in 1995. On the can,
Edward ``Sonny'' Barq IV offers a challenge to root beer drinkers.
He writes: ``When you taste diet Barq's, I think you'll agree it
might just be the best-tasting low-calorie soft drink you ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find Alexander Julian's perfume Womenwear? Every
time I wear it, I receive so many compliments. I hope it is still
being produced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Chunn,
</P>
<P>
   Lithonia, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: What an aptly named perfume for women. We sniffed out your
request and came up with Alexander Julian's Womenwear at Ulta, 3495
Buckhead Loop N.E. (404-266-3559). Each of the teal-colored bottles
with an orchid top (2-ounce spray, $31.49) is crafted and glazed
individually by hand. Menswear designer Alexander Julian introduced
his perfume in 1991 as a sultry, floral blend highlighted by warm
amber notes, touches of cassis and passion fruit, and with a hint
of white musk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a facial soap I used years ago called
Cuticura. I have been unable to find it recently.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Hayes, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We cleaned up on this request. Cuticura Medicated
Antibacterial Bar is available at Walgreens, 4371 S. Cobb Drive,
Smyrna 30080 (678-556-0570). A 3-ounce bar is $1.99. For years,
Cuticura has been the choice of dermatologists, since, says the
manufacturer, ``this non-comedogenic cleansing formula contains
non-drying ingredients to deep clean and remove excess dirt and oil
that may cause blemishes and acne.''

 &HT;    Strange but true: Grilled chicken and beer can a match made in
heaven
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicken is rarely the first thing that comes to my mind when I
think of firing up the grill. I flip a mean burger. I'm perfecting
the steak. And this summer I've had some success with finicky fish.
</P>
<P>
   But chicken? Boring. At least that's what I thought until beer
changed my mind. Or more precisely a beer can.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a sordid tale of drunkenness. In fact, I don't drink
beer at all. But I became so intrigued by the notion of ``beer can
chicken'' that I went right out and bought a six pack. Cook's
Illustrated _ the magazine that tests one dish a gazillion
different ways to discover the best preparation _ declares in the
August issue that ``beer can chicken'' is tops for grill-roasting a
bird.
</P>
<P>
   And when cookbook author and grilling guru Steven Raichlen was
in town, he demonstrated beer-can game hens for folks at Cook's
Warehouse. ``I don't know who did this first. But it sure has
captured the national imagination,'' said Raichlen. ``It is the
most succulent chicken you will ever taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, you take a can of beer and drink half of it (or
pour it out). Throw a pinch of your favorite dry rub into the
remaining beer. (You can also try lemonade in a can instead of
beer.) Some suggest popping an extra hole in the top with a church
key can opener.
</P>
<P>
   Next, massage a dry rub over a whole bird. Stick with a fryer
rather than a roaster, one about 3 1/2 pounds. Or go with Cornish
hens _ one for each diner. For the rub, Raichlen likes to mix a 1/4
cup each of kosher salt, black pepper, sweet paprika and brown
sugar. Try it or use your favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Heat up the coals or the gas grill. Be sure the grate is low
enough that the lid will close once the upright bird is placed on
the grill. Once it's good and hot, move the coals to one side or
turn off a burner to create a spot for some indirect heat. Place
the beer can on the grate (but not directly over the flame/coals)
and then ``sit'' the chicken on top of the beer. Simply lower the
cavity of the bird over the can. Use the legs to create balance if
need be.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the grill and allow the chicken to roast for about 70-90
minutes or until the internal temperature registers 165 degrees in
the breast area and 180 degrees in the thigh. (You do have a meat
thermometer, right? If not, put it on your grocery list.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This might seem like a totally goofy recipe, but there are
some real scientific principles at work,'' Raichlen explained. ``By
roasting the chicken upright, the fat drains off and the skin gets
crispy. Meanwhile, the beer is steaming the chicken from the inside
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the grill and let it sit
for about 10 minutes before carving. Then serve it with some of the
Coca-Cola Barbecue Sauce from Raichlen's ``Barbecue Bible! Sauces,
Rubs and Marinades'' (Workman Publishing, $12.95.) It's the real
thing, especially for real delicious chicken.
</P>
<P>
   COCA-COLA BARBECUE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy saucepan, combine the following: 1 cup Coca-Cola, 1
cup ketchup, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon liquid smoke,
3 tablespoons A.1. Steak Sauce, 1 teaspoon onion flakes, 1 teaspoon
garlic flakes and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper. You can
season additionally to taste. (I like a few red pepper flakes for
heat.)
</P>
<P>
   Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and then reduce the heat and
simmer about 8 minutes. Use right away or transfer to a large jar,
cover, cool to room temperature and refrigerate. This recipe makes
about 2 cups and will keep for a couple of months in the fridge.

 &HT;    Arbors, pergolas reach new heights with lovers of the great
outdoors
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Michele Burns wants to savor her garden, she
simply looks up. In spring, wisteria drips its heady scent over her
outdoor dinner table and not long after, pink roses take center
stage. In summer, lush foliage forms a cool canopy for sundown
suppers, while in fall and winter, what's more romantic than
kicking back to gaze at the stars?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so great _ we use it all the time,'' Burns said of the
arbor, which forms a transition between her Atlanta home and
carport.
</P>
<P>
   Structures like hers are cropping up in back yards everywhere as
homeowners spend more time outdoors. Plenty still play it safe,
taking cover under the roofs of porches, pavilions and gazebos. But
a growing number are turning to open structures dating to ancient
times _ especially large arbors and pergolas _ that provide better
ventilation, a view of the sky and the fragrance of blooming vines.
</P>
<P>
   Arbors and pergolas afford not only shady retreats for relaxing
and entertaining but also the kind of structure, focal points and
transitional areas that yards and gardens so often need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really become the shaded outdoor living room,'' said
Brooks Garcia, an Atlanta garden designer.
</P>
<P>
   Pergolas _ typically a series of arches linked to form a
tunnel-like framework open on all sides _ have always been used to
frame a view, support climbing vines or provide shade. Arbors serve
the same purposes but traditionally are smaller and partially
enclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Both can be formal or informal, taking into account the style of
both the home's architecture and the garden's style. Some opt for
traditional white columns and latticework, while others prefer the
more natural look of weathered locust, as this sampling from
Atlanta-area gardens shows.
</P>
<P>
   Scaled-up versions
</P>
<P>
   Michele Burns' arbor in Atlanta serves various functions, yet
one thing's for certain: It's got scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wimpy about this one,'' said David Ellis, who
designed the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The arbor creates a focal point at the head of the swimming
pool, with green lattice supports rising from stacked-stone pillars
to a towering ceiling. Against its back white wall is a statue
flanked by gas lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   The structure also connects the house to the carport and so
provides a canopy in bad weather. Architect William Edwards and
Brad McGill of Ellis Land Design designed a circular pattern in the
lattice, which is repeated along the side of the carport and
adjacent cabana.
</P>
<P>
   And being partially enclosed, the arbor lends a safe bet for
poolside entertaining in all types of weather. Wisteria and New
Dawn roses, along with bluestone paving, blend the structure into
the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Making an entrance
</P>
<P>
   Gracey McKeown's rear garden needed bones. From her driveway,
the northwest Atlanta garden begged for an entrance. From her back
porch, it screamed for a focal point.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Keith Summerour created a pergola that gives her both,
with an Old World flare to boot. Tan stuccoed pillars support an
earthy brown-stained barrel roof ensnared with just the right
amount of wisteria _ not too much, not too little. Its bluestone
floor extends onto the adjacent pool's decking.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, oakleaf hydrangeas form a screen along one side and hide
the pool's mechanics. The other side is open to the rest of the
garden. A rustic iron chandelier lighted with votives dangles above
a teak bench, forming a romantic haven removed from the openness of
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Think before you build
</P>
<P>
   Here are some points to consider when planning an arbor or
pergola:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Decide how you want to use the structure _ as space for
relaxing or entertaining, a focal point, a transitional area, a
simple support for vines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose a design in keeping with your home's architecture and
garden style.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose a size in scale with its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Opt for simple designs with strong construction, especially if
the structure will support vines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plan for access to the pergola, because pathways will need to
be integrated with the rest of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid a central arch in a narrow garden, which can split the
space visually.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use only one arbor or pergola in a small garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Enclose arbors on one or more sides to create mystery in the
space beyond.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use overhead rafters to create privacy from neighboring
windows.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make pergolas tall enough _ 8 to 9 feet _ so vines won't be
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use only wood pressure-treated with chemicals for posts
installed directly in the ground, because wood will rot without
concrete footings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use pine, fir or cedar if you plan to paint or stain the wood,
redwood for unfinished wood.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Count on spending $12 to $25 per square foot for a wooden
pergola.

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Hendersonville, N.C.

   Hendersonville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   sign at the north end of the Main Street shopping district

</P>
<P>
   More like an international shopping zone, I'd say. This is a
great little shopping town.
</P>
<P>
   Main Street _ from Sixth Avenue on the north end to First Avenue
on the south _ is framed with shade trees, planters filled with
seasonal color and benches along wide sidewalks made for strolling.
</P>
<P>
   The town is chockablock with wonderful antique emporiums, gift
shops, galleries and great places to have a cup of gourmet coffee,
ice cream or a little something for the ol' sweet tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we found: Fabulous imported soaps and body-care
products at Banana Moon. Irish imports at one of the 16 stalls at
Portobello. Romantically feminine dresses and jewelry at
Honeysuckle Hollow. Manly-man outdoor gear at Sherman's Sports and
Army Store. Colorful nylon fabric whirligigs twirling in the breeze
outside at Narnia Studios. Fantasy costumes for kids at Dancing
Bear Toys. Great bargains on home decor at Biltmore Village Co.
Antique coral jewelry at Mehri &AMP; Co. Unusual wind chimes made of
recycled items by James Thomas Butler at Mountain Mark's Stepping
Stones Gourmet Coffeehouse &AMP; Gifts for the Heart and Soul (which
takes the prize for the longest business name known to man). And
everything else at Mast General Store.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours, we'd made it down one side of the street,
landing at the delightful Days Gone By _ the circa-1882 Justus
Pharmacy _ for soda fountain-style sandwiches and thick, creamy
milkshakes. (The fresh banana shake would have made a meal in
itself.)
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the midday heat (yes, unfortunately, it does get hot
even in the mountains), we slipped into the cool, dark Skyland Arts
Cinema Center for the 1:05 p.m. showing of ``Chicken Run.'' This
tiny movie house has bistro seating and a cafe menu featuring
pizza, other snacks and beer and wine.
</P>
<P>
   After a few more hours of browsing, we walked two blocks up Main
Street to the Waverly Inn, field headquarters for our shopping
foray. Later that evening, we headed back downtown for dinner at
Cypress Cellar and the Monday-night street dance. And, truth be
told, a little window shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, before leaving town, we checked out the bounty
of Henderson County at the old-fashioned Curb Market, which has
been in operation since 1924. A don't-miss attraction that's open
on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, the farmer's co-op features
homegrown fruits and vegetables, flowers, baked goodies,
home-canned jellies and relishes and lots of country crafts,
including hooked and woven rugs, dolls, folk toys, quilts, afghans,
table linens _ and friendly vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the market, you'll see the homemade ice cream tent where
the putt-putt-putt of a John Deere tractor engine turns the churn.
Don't leave without trying a yummy cup of vanilla or whatever else
is available, which could be fresh peach, apple pie or orange
sherbet.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     SAN JOSE DAILY EXPANDS INTO SAN FRANCISCO MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Jose Mercury News has entered the
competitive San Francisco newspaper market in earnest, promising
local news, a well-regarded business section and expanded listings
for arts and entertainment coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco edition drops ``San Jose'' from the front-page
masthead, simply calling itself the Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper is aggressively trying to gain a foothold in the
market, offering subscribers a month of free home delivery, and was
said to be providing copies to newsstands and stores at a wholesale
price of 5 cents, compared with 18 cents for the San Francisco
Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner. (Mercury News officials
declined to confirm the price, citing competitive reasons).
</P>
<P>
   The launch comes at a time of uncertainty as San Francisco's two
daily newspapers await to see if a federal judge clears the way for
the Hearst Corp. to buy the Chronicle for $660 million and sell its
flagship Examiner to the publisher of a weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News is owned by Knight Ridder, which publishes 30
other daily newspapers. The Hearst Corp., based in New York, and
the Chronicle Publishing Co. are privately held.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are making the paper available to a broader audience
at this point,'' Jay Harris, publisher of the San Jose Mercury
News, said Wednesday. ``I think the report we provide, not only in
the coverage of Silicon Valley, but the local news we'll offer on
San Francisco and a sophisticated report on state, national and
global affairs, will be of interest to people in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception from the city's newspaper industry was less
enthusiastic. Two Chronicle editors, Allen Matthews and Michael
Collier, went to the Mercury News' San Francisco bureau and dropped
off two toy cable cars, bells and a pot holder ``for handling hot
stories,'' said Matthews, a deputy city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a front-page story in Wednesday's Mercury News on
pedestrian safety in San Francisco, Phil Bronstein, the executive
editor of the Examiner, said: ``It's nice to see they've belatedly
discovered the pedestrian safety issue, but we've already been
covering that for, what, months?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News even got a taste of San Francisco's small-world
nexus of newspapers and politics when the city tagged six of its
new street sales boxes for being too close to curbs or
intersections, or lashed to bike racks or trees.
</P>
<P>
   News racks are monitored by Dan Brugmann, San Francisco's news
rack program manager, who is the son of Bruce Brugmann, publisher
of the Bay Guardian alternative weekly. Dan Brugmann said the six
boxes he cited, out of 20 the entire day, were average for one
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury News executives said the launch had been planned for
several years, as part of an aggressive expansion plan that now
produces seven daily editions tailored to specific geographic areas
_ the counties of Alameda, San Mateo and southern Santa Clara, as
well as the Silicon Valley, Peninsula and Coastline. They have a
combined daily circulation of more than 290,000. Fewer than 2,000
papers currently are sold in San Francisco; officials declined to
say how many readers they hoped to attract.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder also publishes newspapers in Contra Costa County.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News San Francisco bureau has nine editorial
employees _ six reporters, two columnists and a bureau chief _
compared with about 200 for the Examiner and 350 for the Chronicle.
Susan Goldberg, the managing editor of the newspaper, said there
would be a dozen employees there eventually. It is expected to have
a story about San Francisco on its front page most days, and has a
completely San Francisco-oriented metropolitan news section.
</P>
<P>
   The edition had been anticipated by the San Francisco dailies,
which each launched special Friday city sections and expanded their
business coverage.

&HT;     HIRING IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Weddings can teach a crucial lesson about
marriage, a common-sense principle that employers ought to remember
when hiring people. But they usually don't.
</P>
<P>
   Because my wife and I were already older than 30 when we decided
to marry 12 years ago, it seemed silly for her parents or mine to
pay for the wedding. So we paid for it ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   When Mom and Dad are footing the bill, it's easy for couples to
think that they have an unlimited budget, and to chide their
parents for being cheap if they toss up the idea of cutting
corners. But if you pay for the wedding yourself, you have to sweat
the details. Which is more important: having tons of flowers or
live music? Do you want more guests or a nicer honeymoon? Or would
you rather save money and try to buy a house?
</P>
<P>
   You end up debating and compromising and setting priorities. And
guess what? An awful lot of being married involves debating and
compromising and setting priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the workplace, the closest thing to a wedding is when
companies hire new people. You're making a commitment that isn't
always easy to break, one that can turn the next several years into
heaven or hell. And you're doing it with limited information.
</P>
<P>
   What paying for the wedding yourselves does is bring you from
fantasy into reality. You've already gotten to know your
prospective spouse, but the biggest decision you've made as a
couple might have been what to wear to the prom. Paying for the
wedding forces you to discuss things like money and goals and
friendships and appearances, things that married couples have to
work out.
</P>
<P>
   When you hire people, are you basing the decision on items of
substance or on prom outfits? Probably the latter.
</P>
<P>
   How much substance is involved in your hiring process? A couple
of interviews? Con men give great interviews. The applicant's
references? Even Adolf Hitler probably could have listed a few good
references. A drug test? Someone who's been in a coma for six
months might give a great urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   What does your hiring process do to check for what's really
important: All the stuff that comes after ``I do''? If you're a
boss, here are some things that fit into the category of ``I ought
to do'':
</P>
<P>
   Instead of falling in love with the sound of your own voice,
listen to what questions the applicants ask. Not everyone gives a
glib interview, but anybody who really wants a job will research
the company as thoroughly as possible, and ought to be able to come
up with some intelligent questions.
</P>
<P>
   If all you get are generic questions _ or no questions at all _
you don't exactly have a self-starter on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   If I had a little more nerve, just once in my life I'd interview
an applicant like this: ``Thanks for coming by,'' I'd say. ``So, do
you have any questions about our company?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no,'' the applicant replies. ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thanks for coming by.''
</P>
<P>
   Give the applicants an assignment. Before your second interview,
ask the contenders to visit one of your stores or check out your
Web site, then share their thoughts with you. Who has the most
insightful comments? Who notices the mistakes that others miss?
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to give them a business-related question
and ask them to write their answers to bring in for the second
interview. Who makes their points concisely? Who crosses all the
t's and dots all the i's?
</P>
<P>
   If speed is essential to your business, simply ask the
business-related question on the first interview. Either get the
answer orally or give people 15 minutes to write down their
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Another small assignment can be as simple as telling people,
``Give me a call back on Monday morning.'' Who does and who
doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Ask your assistant or receptionist or security guard if the
applicant ever thanked them for their kindness. If they say no,
that's not a red light, but it's certainly a yellow one.
</P>
<P>
   Thanking people is a little thing, not something that draws the
spotlight. Then again, a marriage rarely succeeds or fails because
of those few hours that the couple spent in the spotlight on their
wedding day. Usually it depends on all those little kindnesses that
they either keep doing or stop doing, and how many more little
things they find to be thankful for each year.

BAR RAISED IN US GYMNASTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The boot camps are done, the surgery rehabs
completed, the qualifying meets over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are out in the open,'' said US women's gymnastics
coordinator Bela Karolyi. ``This is the time of the truth. There is
nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   For the US gymnasts, the road to Sydney begins in the shadow of
the Gateway Arch this week with the national championships and
continues next month with the Olympic trials at the FleetCenter in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the math and the back-room politicking are done, six
men and six women will make the team. Except for four-time men's
champion Blaine Wilson, who's already been given a free pass to the
Games, nobody is certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea who's going to make the Olympic team,'' said
men's coach Peter Kormann, who'll be watching nearly a dozen
reasonable contenders in the prelims.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1984, when boycott holdovers like Bart Conner, Peter
Vidmar, Julianne McNamara, and Tracee Talavera turned up, has there
been such a crowd on both the men's and women's sides.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the Magnificent Seven (all but Kerri Strug and Amanda
Borden) who won gold in Atlanta are back to challenge their
successors, who are led by two-time national champion Kristen
Maloney, former titlist Vanessa Atler, and Elise Ray, the top
American finisher at last year's world meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to make a team out of them, you can see what kind of an
attack I am having,'' said Karolyi. ``What a difficult decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Back when the top six finishers were locked in, there was no
decision to make. But the wild-card era, which allows countries to
use one-event specialists in the team competition, has changed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   So only the three women and four men (or top three plus Wilson)
with the best combined scores from nationals (40 percent) and
trials (60 percent) are guaranteed spots. The rest will be chosen
by committee as soon as the trials end Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   That's where resumes may carry some weight. Shannon Miller and
Dominique Dawes, both trying for their third teams at 23, have
virtually no chance to make the top three. But Miller won gold on
beam in Atlanta and Dawes the bronze on floor. If they can
recapture their old magic on even one event, they could bring an
apparatus medal home from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, though, suffered a tibial stress fracture earlier this
month and may not even compete here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want to do is go in unprepared and injure it
again,'' said Miller, who has won 16 Olympic and world medals.
</P>
<P>
   And Dawes, who's only been training since February, hasn't
competed in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Wilson, whom Kormann calls ``the Tiger Woods of
gymnastics,'' there's a mad scramble for places on the men's team,
which has managed to stay among the world's top six even while the
sport has been decimated at the collegiate level.
</P>
<P>
   Only Wilson, John Roethlisberger, and Chainey Umphrey return
from the 1996 squad. Roethlisberger, trying for his third Olympic
team at 31, blew out his knee two years ago. He'll make the team
one way or the other (if only as a lifetime achievement award).
</P>
<P>
   Jason Gatson, the once-rising star who made the 1997 world team
at 17, also blew out his knee at last year's nationals. If he's
back on form, he's on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Who else? Sean Townsend, Stephen McCain, Yewki Tomita, and Jay
Thornton from last year's world team? Brett McClure and Guard
Young, who were 3-4 at last year's nationals?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more depth now,'' said Kormann. ``I wouldn't count
anyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOW THE TEAM WILL BE CHOSEN
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four men and three women with the highest combined scores
from this week's national championships (40 percent) and next
month's Olympic trials at the FleetCenter (60 percent) will earn
automatic places.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two men and three women will be chosen by
committee at the end of the trials. Blaine Wilson, the four-time
men's champion, is guaranteed a berth based on past performance.
Gymnasts can petition for a spot based on injury or other unusual
circumstance.

ALASKA'S MULLOY ON TARGET FOR OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melissa Mulloy has got some serious range. She can hit the big
shot in a pressure situation. Her coach can count on her to score,
and she has a shooter's mentality _ keep firing, and never get
discouraged by a miss.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy has all the tools to be a great shooter.
</P>
<P>
   That's why she was so highly recruited coming out of Masconomet
Regional High School in Boxford, Mass. three years ago. There were
stacks of letters and regular phone calls from big-time college
programs Kentucky, Xavier (Ohio), Marquette, and Wisconsin. But
when it came time to make her decision, the Middleton native
decided to take her skills to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a wise choice. Mulloy has helped the
University of Alaska-Fairbanks win the last two NCAA championships,
and this year was selected to her fifth All-America team. In June
she earned the opportunity to shoot for an even bigger honor: a
gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her desire and her dedication are definitely what got her
here,'' said Randy Pitney, Mulloy's coach and the athletic director
at the University of Alaska. ``Frankly, this whole year I never had
a doubt in my mind that she (would) qualify for the Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy may sound like a hoop star. She's not. Mulloy doesn't
shoot basketballs from behind a 3-point line; she shoots rifles
from behind a foul line. She shoots for the University of Alaska's
women's rifle team, is a two-time All-American for the smallbore
(.22-caliber rifle), a three-timer for the air (pellet) rifle, and
one of 20 American shooters who will travel to Sydney and one of
three who will compete in the women's 50-meter three-position sport
rifle competition in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a really exciting experience,'' Mulloy said of
traveling to Sydney. ``There's a limit to how many people get to
go, and it's an opportunity that comes around only once every four
years. So it's pretty exciting I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of representing one's country may be exciting, but
emotions interfere in shooting competitions. Mulloy and the rest of
the roughly 15,000 people who shoot competitively in the United
States must remain calm when aiming at such miniscule targets.
Imagine trying to hit a bull's-eye smaller than a dime from 50
meters. That's the challenge that smallbore shooters face. Take a
pencil and make a mark on a piece of paper. Now imagine trying to
hit it with an air rifle from 10 meters. Not only does it take
remarkable aim to be a good shooter, but the rifle must be held
steady and trembling avoided.
</P>
<P>
   As in darts, shooters are awarded points for coming close to the
bull's-eye, but coming close all the time won't earn All-America
honors or a spot on the Olympic team. Mulloy, who placed 15th in
last week's International Shooting Sports Federation World Cup in
Atlanta, hits targets consistently because she has developed almost
complete control of her body. She can maintain a normal heart rate
despite the natural adrenaline rush that comes with a pressure
situation like shooting for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the line and you get nervous, you feel your
heart beating fast,'' Mulloy said. ``You can see that movement
through the gunsight. You can see it bobbling all around. You have
to be able to control it. You have to be able to get your body to
relax quickly and get your heart rate down.''
</P>
<P>
   To develop such physical and mental discipline, it takes just
that _ discipline. Mulloy, a business major at Alaska, has a
demanding, five-to-six-day a week workout schedule that includes
aerobics, weightlifting, and visualization exercises. The
athleticism of shooters is tested by the degree of difficulty
involved in holding a 12 1/2-pound rifle for six hours, suppressing
nerves, and tuning out all distractions as they attempt to focus on
a microscopic target, all the while wearing a canvas or leather
jacket and pants designed to keep them as stiff as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney likens shooting to golf, except there's no timer in golf.
In the three-position sport rifle competition, Mulloy and the other
participants will have 20 minutes to fire 20 shots from the prone
position (lying flat on their stomachs), 30 minutes to fire 20
shots from one knee, and 40 minutes to fire 20 shots standing up.
</P>
<P>
   Shooters are allowed as many practice shots as they wish, but
the clock starts ticking as soon as they take their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're making yourself concentrate,'' said Mulloy, this year's
NCAA air rifle champion who started shooting when she was 13 and as
a teenager spent many Friday nights in a shooting club rather than
a dance club. ``It's like trying to sit down and read a book in
front of the television.''
</P>
<P>
   Though shooting is more popular in Europe and Asia than it is in
the United States, Pitney doesn't think Mulloy will be overmatched
against marksmen who are used to hitting the bull's-eye in
televised competitions attended by thousands of fans. Mulloy's work
ethic and superb concentration skills, her coach said, are what
makes her such an accurate shooter. And those qualities will give
her a good shot at winning the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a talent to focus on what she's doing,'' Pitney said.
``She doesn't get shook up about anything. She just puts on the
workclothes and does the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the part that most people like,'' Mulloy said, ``is
that when you're down there on the line, it's just you, your gun,
and all your stuff. It's you that has to go down there and pull it
off.''

 PYRAMID SCHEME COLLAPSES AMID ANGER
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LEWISTON, Maine _ For a few weeks this spring, an electric
current of joy ran through sections of this mill city. Strangers
found they had something in common; debts miraculously cleared;
closely held dreams of trips or boats edged closer.
</P>
<P>
   What had changed in Lewiston was ``Changing Lives,'' described
by its organizers as a ``simple, natural activity'' that was
bringing participants thousands of dollars in cash with the morning
mail. Word spread quickly during the month of May, drawing hundreds
of Mainers into the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   To enter a ``Changing Lives'' group, a new recruit would pay
$2,000 to the person who had been in the group the longest. When
the senior members had collected $16,000, they left, allowing more
recent additions to replace them in the top spot _ and reap the
profits from the next group of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   But in early June Attorney General Andrew Ketterer put a stop to
``Changing Lives,'' declaring it an illegal pyramid scheme and
threatening participants with civil prosecution unless they
returned the money. Trading collapsed almost overnight. Within two
weeks, ``a lot'' of the money had been returned to its original
owners, Ketterer said.
</P>
<P>
   What's over for Ketterer, though, is not over in town.
</P>
<P>
   A month after ``Changing Lives'' broke down into a long list of
personal debts, some of the more intense participants described
communities laced with new grudges _ the kind of grudge that makes
people declare a boycott of their favorite restaurant, or look
suspiciously at a neighbor's new Harley, or consider moving to
Florida to get away from their wrecked friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Get Cheryl Breton talking about it and she starts fuming all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were your best friend and then all of a sudden they
were your worst enemy,'' said Breton, a Lewiston woman who owns
Custom Laminates . . . Plus. ``As it is today, I see these people
out, and it's like, `Don't even look at me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what Ketterer relied on in his attack on ``Changing
Lives'' was Maine's ``sense of community,'' he said. He believed
that once it became clear that trading had come to a halt, people
would decide it was more important to save their relationships than
to keep whatever money they had received. But the rounds of debt
collecting that began as soon as Ketterer cracked down were
anything but friendly, as petitioners trooped into their neighbors'
houses and offices demanding payment, and sometimes threatening
each other, according to participants.
</P>
<P>
   The wounds sustained when such a scam collapses, as they always
do, once the supply of new recruits has been exhausted, can fester
in a community for years, said Robert L. FitzPatrick, who studied
dozens of collapsed pyramid schemes for his 1997 book ``False
Profits: Seeking Financial and Spiritual Deliverance in Multi-Level
Marketing and Pyramid Schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't done by some clever confidence man,'' said
FitzPatrick, whose interest dates from his own involvement in a
failed scheme. ``If it was some sinister character who slipped into
town like the Pied Piper and lied to you, that would be one thing.
But it wasn't like that. It was your next-door neighbor. And you
recruited your brother-in-law. Now you've got to turn your finger
back on yourself, and who's going to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, FitzPatrick said, is that most people don't pay back
the money they've pocketed because they spend it immediately, and
most victims are too ashamed, or too hopeful, to demand their money
back and put a final end to the arrangement. Mike Gilbert, a
28-year-old restaurateur who brought the scheme from Lewiston to
South Paris shortly before its collapse, walked away with his own
lesson about human nature: People were far more likely to pay back
people they saw on a regular basis. While debts between people in
South Paris were cleared within a week, people from Lewiston, 40
miles away, refused to return cash to people they owed in South
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morally, they could care less,'' Gilbert said. ``They don't
have any problem taking money (from strangers).''
</P>
<P>
   Getting money back where it belongs after a speculative bubble
has burst is something like putting toothpaste back in the tube, as
the annals of mass behavior will attest. In his classic book on the
phenomenon, ``Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of
Crowds,'' Charles Mackay describes the stormy public meetings that
took place in 17th-century Holland after the crash of the market in
tulip bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious recent pyramid scheme disaster was in
Albania, where pyramid schemes grew to involve some two-thirds of
the population. When they fell apart in 1996 and 1997, the public
wrath led to a violent uprising that brought down the government
and resulted in the deaths of some 1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   In contemporary America, pyramid schemes are more likely to be
confined to small communities or what sociologists call affinity
groups _ networks with ties of trust _ and the permanent damage is
to relationships, said FitzPatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex ethical question. We're both implicated in a
scam. I got money and you lost your money, who's responsible? You
can see, talk like that is not so warm and fuzzy. The pyramid
scheme commercializes these relationships,'' he said. ``Most
relationships can't survive that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lewiston and Auburn, participants who kept money are still
waiting to see if Ketterer carries through with his threats to
bring them to court under the Unfair Trade Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   The most public fallout has involved police officers punished
for their involvement in ``Changing Lives.'' Two Lewiston officers
were suspended, one for 30 days and one for 60 days, after an
internal affairs investigation that involved 100 people, said a
police spokesman. Auburn police would not comment on the number of
officers punished, but said the officers were appealing the
decision. Breton _ a tanned woman with gold necklaces and bangles _
said the police department has been split over the ``Changing
Lives'' investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they run into a situation where there's someone holding a
gun to their heads, who's going to back them up? It's that bad,''
said Breton, who scrambled to pay a parade of creditors their
$2,000, but when money ran short, paid some $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And 25-year-old Laurie Appleton still blames authorities for
putting a halt to one of the the best things ever to happen here _
a few weeks when ``people had these feel-good vibes'' and found
common ground with people from different income levels. She has
refused to return the $3,000 she netted _ ``Who's going to make
me?'' _ and assumes that anyone who claims to have returned the
money is lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave back 40 grand, where's the rest of it? Because you
made more than 40 grand,'' she said. With investigators from the
attorney general's office urging participants to name names, that
kind of distrust is everywhere, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are disliking their neighbors, there are people that
are no longer friends,'' she said. ``If someone happened to be seen
driving a new Harley, that money was from `Changing Lives,' for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gilbert, for one, has become almost evangelical about the
evils of easy money. In the hectic weeks around Ketterer's
deadline, he raised between $120,000 and $130,000 to return to
people he had encouraged to invest in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of my employees that were involved, even our
salesmen for our food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ketterer said he still intends to bring ``Changing Lives''
operators to court _ a move unprecedented in his six years in
office, although he takes action on three or four pyramid schemes
every year.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it is hard to call Lewiston-Auburn a chastened
community. A little more than a month after ``Changing Lives'' fell
apart, an area restaurant was still dotted with pale purple fliers
for Bigsmart.com, a Las Vegas-based business that Ketterer ordered
shut down this spring after determining it, too, was an illegal
pyramid scheme. Locals are buzzing about another scheme similar to
``Changing Lives,'' in which a $1,000 pay-in is transferred to an
offshore bank.
</P>
<P>
   One local man spent the days before the attorney general's
deadline scrambling to get receipts for the $11,000 he had received
from ``Changing Lives.'' Burned by that experience, he's learned
his lesson _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way: I'd never do it again,'' he said. ``Or if I
did, I'd do it so fast it would make your head spin.''

SPOUSE IS OUTSPOKEN ON EDUCATION, CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Richard B. Cheney has built a political career as a
consensus-minded Republican with few sharp edges, his wife Lynne
has been a different kind of conservative _ a full-throated social
critic at the center of the culture wars.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney, 58, led the National Endowment for the Humanities
from 1986 to 1993, a platform from which she criticized political
correctness and feminist theory at American colleges. She became a
lightning rod for liberal scholars and many Democrats, and was
branded a traitor in 1995 when she urged Congress to end federal
funding for the NEH. The endowment experienced double-digit budget
cuts in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took on academia, which she thought was becoming too
political, too multicultural, too post-modern,'' said Harvey
Mansfield, a professor of government at Harvard University who
advised Cheney at the NEH. ``If education is the number one issue
for George W. Bush, that's certainly her specialty.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Tuesday in Austin, Governor Bush said
Lynne Cheney would be ``an incredibly important member'' of his
campaign team. Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said Mrs. Cheney
had helped the governor on education reform and would have a
speaking role at the Republican National Convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   Both friends and critics of Cheney described her as intelligent,
outspoken, and opinionated _ and more overtly ideological than her
husband or George and Laura Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney gained a national platform in 1995 as the co-host ``from
the right'' on CNN's ``Crossfire Sunday,'' where she lobbed barbs
at liberal guests on political and cultural issues. She also began
a national association for college trustees and alumni who support
tough academic standards and believe liberals have too much
influence over higher education.
</P>
<P>
   She is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute,
a Washington think tank, where she is working on a book tentatively
titled ``Schoolthink: The Ideas That Are Undermining American
Education, and What We Can Do About Them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hers is a conservatism of common sense,'' said Dinesh D'Souza,
an author and colleague of Cheney's in Washington. ``She believes
deep down that there is a certain historical truth. And she regards
as clever or ultimately malicious the people who try to deny the
existence of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was born in Casper, Wyo., attended college in Colorado
and earned a doctorate in philosophy in 19th century British
literature from the University of Wisconsin. She married Richard
Cheney in 1964, and they have two children.
</P>
<P>
   She was an editor at Washingtonian magazine when President
Reagan appointed her chairman of the NEH, which provides grants to
academics, historians, libraries, and museums, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Several scholars and humanities leaders said Cheney took a dim
view of grant proposals that reflected liberal academic theories,
such as Marxism, feminism, or postcolonial studies. Some grants for
such projects were approved, but others were rejected, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very concerned about cutting-edge types of research
that historians and others were engaged in,'' said Lee W. Formwalt,
executive director of the Organization of American Historians.
``Being a conservative, she wanted to go back to the traditional
way things were taught and researched.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney could not be reached for comment, but some of her allies
said her record was being distorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She put a stop to the political agenda at the NEH, and that's
why so many scholars are upset,'' said John Silber, the chancellor
of Boston University. He called Cheney a bulwark against political
correctness, ``the phenomenon that Western culture is no damn good
and you have to criticize it.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the NEH, Cheney supported the PBS ``Civil War''
series and a group of grants to improve libraries and preserve
books. But she became known for reports and speeches arguing that
higher education was rife with elitist, leftist scholars who
practiced historical revisionism, de-emphasizing the importance of
figures like Columbus and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, Cheney aimed her fire at a set of voluntary,
national standards for American history that were being developed
in part with NEH money she approved.
</P>
<P>
   In an Op-Ed piece for the Wall Street Journal, titled ``The End
of History,'' Cheney attacked the standards for leaving out white
males such as Albert Einstein, Robert E. Lee, and the Wright
Brothers, while making frequent mention of Harriet Tubman,
McCarthyism, and the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Gary B. Nash, a professor of history at the University of
California at Los Angeles, who helped develop the standards, cited
a letter from Cheney expressing her early support for the
standards. He said she repudiated them in order to shore up the
conservative credentials of herself and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't going to be outflanked on her right and get
attacked for funding the standards,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   In academic circles and think tanks the buzz centered on whether
Cheney would use her new profile to push her agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been very careful to build and maintain an
identity separate than Dick's, not someone trailing along, holding
his coattails,'' said Katz of Princeton. ``She sees herself as a
very independent person with her own ideas, and her own agendas.''

RAISE A TOAST TO FENWAY _ BUT IT'S PAST CLOSING TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this it? Really? Positively? Absolutely? The deal has been
struck? There is going to be a new ballpark in Boston? Cross your
heart and hope to die?
</P>
<P>
   If that is indeed the case, let the weeping begin.
</P>
<P>
   The tears that fell during the last days of Boston Garden will
seem like they came out of a solitary garden hose by the time the
Red Sox play their last game in Fenway in, oh, let's say, 2003. The
Fenway tears will be the Niagara, Angel, and Victoria Falls put
together.
</P>
<P>
   And I know me. I'll be bawling, too, right along with the most
fervent ``Save Fenway Park'' zealot.
</P>
<P>
   I know all the negatives. We will never have sight lines like
this again. But it doesn't have to be horrible. Go to Atlanta.
That's a new park, and if you're sitting down low, you'd better pay
attention, believe me.
</P>
<P>
   The cost will go up. It always does. But we're already paying
$14 and $16 just to sit in the bleachers, and I do mean ``we,''
since I'm paying $28 per to sit in reserved seats, which isn't
cheap. This is a direct result of the Red Sox having to play in the
smallest park in the major leagues, a park in which very close to
20 percent of the seating is in the aforementioned bleachers. They
have to scale the house as best they can. Given what we're paying
now, how bad can it be?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the atmosphere, the special aura of a Fenway
game. It's very special, and once they move into a new park we'll
never be able to experience that again, OK? Is that what you want
me to say? Well, all right, it's true. As long as any of us are
alive, we will watch baseballs being struck in the new place and
think about where the ball would have gone in Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   We will tell our kids and grandkids and visitors from out of
town about The Wall, the ladder, the door, the red seat, the wicked
curve around the right-field corner, the way the stands jut out
along the left-field line, the triangle, and the unique electricity
of a big game at the park that has served the professional baseball
needs of this community since the week the Titanic sank.
</P>
<P>
   But it is most definitely time. Would that I could summon an
original phraseology, but it cannot be better said than this:
nothing is forever. Updike's ``lyric little bandbox of a ballpark''
has served its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It is old and cramped. Only someone who has just been sprung
from Cedar Junction after a 20-year stay would find Fenway anything
other than a distinctly uncomfortable place in which to sit through
a three-hour ballgame. It is also tremendously overrated as a place
in which to see a game for a great many of the people who come
there. The area from first to third is OK, and left field, with its
nice embankment, is OK, and the bleachers are OK, as bleachers go,
but once you get past first base you are talking about thousands
upon thousands of flat-out crappy seats, and that's without even
mentioning the poles.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway Park is a relic from another place and time. It was
constructed in 1912 for tiny people built in the 19th century, and
nothing can change that.
</P>
<P>
   You knew the deal would get done. You knew that Mayor Menino,
Senate President Birmingham, Gov. Cellucci, and, most of all,
Speaker of the House Finneran would all need to rattle sabres, and
that it would be some kind of 11th-hour deal, because that's the
only way those people know how to do business. But it was always an
idea that, in its broadest concept, made sense. Rational and
reasonable people from the political, business, and athletic
communities all realized that a new park made sense on every level.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans will help pay via surcharges, and why shouldn't
they? There was no reason why the strong-arm tactics employed in
other locales should have been used. Politicians in other places
have conducted end runs around angry voters. There was no way that
was going to happen around here.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi's Law still applies. It won't be over until the City
Council has its say and until the Red Sox themselves figure out
more of their own financial MOs. But Tuesday's announcement
represented the necessary go-ahead rally. Messrs. Harrington,
Menino, Cellucci, Birmingham, and Finneran are standing together on
the mound, signaling for the closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Save Fenway types are firing off the e-mails even as we
speak, but it's too late now. The countdown will soon begin. The
Red Sox will build a new park that will pay homage to baseball
tradition while acknowledging a little concept known as progress.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to honor history, but it's another thing to
wallow in it. Fenway must go, and in a few years we're going to
enter the 21st century. Can this really be Boston?

GREENSPAN'S OPTIMISM KEEPS INVESTORS HAPPY _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress, delivered Tuesday and last week,
Alan Greenspan said everything was hunky-dory. Over the next few
days investors will get a chance to see if the Fed chairman's
optimism is justified.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, of course, didn't use the term hunky-dory. It isn't
technical enough. But the thrust of his testimony was about as
upbeat as anyone could have expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three key questions everyone wanted him to
answer,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA Dismal Sciences,
a Pennsylvania forecasting firm. Is the economy slowing down? Is
the slowdown for real? And finally, if the economy does slow down,
does the jobless rate have to rise beyond its current 4 percent
level to keep inflation in check?
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's answers _ yes, yes and no _ were just the ones
investors wanted to hear. Financial markets know that the economy
has to slow down from the torrid pace it maintained much of last
year and in the first quarter of this year. Continued strong growth
in the 5 to 6 percent range would have meant more inflation and
more Fed rates hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted that consumer spending has tailed off in recent
months, a development he attributed to higher interest rates, a
flat stock market, and higher oil prices. He said it was too early
to know if the slowdown would persist, but he suggested that it
might.
</P>
<P>
   In the question and answer session that followed, Greenspan made
perhaps his most significant statement. ``Do you believe you can
maintain price stability with unemployment at 4 percent?'' asked
Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican. According to the Wall
Street Journal, Greenspan said, ``I suspect yes,'' but added ``the
evidence is not yet of sufficient persuasiveness to convince
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound boring, but trust us, it isn't. In a speech in
Boston last month, Fed governor Laurence Meyer argued that the
jobless rate had to rise to the 5 percent range to assure stable
prices. Getting to that 5 percent level would require more rate
hikes, a major economic slowdown, and possibly a big stock market
correction.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say Greenspan's answer was much more market friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Ayers listened to Greenspan's testimony and came away
encouraged. ``He seemed to be saying that if the Fed is not
finished raising interest rates, they are close to being
finished,'' said Ayers, chief economist at FleetBoston Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In economics, theory quickly gets translated into practice. In
this case, the first tests will come this week.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the government releases the Employment Cost Index, a
measurement of wage and benefit gains in the second quarter. If the
strong economy is generating inflationary pressures, this will be
the first place to spot it. In April, the index showed big gains in
both wages and benefits, especially the cost of health insurance.
The news spooked the stock market and prompted the Fed to raise
interest rates in May.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the government will issue its first report on growth in
the second quarter. In the first quarter growth came in at a 5.4
percent pace. Forecasters expect something more like 3.5 percent to
4 percent this time around. A number in that range would be good
news for the stock market and Greenspan. A number considerably
higher than 4 percent would likely be greeted with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the slowdown we are looking for then the Fed can sit
on its hands for a while,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced the perfect soft landing is underway.
Some analysts believe the economy is just taking a breather before
revving up for another round of high-powered growth. They point out
that consumers are still feeling chipper _ consumer confidence rose
in June _ and people still have plenty of money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   In their weekly report on the US economy, a team of economists
at Goldman Sachs said there is more life left in the economy than
Greenspan suggests. ``We continue to think that rates will rise by
another 100 basis points in the next year,'' the Goldman economists
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Who is right? It's impossible to know. But if you were a betting
person, you'd put your money on Greenspan. Up until now, his
instincts about the economy have been on target. His faith in
technology, his belief that productivity is rising, and his
conviction that inflation is less of a problem than it has been in
the past have been borne out by the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   So don't worry and be happy _ at least until the next round of
statistics is released.

JUMBO CDS COULD ENHANCE INVESTING INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband has just passed away and I am wondering how to
best invest my money. I had a lucrative career, but left it to care
for him and now I need to be home to supervise the teenagers. I
will take a small job in September just to keep busy. I need to
live off some of the interest.
</P>
<P>
   A.P., Braintree, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Please accept my condolences on your husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   There are several routes that you could take _ one of which is
simply to do nothing. If you left the current balance in the money
market fund and withdrew $4,000 a month, until you reached age 59
1/2 and then can draw upon the IRA without penalty, you would still
have $143,551, presuming you realized average returns of 5 percent
from the Fidelity Cash Reserves account.
</P>
<P>
   But you could do much better by going to a series of CDs,
putting $100,000 each in a group of five-year jumbo CDs at
different institutions, where you could expect to get returns as
high as 7.91 percent. (That is the nation's highest rate for
five-year jumbos entering this week, offered by Capital One FSB of
Virginia, 800-564-7426.) If you made withdrawals of $4,000 a month
from these accounts, you would have $342,460 remaining at age 59
1/2. (However, those numbers won't be precise, because you will
have to settle for slightly lower rates for a few of the $100,000
accounts, and because you will need to renew the CDs at five-year
intervals _ and there is no predicting where interest rates will be
then.)
</P>
<P>
   A better tack you might take would be to assume that you might
realize $200 a week from your part-time work, so that you wouldn't
need to take withdrawals of the full $4,000 a month. If your
withdrawals were $3,296 a month and you realized that 7.91 percent
return, you would see no erosion of principal from your taxable
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that you would not have to worry too much if you make
a slight, or even significant, dent in the balance in your taxable
accounts by the time you reach age 59 1/2 is that if your IRAs are
properly invested _ that's to say if they are dominantly in stocks
or stock funds _ you should be comfortable in assuming a 10 percent
average annual total return from the IRA _ an assumption that would
take the balance to $1,572,010 by the time you reach age 59 1/2 and
can begin drawing upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you fry it, you should be quite comfortable with the
resources at hand, which are sufficient to allow you a risk-free
portfolio for income and to leave the IRA accounts in growth
vehicles to provide for your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We hope to retire at age 63 and we currently contribute
$12,000 a year to our 401(k) accounts. What are our chances of
achieving this goal?
</P>
<P>
   R.H., Sharon, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. While of course you could do it, you might be cutting it
fairly close for future comfort. Even though you should have
something in the neighborhood of $1,750,000 by the time you reach
age 63, you would need to devote about 80 percent of it to
supplying an income stream.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the ugly numbers. I used an assumption of 9 percent
average portfolio growth to come up with a projected pool of
$1,756,194 in four years, including your $1,000 monthly
contributions. If inflation averages 3.5 percent in the next four
years you will need $103,277 at that point to support a current
$90,000 lifestyle, effectively eating up the lion's share of your
pension and Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course you might say that the numbers do work _ $1.4
million to supply the income stream and $356,194 to deal with
future inflation. That's true, but with the life expectancy of
Americans ever increasing, I would like to see more buffer.
Consider that if you delayed retirement until age 64, your
projected accumulation would be $1,933,245, and your pension would
probably be a bit higher as well. The difference between having a
$500,000-plus buffer against inflation and one of a little more
than $350,000 should be worth the extra year or toil.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative, of course, would be to step up your savings
during the next four years. Your current savings rate represents a
savings rate of a little more than 8.5 percent of your earnings,
which is hardly an aggressive level for people approaching
retirement. I like the balance of your portfolio, and if you want
to strive for that age-63 retirement date, my advice would be to
save more aggressively and to retain your nicely balanced portfolio
rather than to stretch for higher portfolio returns.

   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland _ The voices clamoring for another pint
in the pubs off Duckworth Street carried the drawl of Texas, the
burr of Scotland, the lilt of Norway, as well as the salty brogue
of Atlantic Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The voices belonged to mudmen, roughnecks, geologists,
seismologists, drillers, and all the other swaggering toilers in
the gypsy trade of international oil, an industry starting to
transform the economic face of a region better known for ruined
codfish grounds, rusting shipyards, and hard luck.
</P>
<P>
   A petroleum boom is building off Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.
And many believe that vast reserves hidden beneath the cold
Atlantic waters hold not only a promise of prosperity for Canada's
poorest provinces but a big part of New England's energy future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deposits appear huge, and the gas and oil flows are
fantastic,'' said Brian Lee Crowley, head of the Atlantic Institute
for Market Studies, a Halifax-based economic think tank. ``But the
real magic ingredient is proximity to Boston and that huge, hungry
New England market.''
</P>
<P>
   Two offshore operations are in spectacular production _ the
just-completed Sable Offshore Energy project, with natural gas
flowing from six wells on the Scotian Shelf, and the three-year-old
Hibernia oil operation, rising from the North Atlantic's
treacherous ``Iceberg Alley,'' 195 miles southeast of
Newfoundland's Cape Spear.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the natural gas from the Sable fields will feed
New England's increasing appetite for the clean-burning fuel, while
much of the oil production from Newfoundland's offshore rigs will
go to US markets, primarily in the Northeast. Crude oil can be
shipped anywhere, but natural gas needs pipelines, so for decades
to come Boston will enjoy first crack at Sable's bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Newfoundland's next enormous offshore oil project,
the Terra Nova fields, 220 miles southeast of St. John's, is
nearing completion. And in Nova Scotia, scores of companies are
scouring the geological depths in an intensive search for lodes of
natural gas and oil.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 offshore test wells are expected to be drilled in
the ocean waters off Nova Scotia in coming months, at a cost
approaching $1 billion. And the province has granted an
unprecedented 43 oil exploration licenses, while auctioning search
rights for tens of thousands of square miles of undersea territory
to oil and gas companies.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the industry is drawing fire from environmentalists
and some fishermen's groups, which contend that the exploration and
development of new fields is proceeding too quickly, putting a vast
marine ecology at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have not ignited much public opposition to the
projects, and provincial government leaders note that oil companies
are operating under some of the most stringent environmental
regulations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the big boys are crowding into Halifax and St.
John's to set up full-time corporate shop _ Mobil, Shell, Marathon,
PanCanadian, Husky, Irving, to name a few. And more players from
Houston, Calgary, London, and Amsterdam are swarming into the
historic seaports; no one wants to miss out on this party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantic Canada is North America's next big energy frontier,''
said Debora Walsh, East Coast manager for the Canadian Association
of Petroleum Producers. ``The planets have come into alignment for
our oil and gas.''
</P>
<P>
   New England started reaping a share of the maritime energy
bonanza in January, as the first natural gas from the Sable
Offshore Energy fields started surging down the 653-mile-long
Maritimes &AMP; Northeast Pipeline through Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Maine, and New Hampshire before connecting to the United States gas
grid in Dracut, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Sable rigs rise from the ocean about 140 miles east of
Halifax. The $3.1 billion project takes its name from nearby Sable
Island, notorious as the ``Graveyard of the Atlantic'' because of
the hundreds of ships that have foundered on its shores and shoals
over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   After seven months in full-tilt operation, the undersea wells
feeding into Sable's hulking Thebaud, Venture, and North Triumph
platforms are producing 400 million cubic feet of natural gas per
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough gas to meet the energy needs of a city of 2.5
million people,'' said Kimberley Gildner, a spokeswoman for Sable
Offshore Energy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Geological Survey of Canada estimates that seabeds off
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia hold more undiscovered oil and gas
than even Alberta's famed ``oilpatch,'' for decades the only
world-class fount of Canadian petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very few years, a significant percentage of Canada's oil
and gas is going to be coming out of the east coast,'' said James
B. Wooder, executive director of the Halifax-based Atlantic Canada
Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is very much in its infancy here. There are still
fewer than 200 wells, most of them test wells, on the Scotian
Shelf,'' he said. ``That compares to more than 6,000 in the Gulf of
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scotian Shelf is the continental protrusion stretching off
the coast of the province. By some estimates, it may contain 18
trillion feet of natural gas in porous rock formations deep beneath
the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The other focus of Atlantic Canada's great search is
Newfoundland's Grand Banks, fairly shallow but highly dangerous
fishing grounds, which, according to the Canada-Newfoundland
Offshore Petroleum Board, contain at least 2.1 billion barrels of
crude oil and 9.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   First off the mark to exploit the trove was a consortium of
companies _ Mobil, Chevron, Petro-Canada, among others _ that built
the monstrous 735-foot Hibernia platform towering from the floor of
the Jeanne d'Arc basin, on the storm-ripped northeastern corner of
the Grand Banks.
</P>
<P>
   There were hoots, jeers, and environmental howls for the five
years it took to complete the $4.2 billion Hibernia project,
derided by many as a government-driven ``make-work'' boondoggle
meant to steal attention from the collapse of the province's cod
fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hibernia came a gusher, surpassing all production
forecasts. The project's five wells are now pumping out 150,000
barrels of oil per day, a rate that will increase to 180,000
barrels later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last decade, the quest for oil and gas off eastern
Canada was marked mostly by bad luck and false starts. The
country's first offshore well, Hillsborough No. 1, was drilled in a
quiet bay of Prince Edward Island in 1943 _ and came up dry.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s through the late 1980s, dozens of test wells were
sunk off Nova Scotia, with tantalizing results. Geologists were
convinced that mammoth deposits of gas and oil were concealed off
the eastern shores, but the quest for offshore petroleum is
extraordinarily expensive and the dangers are daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``On dry land, an exploratory well might cost $300,000.
Offshore, you're talking $30 million a pop, not exactly pocket
change even for the biggest of the big companies,'' Wooder said.
``And working hundreds of miles out on the ocean is a rather
riskier proposition than drilling a hole in some Alberta farmer's
field.''
</P>
<P>
   But the world's ever-growing thirst for oil and gas _ and rising
oil company profits _ has a way of making projects once written off
as insanely longshot gambles suddenly seem like prudent
investments.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that the Shell exploration vessel MV Western
Monarch is conducting elaborate ``3D'' seismological surveys over
1,713 square miles of ocean on the far eastern edge of the Scotian
Shelf, firing bursts of energy whose echoes paint a detailed
picture of geological formations miles under the sea bed.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is, too, that the din of machinery reverberates over
Bull Arm, Newfoundland, a dockyard where 1,300 workers are
attaching topsides to the immense floating production, storage, and
offloading vessel that will serve the offshore wells of the Terra
Nova project. The project is still under construction but scheduled
to come into production next March.
</P>
<P>
   Husky Oil Ltd. soon will decide whether to forge ahead with the
White Rose field on the Grand Banks, estimated to contain even more
natural gas than the Sable find. Mobil and Gulf are beginning
probes of a potentially oil-rich corridor off the French possession
of St. Pierre and Miquelon, islands lying just south of
Newfoundland. And PanCanadian Petroleum has acquired 6,177 square
miles of undersea territory in 15 ``exploration blocks'' that it
plans to spend $48 million probing in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland are fast becoming
important centers for oil technology and research; the two
provinces also boast the fastest-growing economies in Canada,
thanks mainly to the budding energy boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2004, Newfoundland will be producing more than one-third of
Canada's light crude oil,'' Premier Brian Tobin said. ``That's a
magnificent shift from a few years ago, when it was zero percent.''

 COLLEGE STOCK PLANS UNDERCUTTING PREPAYMENT PACKAGES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The anxiety began a year ago. Pardaman Bhan had just
finished paying off $170,000 in student loans, and the sting was
still fresh. Watching his 12-year-old son Aman playing soccer,
romping around carefree, he badly wanted to keep the crush of
college debt off of the boy's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel so burdened when you get out, that all you think
is, you have to make money,'' said the dentist. Only an aggressive
investment, he felt, would cover Aman's first tuition bill, and the
next, and the next.
</P>
<P>
   Bhan chose the U. Fund, a state-sponsored program of mutual
funds run by Fidelity Investments. The plan is one of dozens that
have sprung up nationwide since 1998, fueling a fast-growing $6
billion college-savings industry. College officials say the
programs have become the most popular way in years to pay for a
higher education, creating a whole new brand of financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``These savings plans seem to be the first kind to really
capture the attention of both politicians and the public,'' said
Philip C. Johnson, a financial planner who tracks aid issues.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity, in fact, has led to some unexpected
consequences. They're pulling families into the stock market for
the first time, but they're also siphoning money from another
savings vehicle once touted by former governor William F. Weld and
others. Called U. Plan, it is a tuition-prepayment plan that allows
families to lock in current tuition rates years in advance of
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   New data show that after just 16 months of operation, the U.
Fund is outpacing Massachusetts' older prepayment program, the U.
Plan. This year's sign-up period for the U. Plan was the worst by
far: Only 4,700 investments were made in May and June, compared to
13,805 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year-old prepayment program has $102.6 million in
assets. The U. Fund has accumulated $192.3 million in little over a
year.
</P>
<P>
   As in Massachusetts, savings programs appear to be cannibalizing
the prepayment market from coast to coast. In the last two years,
34 states have created or developed savings programs. Only seven
states have similarly embraced prepayment programs during that
time, though there are 19 of them nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are saving for their children to go to college
because of savings programs,'' said Pam Taylor, director of the
National Association of State Treasurers, which lobbies on behalf
of such plans. ``We don't care how it happens, as long as it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Families are becoming more ambitious about preparing financially
for college, say analysts who study the savings market.
</P>
<P>
   More parents are putting away money earlier than in the past, in
part because taxes on savings and prepayment accounts are deferred
until the earnings are used. Several states exempt the funds from
taxes entirely, a proposal now under consideration in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort zone with the stock market also appears to be
widening, observers say. Mutual funds still carry more risk than
the state bonds undergirding many prepayment programs, including
the U. Plan. But the potential payoff is far greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at tuition going up at a slower pace than
what they can get in the stock market,'' said Joseph Hurley, the
founder of savingforcollege.com LLC, an Internet site that provides
advice on college savings. ``And states like the savings plans
because they don't cost anything. The states can hire an investment
company that can flip the cost, so it's cheap and easy to have
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Fidelity name on the U. Fund was a lure for Richard
Connolly, a Winthrop direct-mail marketer. He has invested about
$150,000 so far in U. Fund accounts for his three children _ money
he said he would be less likely to entrust to the government-run
prepayment program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd feel more confident with Fidelity than with any
state-managed program,'' Connolly said. ``Government management
isn't necessarily that which private industry is.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials say their prepayment program is a solid,
safe investment, but they add that changes in higher education have
diminished the luster of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition, for instance, has stopped soaring. Prepayment programs
sprung up in Massachusetts and elsewhere in the mid-1990s to offer
a hedge against tuition inflation after years of double-digit
increases. Sticker prices have been rising only about 5 percent a
year recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tuition rates start to rise again and the markets aren't so
good, people may think that prepaid programs are more
advantageous,'' said Scott Prince, director of external relations
for the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority, which
created both programs and runs the prepayment option.
</P>
<P>
   But some financial planners aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaying tuition limits parents' choices to Massachusetts
colleges and can become too complicated, said Andrew Schwartz of
Schwartz &AMP; Schwartz PC in Woburn, Mass. None of his firm's 1,000
clients has asked about the U. Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead in the water,'' Schwartz said of the prepayment
program. ``It's too intangible. If the person's child goes to
college in the state, it's a piece of cake because tuition's paid
for. But if not, it seems like a nightmare in figuring out how
you're going to get your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers also chafe at prepayment programs' restricted
benefits, which are mostly limited to in-state campuses. The
Massachusetts U. Plan is one of the most innovative because it
includes many private colleges, such as Boston College and Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bernard Pekala, BC's director of financial aid, said he
prefers the savings program as an investment, especially for
parents who have young children and may be eyeing an expensive
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for a family with a 5-year-old kid to be
that risk averse,'' Pekala said. ``If you have 10 to 15 years to
utilize the funds, the history of the market is that the investment
will perform much better.''
</P>
<P>
   An elite few, such as Harvard University and Williams College,
have resisted joining the prepayment program, despite pressure from
Weld and others. Officials at those schools cite concerns about
financial aid that puts families in the prepayment program at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the formula that qualifies students for financial aid, a
dollar of prepaid tuition can reduce each dollar of possible aid.
MEFA has asked colleges to reduce a student's loan burden first,
when possible, before taking away grant money as a result of
prepaid tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The formula treats savings plans and most other investments more
favorably. For U. Fund savings accounts in a parent's name, for
example, only 6 percent is counted against a student's eligibility
for aid.
</P>
<P>
   MEFA officials and their colleagues elsewhere are lobbying the
federal government to change the aid formula to benefit prepayment
plans as well.
</P>
<P>
   For now, parents who considered both the savings and prepayment
options seem to be casting their lot with the savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bhan, who is also putting away money for his daughter, shunned
prepaying tuition because he didn't want his children locked in to
attending a Massachusetts college. Right now, he added, the stock
market seems both a safe and strong bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the children will have in mind when it's
time to go to college,'' he said. ``So I felt, the more the
options, the better.''

BOOKING ON A BABY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and l coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENNINGTON, Vt. _ Kristina Criss looked on with a cheek-to-cheek
grin as her son Seth devoured his new book, ``Pussycat Pussycat.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Criss's pediatrician said, the 6-month-old will
actually read the book, rather than chomping on its corners with
his toothless mouth. Regardless, Dr. Donna Miller said, the book
was a gift for Seth to do with as he saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this age, they're going to chew their books more than
listen to you read them,'' Miller told Criss, as Seth gurgled on
the examining table. ``You give him another few months, and he'll
be pointing things out on the pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the scenes playing out across Vermont these days, a few
weeks into an ambitious, privately financed program that promises
every baby born in Vermont this year a small library of books. The
program, Born to Read 2000, comes in the form of a tote bag full of
children's books, a videotape instructing parents on how to read to
a newborn, and a list of other age-appropriate books.
</P>
<P>
   The packages, distributed at a baby's six-month checkup, will
likely make their way into more than 7,000 homes this year, said
Maxine Brandenburg, president of the Vermont Business Roundtable, a
group of 115 Vermont CEOs who dreamed up the program and provided
much of the more than $500,000 to put it together.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the program is that, when it comes to child
development, there's not much time to waste. Research into the
cognitive development of infants has shown that exposure to books
at a young age accelerates and aids a child's ability to speak,
understand, and read, said Dr. Paula Duncan, principal assistant to
the secretary of the Vermont Department of Health and a
pediatrician who helped develop Born to Read.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the need to help parents expose their infants to
books is apparent in the findings of several recent reports.
According to the National Survey of Kindergarten Teachers, 28
percent of Vermont's kindergartners are ill-prepared to participate
successfully in school. One reason, specialists say, is that many
parents are incapable of preparing their children. About 12 percent
of Vermont adults are are illiterate and cannot read a children's
book, according to the National Institute for Literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, developers of Born to Read 2000 say they want the program
to help acquaint parents with books as well. One last goody in the
tote bag is a voucher for another free book, which parents can pick
up at their local library. The idea is to get parents interested in
their public libraries, in hopes that they might like what they
see, said Grace Greene, children's services consultant for the
Vermont Department of Libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, the important part is for people to
understand that they have a lifelong supply of books in their
public libraries,'' said Greene, who developed the voucher idea.
``What we hope is the voucher will take people into public
libraries that would not normally go in. People don't always know
that there are materials for very young children in libraries, and
that material has grown tremendously recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled in part after Reach Out and Read, an early childhood
literacy program developed in the late 1980s by doctors at the
Boston City Hospital, Born to Read 2000 is the result of more than
a year's worth of development and collaboration by Vermont
corporations, educators, public agencies, doctors, and librarians
on a level never before attempted.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Reach Out and Read, which requires participating
pediatricians to raise the money for the books, Born to Read
provides the books to the doctors. So far, however, the fledgling
program only has enough funding to provide books for babies born
this year, and only for their six-month visit, Brandenburg said. By
comparison, Reach Out and Read provides books to children at
various intervals until their fifth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether enough companies and donors will
sign on to make Born to Read permanent, Brandenburg said, although
officials are busy trying to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Born to Read 2000 has Vermont's literacy advocates
beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those programs that you have dreams about,''
said Sally Anderson, executive director of the Vermont Center for
the Book, an affiliate agency of the Library of Congress that
promotes early literacy. ``You always hoped, maybe someday, every
child in the state will get a packet of books from the doctor, and
then it actually happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people across the state are working to ensure that
all the babies born this year will get their tote bag _ no easy
feat, given the patchwork of tiny hamlets that constitute the
majority of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Vermont Business Roundtable began
shipping out shrink-wrapped packages from the warehouse
distribution center of one company in the organization. Another
corporation produced the instructional video, and still others
orchestrated advertising campaigns that have barraged the public in
newspapers and on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so exciting because, all of the sudden, we had the
experience and the resources of the business community to help out
with early childhood education,'' Duncan said. ``It said something
to many of us, that if they could put in such an effort, the rest
of us could too. The response has been excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Duncan and others readily admit that Born to Read
may, in the end, do little to change attitudes among some parents
toward the importance of books and reading. After all, some said,
several parents may simply chuck the bag in the corner and never
glance that way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really talking about with this program is changing
the culture, and clearly, that's an uphill battle the whole way,''
said Anderson, of the Vermont Center for the Book. ``As a one-shot
deal, skepticism of this program is certainly well-founded. Will
this book make any big changes? I doubt it. But it's a great start,
and we have to keep pushing forward.''

POPULISM'S FAMOUS FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has been an environmentalist, a centrist, an alpha male, an
earth-toned model, and a vice president. Now Al Gore is becoming a
populist, a label with a stirring, but not winning, history.
</P>
<P>
   America's most famous populist, William Jennings Bryan, died in
Gore's home state 75 years ago today (July 26). Bryan's career had
as many dips and hollows as the hills of Tennessee, but his beliefs
were rooted in the dictionary aim of populism: ``a more equitable
distribution of wealth and power.''
</P>
<P>
   But who would distribute what? That question has dominated
American politics ever since Bryan denounced Wall Street in three
losing campaigns as the Democratic nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes to co-opt a minor candidate, Ralph Nader of the
Greens, who has a clear vision: more regulation and more
government. In 1896, Bryan pilfered the populist platform of the
People's Party, which in 1892 had won three states and 22 electoral
votes. Its platform resonated with echoes heard today: ``We meet in
the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political, and
material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot-box, the
Legislatures, the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan seized on a populist cure, ``free and unlimited coinage of
silver and gold,'' that would help farmers with mortgages. The gold
standard was the enemy, Bryan said, and treating gold and silver
alike would mean cheaper money.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, he was only a two-term congressman from Nebraska, but
Bryan's oratory swept the Democratic convention in Chicago by
denouncing ``sound money'' forces. He warned Wall Street: ``You
shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns;
you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The poet Vachel Lindsay, 16 at the time, later rhapsodized:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I brag and chant of Bryan, Bryan, Bryan,
</P>
<P>
   Candidate for president who sketched a silver Zion,
</P>
<P>
   The one American poet who could sing outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That he did, some 600 times, whistle-stopping for 18,000 miles,
the first presidential candidate to speak for himself. His
opponent, William McKinley, campaigning from his front porch in
Ohio, won with 271 electoral votes to Bryan's 176. Republicans
outspent Democrats by a 30-1 margin. Voter turnout was 79 percent.
It was the first modern presidential campaign featuring, as Lindsay
wrote, ``All the funny circus silks/Of politics unfurled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan ran against McKinley again in 1900, but downplayed free
silver. In 1908, again the nominee, he injected his Christian
fundamentalism into politics. ``He gradually forsook politics for
more ghostly concerns,'' H. L. Mencken wrote in an obituary. Those
beliefs brought him to the Tennessee town of Dayton in 1925 as the
special prosecutor of John T. Scopes, accused of teaching Charles
Darwin's theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The play and film, ``Inherit the Wind,'' show how the defense
lawyer, Clarence Darrow, tricked his old political ally, Bryan,
into denying that man was a mammal. A few days after Scopes was
convicted and dismissed with a $100 fine, Bryan died in his sleep
at 65.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan made populism a captive of the Christian right. Today's
Democratic Party is home to the heathen left, a skeptical lot. Gore
must mesh the left's social-sexual agenda with populism, without
offending too many campaign contributors. To big business, populism
is a crackpot notion. In Bryan's era, voters agreed. In today's era
of 401(k)s, when half of US households invest in the stock market
and two-thirds own their own homes, will voters buy populism?

   Making big tobacco and big oil the John T. Scopes of 2000 is a
formidable task for Gore, but he can at least depend on home state
loyalty. Mencken called Bryan ``a charlatan, a mountebank, a zany
without sense or dignity,'' but admitted: ``His place in Tennessee
hagiography is secure. If the village barber saved any of his hair,
then it is curing gallstones down there today.''

`CATHOLICISM USA' REPORT CALLS CLERGY OLDER, WEALTHIER, FEWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Catholics in the United States are increasingly affluent and
well-educated.
</P>
<P>
   They have followed the job market out of the Northeast, causing
a wave of parish closings in this region and wave of parish
construction in the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of clergy are plummeting, while the ranks of lay
leadership are skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the conclusions of ``Catholicism USA,'' a
compilation of research on Catholics in the United States over the
last century. This new printed database was published by the Center
for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the whole 20th Century, it's just amazing the
amount of change that's taken place,'' said Mary L. Gautier, who
co-authored the book with Bryan T. Froehle. ``There have been
remarkable adaptations, so that declines in one area are matched by
tremendous growth in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the 20th Century, the Catholic population in
the United States has quintupled, so that the group now makes up an
estimated 27 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics are by far the nation's largest single denomination _
there are more than four times as many Catholics as Southern
Baptists, the next biggest denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The church's growth rate, however, is far outpaced by churches
such as the Mormons, Pentecostal Assemblies, and Assemblies of God.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics, characterized early in the century by European
immigrants in the Northeast and Midwest, are now more reflective of
the nation as a whole. The church is more diverse, with large
numbers of immigrants from Latin America, and more dispersed, with
Catholics now living in virtually every metropolitan area of the
country. But even though there is a sizable new immigrant
population, it makes up a smaller percentage of the overall
Catholic population.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics, like other religious groups in the United States,
have seen a surge in intermarriage _ more than one-third of all
marriages registered by the church are of a Catholic to a
non-Catholic, the book found. Adult conversions to Catholicism are
helping the church retain numbers in the face of other Catholics
who have left the church, the book said.
</P>
<P>
   And despite church concern about divorce, Catholics are divorced
at the same rate as the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics have also become more affluent. Catholics tend to be
slightly more highly educated and wealthier than Protestants, the
book found.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Catholics who tell pollsters that they
attended Mass over the seven days before being queried dropped from
74 percent in 1958 to 48 percent in 1988, and even that figure is
thought to be exaggerated. Church officials now believe that about
30 percent of US Catholics attend a weekend Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings of the book:
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of nuns on Catholic school faculties dropped
from 75 percent in 1950 to 6 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   --Priests are getting older. Fewer than one in five is under age
45.
</P>
<P>
   --The number of lay ministers is booming. There are more than
26,000 lay ministers helping to lead parishes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   --At the same time, the number of parishes without a resident
priest jumped from 500 in 1960 to 2,500 today.
</P>
<P>
   --The number of Catholic missionaries from the United States
dropped from about 8,000 in 1970 to about 4,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   --The most Catholic place in the country is Brownsville, Texas,
which claims to have an 85 percent Catholic population.
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of Catholic children in Catholic schools
dropped from 33 percent in 1950 to 16 percent in 1998.

CHENEY'S CONSERVATISM MERGES WITH A MODERATE'S STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a top Republican in the US House, Dick Cheney
outdid the National Rifle Association in his opposition to gun
control. He was an impassioned backer of aid to the Nicaraguan
contras but declined to join a call for South Africa to free Nelson
Mandela. And he made no exceptions in his opposition to federal
funding for abortions, even in cases of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in short, compiled one of the most conservative voting
records of any member of Congress in the 1980s. Yet the civility of
his personal style and his earlier service as chief of staff to
President Ford lent him moderate credentials that softened his
image over the years.
</P>
<P>
   While in the House from 1979 to 1989, Cheney sided with one of
the most conservative Washington watchdogs, the American
Conservative Union, 91 percent of the time. That is 10 to 20 points
higher than the average Republican during the period. Moreover,
Cheney's voting record became more conservative the longer he
served in Congress, reflecting his rise in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He won those ratings with his backing of the contras and a
resolute opposition to abortion. He also, partly as a reflection of
his Wyoming roots, gained a reputation as one of the most hardened
opponents of gun control, going even further than the NRA suggested
when he was one of only four House members to oppose a ban on
plastic guns used by terrorists to avoid detection by airport
security. Cheney also opposed a ban on armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   At other ideological checkpoints, too, Cheney was consistent in
his conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   He voted against the creation of the Department of Education and
opposed funding for the Head Start program. He was one of only 16
House members who voted in 1983 against a nonbinding measure to
protect a nutrition program for women, infants, and children from
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he voted against a sense-of-the-House resolution
calling on the white-controlled government in South Africa to free
the Mandela. (He eventually was released in 1990.) Cheney also
opposed economic sanctions against South Africa. He voted against
measures that sought to ensure the application of a variety of US
civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did break occasionally with the Reagan administration,
disagreeing with the way the White House was compromising with
Democrats on tax reform. In his rare breaks with the American
Conservative Union, Cheney supported multibillion-dollar foreign
aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Armitage, a former Defense Department official who has
long been a close Cheney associate, said Cheney's dual reputation
as a conservative with a moderate patina can be easily explained.
Cheney voted conservatively as a House Republican leader. But
earlier, as Ford's chief of staff from 1975 to 1976, Cheney was
perceived as more moderate because he had to work daily with
Democrats to get legislation through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a rabid partisan, particularly with a
Democratic-controlled Congress, and get things done,'' Armitage
said. ``Democracy is the art of compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Cheney was elected to Congress in 1978, and especially
as he ascended in the Republican leadership, his priorities changed
and he worked hard to avoid compromise. But he did so in a
temperate, well-mannered style that was a marked contrast to that
of another rising Republican leader, Newt Gingrich, who eventually
became speaker by demonizing Democrats as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, who has known Cheney for 30 years, said the former
Wyoming congressman is a different kind of conservative than the
Gingrich model. While Gingrich presented himself as a
``revolutionary,'' Cheney was ``more classically conservative. He
believed in the institutions of government and wanted to make them
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick is a partisan but in a different way; he doesn't want to
demonize the enemies,'' Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Newton Democrat, who served
with Cheney in the House, said: ``He was a deeply committed
conservative. Cheney is an example of how you can get a reputation
as a moderate if you don't yell at anybody, unlike Gingrich. But he
is very, very right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frank recalled two incidents where Cheney showed a more
moderate side. In 1991, when Cheney was defense secretary and
testified before a House committee, Frank asked him about the
military's military ban on gays. Frank said Cheney characterized
the ban as an ``old chestnut,'' an ambiguous statement that may
have helped set the stage for the Pentagon to adopt the ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Frank said, he told Cheney that US military
academies were requiring some students to lose scholarship money if
they were gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `That's not fair,' '' Frank said, and the policy was
eventually changed.
</P>
<P>
   David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said
it was notable that Cheney often scored much higher in the group's
voting scorecard than most Republicans. For example, in 1985, the
average Republican voted with the conservative union 77 percent of
the time, while Cheney had a 100 percent record. Similarly, in
1986, the average Republican score was 74 percent, while Cheney had
100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a conservative member of Congress, probably in
the top 10 percent,'' Keene said. ``But not only was he
conservative, he was a conservative who got along with everybody.
He was a right-winger who wasn't offensive about it.''

WITH CHENEY, A MAN OF CHARACTER AND COMPETENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To those of us yet unpersuaded of the leadership qualities of
George ``Dubbaya'' Bush, his selection of Dick Cheney as running
mate is a big plus, if you happen to know Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington knows Dick Cheney. As former chief of staff to
President Ford in the '70s, as a Wyoming congressman for a decade,
and as defense secretary to President Bush the Elder, Cheney is a
man of character and competence and now of consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else the Texas governor does in this campaign, he has
already surpassed his father in plucking a running mate from the
GOP political tree. Twelve years ago this summer, Bush the First
ransacked the census lists for the person most qualified, in his
mind, to take over the presidency, and came up with: Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   That baffling selection probably should have prepared us for
Bush Sr.'s equally baffling late declaration that when it came to
filling a Supreme Court vacancy, Clarence Thomas was the finest
legal mind in America at that particular moment. I doubt even
Thomas thought that.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney, while little-known to average voters, is a far
superior choice, and Bush the Younger will get points from the
inside-the-Beltway crowd for tapping a man with obvious
qualifications. The selection of the man he'd initially charged
with shuffling the resumes of all the potential running mates
suggests Cheney wore well through the bureaucratic paper-shuffling.
</P>
<P>
   That's important because a lot of what the VP does is sit around
chewing the fat with the prez and the chief of staff as they try to
figure out ``what the hell are we going to do about
such-and-such?'' And that always leads to calls to have more paper
sent in, and more shuffling, and more fat-chewing.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did all that for Gerry Ford, an underrated president and
one of many presidents (Truman, Johnson, Nixon, Bush the First) who
came out of the VP broom closet and took over the big desk. As the
Globe's White House correspondent when Cheney ran the staff for
Ford, I saw the pair make the best of a tumultuous succession after
the Nixon debacle. They lost the next election, but there was no
question Ford handed over the keys to a country in far better shape
than when he'd hurriedly taken over.
</P>
<P>
   And Cheney was a big part of that. He is one of the grownups,
and his choice is reassuring because Young Bush has not stilled
doubts in some sectors that he is a little callow, a bit goofy, not
quite ready to sit at the big people's table.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility _ devoutly to be wished _ that
Cheney's designation will yank the campaign up to a higher level
than the quadrennial autumnal trashing that came into fashion with
the Bush-Dukakis campaign of '88. That year, Bush Jr. sat at the
knee of the late Lee Atwater, the dreaded dark angel of negative
campaigning, as the Bush camp savaged Dukakis as unpatriotic and
unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Running mates have to carry not only water for their patrons,
but typically they carry mud as well. But Cheney will not be a
willing dupe for the Republican slash-and-burn boys. And if Al Gore
picks a running mate of matching qualities, there's perhaps a
chance we'll escape the rubbish bin.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney survived a vetting process he was supposedly running
himself. George W. couldn't get Colin Powell, and he couldn't stand
John McCain. The wounds opened by Bush's trashing of McCain in
South Carolina and some other early primary states left McCain with
a personal beef against Bush. And regardless of the large number of
GOP congressmen yearning to have McCain and his magic on the ticket
this November, Bush fears the Arizonan because he cannot dominate
him.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's negatives? He only brings Wyoming's paltry three
electoral votes, which Bush had anyway. Cheney has suffered three
mild heart attacks in the '80s, and health concerns are always
magnified in national campaigns. Cheney is not a fire-breather on
the stump. Balding, tending to portly, calm and unruffled, he looks
the career middle manager, exuding quiet competence. He is the
antithesis of flash-and-dash. Or gash. He'll not be a willing
accomplice in any kind of gutter campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And he's from the oil industry, having cashed in $5 million in
options on rising oil prices. If gasoline prices stay high or
average $2 a gallon by election day, the Democrats will slap the
Big Oil tag on Bush, himself a creature of the oil industry, and
his running mate. That should neutralize the blame for high energy
costs that Republicans will try to hang on Clinton-Gore, so that
issue is probably a wash in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Old Yankee clipper ship skippers preferred vessels that had
``bottom,'' the ability to ride out a hard blow. ``Bottom'' is what
some of us worry about in George Dubbaya. He's been a kid of
privilege who surfed easily through life and school and the Air
Force Reserve and his Texas ``bidness,'' largely on family
connections. If his first big decision is Dick Cheney, that's a
good sign, at least, that at least he knows ``bottom'' when he sees
it. And Cheney's mettle may cause outsiders to think of this as the
Kangaroo Ticket, where the hind legs are a lot stronger than the
front.

CHENEY'S BUSINESS DEALINGS MAY RAISE EYEBROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the last five years, Dick Cheney has been the
epitome of the globe-trotting business baron. As chairman of the
Halliburton Co., which has 100,000 employees in 130 countries,
Cheney has earned tens of millions of dollars for overseeing
mergers, building a baseball stadium, and boosting the company's
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Halliburton's dealings are bound to be
controversial. Under Cheney, for example, the company has conducted
business in Iran and Libya by carefully maneuvering around US
sanctions, using foreign-based subsidiaries and foreign workers.
Moreover, Cheney has frequently fought to lift US sanctions against
oil-rich Iran despite concerns about terrorist activity by that
country, and he has even raised the notion, heretical in GOP
circles, of revisiting the wisdom of American sanctions against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney's tenure at the head of the Dallas-based energy and
construction company is one of the least-known aspects of his
career, it is also one of the most revealing. After serving in
government for nearly two decades, Cheney's experience and
connections helped him expand Halliburton's business.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House chief of staff, former US House member,
and former defense secretary has traveled from Bangladesh to
Newfoundland in successful efforts to win oil-drilling contracts
for his company. Just last month, Cheney said in a speech in Canada
that the United States should lift sanctions against Iran and allow
US oil companies to invest there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a decision not to allow US firms to invest
significantly in Iran, and I think that's a mistake,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also has said that unilateral sanctions against other
countries are ``unwise.'' Speaking at the libertarian Cato
Institute in 1988, Cheney broached a possible loosening of the
trade embargo against Cuba, suggesting a free trade enclave could
be established. Cheney also declared that unilateral economic
sanctions ``almost never work.'' Often, he said, they are prompted
more by domestic political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Brink Lindsey, the director of the Cato Institute's Center for
Trade Policy Studies, said Cheney's objections to the unilateral
use of economic sanctions would be a welcome change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
candidate who tapped Cheney Tuesday as his running mate, could not
be reached for comment about the Texas governor's views on
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   David Lesar, the chief operating officer at Halliburton who is
slated to take Cheney's place as chairman on Aug. 15, said Cheney
opposed unilateral sanctions because they put the company at a
disadvantage against multinational concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our competition is non-US companies,'' Lesar said.
``We do operate in some other sanctions-countries by complying with
sanctions rules. You operate in those countries using non-US
subsidiaries and non-US employees.'' Lesar said he couldn't specify
the amount of business that Halliburton does in Iran and Libya, but
he called it ``not substantial.'' The United States has sanctions
against those two countries due to concerns about state-sponsored
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   If Cheney becomes vice president, he will almost certainly be
one of Bush's principal foreign policy advisers. And Halliburton is
likely to have interests in almost any major country that presents
a diplomatic problem. For example, Halliburton, with nearly $15
billion in revenue last year, has major business deals in Russia
and Nigeria. In addition, Cheney is also a corporate director of
such giant companies as Proctor &AMP; Gamble, TRW, US West, and
Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar said Cheney transformed Halliburton during his five years
there, doubling the company's size largely through acquisitions,
most notably the $6.2 billion purchase of Dresser Industries Inc.,
in September 1998. The purchase temporarily made Halliburton the
largest employer in Texas, although that status has changed with
the recent sale of some subsidiaries. Halliburton is still a huge
force in Bush's home state, however, with about 30,000 employees,
and it is the No. 2 employer in Houston. It ranks 115th on the
Fortune 500.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresser purchase was a major move that could determine
Cheney's legacy at the company, according to Prudential Securities
analyst Jeffrey Freedman. So far, Freedman said, analysts are
watching to see ``if Halliburton can start to demonstrate an
improvement in results.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's fortunes followed the seesaw of oil prices. The
stock was around $30 when Cheney took over, climbed to $63, dropped
to $26 and closed Tuesday at $42 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar, asked whether Halliburton has conducted business with
Bush or his administration, said the company won no contracts
through Cheney's friendship with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick was active as any major CEO in the state would be, in
terms of education and taxation and environmental issues, in
addition to knowing the governor and working with his father,''
Lesar said. Halliburton not only is the world's largest oilfield
services company, it also is the construction giant that built the
new Enron Field baseball stadium in downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's role at the company was more visionary than hands-on.
One of his most valuable assets was his knowledge of government
officials and world leaders, a benefit of his decades in public
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was helpful in raising our profile in our operations,''
Lesar said. ``He could go in and visit with heads of state, with
ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, an environmental group that has backed vice
president al Gore, said Tuesday that Halliburton has a string of
environmental problems, ranging from asbestos claims to toxic sites
that must be cleaned up under federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton, despite its size, is not among the numerous Texas
corporations, many of them also in energy-related businesses, which
have bankrolled much of the Bush campaign effort. Officials of
Halliburton have donated just $15,000 to the Bush campaign, with
the maximum allowed of $2,000 from Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, according to campaign finance reports, the
company has also donated $80,000 in so-called ``soft money'' to the
Republican National Committee. But that amount, too, is relatively
small. Enron, another Texas energy giant, has given the RNC
$420,000 in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has become very rich as a result of his work. Last year,
he earned $1.28 million in salary and $640,914 in other
compensation, as well as stock options that could be worth up to
$18.8 million, according to an analysis by Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, Cheney cashed in 100,000 shares of stock just as it
neared a one-year high, which resulted in a $5 million payout,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission report.
</P>
<P>
   If Cheney is elected vice president, he would earn $181,400 per
year.

 PORTLAND, Maine: ... elite ranks.

<P>
   Fresh Samantha juices are the basis of the drinks at Fresh
Samantha Juice Bar. For the most part, they are pure juice and
fruit, not diluted with sherbet and yogurt and lots of ice. These
are smoothies to swoon over, particularly Passionate C, which
contains prickly pear juice, passion fruit, pineapple, banana, and
extra vitamin C. Owner Doug Levin loves coconut, so naturally
there's a coconut cream drink, which also includes pineapple and
orange juice, lime, and bananas. ``It's a tropical vacation,'' says
Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's experiments begin here, and like most
other juice bars aiming for a health-conscious audience, this one
offers all kinds of add-ins like St. John's wort, ginseng,
echinacea, and wheat grass. Some of the best items are the
plainest, because the bottled juices are so good to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   This flagship shop (there's only one, with no more expected), a
short walk from Commercial Street, is decorated with the same
curly-haired happy little girl smacking her lips who appears on all
bottles of the company's juices.
</P>
<P>
   There is something of the elated child in Levin, too, who seems
genuinely mystified that he has the good fortune to own a
successful company. ``I'm not a good person with responsibility,''
he says. He is full of ideas, especially the good one he had when
he named his company after his daughter, Samantha, and when his
wife, Abby Carter, a children's book illustrator, began drawing a
cheerful cartoon version of her. Levin and Carter, both 39, founded
the company in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Samantha juices have taken off up and down the East Coast,
with the company acting as its own distributor. All the juices are
highly perishable, and as a result, says Levin, ``this is a very
hard business to make money in. The only way to make this thing
work is to have volume.''
</P>
<P>
   So last February, Levin merged with the California-based Odwalla
company, the West Coast version of Samantha and one of the national
leaders in the business. Levin and Carter received about $25
million in stock; she will continue to do the illustrations, and he
becomes president of the new company. He's not sure what that
means. ``I'm becoming the queen of England,'' he muses.
</P>
<P>
   The Fresh Samantha juice factory will remain in Saco, where the
juices are made, and the label will stay the same. Levin and
Carter, along with Samantha, now 8, and Carter, 5, are moving to
San Francisco next month.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met as students at Wesleyan College. ``She took me
into a life of adulthood,'' Levin says. Before Maine, they lived in
Manhattan, where she was an illustrator at Gem Studios and he was
an art director for Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. ``I worked on British
Airways, Con Ed, the Spanish tourism board, and a lot of cereals,''
he says, then adds, ``I can't even draw.'' He began his career as a
secretary at Doyle Dane &AMP; Bernbach.
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved to Maine to escape the frenzy of their New York
lives. Carter told Levin that she wouldn't move unless he had a
job. So he went to work for her parents in a newly founded sprout
business they ran from their basement. ``I drove a beat-up Chevy
truck and listened to the radio,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha was 2 when Levin, his in-laws, and his brother-in-law,
Michael Carter, a marine engineer, bought a local juice company and
started making carrot juice. Carter drew the cartoons of the little
girl, and pretty soon everyone who noticed the juice bought it. By
the end of last year, when Forbes magazine ranked it number 9 in a
list of ``100 Things Worth Every Penny'' (along with Bose radios, a
KitchenAid mixer, Parma ham, and Petrossian caviar), the company
had sales of $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who claims he wasn't destined to succeed.
Levin was raised in Brussels because his father got into a big
argument with his grandfather (Levin's father thought of the move
as reversed immigration).
</P>
<P>
   Both of his parents owned restaurants in Brussels, and as a boy
he washed dishes. Scrubbing pots, he says, ``I vowed I wouldn't get
into the food business.'' He didn't do well in the famously tough
French education system, so he was sent to Phillips Exeter Academy.
``My parents picked it because it was a snobby school,'' he says.
``Grim teachers, grim climate.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wesleyan, he hung out with a bunch of guys he describes as
``Peter Pan.'' He has barely squeaked out of that category. Now
that he's moving to San Francisco, he says, he thinks he should do
something about his ``worn-out, stressed-out, disheveled'' look,
and his ``crumbled shirt.'' In some ways, he likes the idea of
heading west. Ever since his childhood as an American abroad, out
of synch with the local culture, ``I've been obsessed with finding
the place,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He'll fly back and forth between coasts, returning to Saco to
check in at the juice factory. ``That's OK,'' he says. ``I like
being in motion.''
</P>
<P>
   His original mission to find peace failed. ``I went back to the
same stressful life I had in New York,'' he says, ``like a
boomerang.''

<P>
   The most successful magazine startup of the '90s was In Style.
Spun off from People, In Style is part fashion book, part shelter
book, and all soft-focus celebrity celebration: just the place to
get up close and innocuous with your favorite personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The most talked-about magazine startup of the '90s was Talk,
Tina Brown's attempt to show that (having remade The Tatler, Vanity
Fair, and The New Yorker) she could start a magazine from scratch _
and have an equity stake, to boot. Twelve months into its
existence, Talk is . . . well, it's hard to say, exactly, other
than that it certainly hasn't been the buzz-generating, ad-heavy
smash trumpeted by all the launch hype.
</P>
<P>
   As chance (and lead times) would have it, In Style and Talk have
the same August cover: actress-model Elizabeth Hurley, fresh from
her breakup with actor Hugh Grant. The In Style Hurley looks dewy
and fresh, as if she'd stepped out of an Estee Lauder ad (turn the
page, and there she is in an Estee Lauder ad). The look is in
keeping with In Style's tone of unrelenting niceness. How nice? A
few years ago it showed Sharon Stone _ Sharon Stone! _ baking
cookies. It's a world so nice the reader could easily imagine
herself _ and make no mistake, it's female readers In Style targets
_ fitting right in and being part of the scene. The one problem
with In Style, from a circulation point of view, is that no dentist
in his or her right mind would ever put it in a waiting room.
Everyone in it is always smiling, and those teeth, those teeth,
they're all so perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The Talk Hurley looks like Mrs. Hyde to In Style's Dr. Jekyll.
In fact, she'd make you want to hide, she looks that louche and
gamy. Forget Estee Lauder. This woman's auditioning for the lead in
a low-budget version of ``The Jackie Collins Story.'' Inside,
there's a double-truck photo of a bikini'd Hurley sticking her
tongue out at a boa constrictor that rests (if that is the correct
verb) between her legs. Ho, ho, the reader thinks, we're in for the
good stuff now. ``Kids, go clean your room and leave me alone for
half an hour.'' But, no, Talk's Hurley _ or ``Elizabeth,'' as Mimi
Swartz delights in referring to her throughout _ is just as
girl-next-door-unobjectionable and (dare one say it?) as nice as In
Style's Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is Talk wants to have it both ways: to titillate
the reader while flattering the celebrity. During the palmy days
before Talk debuted, Tina Brown kept talking about her vision of it
as ``a cultural search engine.'' Here, too, one sees the wish to
have it both ways. ``Cultural search engine'' just sounds so
dynamic and up-to-the-minute, doesn't it, as if Brown's been
secretly editing Wired or something under an assumed name. Yet the
August Talk relies on that hoariest of editorial standbys, the book
excerpt _ not just one, but three (from Wayne Barrett's Rudy
Giuliani bio, Joe Eszterhas's ``American Rhapsody,'' and the
memoirs of interior decorator Sister Parish), and guess what: Two
of the books are already in stores, and the other's about to be.
Perhaps one editor's cultural search engine is another's
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   A reader may or may not think much of what In Style does, but
what it does it does very well indeed. More to the point, it knows
exactly what it wants to do. The same cannot be said for Talk.
Might that have something to do with the fact that the most
talked-about startup of the '90s and the most successful fail to be
one and same publication?

   From rehashings of Liz Hurley's love life to examining the
annual scavenging of more than 300 freighters and tankers on a
beach in southern India by desperately poor workers: It's hard to
imagine anything more different _ in life or print. It's also hard
to imagine anything more different in quality. William
Langewiesche's ``The Shipbreakers,'' in the August Atlantic
Monthly, is absolutely extraordinary journalism. Over the past
decade, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have come to dominate the
scrapping of obsolete ships. Langewiesche describes how. He also
describes, in mesmerizing detail, how a ship of many thousands of
tons will be beached, carved up, and sold for scrap. Nor does he
neglect to convey how hard, dangerous, and ill-paid the work is.
</P>
<P>
   This is about as good as reporting gets, but Langewiesche takes
it beyond the realm of facts to that of ideas, for there are moral
and political ramifications here that extend far beyond the Indian
littoral. Greenpeace has trained its sights on Alang (the location
Langewiesche writes about and, incidentally, the subject of a photo
essay in the August Wired) as a prime example of the First World
dumping its environmental sins on the Third World (the vessels
abound in hazardous wastes and other pollutants). Those same ships,
however, provide a livelihood to tens of thousands of Indians who
see Greenpeace, rather than the ships, as the unwelcome visitors
from the West. Scanting the position of neither side, Langewiesche
sets all this out in an exacting, unhurried prose. It's only July,
and who knows what weird misfires happen in the synapses of
National Magazine Award judges, but if ``The Shipbreakers'' isn't a
finalist next year, there's something wrong in this business.

   Runovers: Lori Robertson's ``Golden Oldies,'' in American
Journalism Review (July/August)' ponders aging rock reviewers
writing for newspapers. For ourselves, we propose as a cut-off the
birthdate of The New York Times' peerless Jon Pareles. But he's 46,
which almost makes him Britney Spears's kid brother compared to
81-year-old Jane Scott, of the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Talkin'
'bout whose generation?. . . Entertainment Weekly continues its
ongoing 10th anniversary celebration with a photo issue (July 28).
The images mirror the impact of EW itself: expert, weightless,
oddly impersonal. . . . Artnews (Summer) lists ``The World's Top
200 Collectors'' _ only, alas, alphabetically. Inquiring minds
would want to know how, say, David Bowie (``Modern art, especially
German Expressionism; contemporary art, especially British'')
stacks up against Melinda and Bill Gates (``19th-century American,
especially American Impressionism''). More pertinent, in this
season of Van Gogh a-go-go at the Museum of Fine Arts, is Timothy
W. Ryback's ``The So-Called Van Goghs,'' which relates the
questionable authenticity of a distressingly large number of the
artist's paintings. In passing, Ryback notes that a leading Italian
expert on the painter bankrolls his work with what he won on a game
show as a contestant answering questions about Van Gogh. Forget
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Is the next big thing on
television going to be ``Live with Regis and Sister Wendy''?

   CONCORDE-CRASH _ GONESSE, France _ Working in a dull gray mist,
investigators and medical workers Wednesday began sifting through
the blackened wreckage of a chartered Air France Concorde that
crashed near Paris minutes after take-off Tuesday. As attention
turned to the supersonic aircraft's engines, the airline said that
its mechanics worked on one of the plane's engines just before
take-off. The airline would not say whether the work was done on
the No. 4 engine, the one that apparently caught fire and streamed
flames as the aircraft plunged to the ground. (Roughton, Cox News

praised their leader for not giving into pressure during the 15-day

The show is expected to draw between 3,500 and 5,000 people are is

   PERGOLAS _ When Michele Burns wants to savor her garden, she

outdoor dinner table and not long after, pink roses take center
stage. In summer, lush foliage forms a cool canopy for sundown
suppers. Structures like Burns' arbor are cropping up in back yards
everywhere as homeowners spend more time outdoors. Arbors and
pergolas lend not only shady retreats for relaxing and entertaining
but also the kind of structure, focal points and transitonal areas
that yards and gardens so often need. (Flanders, Atlanta

   GARDENING-LIFE _ Within seconds of one another, I heard two
sounds that rose above the roll of thunder and splatter of rain:
Crrrraaaack! WHUUUMP! In the kitchen of our 110-year-old house, I
felt a thud, but it did not begin to prepare me for what lay in
front of the house. The big old oak next door, a tree that probably
predates the Civil War, had lost half of itself; brushing the top
of our house, crashing into the wrought-iron fence, spreading
across the driveway, reaching even the house beyond ours. Minutes
after the fall, a sweet fragrance wafted, through the house. But,
it was more than newly-broken wood; it evoked the sensory pleasure
of fresh-sliced watermelon, a soothing, life-affirming counterpoint
to the death and decay so evident in the tree that, like so many
oaks in Atlanta, has been dying inwardly for years and whose
falling apart was hastened by debilitating drought and yet another
violent blowdown. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH PHOTOS.

far gone or too ugly to save, replacing a closet door is also a
simple project. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 26.

   PORTLAND, Maine _ When the sun is shining one day, and you're
burning to play hooky, go to Maine, eat your way through the Old
Port, and then walk it off on the Harbor Trail, which curves along
the ocean. Certainly one reason this city appeals is its proximity
to the water. Our port isn't as small, or as lively, but the
buildings are similar: 19th-century brick and granite warehouses
designed to serve a once-bustling seaport. The waterfront along
Casco Bay still works as a port, though fewer vessels come in. The
old buildings have been renovated, the cobblestones are still in
place, and among the usual tourist shops are some culinary treats.
Among them is a chatty hot dog vendor who has manned his corner for
six years, a juice bar that showcases one of southern Maine's hot
new companies, and a bakery with European-style loaves. To get the
full flavor of the Maine coastline, stop at a lobster shack on the
way home. We found one way off the beaten path on Chauncey Creek,
near Kittery Point. By the time you stumble into bed, you'll feel
as if you've been gone for days.

   Perry Mogul can (and will) bend your ear. Fast-talking, funny,
incurably cheerful, and startlingly observant, Mogul operates
Perry's Sidewalk Cafe Almost Famous Since 1994, a mobile hot dog
stand. Once you've met him, you won't easily forget him. One day
when I was ducking out of the rain outside the Whip and Spoon (161
Commercial St.), which is on the same block, Mogul handed me his
umbrella so I wouldn't get wet. I had never seen him before passing
by earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   Mogul, 37, turns hot dogs on his grill and passes the time of
day with a little commentary. You want to take a nice walk along
the harbor? Perry will map it out for you. You're wondering if it's
going to shower? Perry has a direct pipeline to the weather gods.
He pulls everything he uses out of an old Saab that has nearly
300,000 miles but won't give up. ``Oh, I'll be good,'' he says the
car tells him. ``Let's go another year.''
</P>
<P>
   The specialty here, of course, is hot dogs, and Mogul's are
terrific. He uses Best's Kosher brand, 1/4-pound hot dogs from
Chicago not well known in New England. Mogul smothers them with
grilled onions or hot sauerkraut. A dog and some real iced tea go
for $5. He also makes a grilled 6-ounce salmon sandwich with
horseradish sauce ($8, also with tea) and a hot potato knish with
grilled onions ($2).
</P>
<P>
   Everyone along Commercial Street knows Mogul, who operates his
kiosk seven days from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The hours are loose. If he
has hot dogs left and someone wants one, he fires up the grill.
``Hungry stomachs,'' he says, ``never forget being turned away and
sent somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Mogul doesn't open when it's raining, but because his livelihood
depends upon dry days, he watches the skies carefully. ``I've
become a meteorologist by feel,'' he says. ``I'm like a fireman _
ready to go down that pole.'' If it's rainy at dawn but clears up,
and he can get to Commercial Street by 10 a.m., he dashes out to
catch the lunch crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago on a busy Saturday, his girlfriend called from
Brunswick, which is north, to tell him a northeaster was headed
south. Portland was sunny, without a cloud in the sky. ``I put on
my L. L. Bean Gore-Tex raincoat and told everyone, `Big storm's
coming.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He got lots of strange looks. ``Then I saw a black cloud, and I
thought, `Oh my God!' I took my condiments. I threw things into the
car. We got a severe wind and five seconds later the storm. In two
minutes there was flash flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, to amuse himself and his customers, Mogul started using
a digital camera and now snaps pictures of them standing beside
him, then e-mails the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Mogul will be operating as usual during Opsail 2000, which
features the Coast Guard's Tall Ships sailing into Portland harbor
July 28 to 30. Initially, he needed an expensive permit to bring
his stand to the corner that weekend. After contacting several city
officials to protest, he was given special consideration. After
all, he isn't coming out just to make a buck off the tourists. He's
always at his spot on Commercial Street. ``I'm the minister of
tourism,'' says Mogul.

   ``We never got around to putting up a sign,'' says Alison Pray,
who is baking in an old warehouse, once a billiard hall, beneath
Fore Street restaurant. So you have to look hard for Standard
Baking Co. and walk through a parking lot to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with salvaged pieces _ including a 7-foot marble counter
that was once in the local courthouse _ the bakery is stylish in an
understated way, with handmade French bread baskets holding
baguettes and rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Pray and her partner, Matt James, have been in this location for
nine months, making artisanal French and Italian breads, dinner
rolls, chubby half-baguettes, raisin and pecan rolls, brioche, and
a number of pastries. One of their outstanding breads, the country
boule, is made with an Italian technique. ``It has a French name
and an Italian process,'' says Pray, and the result is a flavorful
bread in which you can actually taste the wheat, with a moist crumb
and beautiful crust.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the couple went to Paris and afterward began making
canneles (French for ``fluted''), rich little pastries that
originated in Bordeaux and are the rage in Parisian bakeries now.
They also make small but high gingerbread cakes with a lemon glaze,
Belgian chocolate brownies baked in shallow fluted paper cups, and
a range of croissants, including the classic crescent shape,
chocolate-filled croissants, and remarkable ``morning buns'' shaped
from a milky croissant-style dough that is rolled into sticky,
caramelized snails.
</P>
<P>
   Pray and James have been in business for five years. They used
to be down the road, next door to Street and Co. restaurant, owned
by former Brookline resident Dana Street. Street is a partner in
this venture, and he also co-owns Fore Street with Sam Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   All the Street-related establishments serve Standard bread, and
the baking couple also delivers to three dozen other local
addresses. This is a pleasing place, airy and so big that a rack of
cooling breads is dwarfed in the space. The couple, who began
baking in Brookline's Clear Flour Bakery, celebrated their fifth
anniversary in business recently. Clear Flour owner Abe Faber came
and did pirouettes in the baking area. ``You can dance here,'' he
told Pray and James. She says, ``We've never had this much space.''
</P>
<P>
   While they work to perfect their Old World breads, using
European techniques that require longer rising times, Pray and
James are sometimes surprised at how they're classified by their
industry. ``In the trade, we're known as `scratch bakers,' '' says
Pray. ``I never thought of us as that.'' Since so many bakeries are
``baking off'' yeast doughs and cookies they purchase frozen, the
``scratch'' category had to be established.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone who begins with real butter and cream is called
scratch, then there should be a category so exclusive that only a
fraction of the top bakers would be eligible. Pray and James could
join those elite ranks.

FOR BAADDER OR FOR WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it 1970s nostalgia or simply a desire to vicariously live the
life of somebody who's baaad to the bone?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the pimp (a.k.a. mack or mack-daddy) has
strutted his way into pop culture, complete with flashy cars,
Versace suits, fistfuls of cash, and two armloads of scantily clad
women. Call the aesthetic ghetto fabulous. And lately, it's been
making headway into music, film, and books.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop heads have spent the last few months vowing ``I'll be
forever mackin' '' as they sing along with Jay-Z's crossover hit,
``Big Pimpin.' '' The 1973 film ``The Mack,'' which gave rise to
the slang, has been a hot video rental for years.
</P>
<P>
   Flip on E! Television's Video Fashion Weekly and you'll hear
Stephen Baldwin naughtily call the lush, peacock-colored suits of
British designer Oswald Boateng ``awesome when you want to go a
little extra sexy, a little extra flamboyant, a little extra
pimpy.'' And movie audiences are currently seeing the harsher side
of life as a mack-daddy in the documentary ``American Pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to cause people to make like Marvin Gaye and ask:
what's going on? Vern L. Bullough, co-editor of the recently
published book of scholarly essays, ``Prostitution: On Whores,
Hustlers and Johns,'' thinks he has an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's giving a different interpretation of the pimp, who was
regarded as a lowest of low in the past,'' he says. ``He's not now.
He's really in there and belonging.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn on MTV and you'll hear Jamie, a roommate on ``The Real
World New Orleans,'' crow, ``I'm lucky. I'm a pimp.'' That's
``pimp'' in a positive ``I've got it all'' way, not pimp in the ``I
have women who sell sex for money'' sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue of reality vs. fantasy. And America's digging the
pimp fantasy at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like the way it sounds: `I'm a pimp. I'm a mack,' '' says
Too Short, a rapper who's fashioned a long, successful career
recounting pimp tales on his albums. ``Nobody's actually saying,
`I'm a pimp' and attempting to prostitute women.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't escape the harsh truths about the business in
``American Pimp,'' in which the subjects casually call their
prostitutes terms that are usually reserved for female dogs and
gardening equipment. The glamour of pimp life also faded mighty
quickly last month when a roving group of men felt empowered enough
to grope, poke, or stroke about 50 women after the Puerto Rican Day
Parade in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's misogynist,'' says William Eric Perkins, the
self-described ``godfather of hip-hop scholarship'' who's a
research scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. ``It creates a
culture and environment where these kinds of attacks will actually
be tolerated and condoned.''
</P>
<P>
   You've got to wonder how someone who makes a living in such an
unconventional way could even become hip. So hip that videos by
male artists don't seem complete lately without a bevy of women
clad in G-strings and bikini tops. So hip that Kid Rock, Snoop
Dogg, and menswear companies like Sean ``Puffy'' Combs's Sean John
borrow the mink coats, feather vests, and velvet suits that were
once the pimp's fashion domain.
</P>
<P>
   And you know something's going on if Madonna's appropriating the
look by wearing a lavish fur coat in the video for her upcoming
single ``Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is borrowing heavily from the blaxploitation
era,'' says Perkins. ``These (are) characters who live on the
margin, who live outside of traditional mainstream culture, who
challenge conventional authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bullough, ``There's kind of a thing in culture now of
living halfway dangerously. One way you can do that is through
songs and music, finding borderline people. It makes you feel kind
of daring. It's a cheap way to get excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is pimping the pimp business sells. Just ask rapper Too
Short. He's putting out his 12th album, appropriately titled, ``You
Nasty,'' in September; six of his records have reached platinum
status without the benefit of radio airplay.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the case of Iceberg Slim's novel ``Pimp: The Story
of my Life,'' a sort of bible of the aesthetic. About 5 million
copies have been plucked from bookstore shelves worldwide since it
became available in 1969, according to its publisher, Holloway
House. The novel will soon be made into a Hollywood film starring
actor/rapper Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   Too Short, 34, the son of two college-educated accountants,
became fascinated with the life the way most guys do: he read
``Pimp'' and gobbled up 1970s blaxploitation films like ``The
Mack'' and ``Willie Dynamite.'' Then, after his family moved from
Los Angeles to Oakland, Calif., he found himself in a Sodom and
Gomorrah-like high school where, he maintains, pimps and
prostitutes were his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s Too Short was incorporating lessons learned
from pop culture and real life into his lyrics. His bulging sales
showed he wasn't the only one intrigued with the business
colloquially known as ``the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys fantasize about. . .,'' says Too Short, launching into
talk too raunchy to print here. ``That's the alter ego of men _ not
all of them, but the large fan base out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Too Short, who appears as a ``pimpology'' expert in ``American
Pimp,'' uses gallows humor and funky beats to leaven his
misogynistic tales. ``Let's get this money/That's what I want you
for,'' he raps bluntly in the song, ``Call Me Daddy.'' ``Don't let
me wait too long/'Cause life is too short.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to Jay-Z's radio friendly ``Big Pimpin','' where
the chorus goes ``We doin', big pimpin', we spendin' cheese,'' or
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big pimpin', according to the song, is I'm just out having
fun, enjoying myself. . .spending money'' says Too Short. ``But if
you were doing big pimpin' you'd be making money because big
pimpin' is making cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Too Short deflects any accusations that the current popular
flirtation with the mack instigates violence against women. He
blames Hollywood's relentless peddling of sexual images _ not songs
glamorizing pimp life _ for incidents like the one that happened in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you've got this billion-dollar rap industry, people
are assuming that we're all uneducated, `They're the ones that are
corrupting society,' '' says Too Short. ``It's not the rap music.
Listening to Too Short does not make 12 guys rape somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, prostitution and pimping have been around much
longer than hip-hop. In ``American Pimp,'' some of the subjects
trace the origins of the pimp profession back to slavery and
Reconstruction. But Bullough, a clinical professor at the
University of Southern California, believes men began plying the
trade sometime in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that brothels, which until that point were often run
by women, became outlawed. Women took to the streets to earn money
and turned to men for protection.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, a surfeit of blaxploitation movies introduced
these anachronistic relationships to the masses. A decade later,
1980s comedies like ``I'm Gonna Git You Sucka'' and ``Hollywood
Shuffle'' sent up the image of the pimp.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Brown, a former pimp who now makes a living singing blues
in Los Angeles, isn't impressed with either the films or literary
output. ``They didn't portray the real deal,'' he says disdainfully
in ``American Pimp.'' But the works did engrave certain perceptions
about the mack into society's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In black culture, a pimp was known as a flashy dresser who
could make his way in the white world successfully,'' says
Bullough. ``But in the white world, he was regarded as a vulture
preying upon innocent young girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither image is true, says Bullough, who calls pimps hustlers.
Nor, notes ``American Pimp,'' is the notion that pimps are only
black. In fact, they include white men like Dennis Hof, owner of
the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, a legalized brothel in Nevada, and
Playboy's Hugh Hefner, whom an interviewee in ``American Pimp''
admiringly labels ``the greatest pimp that ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Too Short talks about a new generation of pimps who drive
minivans and wear geeky clothing to avoid the attention of the
police. Of course, fans of Jay-Z wouldn't ever think of sporting
that kind of gear. After all, the current pimp aesthetic is all
about surface: big cars, fur coats, designer labels, alligator
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high style,'' says Perkins. ``It's being ghetto
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   So fabulous that, in March, Esquire magazine went so far as to
declare pimp style in style in its guide to popular culture.
Parents may balk, but it's enough to make any mack-daddy preen.

 &HT;    Some simple fixes for myriad problems with closet doors
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Few things make a bedroom seem shabbier than a
beat-up sliding closet door that's hanging crooked or that won't
open and close smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive closet doors often are installed to cut down on
building costs, but doors made of low-quality materials and hung
with inexpensive hardware can lose their alignment and become
difficult to operate. And they sometimes don't wear very well, so
they can become stained and scratched. Minor impacts can cause
holes.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonably handy person can correct most minor closet-door
problems fairly easily. And if the door is too far gone or too ugly
to save, replacing a closet door is also a simple project.
</P>
<P>
   Closet doors come in three basic styles: sliding (sometimes
called bypass), bifold and swinging-hinge doors. Swinging-hinge
doors are like the other interior doors in your home, but bifold
and sliding doors are hung from tracks and might need extra
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The side of a bifold door is attached to the door jamb with
hinges or pins in brackets. The side of the door opposite the
hinges is suspended from a sliding mechanism that moves along a
track.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the slides stick. If the sliding mechanism contains a
wheel, a little light oil in the works might improve the operation.
If there is no wheel, try rubbing a little candle wax on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding closet doors, which are used in pairs, are not attached
at their sides but glide along overhead tracks. They can become
sticky, too, but they almost always have wheels that can be oiled.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding doors usually have at least one floor bracket that keeps
the bottoms of the doors in line with their tops.
</P>
<P>
   A common problem with sliding doors is misalignment. If the
doors are higher on one side than the other, or if they are hung
too low, they might drag on the floor or snag at the floor bracket.
If they're hung too high, they can swing out of the floor bracket
and come completely out of the track.
</P>
<P>
   The alignment of sliding doors usually can be adjusted without
removing the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside the closet and look for the brackets that attach the
sliding wheels to the top of the door. The bracket should be held
in place with screws set in curving slots.
</P>
<P>
   With a partner holding the door, loosen the screws in the
curving slots but don't unscrew them completely. Move the bracket
up or down as needed and partially retighten the screws. Test the
door to see that it slides properly before retightening the screws.
</P>
<P>
   Replacement brackets and wheels are available at
home-improvement stores. Replacement components run from about $2
for simple wheel assemblies to $20 for new brackets and tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Some closet doors are made of a lightweight wood called lauan.
Such doors usually have a framework of pine or other wood around
the edges, and the center part of the door is hollow.
</P>
<P>
   The wood in the doors sometimes deteriorates, and screws can
become loose, making hinges and brackets rattle.
</P>
<P>
   When a screw refuses to tighten in deteriorated wood, you have
to dismantle and remove the hinge or bracket and plug the old screw
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Put a little wood glue on a wooden golf tee and tap the tee into
the screw hole. Allow the glue to dry a while, preferably
overnight, and then cut off the extra part of the tee with a
utility knife. You can now drill a new guide hole in the tee to
reattach the hinge or bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Closet-door sizes are standardized (24 by 80 inches, 36 by 80
inches, for example), and it should be easy to find replacement
doors where lumber and building supplies are sold. Measure your
existing doors and look for replacements with the same dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   To remove sliding doors, unscrew the floor bracket and slide it
from under the doors. Swing the bottom of the door up and lift the
body of the door to disengage the sliding wheel from the track. If
the track and wheels are in good shape, you can attach the wheels
to the new doors and keep the old track.
</P>
<P>
   Bifold doors are removed by disconnecting the hinges. The slide
holding the top of the door should then slide out of the track.
</P>
<P>
   Bifold doors come in a variety of styles, from plain flat panels
to paneled hardwoods or full-length mirrors. Prices start at about
$35 for an unfinished, 36-inch-wide door and go to about $150.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding doors tend to be a bit cheaper, with 36-inch lauan
panels going for about $25 and other woods mostly in the $35 to $90
range.
</P>
<P>
   Often the hardware to hang a door comes with it, but some doors
are sold as plain panels. The hardware to hang a pair of 36-inch
sliding panels or bifold doors in a 72-inch-wide closet opening
costs about $20.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add a stain to match a new door to existing
woodwork, stain the door and add a protective finish before
installing it. Read the instructions on the finishing products you
intend to use so you'll know how long you have to wait between
finishing the door and handling it to put it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Closet-door installation is simple. For sliding doors, attach
brackets with wheels at the upper corners of flat wooden panels. A
sliding track screws into the top of the door frame, and the panels
are suspended from the track by the wheels. Brackets screwed down
to the floor keep the bottoms of the panels aligned.
</P>
<P>
   Bifold doors have hinges that attach to the door jamb on one
side. When using a pair of bifold doors in a wide opening, one door
will have hinges on the left and the other will have hinges on the
right.
</P>
<P>
   When using a standard hinged door on a closet, you'll have the
extra requirement of installing a door knob and latch.
</P>
<P>
   If the new door has no hole for a door-knob assembly, use a
drill attachment called a hole saw to make a large hole through the
door. Read the instructions that come with your door hardware
carefully and use the templates that come with the new doorknob to
properly position the holes in the door.

   CANADA-U.S.-TOILETS (Windsor, Ontario) _ Americans in search of
suburbia's new holy grail _ the kind of old-style, big-flush toilet
that Americans took as their birthright until 1994 _ now routinely
travel to Canada. In 1994, a federal water conservation law went
into effect, mandating that all new toilets use only 1.6 gallons a
flush. Now, border towns from New Brunswick to British Columbia

commodes. By James Brooke.

   SALVAGED-HOUSE (Phoenix, Ariz.) _ The four-room,
2,400-square-foot house Patrick and Marika McCue are building here
is made from 75 percent salvaged material, including trusses
rejected from a ballpark, high-quality but scratched glass donated
by a house-building friend and surplus steel picked up at
junkyards. The walls are of poured earth, and the roof is a

   OHIO-HIGHWAY (Dateline to come) _ The scenery along the Ohio

at least those of a decent airport terminal. By Phil Patton.

   NY-EAST-VILLAGE (New York) _ In 1978, Roland Legiardi-Laura
bought a loft in the East Village for $20,000. This May, his
building _ the former Tompkins Square Boys' Lodging House, the
oldest surviving structure built for the homeless in New York _ was
designated a city landmark, qualifying its owners for low-interest
loans to restore its facades. When that happens, the exterior will
finally reflect the remarkable transformation that has taken place
within. Today, in a neighborhood that sports new real estate
developments on almost every block, Legiardi-Laura's may be the
most unusual of all. By Marc Kristal.

&HT;     POLICE STALL INVESTIGATION OF KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's independent police watchdog
agency has been unable to complete its investigation of the 1998
shooting of an advertising executive because of an uncooperative
police department.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Police Department admitted Tuesday that its
internal affairs probe of the officer-involved shooting death of
John Smart Jr. was still unfinished, even though a police awards
committee nominated the two officers under investigation for the
Gold Medal of Valor.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, 46, an executive of Interbrand, died of gunshot wounds on
Oct. 6, 1998, after officers Jason Sawyer and Ian Furminger fired
at least 13 rounds into his 1996 Mercedes convertible as he
allegedly drove toward them. The shooting came minutes after the
officers interceded in a struggle between Smart and a woman on a
city street.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Dunlap, director of the Office of Citizen Complaints (OCC),
said her investigation into the Smart shooting had been repeatedly
delayed by lack of cooperation from the department's homicide and
internal affairs units. Smart was shot more than 15 times by the
police as he tried to flee in his car.
</P>
<P>
   The OCC has yet to receive a report from the Police Department's
internal affairs unit on Smart's killing, and a report from the
homicide squad was sent in May, nearly 18 months after the case was
closed by homicide inspectors, Dunlap said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not delayed our investigation,'' Dunlap said. ``We
have worked hard, but we have not gotten the cooperation that we
expect under the City Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her complaints are not limited to the Smart investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have received no officer-involved shooting reports on Smart
or in any other shooting since October 1998,'' she said. This
includes more than eight cases, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap said she had not been able to get an explanation for the
long wait for the homicide detail's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``After months of lobbying, letter-writing and door pounding we
received an incomplete report in May 2000,'' she said. ``My
understanding is that the homicide investigation was closed in
December 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap declined to discuss the contents of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, police Chief Fred Lau questioned why it was taking
the OCC so long to study the Smart case after the homicide
investigation had cleared the two officers of criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, the police admitted Dunlap was correct about
the unfinished internal affairs report in the Smart case and in a
number of other shooting cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take responsibility for not providing full and complete
information that OCC is entitled to,'' Lau said. ``I was acting
upon information that was not completely correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers, their union and attorneys representing officers
under investigation have long criticized the slow investigative
process of the OCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a disgrace that it takes the OCC so long,'' said
attorney Jim Collins, a former police officer who frequently
represents officers accused of wrongdoing. ``These officers have to
live under a cloud for years, not knowing if they will face
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   OCC, created by voter initiative, investigates any citizen
complaint of police activity. Under the City Charter, the OCC
reviews all shootings by the police. The Police Department is also
required to share the results of its investigations with OCC.

   THEATER-CORPORATIONS (New York) _ Not so long ago the nonprofit
Roundabout Theater Company was performing plays for 150 people in a
supermarket basement. Thursday night, the company will open its
first show in its elegant new 750-seat theater. The showplace is
named the American Airlines Theater, in exchange for an $8.5
million payment from American Airlines. Patrons who contribute
$1,500 or more can relax over cocktails and Oreo cookies in the
Nabisco lounge (so named in exchange for $500,000). The rest of the

BUSH'S CHOICE DEMONSTRATES SENSE AND SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could cite any number of reasons why Dick Cheney was a great
choice for the Republican vice presidential nomination, but two
reasons stand out:
</P>
<P>
   _He is highly qualified _ not only to serve as vice president
but as president, should the need arise.
</P>
<P>
   _He is not John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's McCain-for-Veep boomlet was unnerving, to say the
least. It wasn't that I doubted the ability of presidential
nominee-to-be George W. Bush to resist McCain's devious,
last-minute bid to grab a spot on the GOP ticket; it was just ...
well, it was just that politicians sometimes make inexplicable
decisions at moments like this.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a moment like this, after all, that Bush's father
chose Dan Quayle as his running mate. Talk about inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the governor of Texas is not prone to such campaign
weirdness, and he made a thoughtful, level-headed decision when the
time came to choose the individual who figures to be the next vice
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas McCain's monstrous ego would never enable him to
graciously endure second billing in a campaign or in a Bush
administration, Cheney has the experience and the temperament to
carry out the responsibilities of both a running mate and a vice
president. He was White House chief of staff when Gerald Ford was
president; he was secretary of defense under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is an able boss _ he's headed up a major corporation in
recent years _ but he understands that even bosses have bosses.
Obviously, George W. Bush believes that Cheney is a man he can work
with.
</P>
<P>
   And compatibility was one of Bush's top two criteria for a
running mate. First and foremost, the vice presidential candidate
had to be someone capable of taking over the presidency at a
moment's notice. After that, the major factor was the comfort level
between the running mates.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so long ago, when presidential nominees
picked their running mates on the basis of geographical or
philosophical balance, with little or no thought given to the
question of compatibility _ or competence, for that matter. All
that mattered was winning the election.
</P>
<P>
   But recent presidents have given vice presidents more
responsibility, have brought their seconds in command into the
inner circles of decision-making. That means that the president and
the vice president must get along with each other; must communicate
with each other; must respect each other.
</P>
<P>
   After carefully considering all the potential candidates for
vice president, Bush decided that Cheney filled the bill better
than any of the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked him because he is, without a doubt, fully capable of
being the president of the United States, and I picked him because
he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration,'' Bush said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents and detractors were quick to criticize the
selection of Cheney _ as they would have been quick to criticize
any selection that Bush made. Even if Bush had landed the
universally admired Colin Powell as a running mate, there surely
would have been those who found fault with the choice.
</P>
<P>
   But some Bush critics were so hard pressed to conjure up
objections to Cheney's selection that they resorted to the
preposterous charge that Bush is so insecure that he felt compelled
to team up with one of his father's ex-cronies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the opposite is true. By picking the man he believed
was best qualified despite that man's former association with Bush
the elder, Bush the younger demonstrated that he is secure enough
and confident enough to do the right thing even in the face of
certain criticism.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate who was truly laboring in the shadow of his
ex-president father would have gone out of his way to avoid being
linked with one of the father's top advisers. George W. Bush picked
the running mate he wanted and said to heck with the critics.
</P>
<P>
   That's leadership, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's see what Al Gore does about choosing a running mate.

 &HT;    AARP RELEASES POLL, PLANS VOTER EDUCATION CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Family values and education are the most important
issues on voters' minds, according to a recent survey conducted by
the seniors organization AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Providing a prescription drug benefit for Medicare and
protecting Social Security follow closely behind, said Jeffrey
Love, AARP associate director of research.
</P>
<P>
   Among the general public, 27 percent of those polled selected
ethics and family values as the most important issue in determining
their vote for president. That was followed by 24 percent who named
education, 18 percent who chose Social Security and 10 percent who
said Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Among AARP's 30 million members, 35 percent of those polled said
Social Security was the most important issue to watch during the
presidential election, compared to 22 percent who listed ethics and
family values, 18 percent who picked Medicare, and 12 percent who
chose education.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that about half the population claimed they had
enough information to know where the candidates stood on the
issues, but less than half said they could distinguish between Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to inform elderly voters and draw attention to the
importance of senior issues, AARP, whose members are 50 or older,
is launching an ambitious voter education and turnout drive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the AARP's election activities will be:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 23-city, 20-state bus trip featuring AARP President Tess
Canja and other volunteers that will start in Philadelphia during
the Republican National Convention and end two weeks later in Los
Angeles during the Democratic National Convention. Along the way,
AARP will solicit cards from supporters of a prescription drug
benefit in Medicare. The cards will be given to Congress and the
White House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Distributing voter guides and material reporting presidential
and congressional candidates' positions on issues of importance to
the elderly. The guides will be limited to the Democratic and
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Co-sponsoring the three presidential and one vice-presidential
debates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Co-sponsoring an online voter registration Web site,
``beavoter.org,'' where people can register to vote in all states
except New Hampshire, North Dakota and Wyoming. Since April, more
than 50,000 voters have registered on line through the site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Purchasing billboard and newspaper advertisements urging
Congress to pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extensive get-out-the-vote efforts to encourage and assist the
elderly to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors vote in greater proportion that any other age group,
and we vote on issues, not on personalities,'' said Horace Deets,
AARP's executive director.

<P>
   Next week's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia will
feature prominent names like Colin Powell, John McCain, Elizabeth
Dole and, of course, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the names that will not appear center stage are the ones
that will actually pay for the convention _ names like General
Motors, Microsoft, PepsiCo and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are underwriting much of the cost of the event,
which is expected to exceed $50 million, as well as the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   To the companies, the conventions a chance to get their name
before tens of thousands of delegates, public officials and
journalists. But critics say the contributions, which are not
limited by federal election law, are just another way for
corporations to exert influence over the nation's policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the eight biggest donors to the Republican convention
are telecommunications companies: AT&AMP;T, Verizon Communications,
formerly Bell Atlantic, and Comcast Corp. Each contributed $1
million, according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan Center
for Responsive Politics in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, telecommunications companies have important
business before the federal government. AT&AMP;T is battling federal
efforts to force it to open its phone lines to other Internet
providers. The Baby Bells still face resistance in entering the $80
billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years like this where their companies are heavily targeted
by potential legislation or regulation, they are more likely to be
active'' in giving, said Sheila Krumholz, research director for the
Center for Responsive Politics. ``There's a large potential for
harm if they don't participate or benefit if they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other corporate donors have their own concerns. Tobacco giant
Philip Morris, which gave $250,000 to the GOP convention, is
nervous about the Justice Department's lawsuit against the tobacco
industry. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which gave $100,000 for the
Republican event, has a major stake in any legislation affecting
health care.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are not paying the entire cost of the Republican
convention. Philadelphia has contributed $7 million, while
Pennsylvania and neighboring New Jersey have given $10 million and
$3 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chunk has come from companies: an estimated $26
million. The host committee in Philadelphia has even ranked them:
$1 million contributors are ``platinum'' donors, $500,000 givers
are ``gold'' and $250,000 donors are ``silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the corporate giving comes as in-kind contributions,
free goods or services. Hewlett-Packard, for example, is donating
$250,000 worth of printers and work stations. When the convention
is over, the equipment will be donated to schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to be good corporate citizens,'' said H-P spokeswoman
Emily Fox. ``By supporting an important aspect of the political
process and promoting economic and educational development in the
host city, we think we're fulfilling that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most companies say their contributions aren't meant to influence
the political process, but to help market their products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Airways, official airline of the GOP convention, has
offered discounted airfares to delegates. The airline's $500,000
gift to the host committee was aimed at bringing attention to
Philadelphia, its third-largest hub, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision to be a participant with the Republican National
Committee was purely a business decision,'' said David Castelveter,
a U.S. Airways spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, official carrier for the Democratic National
Convention, also gave $500,000 to its host committee and offered
similar discounts to convention-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to have those customers fly on United
Airlines and attract their business,'' said Kurt Ebenhoch, a United
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both airlines said their sponsorship of the
political conventions had nothing to do with their pending $11.6
billion merger, which requires federal approval. ``I wouldn't want
to speculate about that,'' Ebenhoch said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are giving to both parties. General Motors,
Microsoft and AT&AMP;T gave $1 million each to the Democratic and
Republican convention committees.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense aerospace company,
gave $100,000 to both conventions. As a company that does 75
percent of its business with the government, ``we try to be
even-handed and equal in our giving to both of their conventions,''
said Hugh Burns, Lockheed Martin spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the in-kind donations have been massive. SBC
Communications, the San Antonio-based telecommunications company,
has installed nearly 5,000 miles of copper wire and more than 350
DSL lines worth $1 million in and around the Staples Center in Los
Angeles, where the Democratic convention will be held. The
convention will cost an estimated $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity, in front of an international audience,
for the company to really distinguish itself,'' said Steve Getzug,
an SBC spokesman.

`BROTHERS GARCIA' REFLECTS LATIN LIFE, MINUS STEREOTYPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By October, kid channel Nickelodeon will have managed to do
twice what the broadcast networks haven't even attempted in at
least a decade: air a series built around Latino families.
</P>
<P>
   Getting much of the attention but not airing until fall is
``Taina,'' a multigenerational series following the life of a
spunky 15-year-old girl who tries to balance the expectations of
her traditional Puerto Rican family with her passionate dreams of
fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   I'd suspect that the show's trendy urban core, musical numbers
and Latin pop culture wrapped around universal themes make it a
cinch to lure Nick's target audience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hype for the ``The Brothers Garcia,'' which premiered
Sunday, was less spectacular, but it would be a mistake to judge
this series on a lack of water-cooler chat alone.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Jeff Valdez, the Los Angeles producer of Latino
English-language and bilingual programs, ``The Brothers Garcia'' is
a drama-comedy that puts you in mind of ``The Wonder Years,'' what
with its whimsical nature and how the show's protagonist offers in
narration his perspective on the world and how it's shaping him and
his tight-knit San Antonio family.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as an adult (it's the voice of John Leguizamo), Larry
Garcia (Alvin Alvarez) is recalling his quest as an 11-year-old and
youngest of the three Garcia brothers (Carlos, played by Jeffrey
Licon, is 13, and George, played by Bobby Gonzalez, is 12). Carlos
is the athletic one and George is the smart one, so Larry does what
he can to assert his individuality. Even if it gets him in trouble,
which it often does.
</P>
<P>
   Larry lives at home with his hardworking father, Ray (Carlos La
Camara), and mother, Sonia (Ada Maris), who are compassionate but
pragmatic when it comes to laying down the law of family values and
morals. No means no, and the kids have already been trained to
accept that fact and move on. Larry also has a fraternal twin
sister, Lorena (Vaneza Leza Pitynski), who always seems to be
around when he's up to no good. It drives him up a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The scrapes Larry gets himself into are the usual predicaments
kids eager to grow up often find themselves in, but thankfully, the
story lines aren't as trite as we've seen in similar family series
like ``Full House.'' In the episode sent for review, the boys put
on their own wrestling match when a short-term financial crisis
keeps them and their father from attending a professional wrestling
match.
</P>
<P>
   Future episodes include Carlos and George falling for the same
girl, Larry trying to break free from his role as the family's
baby, and Ray and Sonia putting a cap on TV-watching.
</P>
<P>
   One of the failings of programs centered on families of color is
that they are usually the result of commerce, not art, and
certainly not of a commitment to actually reflecting the world
children live in.
</P>
<P>
   Nick has been better than most, having previously presented
multicultural shows and some with predominantly black and Asian
casts.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Brothers Garcia,'' Nick offers an engaging look
inside a Latino family that goes far beyond the stereotypes.

   THEATER-CORPORATIONS (New York) _ Not so long ago the nonprofit
Roundabout Theater Company was performing plays for 150 people in a
supermarket basement. Thursday night, the company will open its
first show in its elegant new 750-seat theater. The showplace is
named the American Airlines Theater, in exchange for an $8.5
million payment from American Airlines. Patrons who contribute
$1,500 or more can relax over cocktails and Oreo cookies in the
Nabisco lounge (so named in exchange for $500,000). The rest of the
theater's subscribers can catch the sunset from the balcony of the
new penthouse lobby (name still for sale at $1.5 million). By Robin

suburbia's new holy grail _ the kind of old-style, big-flush toilet

travel to Canada. In 1994, a federal water conservation law went

 &HT;    MICROSOFT BLASTS ANTITRUST JUDGE
 &HT;    Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. told the Supreme Court on Wednesday
that the judge who seeks a fast-track appeal of his decision to
break up the company is prejudiced and should be removed from the
landmark case if it is sent back to him.
</P>
<P>
   In its 30-page brief, the world's largest software firm urged
the high tribunal to allow the U.S. Court of Appeals in the
District of Columbia to first review the issues, rather than
hearing them directly.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Microsoft launched a stinging personal attack
against U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ordered
the breakup after branding Microsoft an abusive monopolist that
illegally used its huge power in the marketplace to stifle
competition and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ``blunt comments to the press,'' made both before and
after his final ruling June 7, ``raise serious questions about
(his) impartiality,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it added, they ``betray a misguided belief'' that the
government and 19 states, who filed their historic antitrust suit
26 months ago, ``were entitled to the remedy of their choice, no
matter how extreme, simply because they had prevailed on
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's 11,000-word filing, accompanied by a 312-page
appendix, accused Jackson of having made 15 broad errors in the
course of the 78-day trial, any one of which, it argued, offered
ample grounds for an appellate court to reverse him.
</P>
<P>
   To this list, Microsoft's lawyers added three more alleged
errors that Jackson purportedly committed after the trial had
ended. They were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Entering ``a sweeping permanent injunction without an
evidentiary hearing on relief.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Imposing extreme and punitive relief unrelated to the
antitrust violations found.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Engaging in ``extrajudicial communications with the press
concerning the merits of these cases in violation of (federal legal
canons).'' Those rules, the brief said ``require that the judgment
... be reversed and, if the (case is) remanded, that (it) be
assigned to another district judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also accused Jackson of showing bad faith. He
allegedly did so by privately promising that in the remedial phase
he would ``replicate the procedure at trial with testimony in
written form subject to cross-examination'' _ only to subsequently
spurn Microsoft's plea that chairman and co-founder Bill Gates be
permitted to testify.
</P>
<P>
   A clerk for Jackson said the judge would have no comment on the
charges raised in the Microsoft brief.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A 1978 law opens the door for government-initiated antitrust
cases of ``general public importance'' in ``the administration of
justice'' to get direct Supreme Court consideration. The justices
are not expected to decide whether to assert jurisdiction before
October, when they are next due to convene.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said in its brief that ``the severity of the remedy
imposed and the significance of (the case) to the nation's economy
make it more important _ not less _ that (the appeal) proceed
through intermediate appellate review in the normal course.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mean turning the issue over to a seven-member panel
of appellate judges who work four floors above Jackson's courtroom.
Those judges have already signaled their eagerness to retain the
first crack on the appeal, a procedure that both Jackson and U.S.
Solicitor General Seth Waxman seek to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Microsoft held that the mid-level appellate branch
is far better suited than the nine Supreme Court justices in coping
with the 1,815 pages of written direct testimony, 13,466 pages of
trial transcript and 2,695 trial exhibits, much of which ``relates
to highly technical issues of software design.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will reply to the Microsoft filing by
Aug. 15, and Microsoft will have a final chance to rebut the
government's views by Aug. 22.

make it more important _ not less _ that (the appeal) proceed
through intermediate appellate review in the normal course.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mean turning the issue over to a seven-member panel
of appellate judges who work four floors above Jackson's courtroom.
Those judges have already signaled their eagerness to retain the
first crack on the appeal, a procedure that both Jackson and U.S.
Solicitor General Seth Waxman seek to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Microsoft held that the mid-level appellate branch
is far better suited than the nine Supreme Court justices in coping
with the 1,815 pages of written direct testimony, 13,466 pages of
trial transcript and 2,695 trial exhibits, much of which ``relates
to highly technical issues of software design.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will reply to the Microsoft filing by
Aug. 15, and Microsoft will have a final chance to rebut the
government's views by Aug. 22.

<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Just call it Anna-proofing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a large window at the main entrance to the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium behind which the press room is located. Last year,
when Anna Kournikova made her Bank of the West Classic debut, the
area in front of that window was home to a veritable throng of fans
_ OK, men _ with their noses pressed against the glass, knocking
and waving as the Russian teen made her postmatch remarks.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there is a small wooden picket fence extending out
about 5 feet away from the window and a security guard manning the
location to ensure against a repeat. There will be no getting
carried away with Anna-mania in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova made her debut at Stanford Tuesday night in front of
a full house and a sizable contingent of the Stanford football
team, winning easily against Annie Miller, 6-1, 6-2, in just 48
minutes. But if Kournikova's presence caused a palpable buzz, there
were no signs of a frenzy _ only a couple of homemade signs
(including one that said ``I Play Hockey'' in reference to her
relationship with hockey stars Sergei Federov and Pavel Bure and
another bearing a rather suggestive proposition), a few whistles
and a dozen photographers with their cameras poised solely in her
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Kournikova said of the crowd. ``I like playing
night tennis because it's such a great atmosphere. It's great when
the crowd gets into the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova is still the most famous tennis player in the world
who has never won anything. She has been on tour nearly five years
and is still without a singles title.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her ranking has slipped appreciably this year. She was
ranked as high as No. 9, following a semifinal loss to Davenport in
early March, but she has fallen to her current ranking of 19 after
second-round losses at both the French Open and Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest flaw in her game, her lack of consistency, was
evident Tuesday even in an easy victory. Kournikova hit a slew of
stinging groundstrokes, strokes that make her competitive with the
best players in the world, but also managed to mix in a few costly
unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably one of the most enjoyable matches I've
played in the last few months. I was really happy with my game
today. I didn't try to adjust to her game, I just kept playing
mine,'' Kournikova said. ``This is going to be a great time for me
to get some points, just play and move up in the rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a onetime top 50 player, was playing her first match
after a two-year layoff because of injury and studies at the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have to do much to win pretty easily,'' Miller
said. ``I was making tons of errors. When we did have a couple of
decent point rallies, she was more aggressive. I don't think I gave
her too much competition tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova's will probably play again on Thursday against
Canadian Jana Nejedly.

 DROP AND ROLL: FRIEND FIRED UP OVER DUMPLINGS
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
 By ART CHAPMAN
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend of mine, a Texas expatriate who is dodging the summer
heat at his retirement home in Oregon, sent me a note crying for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help!'' it began simply. ``Before I attempt chicken and
dumplings again, I need a better recipe and perhaps some better
instructions on how to implement it. Didn't you go through a round
of dumpling recipes a few years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   He knew full well that I had. It was a tumultuous time. Those
who love dumplings dropped from a spoon into the hot broth
threatened to fricasse my fingers if I didn't stop telling people
to roll out their dough for flat dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides raised their rolling pins in anger when it was hinted
that a make-do recipe could include canned biscuits or flour
tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I ever have a bone to pick with you,'' one writer began.
``A pot of boiling broth and chicken meat with the addition of bits
of canned biscuit dough is NOT chicken and dumplings!''
</P>
<P>
   The words ``nasty'' and ``disgusting'' were bantered about.
</P>
<P>
   But my friend was willing to raise all these issues again,
because he had suffered an embarrassing setback with his own
recipe. His wife wouldn't let him pour the remains down the sink;
the retirement home is new, and the septic system unproven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipe I used called for only flour and water and parsley
flakes, which is also the way we used to make flour paste when I
was a kid,'' he wrote. ``As I recall, the paste tasted better.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Almaroad of Grapevine sent a recipe I used during those
turbulent times.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote: ``Sift about 3 cups of flour into a bowl and make a
well in the center. Add 1 cup of HOT broth, 1 tablespoon
shortening, 1 egg and 2 egg yellows. Mix until dough is stiff.
Chill a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flour board, divide dough for easier handling, roll out paper
thin and cut into 2-inch-by-2-inch squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Almaroad says to drop the squares into the boiling broth, but
don't stir. Just use a long-handled spoon and ``jiggle.'' When all
the dumplings are in, return the boned chicken, season and cook for
20-30 minutes on medium-low heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Little has happened in the world of chicken and dumplings since
those earlier stories. Almaroad's recipe has held up well. Those
who know how to make chicken and dumplings are held in reverence
and awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on a farm and I learned how to do chicken and
dumplings,'' said Dorothy Hill, who with her husband, Pete, runs
Summerhill House at Sixth Avenue and Magnolia Street on Fort
Worth's south side. ``I don't have time for people who use canned
biscuits or flour tortillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's chicken and dumplings are legendary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Summerhill House is not a big restaurant: about a dozen or so
stools at the counter, one table and maybe three or four chairs
against the wall. The Hills have run the place for the past 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long do you have to be married before you stop fighting,''
he asked somewhat rhetorically of the noonday crowd. ``How long you
been married, Pete?'' someone asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-nine years,'' Pete answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long enough,'' came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy and Pete don't really argue in front of the customers.
They simply spar a little _ a gig here, a jab there.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Pete is singing Dorothy's praises. ``She makes the
chicken and dumplings from scratch,'' he said. ``She rolls those
dumplings out so thin, they melt in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what I came for.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken was several hearty chunks of pure breast meat _
tender and rich in taste. The dumplings held together just long
enough to get to your mouth, then they quickly dispersed in a silky
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The broth, Dorothy said, is rich because she uses ``turkey
tails.'' ``You can't get them (just) anywhere,'' she said. ``I buy
them at Carnival.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she has boiled the turkey tails into a stock, she adds the
chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The dumplings are made of flour, baking soda, baking powder, a
little shortening and several eggs. The secret ingredient, she
said, is buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to try her banana pudding,'' Pete interrupts. ``She
makes that by scratch, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Pete, let the man eat,'' Dorothy fires back.

THE HORROR! WRITER PETER STRAUB CAN'T ESCAPE SCARY IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JEFF GUINN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Straub thinks of himself as a writer, not a ``horror''
writer.
</P>
<P>
   But Straub, who has written 17 books, remains best-known for two
titles that fall squarely into the horror genre: ``Ghost Story,'' a
classic spook yarn published in 1979, and 1984's ``The Talisman,''
co-authored with longtime pal Stephen King, the acknowledged modern
master of monster fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much accepted that people want to put writers in
some category,'' Straub, 57, said on a recent stopover in Fort
Worth. ``It's easier for them, despite all the times I have
deliberately not written about supernatural subjects. `Ghost Story'
labeled me as a horror writer in peoples' eyes, `The Talisman'
cemented me, and the (book I'm working on) will lend itself to
that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after their first collaboration, Straub and King
are hard at work on what they're currently calling ``Talisman II.''
They e-mail parts of chapters back and forth, each adding new
material to whatever the other sends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew we'd want to continue working together,''
Straub explained.
</P>
<P>
   But they also have their own books to write and promote. Straub
is on the road touting ``Magic Terror'' (Random House, $24.95), a
collection of short stories whose subjects sometimes, but not
always, include things that go bump in the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People complain that the language is too blunt, that the
violence is too extreme, but some of these stories are as harmless
as baby food,'' Straub said. ``I never want my work to be boring,
familiar or stating the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   As a voracious reader, Straub is familiar with the work of his
bestseller list peers. And he has strong feelings about what does
and doesn't make a good scary novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best writing of the genre, the author uses the power of
the unstated,'' Straub said. ``You give the reader's imagination
room to work. Give the reader all the information he or she needs _
a glimpse of the evil here, a sense of foreboding location there _
and then let the tension build into a sort of `aha!' moment when
everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Best buddy Stephen King is the master of such moments, Straub
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not completely consistent, but when he's at his best he
mesmerizes readers,'' Straub said, citing ``The Shining.'' ``His
greatest strength is an immense imagination and a willingness to
take risks. Too many so-called horror writers have a successful
book, then are plagued with the fear it might be a fluke. So they
do the same things again and again, (either) for that reason or
because their abilities are limited to that level.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Straub's current favorite scary writers is children's
author J.K. Rowling, whose Harry Potter series features all sorts
of demon lords and wizards-in-training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed by what she has managed to do,'' Straub said.
``You can tell she's writing from her heart. What she does in those
books is to offer a very playful version of the classic English
school/ghost story, a boy off at school facing all sorts of
supernatural challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Straub is less fond of the later vampire/horror novels of Anne
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was once the possessor of a lush, tropical style,'' Straub
said. ``It seems to me her work has become rather earthbound, less
flowing. I think it may be because she's writing faster. It seems
she has a new novel out every few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Straub's own writing schedule is more deliberate, though not
sedate. After ``The Talisman,'' he went into a four-year slump,
trying to come up with an idea for a novel that would be as
well-received as ``Ghost Story'' without mimicking it. ``Koko,''
which concerned a troubled, murderous Vietnam veteran, was
painstakingly written and rewritten one page at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But having to do it that way made me a better editor of my own
work, which made me a better writer,'' Straub said. ``I think I'm
still getting better as a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Talisman II'' _ Straub expects a different title by the time
the book is published by Random House in fall 2001 _ is challenging
and fun, Straub said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen and I have a funny, affectionate relationship, and we
decided to write books together the third time we met, which was
1979,'' Straub said. ``This second collaboration came about because
Stephen remembered something I said while we were doing the first
one, an idea I had. Being an honorable guy, since it was my idea _
I don't want to say what it was _ Stephen called and said we should
write it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Though King's in-your-face style is markedly different than
Straub's cerebral approach, the two manage to mesh well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's working on it now while I'm traveling,'' Straub said.
``My last time out, I expanded his last two paragraphs by 15 pages.
We just see what the other one has done and work from there. For
`Talisman I,' I set the tone by writing the first 50 pages. Stephen
loved that tone and did his damndest to match it in the next 50
pages. We work in a spirit of respect for each other. It's
enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   The enjoyment of writing ``Talisman II'' is tempered only a
little bit by the fact that it will only make more people think of
him as a ``horror'' writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm resigned to it,'' he said. ``My secret goal, all these
years, has been to create a whole literary genre that is defined by
my name _ the `Peter Straub' style of book. But I could write a
straightforward novel about a young couple in suburbia, nothing
supernatural, and the first line of every review would begin,
`Horror writer Peter Straub.'''

&HT;     49ERS COACH CONTENT WORKING WITH WIDE RECEIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Nearly half an hour after practice, with most
of the 49ers in the locker room, Jerry Rice runs 40-yard sprints
and Terrell Owens runs pass routes, catching balls from quarterback
Jeff Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys want to be nothing less than the best,'' said the
observer, George Stewart, in his first year as the 49ers wide
receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, after four years as the team's special teams coach, has
been entrusted with the San Francisco 49ers' most high-profile
unit. And it's clear from the smile on Stewart's face as he watches
Rice and Owens that there are parts of the job that are going along
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year receiver coach Larry Kirksey left the team in the
off-season to accept the head coaching job at Texas A&AMP;M. Kirksey
had a quiet, relaxed style. Stewart, on the other hand, is the most
demonstrative coach on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, after then-49er Iheanyi Uwaezuoke roused the
Candlestick crowd with a thrilling punt return, Stewart ran onto
the field, bumped chests with Uwaezuoke and sent the player
sprawling on his backside.
</P>
<P>
   During drills at training camp at the University of the Pacific,
Stewart often chases down his players after passing plays _
congratulating them for catches or for executing especially sharp
routes.
</P>
<P>
   He's also ready to offer constructive criticism _ with all the
force of his basso profundo voice. Due to a coincidence in
scheduling, Stewart used to meet with his special teams players and
review game films on Mondays next door to the room where coach
Steve Mariucci meets with the press in his day-after-the-game press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   After one particularly dreadful performance, Stewart was letting
his players have it _ his booming voice clearly audible beyond the
walls. Mariucci was asked how special teams had played in that
week's game. ``Let's just listen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment you do something wrong, he's correcting it,'' said
J.J. Stokes, the third regular veteran in the corps. ``And the
moment you do something great, he's the first guy running down the
field to congratulate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has 12 years of coaching experience in the NFL and, in
Mariucci's words, ``is a perfect fit'' with the team's glamour
squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some personalities, we've got some very veteran,
productive guys in that meeting room,'' Mariucci said. ``I needed a
strong coach to deal with them and keep them playing hard every
single game. . . . I didn't want to put some brand-new, young
whipper-snapper in that spot. It would have been difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, meanwhile, has eased right into his new role. It helps
that he spent the last three seasons sitting in the wide receiver
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition has been an easy one because of Jerry Rice,
because of Terrell Owens and because of J.J. Stokes,'' Stewart
said. ``They're very respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   He says each player is different. And his best may be the
easiest to coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jerry Rice the first still burns,'' Stewart said. ``He's
never comfortable. . . . He's self-motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his job will be to revitalize Stokes, who is coming off
another disappointing season. He wants to get Stokes back to the
form that made him a first-round draft pick out of UCLA in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a major university, as a receiver, he carried his football
team,'' Stewart said. ``There's no other player that I've seen in
college carry his team like J.J. did. I want to get him back to
that level.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that much of Stokes' value goes unnoticed. ``Terrell
scores touchdowns and he dances,'' he said. ``Jerry is the best of
all time. . . . Meanwhile, there's nothing flamboyant about J.J.
Stokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has 10 wideouts in camp, including second-year man Tai
Streets, who missed most of last year with an Achilles injury, and
undrafted rookie Chafie Fields, a Penn State product who is having
a great camp.
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart does whatever works with each of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all different,'' Stewart said. ``You have to be a
psychiatrist, you have to be a little bit of a con artist, you have
to be someone that's truthful, you have to be it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart watches as Rice trots over to join Owens in running
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to continue what's been laid before me here,'' he
said, ``and hopefully to improve upon it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FELIPE TORRES MOCHAS, MEXICO _ Maybe God had a reason for
letting their son bleed to death in south Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So believe the grieving parents of Eusebio de Haro, 22, one of
the latest victims in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse claiming
the lives of scores of Mexicans trying to illegally enter the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't the United States open its borders? Every day
people are drowning or dying trying to cross the desert. Maybe
someone will listen to us now,'' said Pasiano de Haro, whose eldest
son was killed by a rancher's bullet May 13 after he asked for a
drink of water about 40 miles inside U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of migrants like de Haro, and the phenomenon of illegal
immigration in general, is probably the most complicated and
bitterly disputed of all the constants in U.S.-Mexico relations.
The delicate subject could be headed for an era of fresh
negotiation when Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox travels to the
United States for high-level talks in August.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans largely view the United States as a two-faced nation,
eager to use cheap undocumented labor but indifferent to the perils
faced by those who swim the Rio Grande or trek through wilderness
to get into the country. Many Americans believe that Mexicans have
developed an unhealthy reliance on seeking U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is the former governor of Guanajuato, the state where de
Haro was from and a top source of Mexican legal and illegal
migrants. On July 2 Fox made history by toppling Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has controlled the
presidency here for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   A charismatic leader who is promising sweeping change when he
takes office s to meet President Clinton next month as well as
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush and his Democratic
rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Fox reportedly would like to ask the United States to consider a
dramatic increase in the number of immigrant visas it grants to
Mexicans annually. Last year, about 75,000 Mexicans were granted
legal residency visas to the United States, more than any other
country.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Fox suggested in a recent ABC News interview, Mexico
and its North American neighbors should aim for opening borders
completely to a free flow of labor _ like the European Union _ in
as little as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see some Americans sitting at their house, watching TV and
hearing me, Vicente Fox, saying we're going to open up that border
to people. Wow! That's a shock. But, I think we will have wisdom if
we have a long-term view,'' Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, said
in English.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Fox lashed out at the PRI for failing to
generate enough jobs and relying on the United States as a ``safety
valve'' to release the pressure of high unemployment at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox is also a pragmatist who says immigration will be
impossible to stop until the profound wage gap between Mexico and
the United States is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a member of the conservative National Action Party,
aggressively reached out to migrants while he was governor and
visited them in the United States during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Countless towns in Mexico rely on the estimated $6 billion
migrants send home annually, a sum that's more than Mexico spends
on primary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   Here in San Felipe Torres Mochas, signs of money from ``el
norte'' co-exist with tradition. Trucks with Texas, California or
North Carolina license plates rumble past adobe homes. Donkeys tied
to posts eat corn from barrels just down the street from
hand-painted signs advertising Internet hook-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a 1986 law that imposed tougher sanctions against
hiring illegal immigrants, people in Guanajuato's villages say
undocumented Mexicans are still routinely hired by American
employers from the Canadian border to the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio de Haro, in fact, worked at a Texas furniture factory
and an Arkansas construction site shortly before he died near
Brackettville, Texas, trying to return after being deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latino immigrants are making the United States strong. Why
don't Americans just recognize that?'' said Pasiano de Haro.
</P>
<P>
   Represented by American lawyers, de Haro filed a $15 million
lawsuit this month against Sam Blackwood, the rancher who shot his
son in the leg after Eusebio and a companion stopped at his house
and asked for water after crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood is accused of pursuing the men after they were spurned
and shooting de Haro, who bled to death before a sheriff's deputy
arrived at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood has been indicted on charges of deadly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the Guanajuato village of Nuevo Valle de Moreno, where de
Haro's death hit home, townsfolk said virtually every family has at
least one member working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had problems finding a job or been asked for an
identification card once since I started going to the United States
when I was 14. The problem is getting there,'' said 30-year-old
Rafael Rangel, who opened a tortilla shop with money he earned
doing construction in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 200 people from his village of only a couple
thousand, Rangel said, are currently in Little Rock mostly doing
construction, yard or restaurant work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's more dangerous than ever for migrants. The U.S. Border
Patrol's strategy of trying to deter migrants by forcing them into
more isolated areas has resulted in an increase in deaths - more
than 160 so far just this year, according to Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers on the Arizona border have been accused of ``hunting''
migrants, unlawfully detaining them at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure is building among various quarters in the United
States to own up to America's continued addiction to immigrant
workers. Arizona Gov. Jane Hull acknowledged a labor shortage in
her state that Mexican workers could help fill. Several bills are
floating in Congress to legally allow in more foreign farm
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic boom in the United States has made it possible to
recognize that migrant workers are contributing. Even labor
organizations like the AFL-CIO are talking positively about migrant
workers. This is a parting of the waters,'' said foreign affairs
expert Rafael Fernandez de Castro of the Autonomous Technical
Institute of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez de Castro is collaborating with the U.S.-based
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to develop possible
options for admitting more legal Mexican workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't wait to talk about this. The United States
economy could decline and migrant workers could become
scapegoats,'' Fernandez de Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-union AFL-CIO broke this year with a traditional U.S.
labor position that immigrants have a negative impact on American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is advocating another amnesty _ similar to one
passed by Congress in 1986 _ for the estimated 6 million
undocumented workers in the United States. But it doesn't support
starting a guest-worker program with Mexico; unions fear a special
program would be riddled with abuses and suppress wages and labor
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a sense that in this day and age there should
be something better than the status quo,'' said University of
California at Davis migration specialist Phil Martin. ``The problem
is there is no consensus on what that should be.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s the U.S. labor movement fought to end the
``bracero'' program, which started importing Mexican workers to
work on U.S. farms during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The program allowed employers to pay Mexican workers less than
minimum wages and routinely subjected them to unsafe working and
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Farm labor advocates also have a dim view of the existing H-2A
program, which imports a relatively small number of foreign farm
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   With an abundance of undocumented workers arriving on their own,
agricultural employers in the West haven't really needed the H-2A
program, which requires employers to prove they can't find
Americans or legal residents to hire.
</P>
<P>
   But fueled by a surge in the South, especially in North Carolina
and Georgia, the numbers of H-2A workers rose from about 15,000 in
1995 to a record high of close to 42,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another program that admits non-agricultural seasonal laborers
is the H-2B program, which has a cap from all countries of about
66,000 a year. Mexicans have been recruited under this program to
work in stables in Kentucky, Christmas tree farms in North Carolina
and crab-packing operations in Maryland, where labor violations
have been alleged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic position is that guest-worker programs don't work.
What they do is provide employers with vulnerable workers with no
political or economic power,'' said Bruce Goldstein of the
Farmworker Justice Fund in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary foreign workers have no right to bring families and no
right to seek legal residency, Goldstein said. None of the current
proposals for more guest workers call for those reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, now the top user of H-2A workers, labor
advocates say employers have had union organizers and social
workers arrested _ a violation of civil rights _ simply because
they tried to visit employees in mandated company-provided housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK to want to legalize the flow of labor,'' Goldstein
said. ``But the legal framework offered right now is terrible. Our
view is that if this country needs workers, they should be allowed
in as immigrants with the right to become citizens.''

   VAQUERIA, Mexico _ For Carlos Hernandez it was that long year
alone he spent in Atlanta that really helped him understand the
hardship Mexican migrants suffer.
</P>
<P>
   A professional who once ran his own publicity company, Hernandez
didn't see his wife or small children once the whole time he was in
``el norte,'' the north, working as a house painter to pay business
debts that soared after Mexico's peso crashed in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hernandez drives an old Volkswagen bug over rutted dirt
roads in Mexico's Guanajuato state, bringing information to
mountain villages that send a steady stream of migrant laborers to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going back 40 years in time in some of these
villages. In some towns, the women and the men still sit on
separate sides of the church,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned Catholic faith is strong in the rugged farm
country of Guanajuato, and many men and women still abide by strict
roles defined by gender. Hernandez, who works for a unique state
aid program for migrants, tries to help the families of migrants
cope with the strain of separation and _ too often _ abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   He also tries to inform migrants of the hazards they face, what
their obligations are under U.S. law and their rights should they
be detained or threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, Hernandez was in charge of receiving the body of
Eusebio de Haro, a 22-year-old undocumented migrant who was shot
and killed by a Texas rancher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sent back in a black plastic bag with a few pesos in
it,'' Hernandez said, still bristling at the indignity.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in Vaqueria, a village surrounded by rocky fields farmed
with crude wooden plows and horses, Maria Abundez asked Hernandez
to help find her 20-year-old son in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He's the oldest of the 14 children Maria, who is only 38, gave
birth to.
</P>
<P>
   Genero Medina, whose father left for California when he was a
child, asked if Hernandez knew where to find him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called a number and he wouldn't talk to us,'' Medina, now
25, said.
</P>
<P>
   Without any money from her husband, Medina said his mother had
been reduced to selling cactus fruit in nearby city streets to help
maintain the small children she still has.
</P>
<P>
   One of her older daughters is married to a migrant who also
appears to have disappeared, and Carlos Hernandez fears the cycle
of abandonment will repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who are left behind have it the worst of all,'' he said.
``They have low self-esteem. They get depressed and start drinking.
We've discovered a number of babies born with deformities because
their mothers drank.''
</P>
<P>
   Migration from Guanajuato began in the early part of the last
century and is so ingrained here now it is futile for social
workers to try to persuade people from going with mere words,
Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The state _ which is home to Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox
_ is trying to develop home-grown jobs in remote villages by
offering investment help to start clothing factories that can
employ wives and other women left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these factories have failed to take off. But the state
is pushing on with the project, trying to provide jobs where
virtually none exist outside of farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of how many generations there have been of people who
found that the United States was the best option,'' Hernandez said.
``Some think if you don't go, you're not a real man.''

&HT;     HEARST RETREAT IN CALIFORNIA MAY GO INTO NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Press tycoon William Randolph Hearst's estate
known as the Hacienda on what is now Fort Hunter Liggett in
southern Monterey County, Calif., may be incorporated into the
federal park system under an unusual arrangement between the
National Park Service and the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst sold the 165,000-acre property, including the Hacienda,
to
</P>
<P>
   the Army in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Now the park service is interested in acquiring the Hacienda
</P>
<P>
   along with 76 other buildings and 100 acres on the base that the
Army has declared it no longer needs.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1992, when Fort Ord was deactivated, Fort Hunter Liggett
was used
</P>
<P>
   principally by the Fort Ord-based 7th Infantry Division. It is
now managed by the U.S. Army Reserve Command.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst used the Hacienda as a rustic ranch getaway from his much
more elaborate San Simeon estate in the coastal mountains near
Cambria in northern San Luis Obispo County. Both structures were
designed by famed architect Julia Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Joint use of an active military base is highly unusual, National
Park
</P>
<P>
   Service spokesman David Barna said. ``The only thing I can think
of quite like it is the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in
South
</P>
<P>
   Dakota,'' which opened last November, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Army Reserve has rented 14 rooms and served
meals
</P>
<P>
   at the Hacienda. The rooms range in price from $125 for a suite
to $28 for the five plain ``cowboy rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Service study to evaluate the Fort Hunter
Liggett property was authorized in a bill sponsored by Rep. Sam
Farr, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the park service will hold public hearings in King
City and Salinas to determine what kinds of uses people want for
Fort Hunter Liggett. The post is located 22 miles southwest of King
City and 80 miles south of Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   One question the study aims to answer is whether the Park
Service will be able to use any of the oak valleys and hills where
the Army reservists now train.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great collaborative approach for public access,'' said
Holly
</P>
<P>
   Bundock, regional spokeswoman for the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The fort was named for Lt. Gen. Hunter Liggett, who commanded
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   troops in the Philippines in 1916 and 1917 and in Europe during
World War I.

TURNPIKE STOPS WORTH THE TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., Brazil)   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scenery along the Ohio Turnpike _ an east-west melding of
Interstates 80, 90 and 76 _ will never be confused with that along,
say, the Pacific Coast Highway or the Blue Ridge Parkway. But weary
travelers this summer are encountering something that may
compensate: a new generation of service plazas, providing the
amenities of home or at least those of a decent airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, the buckle on the Rust Belt, the turnpike commission
has decreed a new family of pleasure domes. Little colonies of
comfort just off the exit ramps, the buildings are set in pairs,
one on either side of the roadway. They catch the eye immediately,
suggesting the town hall of a midsize Swedish municipality or
perhaps an American high school designed by Eliel Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   Long, with low domes, eaves of white limestone and supports of
Roman brick, they replace drab and dingy facilities dating from
1954 and 1955, the first years the highway was open. Their arcades
curve to embrace the parking lots; covered walks reach out, topped
by an iconic minitower that is part sail, part steeple _ a faintly
Art Deco element that could have been borrowed from the 1934
Chicago World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   At about $10 million each, the plazas may seem steeply priced.
But the two pairs already open (the Erie Islands and Commodore
Perry stops, at one exit, and the Towpath and Great Lakes centers,
at another) have become a hit with their offerings of Sbarro,
Starbucks, Jody Maroni's &AMP; Cinnabon, Burger King and Max &AMP; Erma's
sit-down restaurants. All 16 stops are due to be finished by 2005
or 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The designs were part of a larger plan to improve and widen the
turnpike, a plan initiated in 1994, when the commission promised a
fresh new vision: ``Rather than rehash the old concept of service
plaza, the commission has instead redefined the concept for the
21st century,'' a legend on the turnpike map boasts.
</P>
<P>
   Under Umberto Fedeli, a former chairman of the commission, the
project began in 1995 as part of the wider refurbishment. To pay
for a whole package of improvements, including redoing toll plazas,
rebuilding bridges and adding interchanges and an extra lane, tolls
have been raised about 10 percent a year since 1995, leading to
widespread grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we were building Turnpike Taj Mahals,'' Enrico
Zamporelli, the commission's executive director, said. ``But now
people love them.''
</P>
<P>
   The new service plazas have surely helped improve drivers'
perceptions of Ohio. The impressions left by a major highway can
shape the entire image of a state _ consider how often New Jersey
is associated with the oil refineries along just a couple of miles
of the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to enhance the image of the state of Ohio,''
Zamporelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the new centers is Celso Gilberti, whose firm,
Gilberti Spittler International of Cleveland, was chosen from three
finalists in an architectural competition. Gilberti, who was born
in Brazil, examined other ``transportation nodes'' _ bus and train
stations and airports _ and chose as his model what he calls ``the
better shopping airports,'' like Pittsburgh's, with a variety of
stores and types of food.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the buildings is inspired by Prairie style, he said.
``My buildings have a strong sense of eaves,'' he said. ``You get a
very nice horizontal line, anchored with the dome at one end.''
Those eves and the long Roman bricks in the supporting structures
pick up the horizontal line of the road _ the line of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Gilberti said, travel becomes monotonous: ``You lose
the excitement you had when you set out, of going from one place to
another. I wanted to recapture some of that excitement of the
journey.'' In each lobby, an attendant stands watch at a
horseshoe-shaped information desk. Inside are shops, a business
center with a fax and e-mail kiosk, a truckers' lounge and various
dining options.
</P>
<P>
   A display shows a side of Ohio that is changing. To such
attractions as the Benjamin Harrison historical site have been
added the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the National Inventors Hall
of Fame and the roller coasters at the Cedar Point amusement park,
top-rated by connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   A chart lists hotels and motels along the turnpike, with a green
light for vacancy, or a red if fully occupied. Truckers, who enter
separately, have their own television lounge with smoking and
no-smoking halves, several showers and a coin laundry room.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the dome four or five restaurants line one wall, and
tables are scattered among upright lamps that feel like
streetlights. The patio, with more tables, is popular as well. At
the Towpath center, the restaurants include Panera Bread, known for
sourdough bagels; the Coffee Beanery; Wendy's; and Pizza Hut. As is
the policy at many airports these days, the facilities promise to
restrain prices for ``captive travelers'' to roughly the level of
those in surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   Turnpike travelers across the country have come a long way from
the dark '70s, when they faced decaying facilities on toll roads.
Long-term contracts during those inflationary years left the
vendors with little incentive to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern for toll road services was set by the Pennsylvania
Turnpike, the nation's first, which opened in 1940. In the 1950s,
variety in food on the turnpike meant 28 flavors of ice cream to
follow the wrinkled frankfurters in paperboard trays. Howard
Johnson raised turnpike food to an art, before it degenerated into
grudging service, indifferent maintenance and minimal choice.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, travelers' tastes have changed. They want bagels and
yogurt, Arizona iced tea and French roast coffee. (The Starbucks at
the Commodore Perry service area, Zamporelli said, is one of the
busiest in the country.) And travelers want their electronic
services: modems and faxes and places to recharge their cell
phones. Even truckers file their road logs by fax or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of other turnpikes have visited Ohio, Zamporelli
said. The New York State Thruway has added larger plazas with more
services and varied food in recent years. Several states offer
outdoor farmers' markets in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberti stops by the plazas frequently to read the comments in
the guest books. On his way in, he always glances up at the towers
at the entrance. ``These I call the Portals of Ohio,'' he said.

JANINE TURNER TACKLES NEW SERIES AS A SINGLE WORKING MOM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The message button on the phone in my hotel
room was illuminated when I woke at 8:30 a.m. That seemed very odd
to me, since I hadn't heard the phone ring during the wee hours of
the morning. What I discovered, however, after listening to the
recording, was that the person who had left the message was Janine
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and I had been trying to hook up for three days without
success to talk about her new Lifetime series ``Strong Medicine,''
a hospital drama that premiered Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Our first attempt failed last Friday when Turner and her 2
1/2-year-old daughter, Juliette, decided at the last minute to
spend the weekend with their three horses, three dogs, eight cows
and two cats at their ranch near Fort Worth. The following Monday
was unsuccessful because of Turner's hectic work schedule. But at 6
o'clock Tuesday morning _ in atypical Hollywood fashion _ the
gracious Texan called from the set and left a rather lengthy
apology on my voice mail that was filled not with excuses, but
realities.
</P>
<P>
   She was a single working mother who, at that moment in time, was
simply overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough s'plainin' for me.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, she left a plethora of numbers where she could be
reached during the day and added that she had asked the hotel clerk
to put the call through so it wouldn't wake me.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty, smart and considerate, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Turner, 37, and I finally did talk, it wasn't for very
long. She was between takes and only had about 10 minutes before
her next scene. Initially, the conversation was all over the map,
like two old girlfriends who couldn't wait to share the significant
and insignificant events of the past few days. When she learned I
was from Ohio and not the Lone Star State, the Lincoln, Neb.,
native and longtime Euless, Texas, resident turned on the Texas
charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I've ever met from Ohio has really great skin,'' she
said. ``I bet you have beautiful skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. Pretty, smart and psychic, too.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation soon turned to baby talk. Turner is more than a
little delighted that she's able to bring her daughter to work with
her each day. Little Juliette has a playroom on the set and her own
personal trailer that her mom bought for her in Texas. ``It's all
pink with flowers and birds and lots of little girl things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really blessed to be in this place at this time,'' she
said wistfully. ``It's been a little crazy. I'm in a new house out
here, but I'm not in it because everything's still a mess. That's
why I wanted to go home. I feel grounded when I'm back in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big believer that if you don't take time to fill up your
soul, then you are kind of running on empty. You have to take time
to refill your well. Life is an important thing. I need a normal
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Life has rarely been ``normal'' for Turner, who began modeling
and participating in beauty pageants when she was 3 years old. Her
mother, Janice, was a former beauty queen who encouraged Turner to
take advantage of her God-given assets.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Turner and her family moved to New York, where she signed
with the prestigious Wilhelmina agency. Even then, she longed for
her Texas roots and ended up returning to Fort Worth to finish high
school. Just before her graduation, Turner was cast as Charlene
Tilton's best friend on ``Dallas.'' That gig led to starring roles
on the late-night soap ``Behind the Door'' and the daytime drama
``General Hospital,'' where she played Demi Moore's younger sister,
Laura Templeton.
</P>
<P>
   Her career really took off in the '90s when she was cast as the
strong-willed Maggie O'Connell in the cult classic ``Northern
Exposure,'' a role that earned her a Best Actress Emmy and three
Golden Globe nominations. Next came a plethora of
movies-of-the-week and a handful of feature films such as ``Young
Doctors in Love,'' Sylvester Stallone's ``Cliffhanger'' and ``Leave
it to Beaver,'' in which she played Beaver's mom, June Cleaver.
She'll next be seen on the big screen this fall in Robert Altman's
``Dr. T and the Women,'' with Richard Gere.

AMERICANS MAKE TOILET RUNS ON CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.Y., Ind., Canada)   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WINDSOR, Ontario _ During
Prohibition, Americans rowed across the Detroit River to this
border city to buy whiskey. A generation later, young people drove
across the river to buy marijuana. But today, the border contraband
run is to score a different kind of Canadian pot, one that gives a
different kind of thrill _ the forbidden flush.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why do I need the government to tell me what kind of toilet to
buy?'' Linda Walton, a visiting American, asked one hot Saturday
morning after her husband, Tony, wrestled into their van three
3.5-gallon-capacity toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The Waltons and their two boys, Kyle and Ian, had made the
five-and-a-half-hour road trip from Indianapolis in search of
suburbia's new holy grail: the kind of old-style, big-flush toilet
that Americans took as their birthright until 1994. That year, a
federal water conservation law went into effect, mandating that all
new toilets use only 1.6 gallons a flush.
</P>
<P>
   Border towns from New Brunswick to British Columbia now offer
what one Vancouver plumber has called Canuck commodes. One of the
most popular destinations is Windsor's Veteran Plumbing and
Supplies, conveniently located only two blocks from the mouth of
the tunnel from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   There, on any given Saturday, knots of Americans can be found
inspecting a gleaming array of ``3.5s'' in seafoam green, Bahama
pink, Jamaican beige, Tiffany rose and the safe decorating standby,
white bone. Some potties even carry the sticker: ``For Export from
the U.S. Only.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, conviction for distribution and sale of taboo
toilets inside the United States can mean fines of $100 a toilet.
But if American toilet manufacturers, like American Standard,
Mansfield, Kohler and Eljer, may now make jumbo toilets only for
export, there is no law to stop Americans from driving them back
across the border. Thanks to the North American Free Trade
Agreement if the toilets are made in the United States or Canada,
they come in duty-free.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Sutts, the new owner of Veteran Plumbing, winces at hearing
the word contraband. Suavely dressed in Top-Siders, shorts, polo
shirt and gold chains, he said confidently, ``It is legal for
Americans to bring them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Once home, Americans face the hurdle that new houses will not
pass inspections if they are outfitted with old-style big flushers.
But with inspections behind them, some Americans indulge in a new,
closed-door suburban passion: toilet swapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people building million-dollar houses, but they come
in here to buy an old toilet,'' Tim Harmon, the owner of Tim &AMP;
Billy's Salvage Store in Indianapolis, said in a telephone
interview. ``Nobody wants those new toilets. We sell maybe 10 or 20
old toilets a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody complains about the new ones,'' Harmon continued.
``The biggest argument that you hear is that you have to flush it
two or three times to get all the waste down, so who's saving
water?''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Muglia, a Michigan home builder who is a regular shopper
here, estimated that a quarter of his clients insist on old-style
toilets. ``A lot of people are just used to the big flush,'' he
said. In a 1998 membership survey by the National Association of
Homebuilders, 72 percent of respondents said that the new toilets
were a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of low-flush toilets respond that the newer models
work better than early versions. In a recent study, Consumer
Reports said that the late 1990s models ``worked just fine almost
always on one flush.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates also calculate that the 50 million low-flush toilets
installed since 1994 save 500 million gallons of water daily,
cutting the cost of expanded water supply and sewage disposal.
Toilets, they estimate, can account for a quarter of household
water use. Ed Osann, a natural resources consultant who lobbied
almost a decade ago for the conservation legislation, said, ``The
argument for water efficiency is pretty clear. We face growing
demands for water and wastewater infrastructure investment in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Many critics of water savers are politically conservative to
begin with. When they kneel, plunger in hand, before a clogged,
low-flow toilet, they start thinking negative thoughts about
Washington: ``First, our toilets; next, our handguns,'' they
mutter, and, ``If liberals are so eager to get big government out
of the bedroom, why are they so eager to put big government in the
bathroom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another government intrusion into what I do and
say,'' said Walton. ``If they spent as much time regulating their
nuclear secrets at Los Alamos as they do regulating toilets, our
secrets would be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   G. Gordon Liddy, who won notoriety for working with a different
breed of plumber during Watergate, boasted on his radio show that
he traveled overseas to buy banned toilets for his new house. In
one of many blasts against so-called toilet totalitarianism, he
warned: ``Next, the government will require us to wear helmets in
the shower, lest we slip and fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may tag Liddy a toilet reactionary. But Rep. Joe
Knollenberg, a Republican from an affluent Detroit suburb, is
sponsoring legislation to restore toilet choice. The congressman
assails Washington for imposing a one-size-fits-all toilet on the
entire nation. Much the way national speed limits ignored the
geographic differences between Montana and Massachusetts, his
supporters say, the national toilet standard ignores differences
between water-rich states like Michigan and Minnesota, and
water-poor states like Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were none too happy with the commodes they were forced
to use,'' Paul Welday, the congressman's chief of staff, said. ``We
found that we had a number of constituents who were crossing the
bridge to get those toilets.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the bill has attracted support from voters
nationwide and from members of Congress of both parties, he said:
``They're just folks from all across the country who have literally
written in on the back of toilet paper to say: `Keep up the good
work.'''

 UNDATED: Richard Gere. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It hasn't all been limos and borrowed diamonds from Harry
Winston, however.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was nearly broke on more than one occasion and had
several failed romances, including highly publicized ones with
former fiance Alec Baldwin, baseball player Mark Grace and
Juliette's still unidentified father, a man whom Turner says left
her when she was seven months pregnant. To this day, the mystery
man has never seen his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drama, Turner has always managed to bounce back very
nicely by Hollywood standards. That is, she has never needed to
spend time at the Betty Ford Clinic, hasn't been involved in any
hit-and-run auto accidents and hasn't had to do 200 hours of
community service for indecent exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has truly blessed me,'' she repeats softly into the phone.
``The greatest gift is my daughter. When I look at her, I see an
angel. She is so good-natured and happy. She's just a tremendous
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliette and Turner's love of Texas were two of the biggest
reasons she wasn't keen on re-establishing her career on a West
Coast soundstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like pulling teeth getting me to leave Texas,'' she
said. ``I told my agent not to even send me any hour shows because
I wouldn't consider them. I didn't want to leave home. I love
everything about Texas. It's like the movie `A Trip to Bountiful.'
Remember when Geraldine Page just wanted to go touch the dirt? My
whole family is from Texas _ my roots, my heritage. I'm just a
Texan in my soul. It's everything _ the birds, the crickets, the
heat, the people and the dirt. It's real.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern was Juliette. I did not want to uproot her,
and I was terrified of the time factor. Doing an hour series
usually means you're working from sunrise to sunrise. But it all
worked out. I'm off each day by 6 p.m., and the producers
understand what it's like to be a single mom. Also, I made sure
that my contract included time to get back to Texas. We've already
been back twice this month. In my mind, we're commuting.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her reluctance to leave Texas for Los Angeles, the
strength of the material, the opportunity to work for and with
Whoopi Goldberg (one of the show's executive producers, along with
Tammy Ader) and the complexity of her character convinced Turner to
take a dose of ``Strong Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect both Whoopi and Tammy,'' Turner said. ``Plus, the
script had a lot of colors. It would have been hard to turn this
down anyway, because the role is so wonderfully written.''
</P>
<P>
   The series chronicles the challenges, victories and
disappointments experienced by two very different women who are
forced to reconcile their differences when they combine their
talents to run a women's clinic in Philadelphia. Turner's
character, Dr. Dana Stowe, is a sort of stuck-up, no-nonsense
surgeon from a prestigious hospital whose bedside manner leaves
much to be desired. Her partner, Dr. Luisa Delgado (Rosa Blasi), is
a hands-on physician who sometimes breaks the rules at the women's
free clinic she runs in South Philly. The two become colleagues
when Stowe's hospital asks her to determine whether Delgado's
struggling clinic is worth investing in.
</P>
<P>
   With their polarizing approaches to medicine, Stowe and Delgado
just can't seem to get along. In the pilot, it takes a visiting
doctor (Goldberg, who will make occasional guest appearances) to
get the women to realize that not only do they have something
special to offer their patients, but they can also learn from each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Stowe is a strong woman who is driven, but she has a lot
of conflict,'' says Turner. ``She has a lot of levels and
complexities. I think if you sign on to be a doctor and do doctorly
things, it can be rather boring. But I've really grown to
appreciate physicians and their ability to be not only academic and
scientific, but their ability to cope with patients' emotions. It's
all very stimulating.''

GOODBYE, READERS, AND THANK YOU
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Every Good-Bye Ain't Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   I read that line _ the title of an essay by one of my favorite
writers _ ages ago, it seems. But I've thought of little else for
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   As I remember it, James Baldwin penned the autobiographical
essay some 30 years after his voluntary exile from America to
France to do the thing he loved most _ write.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin explained his leaving, saying he simply had no choice.
And while in his own eyes his departure stank of betrayal, leaving
was the only way of proving and redeeming his love.
</P>
<P>
   But every goodbye ain't gone. That is, in essence, the sum of my
feelings as I write my final column for the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Only, I've not lost my love of writing. I see my move to the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution as an opportunity to build upon it.
That's exciting.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, my mind is full of those of you who have
responded to my words, lifting me to a place I had not imagined
when my ninth-grade English teacher, Mrs. Turnage, told me I was a
gifted writer. In a funny kind of way, though, it has been your
encouragement _ and sometimes your anger and tears _ that have fed
my yearning to improve my craft.
</P>
<P>
   I had not intended to become a columnist, and certainly not in
this space and on this day of the week. I was simply filling a void
that had been left by someone who had missed a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote about the burning of the church I grew up in on an old,
winding, dusty road in Smithdale, Miss. Months later, when the
piece was named a finalist in the statewide Katie competition for
journalists, I was drunk with joy.
</P>
<P>
   By then, I'd been smitten with this column-writing bug, churning
out one a week amid my many other assignments. You had responded to
my stories, but this was different. We were connecting in a way I
hadn't thought possible. As I revealed more about myself and my
loved ones in my columns, you told me about you and yours.
</P>
<P>
   I was so very grateful when Executive Editor Jim Witt officially
asked me to write for these pages, first on Thursdays and then on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly 200 columns and four years ago. Good years.
</P>
<P>
   This place and this newspaper have been good stops for me. But I
see an opportunity to move so I can grow personally and
professionally. I see a chance to go home, so to speak, to return
to my Southern roots, the place that inspired and nurtured my
writing from when, as a little girl, I used to string words
together on white notebook paper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I can't help but ache for the people and places I will
leave behind. There's great shopping in these parts. I've had a
wonderful church family. My children got a great start on their
educations here.
</P>
<P>
   You and many of my colleagues here have provided me with a
nurturing support system. I don't take that lightly.
</P>
<P>
   You've affirmed for me what I think I've always known: that
hunger, hatred and love are the same wherever you find them, and
that no matter where you go, there's always something or someone to
love, to win or lose, to mourn or celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   But every goodbye ain't gone, is it?
</P>
<P>
   I take with me much more than I had when I arrived in 1990 from
Sacramento, Calif., not the least of which are the many memories
I've stored up from the people God has put in my path. I hope I
leave behind as much as I have been given.

   Monsters on wheels
</P>
<P>
   WACO _ If it twists the tongue, consider how it would tie up
Texas turnpikes.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, fortunately, it is the trucking industry that is
bottlenecked in its quest to open the nation's interstate highways
to monster rigs.
</P>
<P>
   The push to have these huge trucks on our highways has been
stymied thus far by Congress, which has put a lid of 80,000 pounds
on trucks on the interstate system.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen states, mainly in the West, are unaffected because
regulations allowing larger trucks were grandfathered in when
Congress set the lid on truck weight several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer some of those states lobbied Texas to join in a
resolution urging Congress to ``harmonize'' state standards. The
proposal was to allow continuous travel of triple-trailer rigs
throughout the West, including Texas. Gov. George W. Bush declined.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the four western states that do not allow the
triple rigs are California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. They are
the states sharing the Mexican border with increasing truck
traffic. They don't need more trailers on the trucks they already
have crowding their highways.
</P>
<P>
   Bush certainly ought to keep up the roadblock. Polls show a vast
majority of Texans oppose the big-big trucks, with their
road-hogging presence, their slow stopping time and the heavy wear
and tear they bring to our roads.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall the Texas Transportation Commission scrapped
recommendations of an Interstate 35 task force to consider opening
the crucial arteries to three-trailer, 26-wheel mammoths.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has no business opening its highways to triple-trailer
trucks until it can create lanes that segregate semi rigs from
passenger vehicles. As it is, the trucking industry essentially
wants to introduce to Texas highways the equivalent of freight
trains without rails.

<P>
   It's possible for states to seek exemptions from the weight
limit. Maine this year asked for it, and Idaho wants to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Texas should steer clear of that idea. And so must Congress
drive with caution on the matter of increasing truck size. A bill
seeking to increase the cap on truck weights on interstates to
90,000 pounds has languished on the shoulder, unable to advance
through congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   On the shoulder is where it should stay.

<P>
   Even among serious students of Bach, only the most privileged
ever hope to examine the composer's handwritten scores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the manuscripts, once largely collected at
the Staatsbibliothek repository in Berlin, were scattered among
more than half a dozen archives after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who received permission from those archives have had to
settle for viewing the manuscripts on black-and-white microfilm,
with its attendant vexations, or on photographs of microfilm; the
ink's corrosive effect and the ravages of more than 250 years have
left the originals perilously fragile.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, July 27, using IBM technology and timed to the
250th anniversary of Bach's death, the Staatsbibliothek and six
other repositories of Bach manuscripts are inaugurating online
access to some of the composer's documents, scanned and digitized
from high-quality color slides.
</P>
<P>
   The Bach Digital Library will make available a Web version
(www.bachdigital.org) and a version with a resolution so fine that
it can be used for study by specialists. To access the
high-resolution version, musicologists would still need to file a
request with the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   With clarity and color close to that of the originals, these
digital collections will have certain advantages even over visits
to the archives that hold the actual works, said Stephen Crist,
secretary of the American Bach Society and a professor of music at
Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One example would be the score of the ``Well-Tempered Clavier,''
where one part of the original is in the Staatsbibliothek and
another is at the British Library in London. The Bach Digital
Library will eventually allow a visitor to view the entire score.
</P>
<P>
   The digital collection will also reduce the effort involved in
studying the manuscripts. Michael Marissen, a professor of music at
Swarthmore and author of several books on Bach, called it ``a great
improvement over those challenging-to-negotiate,
motion-sickness-inducing, hard-to-read, black-and-white microfilms
in research collections.''
</P>
<P>
   Since some of the musical pieces contain gigabytes of
information, and because of the high cost of digitization, the
manuscripts will not be housed on a single server, said the
project's technological leader, Volker Susok, of IBM Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Digital Library will constitute a ``lookup
service'' that contains general information and links but reroutes
requests to access individual pieces to servers at the institutions
that house the originals.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the start of the project, the Web site will post the
digitized image of the 180-page score of the ``Mass in B-Minor''
while television and radio stations broadcast a performance of the
masterpiece from the Thomaskirche, one of four Leipzig churches
that Bach provided with music from 1723 to his death in 1750.
Listeners will be able to follow along in the score.
</P>
<P>
   As for other pieces, Susok said, the library will have MP3
streaming capabilities, so that visitors to the Web site will not
just see the score of a composition but also be able to listen to
and compare sections of its performance under different conductors.
</P>
<P>
   The Staatsbibliothek is also contributing half a dozen more of
its several hundred Bach holdings to the digital collection,
including the Brandenburg Concerto No. 3. The Bach-Archive in
Leipzig is providing the program that accompanied the 1734 premiere
of the Christmas Oratorio _ a booklet containing the text of the
work in German and notes about the performance. A couple of
cantatas are being provided by the Bachakademie in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   The project's other academic partners include the Saxon State
and University Library in Dresden, the British Library and the
Bibliotheka Jagellionska in Krakow, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   For scholars accustomed to reading aging microfilm and for
first-year students who keep their Bach in the piano bench, the
digital archive provides something else: a glimpse of music in the
master's own hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to their scholarly usefulness, the original Bach
sources are very beautiful, both for the artistry of Bach's
calligraphy and for the sheer immediacy of ink on paper,'' said
Daniel Melamed, a professor of music at Indiana University. ``The
closest we can come, physically at least, to Bach's creation of
this music and its first performance.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The imposing facade of the main pipe organ at the
Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan looks about the same
as it did before its recent overhaul. And its thousands of pipes
still produce celestial blasts of trumpets in the treble and
rumbling thunder in the bass.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the facade and the ranks of pipes is a profound
change that is causing rumbles not just beneath the floorboards of
the sanctuary but also throughout the world where people listen to
and treasure the mighty sounds of the pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Some of the sounds in the refurbished main organ are
digital, produced by a loudspeaker instead of an organ pipe. That
means that when the organist pulls a stop on the console to signal,
say, an English horn or a chime or a flute and then touches the
keyboard, the people sitting in the pews hear a digitally sampled
version of a horn, a chime or a flute pipe recorded elsewhere.
Stops are the knobs used to activate a row of pipes that make a
particular sound, like that of a flute.
</P>
<P>
   While the sound of the main organ at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian
has only a few digital contributors salted in among the regulars,
the antiphonal division _the main organ accompaniment sitting at
the rear of the hall _ is now entirely digital. All of its sounds
are produced by circuits and loudspeakers instead of pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth Avenue Presbyterian is just one place where the king of
instruments is being usurped by the prince of electronics. In organ
lofts throughout the country, relatively inexpensive circuits and
loudspeakers playing digitally sampled sounds are taking the place
of costly organ pipes. Sometimes digital sounds are used solely for
the deep bass notes of the pedal pipes and sometimes for the reeds,
trumpets or other stops that are expensive to build and fussy to
maintain. Sometimes the entire instrument is digital.
</P>
<P>
   Synthesized organ sounds are not new. What is different is the
quality of the sounds and the speed with which they are being
adopted. Proponents say that with the increasingly sophisticated
sampling techniques of digital technology, there is virtually no
difference in sound between a true organ pipe and its digital
impersonator. Any differences, they contend, are outweighed by the
savings in money and space.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the sounds of the ersatz organ pipes is
sharply inferior. They object to what they see as yet another
musical sacrifice on the altar of frugality.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard D. Westenburg, director of music at the Fifth Avenue
Presbyterian Church, defends the digital technology in his
renovated organ loft. ``The electronics are so flawless that they
replicate the real pipes with absolute integrity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the price was right. ``The cost was probably under
$40,000,'' Westenburg said. ``Were we to buy those pipes, as well
as installing a new division at the other end with its wind supply,
there's no way it could be done for under $200,000 to $250,000. And
we don't have to sacrifice the sound for the savings. We can enjoy
the fruits of economy with the same results.''
</P>
<P>
   The economics of fake pipes are certainly powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Cornel A. Zimmer, an organ builder in Denver, N.C., whose
company produces pipe organs, all-digital organs and combination
instruments that include both pipes and electronic voices,
explained the big difference in cost for a single stop. ``A low-end
pipe stop costs anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000,'' he said. ``A
high-end customized digital stop will cost about $2,000 to
$3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And the sound of that digital stop? Can it really fool the ear?
Kent Tritle, who is the music director and organist at the Church
of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan as well as organist for the New
York Philharmonic, said that there were distinct differences in the
clarity of sound between the actual and the digital. ``Setting a
column of air in motion is what one pipe does,'' he said. ``No
matter what you do, digitally produced sounds are coming through a
speaker that's putting the air in motion. It sounds quite
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the true sound of a pipe organ and its replacement
by electronic counterparts is at the center of a deeply passionate
debate. It is one thing, many musicians argue, to improve the sound
of a pipe, but another entirely to abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward digital enhancements is being firmly resisted
by some groups, including the Associated Pipe Organ Builders of
America, an invitation-only organization of more than 30 companies
that account for the majority of pipe organs produced in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to keep the organ from going down the slippery
slope of electronic conditions that compromise it,'' said Charles
Hendrickson, president of the organization and owner of Hendrickson
Organ Co. in St. Peter, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the group feels so strongly about digital voices that
after an extensive debate, it now expressly forbids the use of most
digitally sampled sounds, except for deep bass notes and some
percussive sounds, like chimes and bells. The issue is so divisive
that some members of the organization left the group because they
were unwilling to comply with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson said his group was fighting to keep the tradition of
the pipe organ alive. ``We want to retain the pipe organ as an
authentic wind-blown instrument with as few electronic voices as we
can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the business of electronic voices, as the digitally sampled
sounds are called, is booming, said John Carpenter, president of
Walker Technical Co. in Zionsville, Pa., which makes many of the
electronic stops, including the eight-foot flute harmonique at
Fifth Avenue Presbyterian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give smaller churches the ability to afford something that
sounds more like a pipe organ,'' Carpenter said. ``Put a few ranks
of pipes on it and build the rest with electronics, and you'll have
it much more like a total pipe organ.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One electronic enhancement for pipe organs has not been
controversial: the use of microprocessors to make the job of
pulling stops simpler during a pipe organ performance.
</P>
<P>
   The more stops, the more complicated the job of changing the
sound. A mere mortal with two hands and two feet, already busy with
the keyboards and pedal board, can be hard-pressed in the middle of
a tricky passage when the time comes to change the sound from
flutes to trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Wadey, a design engineer at Solid State Logic Organ
Systems in Brandon, England, and Livonia, Mich., designs some of
the programmable stop systems that let organists create a single
command _ similar to the computer shortcut called a macro _ that
specifies a number of physical actions by the stops. That lets the
organist press a single button, called a piston, to put the command
into effect. The pistons are usually under the keyboard or above
the pedal and are operated either by a thumb or a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Wadey, a young but seasoned player in the contentious world of
electronic aids for pipe organs, is careful to explain exactly what
he and his company do. ``We don't make electronic sounds,'' he said
flatly. ``We concentrate on real pipe organ sounds and tools that
let the organist get as much as possible out of the organ.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Tritle said that the
programmable stop system on the church's mechanical-action pipe
organ, designed and built by Mander Organs in London, was quite
useful. He enters information in the microprocessor so that when he
pushes a particular piston later, it moves the correct stops into
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an antique key action,'' he said, ``but the modern
convenience of electric programmable stops saves an enormous amount
of time.'' If a piece requires rapid changes in sound, Tritle can
program those changes in advance, setting memory levels for the
stop selections before the performance.
</P>
<P>
   At another Manhattan sanctuary, Calvary Episcopal Church, where
the organ is being renovated, the director of music, Harry L. Huff,
is looking forward to the convenience of programmable stop action,
as well as other innovations brought about by computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation at Calvary is being done by Bishop Pipe Organ
Service, of Westfield, N.Y. Ron Bishop, the company's owner, is
careful to point out that absolutely no digital voices are going
into the instrument. ``It will have programmable stops, but no
programmable sounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The organ at Calvary is electropneumatic. When the organist
presses any key, an electrical switch closes and activates an
electromagnet, which, with the help of a bellows to open a valve,
sends puffs of air into the pipes. When the overhaul is complete,
the organ's electromechanical switches and relays will be replaced
by solid-state circuitry, Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, one digital stop has gained wide acceptability and
prompted little criticism. It is the one used to create the bass
sound of the pedal pipe, and it is popular because the large bass
stops are expensive to produce and take up a lot of space. At this
frequency, 16 hertz, sounds are almost beyond hearing range and are
more like rumbles than notes. But even for this bass sound, some
builders refuse to use digital enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-no,'' said John Pike Mander, president of Mander
Organs in London. Mander does not put the digital bass stops on the
instruments he builds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often the sounds are sampled from existing stops with strong
basic tones but little harmonic development,'' he said. But pipe
organ stops get their particular character through a layer of
foundation notes plus a series of harmonics above them, he said.
``I don't think electronic notes, which characteristically have a
lot of foundation and little harmonic development, make the right
sort of sound,'' Mander said. A real bass pipe has harmonics that
blend with higher-pitched pipes in a way that produces better
sound, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Objections like that seem pointless for some organists, like
Robert Melhuish, the chapel organist at Saint Mary's College in
Moraga, Calif., and St. Joseph's Seminary in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organs of the future are going to have core sets of pipe
ranks and digital enhancements for the large and
difficult-to-maintain pipes,'' he said. ``Because of the huge
expense and the talent to maintain the pipes, digital enhancement
is the direction the field needs to go in, and yet the field
appears to be fighting it.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ALL THE STOPS
</P>
<P>
   As churches begin to modify and replace pipe organs, they have
several options:
</P>
<P>
   TRADITIONAL: All sounds are created by air forced through the
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   HYBRID: Many church organs now have some natural sounds,
produced by pipes, and some electronic sounds, produced by
amplifiers and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRONIC: The least expensive and most radical change
eliminates the pipes entirely. All sounds are produced
electronically.

AT 98, HE LEARNED TO READ. AT 102, HE'S BUILDING A NEW HOME

<P>
   DALLAS _ The sound of hammering and sawing rings out loudly on
Starks Avenue, a quiet street of old homes and vacant lots just a
few blocks from Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   George Dawson, 102 years old and still capable of walking at a
good clip, stands to one side of the door and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come right on in, come right on in,'' he says, holding out a
hand to his visitors in the familiar after-you gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Inside there are several men working, one sitting on the
fireplace in the living room, one out in the one-car garage. Dawson
enters, walking through the living room to the big bedroom at the
end of a short hallway. He looks out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be different, a better life,'' he says, looking
around at the room where he will put his bed, and out to the back
yard, where he plans to plant a garden. ``It's nice _ it's like a
brand new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna have tomatoes and okra and everything,'' he says,
walking to the front porch and looking out at the lawn, which is
currently covered with building materials. ``And I'm gonna have a
big dinner right out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The world is full of proud new-home owners, but few have waited
as long as Dawson. You may remember his remarkable story: He
learned to read when he was 98, and then collaborated with
co-author Richard Glaubman to write his autobiography, ``Life Is So
Good,'' published last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson appeared on ``Oprah,'' met dignitaries and had one
journalist after another profile him. He lived in a four-bedroom
former duplex that lacked central heat and air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hot in the summer and cold in the winter,'' Dawson said
earlier this day in the lunchroom of the Lincoln Instructional
Center, where he polishes his reading and writing skills five days
a week. ``The foundation was going down _ termites were eating it
up. It was dilapidated. I couldn't get it fixed. The roof was
holding the house together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting nearby, his son George Dawson Jr. takes up the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a geat deal of leaking,'' he says, noting that the
home was 40 or 50 years old and that his father had lived there for
about the last 15 years. ``The first idea was to remodel the house,
but everybody said it would cost more to repair it than to get a
new one built.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Gary Krupkin, who describes himself as a ``self-absorbed
lawyer'' and a big George Dawson fan. His wife, Roxanne, had
suggested he read ``Life Is So Good''; he did, and was so impressed
that he went and saw Dawson at a reading. He met Dawson, who
autographed a copy of the book, and Glaubman.
</P>
<P>
   Glaubman said that Dawson had never lived in a new house and
asked if Krupkin could help. ``I said sure. George is a cool guy,''
Krupkin said. ``Here's the story of a guy who saw the absolute
worst our democracy can deal out to anybody, and he has such a
positive outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Krupkin's own home near White Rock Lake had been built three
years ago by the Starks Building Co. He contacted proprietor David
Starks and arranged a meeting with the Dawson family.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to use advance royalties from Dawson's book to fix
the old house, but now the money went into new construction. Dawson
moved his possessions (including his Bibles) into his son's house
in late April; his home was torn down and construction began in
early May.
</P>
<P>
   ``George didn't even have a bank account before he got his
advance,'' says Glaubman, a teacher who lives in Washington state
and first heard about Dawson through a reprint of a story published
in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``He would cash his Social
Security checks at the grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   The new brick house is 1,200 square feet; it has three bedrooms,
two bathrooms, central air and heat, a gas log fireplace and gas
stove. George Jr. says one of the bedrooms will be used as a
library, dedicated to the plaques his dad has received and the
photos that have been taken of him with famous people.
</P>
<P>
   Starks says the home should be completed around Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Krupkin and Glaubman are looking for donations
of furniture and appliances; construction of the new home pretty
much exhausted the royalty advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `George, we can move you anywhere you want,' and he
said he wanted to live there,'' Krupkin said. ``And any company
that donates something to his house, I'll make sure they get an
autographed copy of his book. He's shown kids in that neighborhood
they can be a success _ that's what this country needs. The world
should know this story.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson says that moving into a new home is ``a fine thing to
do'' and that it'll be ``very nice'' once he's in and settled, and
that he hopes to live there the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that kids are still what he cares about the
most; he still reserves his biggest smiles for them, like the
little boy he encountered in the lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just give up,'' Dawson said softly. ``They can
say, `Well, he was an old man but he kept on going.' No man should
give up as long as he's able to move. Every school I've been to, I
give 'em my view of life. I want to give somebody an understanding
of my living.''

 &HT;    ENGINE FOCUS OF PROBE, AS INVESTIGATORS SIFT THROUGH THE
WRECKAGE OF CONCORDE CRASH
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ The pilot of an Air France Concorde that
crashed Tuesday reported engine trouble minutes after take-off and
was apparently making a frantic attempt to fly the crippled
aircraft to a nearby airport, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Senot, a French jurist conducting a judicial enquiry
into the crash, said tower controllers at Charles de Gaulle
International Airport radioed the Concorde's crew that they could
see flames at the back of the aircraft 56 seconds after it took
off. Air France identified the pilot as Capt. Christian Marty,
apparently known for skill and prudence as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain replied, 'fault in engine number two,''' Senot
said at a news conference. ``After that it seems the flames became
extremely large because (the fire) was once again signaled by the
control tower, and the crew replied that they were no longer in a
position to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew told the tower that they were heading for Le Bourget
Airport, four miles southwest of Charles de Gaulle. This would have
required a half turn rather than a full turn by the damaged
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during this turning maneuver that it crashed on the
hotel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic transport lost power and altitude as the flames
poured from engines under its left wing and crashed into a small
hotel. All 109 passengers and crewmembers aboard the Concorde were
killed, as well as four people at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The plane struck the hotel and earth near fields of wheat and
corn near the suburb of Gonesse, about nine miles from central
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Air France reported that Marty asked mechanics
to make a repair to the engine that began spewing flames minutes
before take-off. Mechanics repaired a thrust-reverser in one of the
two portside engines before the Concorde took off.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the airline said engine No. 2 _ the interior
engine on the left wing _ was inspected and repaired at the pilot's
insistence even though the repair was not required for take-off.
The problem with the thrust-reverser, which is used to slow an
aircraft on landing, was detected after the plane arrived from New
York on Monday, Air France said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pilot was told that the repair wasn't required,
he asked mechanics to make it anyway, the airline said. ``The piece
was immediately taken from a reserve Concorde,'' Air France said.
``The repair was carried out in 30 minutes.''

   Francois Brousse, the airline's spokesman, refused to speculate
on any relationship between the repair and the accident. ``At the
current state of the inquiry there is no way of knowing
</P>
<P>
   if this has any relation with the accident,'' Brousse said.
</P>
<P>
   While many experts have speculated that a single engine
explosion was probably not enough to trigger Tuesday's accident,
others said that it would be catastrophic if the explosion were not
contained. John Guntrip, a former British aviation accident
investigator, told Sky-TV News that such an event could damage
other of the aircraft's systems perhaps rendering it impossible to
fly. ``A total failure of a jet engine is a rare event, but this
looks like a major uncontained explosion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were examining the cockpit voice recorder and
flight data recorder _ the two so-called ``black boxes'' _
recovered from the aircraft early Wednesday morning. The voice
recorder can shed light on what happened because it records
conversations between the two pilots. The flight data recorder will
tell investigators about the physical condition of the aircraft, as
well as its speed and bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though British Airways resumed flying its fleet of seven
Concordes Wednesday morning, Air France said its five remaining
supersonic planes would remain grounded for now.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crash _ the first in the Concorde's 30 year history
_ French Transport Minister
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Gayssot told a news conference that he hoped an
analysis of data from the doomed Concorde's black boxes might be
available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resumption of (Air France) Concorde flights could happen
in the next few days,'' Gayssot said.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather improved during the day, investigators combed the
charredes. Typically, they will try to gather together all the
scattered engine parts to try to determine the sequence of failure.
The special metals used in jet engines are not generally damaged
significantly even in the extreme heat of such a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 43 victims were taken to a Paris lab for
examination, police said. The rest were too severely damaged to be
easily moved, and remained at the crash site as emergency workers
picked through the blackened wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six German passengers were killed in Tuesday's crash. The
overwhelming majority of the dead, they were headed to New York for
a luxury cruise to the Caribbean and, for some, on to the Sydney
Olympics. Two Danes, an Austrian and an American _ retired Air
France employee Christopher Behrens _ were also passengers. Nine
crew members died, along with four people in the hotel, including
two Polish hotel trainees.
</P>
<P>
   A special crisis center staffed by psychiatrists, counselors and
medical staff has been opened for relatives at the airport. About
100 family members were expected to come to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said in Germany that his nation was
in shock. Pope John Paul II sent condolences.
</P>
<P>
   One of the crash's survivors on the ground told reporters that
she was spared only because she had been assigned a room at the
front of Hotelissimo, which was engulfed in the blaze fed by the
aircraft's 100 tons of fuel. Alice Brooking, 21, a Cambridge
student, jumped out of a window on the hotel's second floor to
safety seconds after the accident. She had been on the phone with
her sister in England.
</P>
<P>
   She said that flames and smoke moved quickly through the hotel.
``It was like being in an oven,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Gonesse, a town of 20,000 brought unhappily to the
world stage by the crash, expressed a mix of sadness and gratitude
about what had happened. Coming out of a Toys ``R'' Us at a nearby
mall, Marie Hetru said she could not get over the crash, and the
prospect that it could have crashed into the center of Gonesse a
half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would the number of dead be then _ maybe including me and
my children,'' she said. ``Of course it is terrible _ 113 people _
but if it wasn't for the pilot, it may have been much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy said the crash reflected the
miseries of the town's living near one of the world's busiest
airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been saying for a long time that air traffic is
increasing too fast, that even with four runways, you can't safely
manage this amount of air traffic around Paris,'' Blazy said at a
press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived with planes for several decades and we don't
live in daily fear of a crash, but it's on our minds.''

DIVIDED DATA CAN ELUDE THE CENSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL SORID   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the ever-shifting Internet, what is on a Web site today could
easily be gone tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But a new publishing system developed by AT&AMP;T promises to add
permanence to information put on the Internet, assuring protection
against censorship, for example, and the unauthorized deletion of
material by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The system is called Publius, after the pen name adopted by the
authors of the Federalist Papers. It dices up messages, encrypts
the pieces and spreads them across many computer servers. The
pieces, called keys, are designed so that even a small number of
them can be assembled into a complete message.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while keys would live on dozens or hundreds of computers,
a user would need to have access to only a few of those computers
to have enough information to reassemble the document. Publius
recently accepted its first users as part of a two-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   Publius can be used to spread any kind of data, including text,
music and images, although there are limits to the size of the
files. The keys are always encrypted, so those who hold keys on
their computers never know exactly what they contain. The author of
the material can later modify or delete it and can remain anonymous
by using Publius in tandem with an online identity masking-service.
</P>
<P>
   The developers of Publius say that even if a government had
legal authority to remove a file from computer servers, doing so
would not be feasible because of the sheer number of servers that
would hold the information. ``It won't stop them from getting the
court order, but it will make the court order unenforceable,'' said
Dr. Avi Rubin, the co-developer of Publius and a researcher in
AT&AMP;T's secure systems research department.
</P>
<P>
   After a message is processed by Publius, the system creates a
special code resembling an Internet address that holds encrypted
information about which servers hold the keys. Once that address is
entered into a Web browser, a special server, called a proxy, uses
that information to pull together and decrypt the keys and send the
complete message to the user. Users will have to program their Web
browsers to use the proxy server.
</P>
<P>
   The system, Rubin said, will have a default setting of splitting
a message into 20 keys. But any four of those keys will have enough
information to reassemble the document.
</P>
<P>
   Another anti-censorship system, called the Eternity Service,
spreads messages across the Usenet system of Internet newsgroups.
But Rubin said that Publius is more advanced because messages on
Usenet can expire, and messages put on newsgroups cannot later be
reliably deleted from all servers by the author.
</P>
<P>
   As more people go online, protecting speech on the Internet is
becoming an increasingly popular notion. With free tools, one can
surf the Internet anonymously, sending e-mail messages and posting
messages on bulletin boards with little fear of being identified as
the author. Messages can also be sent privately, using readily
available encryption tools that prevent others from reading a
message.
</P>
<P>
   Those tools can be used in tandem with Publius, allowing, for
instance, a dissident living under an authoritarian government to
spread an anonymous message across many servers, or to send an
undeletable message to a limited constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he hoped that political dissidents and others would
use Publius to spread messages that otherwise would run the risk of
being censored by autocratic governments or powerful organizations.
In a paper about Publius, for example, Rubin and his co-authors,
Dr. Lorrie Faith Cranor, a senior researcher at AT&AMP;T, and Marc
Waldman, a doctoral student at New York University, wrote that the
Church of Scientology tried to censor information about itself that
it considered secret. ``The church has used copyright and trademark
law, intimidation and illegal searches and seizures in an attempt
to suppress the publication of church documents,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to countering censorship, Publius may also prove
valuable to businesses that want a reliable way to keep information
available on the Web during hacking assaults like the
denial-of-service attacks that brought down the Web sites of
several major companies earlier this year. Information distributed
with Publius would be available even if many servers were taken
down.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is giving away Publius software and service free. Rubin
said he hoped that Publius would become a success and might be
incorporated into Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   But dissidents and businesses might not be the only ones to find
Publius useful. The technology could also be used to spread child
pornography or copyrighted music. Rubin said he had taken steps to
prevent abuse of Publius but added that ugly or unwanted speech
could not be prevented. ``One of the tenets of free speech is that
it allows for uncomfortable speech,'' Rubin said. ``It would be a
tragedy if we let the potential for abuse limit all the good that
this technology can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the potential for misuse of Publius has caused concern.
``The Publius system will be used most and best by criminals,''
said Bruce Taylor, president of the National Law Center for
Children and Families, which aids prosecutors in cases of obscenity
and child pornography. Taylor said that Publius is ``an impressive
technology'' that should be allowed to exist, but that those who
use the system illegally should be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Publius is most effective with documents distributed to a large
number of servers, so the system needs people to volunteer their
servers to hold message keys, Rubin said. Many Internet users will
volunteer, he said, because of a passion for free speech and a
willingness to share resources to benefit others' work in that
area. Publius has 90 volunteers, he said, including one person who
is dedicating a one-gigabyte server to the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Internet community, there's a culture of sharing,''
Rubin said. ``In today's world, it's hard to imagine that.''  &QL;

 CT SCANNERS CAN DETECT SOME HEART-LUNG PROBLEMS AND CANCERS IN
EARLY STAGES
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanied by X-RAY SCANNER-PATIENTS and X-RAY (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CAROLYN POIROT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All that white stuff'' that showed up on his CT scan caught
Clint David totally off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the 45-year-old Dallas lawyer was running 30
miles a week, lifting weights and playing tennis when an ultrafast
electron-beam X-ray scan indicated significant calcification in his
coronary arteries. An earlier exercise stress test gave no hint of
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The same ultrafast CT (computed tomography) scanner at the
Cooper Clinic in Dallas found a tiny lung cancer _ too small to see
on a conventional chest X-ray _ in Annette Melton's right bronchus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had absolutely no suspicion at all,'' says Melton, 53, who,
after her doctor diagnosed high cholesterol, had put herself on a
low-fat diet, launched a walking-running fitness regime and started
taking vitamins with extra antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Her cholesterol had continued to climb despite her efforts, and
Cooper suggested an electron-beam scan to check whether the
cholesterol was damaging her coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   No heart disease was found, but the radiologist pointed out the
tiny mass in her lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to know if I smoked or had ever smoked or had asthma
or bronchitis, but I had not,'' says Melton, a marketing executive
for Compaq Computers in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   She took the report to a pulmonologist, who did another scan and
found the same 10-millimeter tumor. He did a biopsy and diagnosed a
low-grade malignancy known as a carcinoid. It was surgically
removed Jan. 11, 1999, and there have been no signs of cancer
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoracic surgeon told me afterward that he had to give Dr.
Cooper an A-plus for finding that tumor. I only went in because I
was worried about my cholesterol,'' Melton says. ``I had no reason
to suspect lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hospitals and some diagnostic radiology centers now have
the powerful new X-ray machines that can detect coronary artery
disease as well as lung cancer and other abnormal lesions in the
chest and abdomen much earlier than regular X-rays. But not many
doctors are using them for general screening, at least not in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   Some imaging centers in other parts of the country are heavily
promoting spiral CT scans as noninvasive screening tests for lung
cancer. Smokers and former smokers who know they are at risk are
reportedly flocking to the centers that advertise the CT scans for
as little as $300.
</P>
<P>
   David says he only got a scan as part of his annual physical
because there is heart disease in his family.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the suspicious scan, a more sensitive thallium
stress test (in which a radioactive chemical is injected into a
vein before you walk on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle in order to
detect which areas of the heart may be damaged) showed a 90 percent
blockage in one of his arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable. I walked into the Cooper Clinic expecting
congratulations for being in such good shape and left with an
appointment with a heart surgeon,'' David says. Three days later,
he was in the hospital undergoing balloon angioplasty to open the
clogged blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Both the spiral CT scanner and the electron-beam CT scanner use
ultrafast computers to analyze data from the 3-D images they make.
They are so quick, there is little distortion from breathing or
other movement, so they can detect very slight abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cooper Clinic, its two $2 million ultrafast electron-beam
scanners screen about 200 patients each week. Screenings and
medical interpretation cost $599 and are usually not covered by
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have picked up 80 malignancies including 33 kidney tumors _
renal cell carcinomas _ and six lung cancers in asymptomatic
patients, long before they developed any symptoms. We've found
hundreds of people with unsuspected coronary artery disease,'' says
Cooper, medical director of the Cooper Clinic and Aerobics Center.
</P>
<P>
   While the machines' ability to capture 3-D images is clearly an
advancement for medical science, patients should be aware that
another critical factor in these screenings is the experience of
the radiologist who interprets the scans. It's important to
consider where consumers are getting the scans _ and who's reading
them.

   UNDATED _ You've done it the Internet way: Met your customer,
shown your stuff, made your pitch, talked your terms, nailed your
sale -- all online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as your million pounds of widgets sails toward Hong Kong,
the doubts hit: How do you know whom you're dealing with? What's
the risk that you're going to get burned?
</P>
<P>
   As e-commerce -- especially business-to-business dealing --
continues its explosive growth, these questions worry more and more
business executives. Insurers are stepping forward with some
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is not just a 12-year-old in a black T-shirt with a
ring in his nose,'' said Emily Freeman, senior vice president of
Marsh Risk and Insurance Services. ``It's not just hackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how to deal with the risk is critical if e-commerce
is to grow -- just as an idea from the gang at Mr. Lloyd's London
coffee shop made it easier for 18th century merchants to think
about sending fleets of vessels around the world. The men who
created the Lloyds of London insurance market reassured ship owners
by promising to cover losses from shipwrecks, in return for an
upfront payment. Today, Lloyds is the world's largest insurance
market, where the biggest risks around are covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance is about facilitating commerce,'' Freeman said.
``That's why there's Lloyds of London.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers are developing a number of ways to help companies deal
with the risks of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, a new breed of insurance expert can consult with
companies about computer security, ranging from how to keep the
power from surging to how to keep the black-shirted 12-year-olds
out. They know about software that helps businesses learn who they
are dealing with online -- before that million pounds of widgets
heads for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an insurance-style approach to the risk that a
customer won't buy online. A surety bond Marsh is starting to
market gives e-tailers insurance that customers will be reimbursed
if the product isn't what was promised, wasn't delivered as
promised or wasn't a fair value. E-tailers who have the coverage
can post a logo on their Web pages. One of the selling points of
such programs is the hope that an easily visible guarantee will
encourage online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   More and more specialized policies are hitting the market,
agents and brokers say.
</P>
<P>
   With the rash of computer viruses in the past few years, for
instance, insurance companies have scrambled to offer coverage for
losses caused when Web sites crash.
</P>
<P>
   After hackers attacked some of the Web's most popular sites,
including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com, in February, shutting
them down for hours and costing untold millions of dollars, more
and more companies started looking for insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers are looking at a slew of other problems e-businesses
could face -- issues such as copyrights, libel and liability for
advertising and links to other pages.
</P>
<P>
   Kae Lovaas, vice president-technology of the St. Paul Cos., told
the Cyber Risk 2000 conference earlier this year that as the
Internet develops, businesses may start fighting over the market by
suing one another over copyright, patent and trademark issues.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Paul offers specialized coverage for high-tech
businesses, Lovaas said she believes such insurance for
intellectual property claims will be built into standard business
policies within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb Corp., for instance, this year launched a new Internet
insurance policy that covers companies against claims for libel or
misrepresentation that could arise from Web sites, e-mail and other
online communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more companies disseminate information to the public via
Web sites and other media ... commercial businesses now have the
same liability exposures once reserved only for book publishers,
broadcasters and advertising agencies,'' said Leib Dodell, media
and intellectual property underwriting manager at Chubb.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb's approach is an ``all-risks'' coverage for Internet
activity, rather than the approach some insurers have been adopting
of coverage for specific perils.
</P>
<P>
   Dodell said Chubb believes it has a better approach, ``given the
uncertainty of the legal rules governing the Internet and the types
of legal claims that will be generated by Internet activity.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Because judges and legislators are still trying to figure out
the best rules for e-commerce, it is tough for insurers to decide
how much they need to charge e-businesses to cover legal liability.
</P>
<P>
   While insurers are pretty good about predicting how much drivers
will cost them in any given year and charging them that much plus
an allowance for a profit, there's not much of a track record for
them to use to set a price for e-commerce coverage.
</P>
<P>
   So for e-commerce, insurers don't look so much at claims
histories or legal judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at best practices,'' Freeman said -- that is, at what
the experts say is the way to fend off risks, ranging from hackers
to power surges to mysterious shoppers from Hong Kong. If a company
is making an effort, some insurers would be inclined to cover the
risk, she said.

<P>
   UNDATED -- Say two little letters, get a big response --
everything from anger that O.J. Simpson remains in the public eye,
to pride that the justice system finally worked for a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that six years after the murders of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman, nearly five years after O.J. Simpson's
acquittal, more than three years after a jury found him responsible
for the deaths in a civil trial, the case still evokes visceral
emotions?
</P>
<P>
   Is it Simpson himself? Just this week he's sparked controversy
by appearing on the ``Today'' show to promote his latest venture
(www.askoj.com) -- and by not being a guest on ``The View,'' after
fans of that talk show protested his scheduled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum? Do the news and
entertainment media cover O.J. because the public remains
fascinated, or is the public fascinated because the news and
entertainment media cover him?
</P>
<P>
   Even experts differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bored with the subject, and my students are. They yawn
when I bring it up,'' said Frankie Bailey, a University of Albany
specialist in media and criminal justice in popular culture. ``I
know the media are still interested. People may just be dragged
along behind the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell M. Hunt disagrees. ``I don't think the case will ever be
NOT interesting,'' said Hunt, director of African-American studies
and an associate sociology professor at University of Southern
California. ``People will always be somewhat titillated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Joshua Meyrowitz, professor of communication at the
University of New Hampshire, it's ``shortcut journalism. That's the
reason why O.J. and others like JonBenet Ramsey and Elian Gonzalez
keep popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's not so much (that) the public is interested,
it's that journalists and journalistic institutions have figured
out how simple it is to report these cases. It doesn't require
research, or understanding of complex issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the World Wide Web, the 645 members of one O.J.
newsgroup (alt.fan.oj-simpson) still debate, every day, the
minutiae of his guilt or innocence. They even have labels for their
split, the ``No-J's'' and the ``Pro-J's.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,272 topics include everything from the gruesome (``Nicole,
whose trachea was severed, did not even aspirate a single drop of
blood...'') to the mundane (``Kato saw the golf bag about 10:55
p.m. outside the front door, when Simpson was still in the
house...'')
</P>
<P>
   One member is Betty Parker, 60, a General Motors retiree in
Trenton, N.J. She's pondered, or researched, or written on, or read
about the case ``from Day One,'' she said, and continues to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, ``I didn't even like O.J.,'' Parker said. ``But I
started watching, and I found myself thinking, `That's strange,'''
about so many details.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody glove, for instance. ``Why would a killer leave that
behind at the scene?'' Or Simpson's injured finger. ``If he was in
a life-and-death struggle he would have practically sliced it off,
but it was just a tiny cut.''
</P>
<P>
   For Parker, such nagging questions never have been answered, and
in their wake is a different America.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an African American, I feel my people are being punished
for taking this (innocent) position,'' she said. ``There are people
in board rooms making decisions, who are still embittered over the
O.J. Simpson verdict. And those decisions are their retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's Hunt, author of ``O.J. Simpson Facts and Fictions: News
Rituals in the Construction of Reality,'' agreed that race is a
prime reason why Simpson remains a flash point. ``I think the case
might be seen as a giant Rorschach test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trials forced America to consider three hot-button topics
simultaneously, Hunt said:
</P>
<P>
   -- Race, as Simpson is black and Nicole was white.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gender, with the allegations of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   -- And class, with his wealth enabling Simpson to hire a ``dream
team'' of attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those are issues we continue to wrestle with,'' Hunt
added.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, there's disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I encounter, the subject of O.J. just never comes
up,'' said Bailey from the University of Albany. ``I think by this
time, most people have reached their own conclusions about the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing isn't in dispute: that O.J. Simpson is a permanent
fixture in American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's outspoken, he continues to talk about it,'' Bailey said.
``As an academic, I'll be interested to see how many hits he gets
on his new Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Simpson ever be able to stroll down a street and not evoke
a response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, absolutely not,'' Hunt said. ``I just can't see it. Until
he dies, he'll be a symbol of where we are as a society.''

NUCLEAR DETERRENCE, SECURITY UNDERPINNING FOR DECADES, MAY BE DYING

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS HENRY JACKSON -- Nestled snugly in the vertical
launch tubes of this black dreadnought gliding stealthily 600 feet
beneath the Pacific Ocean are 24 intercontinental missiles humming
with power and packed with thermonuclear warheads. At the turn of
three keys, the Jackson can begin launching enough destruction to
obliterate 1,400 cities the size of Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Four U.S. ballistic missile submarines like the Jackson are
always on patrol. They lurk for months beneath remote seas, ready
on 15 minutes' notice to launch the weapons that could end
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only think about this every once in a while, but we have
the power to make it so we can't go home anymore,'' said Petty
Officer Trevor Foyston, 29, plotting a navigation course in the
Jackson's control room.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, this extraordinary power was justified in
apocalyptic terms: The United States faced a mortal enemy in the
Soviet Union. Each superpower's deadly weapons deterred the other
from attacking.
</P>
<P>
   But today, nuclear deterrence -- the underpinning of American
security for half a century -- may be a dying doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   What threat could warrant, these days, a nuclear retaliatory
strike that would incinerate millions of innocent bystanders? What
crisis should be resolved by risking ``making it so we can't go
home''?
</P>
<P>
   Even though deterrence has been the fundamental principle of
American security for 50 years, it is only a theory. No one knows
if it ``worked'' during the Cold War, or whether the nuclear powers
escaped annihilation through sheer luck. And no one knows that it
can work in a less stable world, one where emerging nuclear powers
are led by unpredictable, and in some cases arguably irrational,
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Deterrence, experts say, is in the eye of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about nuclear deterrence is, we could have redwood
logs in here,'' said Senior Chief Petty Officer James Matthews, a
Jackson crewman, rapping his knuckles on the sub's fat steel
missile tubes.
</P>
<P>
   And with few solid facts, debate among policymakers seems to
ricochet from the far corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likely consequences of nuclear war have no politically,
militarily or morally acceptable justification,'' former Air Force
Gen. Lee Butler, who retired in 1994 as commander of U.S. nuclear
warfighting forces, said at a 1998 press conference. ``The threat
to use nuclear weapons is indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice idea -- in a perfect world, say defenders of deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the introduction of nuclear weapons, you could afford
to lose a war. Nukes changed that fundamentally,'' said Jack
Mendelsohn, a former U.S. arms negotiator who is executive director
of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security Laws, a pro-arms-control
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deterrence became the inevitable nature of relations between
nuclear states; it wasn't a choice,'' Mendelsohn said. ``And I
don't see any significant change. Nuclear states will manage their
relations by the threat of devastating retaliation, which is
deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   No such arguments, pro or con, are heard aboard the Jackson. For
her 165-man crew, nuclear deterrence theory translates into a hard,
simple reality -- a monotony of six-hour watches, emergency drills
and launch rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 days at a time, the Jackson remains hidden, receiving
basic messages but transmitting not a word. The only people who
know its location are the men on the boat itself.
</P>
<P>
   America's force of 18 ballistic missile submarines is
impressive, as are their crews. But all U.S. nuclear forces sat out
an early test of nuclear deterrence in the new, post-Cold War
security environment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fall of 1990, as tens of thousands of U.S. and allied
combat troops gathered in Saudi Arabia for the war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the potential for a devastating Iraqi chemical
attack, President George Bush and his top advisers met to thrash
out a policy to persuade Iraq's Saddam Hussein not to use chemical
weapons, and on how to respond if he did.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the United States issued a veiled warning. But no
explicit threat of nuclear retaliation was made or even considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among ourselves, we said if he used chemicals we would not
respond with nuclear weapons,'' said Brent Scowcroft, who was
Bush's national security adviser. Instead, the White House would
have intensified non-nuclear air strikes against Baghdad, Scowcroft
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration feared that the coalition against Iraq,
which included several Arab countries, would shatter if the United
States menaced a fellow Arab country with nuclear weapons. In other
words, the threat was politically unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States practices coalition warfare in the future,
as most experts expect, it might face similar political constraints
on its nuclear deterrence doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is targeting. In the case of Iraq, Scowcroft
said, it was hard to imagine a target that was both of immense
value to Saddam and would not involve killing a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   The same problem -- the balance of moral and strategic concerns
-- fuels arguments over how many nuclear weapons the United States
needs. No one can say with precision what will deter a foe. As a
result, some maintain, the Pentagon has taken the conservative
course, aiming too many weapons at too many targets and risking too
many civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, a former U.S. nuclear missile launch officer who is
president of the nonpartisan research organization the Center for
Defense Information, said the Pentagon believes that 3,000 nuclear
weapons, from the total U.S. stockpile of 5,500 weapons, are
necessary to ``deter'' Russia. ``Hundreds'' more, he said, have
targets in China, Iran, Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1,100 weapons are aimed at Russian nuclear arms
sites. Many of the rest, he said, are unnecessarily targeted on the
disintegrating Russian army and on deteriorating factories idled by
the crumbling Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the United States could deter Russia with ``far
fewer'' weapons by targeting only its most critical weapons. Many
strategists agree. But the Pentagon has historically refused to
discuss its targeting plan in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the incident with Iraq suggests that Saddam was
considered so unpredictable, it was hard to know what would deter
his use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a mystery why he didn't use them. We can only
guess,'' Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   That issue -- precisely what it takes to deter a potential
adversary -- is also likely to become more complex in the decades
ahead. Clearly, the relatively stable U.S.-Soviet nuclear standoff
has evolved into a less stable situation, experts say. Consider the
following:
</P>
<P>
   -- The deterioration of Russia's non-nuclear military forces has
made it more reliant on nuclear missiles as the weapon of first
choice rather than last resort, said Pennsylvania State University
political scientist Steven J. Cimbala.
</P>
<P>
   -- U.S. officials believe Russia's 6,000 nuclear weapons are not
as tightly controlled as they once were, reopening fears about
accidental or unauthorized launch that deterrence couldn't prevent.
</P>
<P>
   -- The United States and Russia each keep about 2,000 of their
nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert. Inside of 30 minutes, these
weapons could be launched and would begin detonating with the power
of 100,000 Hiroshima bombs, according to Blair.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Missile and nuclear warhead technology is spreading virtually
unchecked, according to a September 1999 Central Intelligence
Agency assessment. Even non-government groups could acquire nuclear
weapons, the CIA said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, India and Pakistan now brandish nuclear weapons
without benefit of the art of crisis management and restraint that
the United States and Soviet Union learned during their long
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   How deterrence will work in this environment is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``As nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles spread to more and
more countries, you're going to have more and more adversaries who
understand each other's cultures less and less,'' said Cimbala.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Spring, arms analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said the United States and the Soviet Union during the
Cold War were ``like two scorpions in a bottle -- the dynamic was
clear and reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   But with six or eight nuclear powers, ``the dynamic has
changed,'' he said. ``Deterrence clearly has its limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the retired Air Force general, now declines to speak
publicly as he works behind the scenes toward a total abolition of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But he has said that deterrence relies on a perfect knowledge of
how the other side thinks. And American understanding of Moscow, in
his view, was dangerously far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, senior commanders like Butler studied the
personalities of their Soviet counterparts by name and habits, and
tracked their whereabouts every day. Soviet military writings were
dissected and discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler, in a March 1999 article in Resurgence magazine,
wrote that this was all in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was it that we subscribed to a strategy that required near
perfect understanding of an enemy from whom we were deeply
alienated and largely isolated?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than understanding each other precisely, he described the
two Cold War superpowers as ``groping fearfully in a fog of mutual
misperception.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts insist that there is a useful distinction between
``rational'' enemies, who can be trusted in a crisis, and those who
are irrational.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, Virginia Republican and chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said during a committee hearing May 23
that nuclear deterrence works between Russia and the United States
because there is in both countries ``a rational framework of
decision-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that North Korea, Iraq and others are unpredictable
and ``irrational'' and thus cannot be deterred with nuclear
threats. That is why the United States must build missile defenses,
Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting view holds that ``rogue'' leaders may be
unpleasant, but can be understood and deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Saddam Hussein is not irrational; he just has
different values and priorities,'' said Jerrold Post, a career
analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency who established the
CIA's Center for Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Post now directs the political psychology program at George
Washington University's School of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk about the irrationality of `rogue leaders,' I
often think they mean individuals who refuse to have their foreign
policies adhere to the ideas of the West,'' Post said. ``There is a
tendency to demonize those whom we don't understand clearly, and
that is unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of nuclear deterrence is entangled in another
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of strategists believe that a key American goal
-- keeping other countries from ``going nuclear'' -- will be
unreachable as long as the United States clings to its own huge
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason that the ranks of the nuclear abolitionists
were joined in 1994 by retired Air Force Gen. Charles Horner, who
commanded U.S. and allied air forces during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard for us to say to North Korea, `You are
terrible people, you're developing a nuclear weapon,' when we have,
oh, 8,000 of them,'' Horner explained during a 1994 press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   None of this gets much conversation in the officers' wardroom or
the mess decks of the Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues really aren't my business,'' said the Jackson's
skipper, 41-year-old Cmdr. Paul D. Ims Jr., whose cropped blond
hair and wire-rim glasses give him a boyish look. ``My business is
to be out here and to be a deterrent at the highest level of
readiness I can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to firing the missiles, at least in practice, the
procedure is so intense and mechanical that it leaves little room
for introspection.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought when he squeezed the trigger that in an
actual launch would send 800,000 tons of thermonuclear explosive
streaking toward human targets, Lt. Randy Tupas, strategic weapons
officer, looked blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about anything, it was just sort of
automatic,'' he said. ``It's a reflex.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS URGED TO BUY LAND TO HELP ENVIRONMENT, SUGAR GROWERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buy land, not sugar.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Everglades Coalition urged Congress to do
Wednesday in response to the market surplus of sugar and the
decrease in its price.
</P>
<P>
   At a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, the coalition, which
includes 42 environmental, civic and recreational organizations,
suggested that the federal government purchase marginally
profitable sugar-growing land in the Everglades Agricultural Area
instead of purchasing extra sugar to reduce the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition also urged Congress to phase out the sugar price
support program when it considers reauthorization of the farm bill
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal sugar price support program inflates the profits
of sugar farms in the EAA, distorts the economy of sugar making,
and provides an incentive for overproduction while destroying one's
of the nation's most valuable natural resources,'' said Shannon A.
Estenoz, co-chair of the Everglades Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government decisions to buy sugar simply encourages the growth
of the sugar surplus, and _ as an alternative _ the government
should choose to purchase land in the EAA, which would take the
land permanently out of sugar production and make it less
destructive to the Everglades.''
</P>
<P>
   Estenoz suggested that if the program was eliminated, ``marginal
sugar growing lands that are only profitable to farm because of
price supports would likely come out of production, thus reducing
the pollution into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said Congress needs
to consider the option of making further land purchases from
willing sellers in the EAA with the savings that might result from
reforming the sugar program.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Farm Bill included $200 million to purchase lands in
the EAA to help restore the Everglades, Lugar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Everglades are dying because the natural flow of water has
been disrupted, and water that could be used to restore the natural
environment is being flushed out to sea,'' Lugar said. ``I believe
that sugar policy reform can play an important role in Everglades
restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark D. Perry, executive director of the Florida Oceanographic
Society, told the panel that sugar growers have caused damage to
the Everglades through the diversion of the natural flow of water
and the introduction of pollutants such as phosphorus and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historiified.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said the United States must support
sugar growers with more money or risk losing the industry
altogether, and that opponents of the sugar price support program
are referring to incorrect world sugar prices in their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union spends 10 times more than the U.S. on the
sugar industry, and it is no wonder that they have gobbled up our
market share,'' Conrad said. ``Furthermore, those who suggest the
price of sugar in the U.S. is twice the world price are dead wrong,
because the United States has the third lowest sugar price in the
world next to Canada and Australia.''

should choose to purchase land in the EAA, which would take the
land permanently out of sugar production and make it less
destructive to the Everglades.''
</P>
<P>
   Estenoz suggested that if the program was eliminated, ``marginal
sugar growing lands that are only profitable to farm because of
price supports would likely come out of production, thus reducing
the pollution into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said Congress needs
to consider the option of making further land purchases from
willing sellers in the EAA with the savings that might result from
reforming the sugar program.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Farm Bill included $200 million to purchase lands in
the EAA to help restore the Everglades, Lugar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Everglades are dying because the natural flow of water has
been disrupted, and water that could be used to restore the natural
environment is being flushed out to sea,'' Lugar said. ``I believe
that sugar policy reform can play an important role in Everglades
restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark D. Perry, executive director of the Florida Oceanographic
Society, told the panel that sugar growers have caused damage to
the Everglades through the diversion of the natural flow of water
and the introduction of pollutants such as phosphorus and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, rain water falling on the Kissimmee River Valley
would flow south into Lake Okeechobee, and the lake would
periodically overflow the southern rim and the water would flow
slowly through the Everglades and eventually into Florida Bay,''
Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, through the introduction of over 1,000 miles of
canals, levees and pump stations, the sugar growers have
dramatically altered the normal water level, and hurt other
ecosystems by diverting the excess water into the Atlantic Ocean
and the Gulf of Mexico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar growers have also negatively impacted surrounding
natural environments other than the Everglades, including Lake
Okeechobee, the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries and even
Florida Bay, Perry testified.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said the United States must support
sugar growers with more money or risk losing the industry
altogether, and that opponents of the sugar price support program
are referring to incorrect world sugar prices in their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union spends 10 times more than the U.S. on the
sugar industry, and it is no wonder that they have gobbled up our
market share,'' Conrad said. ``Furthermore, those who suggest the
price of sugar in the U.S. is twice the world price are dead wrong,
because the United States has the third lowest sugar price in the
world next to Canada and Australia.''

   ``I'm not concerned about the technology, but I am about the
interpretation of results,'' Cooper says. ``Interpretation is very
important. You must have a highly skilled radiologist, otherwise
you get a lot of false positives and false negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such results can lead to more invasive testing or even
unnecessary surgery, or to an unfounded sense of security that
could cause a person to ignore symptoms when they begin showing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 60 places in the country, mostly free-standing imaging
centers, are promoting the scans as general screening tests. Some
of the `doc in a box' places shouldn't be doing them at all,''
Cooper says.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is whether the tests are helpful in predicting
disease. ``We are currently doing the research to determine whether
they are valuable in predicting future coronary events,'' Cooper
says.
</P>
<P>
   He has a $1.3 million grant from the National Institutes of
Health to complete a five-year study to determine whether early
fatty deposits and calcification correlate with future coronary
events, especially heart attacks, and whether finding them can save
lives. The study was started last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of screening for these lesions is gaining credibility
daily,'' Cooper says. ``I think this technology is futuristic _ a
giant step forward in the field of preventive medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   For detecting early lung cancers that may be missed by chest
X-rays, electron-beam and spiral scanners are equally effective,
judging from preliminary published study results. For coronary
disease, electron beam is better, Cooper says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several cases where X-ray did not pick up lung cancers
that we found with the (electron beam). I believe it should be done
as a routine screening for anyone who has a history of smoking. If
a patient has a history of smoking or is a current smoker, we like
to have that CT scan done, and even if they are not smokers, we
like to have a base-line scan at age 40.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the standard in the not-too-distant future, Cooper
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Most Tarrant County hospitals have spiral CT scanners and use
them to stage cancers and check for metastasis or the spread of
cancer to other areas of the body, but no one is using them much
for screening in the Dallas-Fort Worth area except the Cooper
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Texas, a doctor's referral isn't required to get
a diagnostic test, such as a CT scan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cooper Clinic, a quarter of the tests done are
self-referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk in and ask for one if you are paying for it on
your own, and most insurance doesn't cover them, anyway.'' Cooper
says. About 25 percent are referred by outside physicians who want
more information on how aggressively to treat a patient, usually
for high cholesterol. The remainder are from one of the 14
physicians on staff at the Cooper Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   A quick check with diagnostic imaging centers and hospitals in
Tarrant County found most able to do the scans, but not doing them
without a doctor ordering the test. Doctors are not ordering them
for general screening. The charge at one Tarrant County diagnostic
center is $906.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clay Roberts, a radiologist at All Saints Hospital, says the
powerful new spiral scanners with bigger tubes and better computers
allow doctors to get a whole lot of data and process it in a
reasonable time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are replacing the old machines for everything _
diagnosing cancers, strokes, lots of different belly pains and
complex fractures,''says Roberts. ``But the new entrepreneurial
rage is to use it to screen for various malignancies in
asymptomatic, healthy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Shyn, a radiologist at Harris Methodist Fort Worth,
says most hospitals are using spiral CTs, but not for screening
healthy patients with no symptoms of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of using it for general screening is new. We have had
very few requests for a screening CT for lung cancer. We do them
all the time as follow-up when lung cancer is suspected because of
an abnormal chest X-ray or other test, but as far as screening
asymptomatic people. There has been very little in this
community.''

TO EVERY PARMIGIANO, A SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: two optional sidebars at end of article)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most people who buy Parmigiano-Reggiano never give a
thought to the variations in the way it tastes. Even I always
assumed the flavor differences had to do with the aging process or
the quality of the cheese itself. Parmigiano, after all, always
looks the same. Unlike Cheddars and chevres, it doesn't wear a
brand name or come in different shapes. It's one cheese, all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Or so I thought until last week, when I tasted
Parmigiano-Reggiano produced in fall, winter, spring and summer
side by side. I was amazed at how distinctive each one was: sharp
or sweet or herbaceous, or just intensely buttery like aged cheese.
One was not better than another _ they were just different.
</P>
<P>
   For only a few weeks in July, DiPalo's Italian specialty market
in lower Manhattan's Little Italy is able to offer these handmade
cheeses of all seasons, each two or more years old. The owner, Lou
DiPalo, and a few others like Richard Rogers of Rogers
International Ltd., an importer of specialty foods in Portland,
Maine, make a point of searching out cheeses from certain seasons
and celebrating their individuality. But they are the exception.
Each year, the differences in what is essentially the same cheese
become harder to distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when Americans are becoming more interested in
nuances in cheese, the people in charge of guarding the sanctity of
Parmigiano-Reggiano are working hard to standardize it, to erase
the variations that different seasons bring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, my tasting session at DiPalo's was eye-opening. The
seasonal differences in the cow's milk seemed very definitely to
affect the flavor of the finished cheese.
</P>
<P>
   When the spring cheese, with a slightly pink cast to its
delicate yellow center, was cracked open, its delightfully
herbaceous quality perfumed the air, though the fragrance
dissipated quickly. To me the spring cheese had the most complex
flavor. It was drier and more crumbly than the other cheeses. The
fall Parmigiano was rich and full-flavored, with a bit of bite at
the back of the mouth, the most balanced and polished of the
cheeses. The winter, which is lightest in color, was the most
delicate and sweet, with a nice mouth feel because it had more
butterfat. DiPalo provided two summer cheeses, both different, one
from the hills and one from the plains. These had the deepest
golden color, and the one from the mountains had the texture of
spring, the taste of summer: sharp with an almost acidic afterbite.
</P>
<P>
   What they all had in common was a flaky, slightly grainy
texture, the famous crunch that comes from the crystallization of
the amino acids in the milk as the cheese ages. The older the
cheese, the more grainy and crunchy. But a thin sliver of any of
the cheeses, held in the mouth, seems to melt.
</P>
<P>
   While the more pungent Parmigianos are better for filling
tortellini or ravioli and for grating, the others are better thinly
shaved on top of other ingredients or eaten in chunks out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano, the industry
group that certifies the authenticity of the cheeses, acknowledges
the existence of the seasonal variations that DiPalo celebrates and
I perceived, but says they are not as great as they once were
because the feeding of the cows has been standardized.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium insists that most differences in taste are due
more to variations in producers. In 1955 the consortium set down
regulations governing the way the cheese must be made. Those who
don't agree with the consortium say that while it may have gotten
rid of the really poor cheeses, it has also gotten rid of the
really great ones.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1984, authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano could be made only
between April 15 and Nov. 15. That made from November to April was
called vernengo. But changes in the breed of cow, the types of feed
and the method of feeding meant that Parmigiano could be made 365
days a year, a fact that the consortium officially acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a few exceptions in the hills of the region where
the cheese is produced, very few cows are out in pastures grazing.
Instead, special grasses are grown and fed to them in the barns
where they are confined. Because the feed is the same for almost
all the cows, the cheese is far more uniform than anything
available before the regulations were set down.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many professionals can discern differences. Robert
Kaufelt, who owns Murray's Cheese in Greenwich Village, says he has
come to understand that the seasons do make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a tasting, and winter cheese is better than summer,'' he
said. Lou Todaro, who owns Todaro Brothers, buys only winter
Parmigiano-Reggiano, which he also thinks is the best.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Rogers of Rogers International buys spring and fall
cheeses only. ``We deal with cows that graze only on natural
grasses,'' he said. ``We emphasize a very narrow niche.'' Rogers
has also been buying some of the very small production from the
Razza Reggiana breed of cows, which used to provide the milk for
all Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. The milk of the Razza Reggiana, or
vacca rossa (red cow), is much richer and higher in protein, and
the cheese can be aged much longer than that from the current herds
of Frisona Italiana, which are the progeny of Dutch Holsteins. Red
cow Parmigiano is also about 80 percent more expensive, Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even chefs are often aware of seasonal differences. At Frank, a
trattoria in the East Village, Frank Prisinzano serves a plate of
two to four different seasonal Parmigiano-Reggianos with figs,
peaches or pears. And at Peasant, an Italian restaurant in Nolita,
Frank DeCarlo prefers the spring and winter cheeses and matches
them with food.
</P>
<P>
   Max McCalman, who is in charge of the cheeses at Picholine,
prefers the summer cheeses, although he finds any
Parmigiano-Reggiano a hard sell on his cheese board because diners
presume to know the cheese already.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario Batali, the chef at Babbo, does not see much
difference among the cheeses. ``In a blind tasting I can't tell
which season is which,'' he said. ``Spring cheese tastes more
herbaceous, but that's all I'm prepared to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Parmigiano-Reggiano, a raw milk cheese, has been made for at
least 700 years in a region of northern Italy that consists of the
provinces of Parma, Modena, Reggio Emilia and parts of Bologna and
Mantua. The district where Parmigiano is made has about 9,000
dairies and about 600 cheese makers. The only ingredients in the
cheese are milk, rennet and salt. The entire rind of each wheel of
authentic Parmigiano is imprinted with the name as the cheese is
being shaped, as well as the month and the year. Cheeses are aged
18 months to three years, sometimes longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but good things to say about the consorzio that
protects the quality of Parmigiano-Reggiano,'' Pamela Sheldon Johns
writes in ``Italian Food Artisans'' (Chronicle Books, $24.95).
``But with big business comes standardization. More and more
dairies are forming cooperatives, and the independent
dairyman-cheese maker is becoming rare. With the disappearance of
the individual artisan goes some of the distinct differences
evident in the past, such as floral qualities in a mountain spring
cheese, or the rich, pungent character in a plains-produced autumn
cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johns goes on to say that fortunately, variations still persist,
because it is impossible to standardize artisanal products so they
always look and taste exactly the same, like Velveeta.
</P>
<P>
   In an introduction to a 1998 cookbook produced by the
consortium, Lynne Rossetto Kasper, an expert on Italian food, says:
``The secrets of Parmigiano-Reggiano's quality are found in its
inconsistencies. In a world of mass-produced sameness this cheese
is made by hand, usually only 8 or 12 wheels at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Topography also plays a role,'' she says, and ``cheeses from
the hills and cheeses from the plains are never quite alike.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Kasper was not quite so
complimentary, contending that the consortium had narrowed the
range of quality. ``Before 10 or 15 years ago there was lousy
cheese, middle-road cheese, high-good cheese and extraordinary
cheese,'' she said. ``In the '70s, it was not unusual to taste
something pretty special, and it was easy to find. The consorzio
got rid of the stuff at the bottom and discouraged the
extraordinary stuff, concentrating on the high good. They saw a
market that couldn't tell the difference between high good and
extraordinary. I think the quality has definitely gone down, and I
think it was stupid, because it commands a premium price and there
are so many alternative cheeses for people to buy today.''
</P>
<P>
   But the consortium maintains that standardization is necessary
to improve the bottom line. ``Americans and northern Europeans
equate consistency with quality,'' said Nancy Radke, the director
of communications for the consortium in the United States. ``It is
counter to artisan products, but in this industrialized world this
is a fact of life. There is a certain sadness that some of that
variation is lost, and with the European Union rules for hygiene,
cheese like this will become an endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Zannoni, a sensory analyst for the department of quality
control for the consortium, defends the standardization. ``The
consorzio has reached a reasonably good quality,'' he said. ``A
portion of the production is considered very good. I'm not sure we
had extraordinary cheese before. I think we had very good cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less variation between the seasons because of the
feeding standardizations. There is still an effect of the seasons
and of the ripening, but it is less than before. The variations are
connected more with the cheese factory than the seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPalo, however, maintains that the seasons are the primary
reason for the differences and that the cheeses he chooses
celebrate the differences. ``I know,'' he said, ``because I have
cut thousands of pounds of cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPalo, whose family has been selling Italian delicacies since
1925, is happy to acknowledge that he is a dinosaur. ``I'm very
traditional,'' he said, ``and I've taken it upon myself to search
out seasonal changes. It's an art that requires a lot of time and
patience on my part and the part of those who buy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement to bring back the vacca rossa may be to his
benefit. Since 1990 a group of 10 breeders have been making cheese
exclusively with this milk, and DiPalo is expecting a shipment of
their cheese shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consorzio is making a big mistake conforming to the
plastic world,'' he said. ``They are telling you this is what you
like, this is what you are going to eat, but I'm going to continue
to look for cheeses with different characteristics.''

   SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER: A Quartet to Make Vivaldi Sing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By MARIAN BURROS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to experiment with seasonal variations in
Parmigiano-Reggiano, here are tips from Lou DiPalo of DiPalo's and
Frank DeCarlo, the owner and chef of Peasant:
</P>
<P>
   Top buttered steamed asparagus with shaved spring
Parmigiano-Reggiano, and run it under the broiler to melt and brown
the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Top paper-thin slices of bres-aola with shaved winter
Parmigiano-Reggiano on a bed of arugula; drizzle with extra virgin
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Add grated summer Parmigiano-Reggiano to a frittata with onions
and peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Top very thin slices of prosciutto with slightly thicker slices
of winter Parmigiano-Reggiano over baby dandelion greens, and serve
with fresh figs drizzled with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   As for complementary wines, DiPalo recommends Chianti or merlot
for fall Parmigiano-Reggiano, prosecco or pinot bianco from Friuli
for winter cheese, Dolcetto d'Alba for spring cheese. Summer cheese
is not good for eating out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGING A CHEESE BY ITS RIND
</P>
<P>
   By MARIAN BURROS
</P>
<P>
   Even if you cannot choose Parmigiano-Reggiano by the season,
here are some rules for getting the best available and storing it
properly:
</P>
<P>
   Look for the date and year the cheese was made, imprinted on the
rind. If the rind has ``X'' marks, the cheese has been rejected by
regulators because it did not meet their standards.
</P>
<P>
   Never buy grated Parmigiano-Reggiano: It loses its flavor. If
you grate cheese, use it within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Buy cheese that has been cracked into wedges, rather than
sliced, which changes the texture.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese should have a crisp but not very dry texture; the color
is not indicative of quality or taste.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for cheese that has been stored either at the proper aging
temperature or in a refrigerated case. At home, remove the plastic
wrap and let the cheese sit at room temperature for a few minutes;
then rewrap it with plastic film and cover with aluminum foil or
parchment paper. Change the wrap every time the cheese is used, or
at least once a week. Keep the cheese in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   If a piece of cheese has become old and dry, wrap it in a
moistened cheesecloth, cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate for
a day. Then, rewrap in plastic. If mold develops on the outside,
clean it off; otherwise, it will bore through the cheese and spoil
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the rinds to add flavor to minestrone or chicken
soup, wash the outside first.

 &HT;    SENIOR GROUPS CALL CHENEY'S VOTING RECORD A 'DISASTER'
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his decade in Congress, Dick Cheney compiled
a record of voting against elderly interests on Social Security,
Medicare and assistance programs, senior advocacy groups said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voting record on senior issues was a disaster,'' said
Bette(cq) Cooper, communications director for the National Council
of Senior Citizens. ``I haven't found one point where he could be
viewed as a friend of senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for the
non-ideological AARP, said the votes by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
new running mate on a variety of senior issues ``could be one of
his biggest liabilities as a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Cheney was one of a handful of congressmen who voted
against the Older Americans Act and restoring minimum benefits to
Social Security recipients, Rother said, ``some of those votes
weren't even close, so he went out of his way to vote negative on a
number of issues that will come back and bite him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney served as a Republican House member from Wyoming from
1979 to 1989. During that decade, he compiled a cumulative score of
8 out of 100 on votes deemed crucial by the National Council of
Senior Citizens, which takes a liberal stand on senior issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign, said
Cheney acknowledged that many programs he voted against while in
Congress were worthwhile, but his primary goal was to reduce the
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government was running an enormous deficit and he
was committed to reducing that and getting our fiscal house in
order before we committed ourselves to new programs,'' Bartlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the credit for the balanced budget and the surplus we
enjoy today were the work of congressmen like Dick Cheney to rein
in spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign was quick to circulate a memo
to senior organizations highlighting some of Cheney's votes on
elderly issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among those were votes to raise the full retirement age for
Social Security to 67, cut Medicare spending by $13 billion over
three years, and oppose spending for the Older Americans Act, which
includes such elderly assistance programs as Meals On Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Most senior groups said they were less concerned with Cheney's
vote to raise the retirement age, which was included as part of a
comprehensive package to save Social Security in 1983, than his
votes on benefits affecting the elderly poor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cheney was one of 20 House members who voted in
1981 against an amendment restoring minimum Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives you an idea where he is coming from, that he would
vote against restoring money to these people who had absolutely
nothing,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Cheney was one of a dozen House members who voted
against money for the Older Americans Act. In 1987 he was one of
seven House members who voted to cut $108 million from the act.
</P>
<P>
   That year he also voted against a $2 million demonstration
project aimed at providing home care to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Cheney was one of 39 House members who voted
in 1985 to limit annual cost-of-living adjustments to 2 percent for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was one of 72 House members who voted in 1988 against a
bill, supported by the Reagan administration, giving catastrophic
coverage to Medicare recipients. The program was repealed a year
later after a backlash by seniors angered by its high cost.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Smith, director of legislative affairs for the United
Seniors Association, a group which takes a conservative stand on
elderly issues, said he had not analyzed Cheney's votes but noted
they occurred in a time of tight budget constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress was faced with a bunch of bad choices,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security was about to go bankrupt. We need to learn
from that lesson and reform Social Security now'' along the lines
offered by Bush to establish private investment accounts, Smith
said.

 &HT;    SENIOR GROUPS CALL CHENEY'S VOTING RECORD A 'DISASTER'
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his decade in Congress, Dick Cheney compiled
a record of voting against elderly interests on Social Security,
Medicare and assistance programs, senior advocacy groups said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voting record on senior issues was a disaster,'' said
Bette(cq) Cooper, communications director for the National Council
of Senior Citizens. ``I haven't found one point where he could be
viewed as a friend of senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for the
non-ideological AARP, said the votes by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
new running mate on a variety of senior issues ``could be one of
his biggest liabilities as a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Cheney was one of a handful of congressmen who voted
against the Older Americans Act and restoring minimum benefits to
Social Security recipients, Rother said, ``some of those votes
weren't even close, so he went out of his way to vote negative on a
number of issues that will come back and bite him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney served as a Republican House member from Wyoming from
1979 to 1989. During that decade, he compiled a cumulative score of
8 out of 100 on votes deemed crucial by the National Council of
Senior Citizens, which takes a liberal stand on senior issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign, said
Cheney acknowledged that many programs he voted against while in
Congress were worthwhile, but his primary goal was to reduce the
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government was running an enormous deficit and he
was committed to reducing that and getting our fiscal house in
order before we committed ourselves to new programs,'' Bartlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the credit for the balanced budget and the surplus we
enjoy today were the work of congressmen like Dick Cheney to rein
in spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign was quick to circulate a memo
to senior organizations highlighting some of Cheney's votes on
elderly issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among those were votes to raise the full retirement age for
Social Security to 67, cut Medicare spending by $13 billion over
three years, and oppose spending for the Older Americans Act, which
includes such elderly assistance programs as Meals On Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Most senior groups said they were less concerned with Cheney's
vote to raise the retirement age, which was included as part of a
comprehensive package to save Social Security in 1983, than his
votes on benefits affecting the elderly poor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cheney was one of 20 House members who voted in
1981 against an amendment restoring minimum Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives you an idea where he is coming from, that he would
vote against restoring money to these people who had absolutely
nothing,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Cheney was one of a dozen House members who voted
against money for the Older Americans Act. In 1987 he was one of
seven House members who voted to cut $108 million from the act.
</P>
<P>
   That year he also voted against a $2 million demonstration
project aimed at providing home care to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Cheney was one of 39 House members who voted
in 1985 to limit annual cost-of-living adjustments to 2 percent for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was one of 72 House members who voted in 1988 against a
bill, supported by the Reagan administration, giving catastrophic
coverage to Medicare recipients. The program was repealed a year
later after a backlash by seniors angered by its high cost.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Smith, director of legislative affairs for the United
Seniors Association, a group which takes a conservative stand on
elderly issues, said he had not analyzed Cheney's votes but noted
they occurred in a time of tight budget constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress was faced with a bunch of bad choices,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security was about to go bankrupt. We need to learn
from that lesson and reform Social Security now'' along the lines
offered by Bush to establish private investment accounts, Smith
said.

 &HT;    Sisters' shared memories make friendship strong
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Once there was a princess, and once she
had a party because it is the privilege of a princess to live in
that moment when she shines and glimmers and is the very heart of
her world.
</P>
<P>
   She was almost 60. She had wrinkles fanning from her sky blue
eyes and threads of gray woven through her blond hair, but on this
night she was eternal youth. The ruffled collar of her white satin
dress framed a face that glowed and blossomed into smiles. A halo
of blue flowers and ribbons floated on her downy curls, matched by
the corsage on her wrist, and on her feet were the glowing white
Cinderella shoes she kept glancing at, their iridescent glitter
winking at her as she crossed her ankles and swung her legs.
</P>
<P>
   It was her night, her singular moment, and she wanted everyone
who came to her party to know one thing: The woman in the pink
sweater, the one with blond hair and blue eyes just like hers, was
her sister.
</P>
<P>
   THE PARTY WAS KRIS' IDEA
</P>
<P>
   Kris is a positive person who thinks of what she can do for
others, especially her sister. Always her sister. Not because she
has to, but because she wants to. She's my sister, Kris would say,
and lists what Karen did for her through their lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's the complex and pliant and beautiful nature of
sisterhood, and theirs is a story of sisters.
</P>
<P>
   When Karen Anderson was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease Dec.
29, her sister, Kris Potter, sat in the examining room with her and
listened to Dr. Joel Dean explain that when people with Down
syndrome get Alzheimer's, they decline quickly. There was a
possibility, he told Kris, that within 90 days Karen wouldn't know
her and that within six to 15 months she might need
around-the-clock care.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand thoughts darted through Kris' mind as he spoke,
worries and questions and a lifetime of shared memories with her
sister. She was going to lose Karen and she wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I thought, `Oh, no!' because her birthday is four
months away,'' Kris said. ``She's always loved her birthday and she
starts telling you every year right after her birthday, `My
birthday's coming up April 27th.' So in January we got to thinking
that it would be fun to do a party early. We wanted to make sure
she had a birthday party before she ... and we got to thinking
she'd think it was neat. She wasn't too hung up on it being a
certain time, so we looked at the calendar and thought, `Well, we
need to have it near Valentine's Day because she's just so full of
love and everybody loves her.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Kris reserved the gymnasium of the LDS Church building for
the night of Feb. 12 and organized her family to assemble a party
for Karen's 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the party, a work crew of Potters and
Andersons pulled together all the evening's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Karen was having her hair and nails done by a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got her a princess dress and Cinderella shoes, so it's
going to be so neat for her,'' Kris explained. ``This is just
something special we wanted to do for her because she's always been
there in the background and I wanted her to have a time where she's
the shining star.''
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
   Karen Marie Anderson loved fancy purses and beaded costume
jewelry. Kristina, her younger sister, was more interested in
sports and school activities, and their parents encouraged them in
their interests.
</P>
<P>
   The people they both became are reflections of parents. J. Albin
Anderson, their father, was born on a farm in northern Illinois,
one of 11 children whose mother died when he was 15 and the
youngest was 3. He was an exceptional student who earned a juris
doctor in 1938 from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He met Janet Elder, who grew up on a farm near Pattersonville,
N.Y., in Boston and they married in 1932. Karen, their first child,
was born April 27, 1940, in Springfield, Mass., where Albin was an
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   She was born early, weighing barely 4 pounds and with physical
traits indicating she had Down syndrome. Much was unknown about
Down syndrome then, so doctors in Springfield referred the family
to specialists in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists told the new parents that perhaps their infant
daughter's condition had been caused by an eye infection that bored
through one side of her brain, so they gave her electroshock
treatments in an attempt to stimulate that side of her brain.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until years later that researchers discovered Down
syndrome is a condition caused by extra genetic material from the
21st chromosome that affects about one in every 1,000 children born
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was common then for families of children with Down syndrome
to quietly send them to institutions where they spent their lives.
Karen stayed with her parents. Albin and Janet were prominent in
Springfield _ he was a successful attorney who was elected mayor,
and she was active in the community. They often had their picture
in the newspaper, and those photos would include their children as
their family grew.
</P>
<P>
   They smiled proudly and put Karen up front when pictures were
made.
</P>
<P>
   Kris was born almost three years after Karen and John three
years after Kris.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she was old enough for a regular bed, Kris shared a
room with Karen until Kris was in high school. Their father built
them doll houses that looked like the white house with green trim
they lived in, and their mother made them new Easter dresses every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kris started school, the girls played with their dolls,
their pets and their hula hoops and swung on the trapeze their
father built in the back yard. Karen could twirl and twirl, better
than Kris, better than John. Every Saturday they rode the bus
downtown with their mother to go shopping. In the summer they
visited their grandparents in New York, rolling like sausages down
the big grassy hill in front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Poet Edna St. Vincent Millay said, ``Childhood is the kingdom
where nobody dies,'' and that's where Karen stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Kris and John got older, started school and joined basketball
teams and discovered the opposite sex. Karen learned to read and
write _ she could write her name in cursive _ and do things around
the house, which Janet patiently taught her. But her mind remained
6 as her body aged.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Grand Junction in 1954 because they had
driven through the area on a family vacation to California and fell
in love with it. They moved into a Palisade house in the middle of
a peach orchard, in back of which Albin built another trapeze for
Karen, and he started a legal practice that he worked at for 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   Kris and John started school, but there was nowhere for Karen to
go, so Albin began looking into what the state was required by law
to provide for its school-age children. He discovered that all
children, regardless of mental capabilities, were entitled to
education and, after talking to the school district, prepared to
file suit with the state calling for equality of education.
</P>
<P>
   In response, before the suit was filed, the school district
started the Whitman School for special-needs children and Karen
went there for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really proud that she had her school, because (John
and I) went to school every day for several years before she got
to,'' Kris said. ``She was proud of what she got to do, and I guess
a part of her was trying to be like John and I and do things that
we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``A part of her probably realized that it was hard for her to do
things and I didn't think a lot about it until she was excited
about getting to do something that kind of mirrored what we were
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris and John developed their own interests _ Kris in school
functions and academics and John in animals and the outdoors. In
sixth grade Kris met a boy named Bill Potter, who had the longest
eyelashes she'd ever seen, and went with him to the eighth grade
dance, but ended up dating his best friend through high school.
</P>
<P>
   At Palisade High School she got good grades, played in girls'
athletic clubs, was drill captain, president of the Future
Homemakers of America, newspaper editor, a member of a capella
choir and participated in student senate.
</P>
<P>
   She and Bill graduated in 1961 with the same grade point average
and in the top of their class.
</P>
<P>
   Kris and Bill got married Sept. 5, 1964; Karen was in charge of
the guest book at their reception. The newlyweds attended Colorado
State University, Bill studying psychology and Kris focusing on
home economics education and childhood development until she took a
12-month licensed practical nurse training program. She graduated
from the program and worked for a year in the labor and delivery
department of the Fort Collins hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter Kerry was born in 1968, the year Bill started
graduate school in special education, and Eric came 10 months
later. Derek didn't come along for nine years, followed by Wendy
and Rebecca. The family settled in Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   Karen was living with her parents and saw Kris and her children
frequently. The kids considered Karen another playmate, and Kris
occasionally caught them bossing her around more than they probably
should have.
</P>
<P>
   Karen also had different jobs through the years. She worked in
the kitchen at the Colorado State Home and did contract work for
Goodwill Industries and Mesa Developmental Services. On one job for
Goodwill, Karen assembled packets of small building parts for a
local company.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Kris and the kids went by to visit Karen at work and
Karen proudly showed them what she'd done and, even more proudly,
introduced Kris to everyone who worked with her, even those who
already knew Kris.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at work knew about Karen's sister, because she talked
about Kris so much.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW LIFE FOR KAREN
</P>
<P>
   Karen came to live with Kris and her family on New Year's Day,
1990. Their father had died the previous year and it broke Karen's
heart. Their mother had died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Potter's home was filled to bulging, with Bill and
Kris, four of their five kids and now Karen. The kids _ Eric was
attending Mesa State College, Derek was 11, Wendy was 9 and Rebecca
was 6 _ never complained. Karen shared a room with Rebecca, and
Wendy slept on the couch for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate my children,'' Kris said. ``I don't remember them
ever complaining and I'm sure it was harder for them. Of course, I
think they just accepted it _ try to help the family. And I've told
Bill a lot that he let Karen live here when he could have made it
not be nice or feel like I better find her a place, but he never,
ever did. He said, `She's our family and she needs to live here.
Why wouldn't we do it?' It was neat that he didn't think that was
anything different or unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Potters were able to add some rooms on their house so
when Eric got married and moved out, the kids and Karen got their
own rooms. Eric and Derek fixed up Karen's for her.
</P>
<P>
   When she first came to live with Kris and her family, Karen went
to work every day at the Holiday Inn, where she vacuumed rooms.
Several years ago she retired because of a few health problems and
because she was becoming a little forgetful, so Kris registered her
in the Blossom View Day Care program.
</P>
<P>
   A bus picked her up in the mornings so she could spend the day
with her friends, playing bingo, going to the mall, making crafts
and watching movies. She came back on bus the in the afternoons,
and Kris was waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, Kris took Karen trick-or-treating every
Halloween, dressed as a gypsy because it was her one chance to wear
lots of her beloved necklaces and bracelets at once. At Christmas
Kris would take her to see Santa Claus and when she saw him she'd
light up, she'd get excited, she'd just sparkle all over: ``(gasp)
Santa!'' She'd sit on his lap and give him a big hug. She never
thought to ask for anything big, just maybe a book or more jewelry
or a new purse.
</P>
<P>
   As she got older, she began forgetting things _ how to set the
table, an occasional name and, as the Alzheimer's progressed, how
to read, dress herself and write. Where once she filled notebooks
with the carefully printed names of family members, she devolved
into filling pages with circles.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kris made an appointment and Dr. Dean confirmed what
she'd suspected, that Karen had Alzheimer's. Kris and her family
began doing things for Karen so that her last memories would be
good: They left the Christmas lights up in her room so she would
remember Christmas. They watched her favorite movies with her _
``The Happiest Millionaire'' and ``101 Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though her memory was fading, she always shouted ``Penny!''
during ``101 Dalmatians'' because Penny was the Dalmatian the
Andersons had when she was young.
</P>
<P>
   When Kris decided to have the party for Karen, friends
volunteered to make Karen's white satin top and skirt. Rebecca
organized the decorating. John's wife, Rhonda, made Karen's halo
and corsage.
</P>
<P>
   Kris made a special cake.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to be a happy memory for Karen and for everyone who
loves her.
</P>
<P>
   A SPECIAL KIND OF LOVE
</P>
<P>
   Mid-afternoon on Feb. 23, as Kris sat facing the front living
room window, talking about Karen and watching for her bus to arrive
from Blossom View, Kris said she was glad their parents raised her
to love Karen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I see my girls having fun, sometimes a part of
me wishes I could do that, too, have that kind of relationship with
my sister. But she's always loved me and I've always loved her and
I've tried to treat her so that when she becomes a perfected person
she'll,'' Kris said, and paused to take a deep breath before trying
again, ``she'll still love me for being her sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the yellow bus pulled up, Kris hurried outside as the
doors swung open and Karen approached the top of the three steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Karen!'' Kris exclaimed, smiling, asking Karen if she'd
had a fun day and extending her hand for Karen to hold for
stability as she slowly came down the steps of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   'I KNOW SHE'S RUNNING AND DANCING'
</P>
<P>
   The milky afternoon sun shone through the Potter's living room
window on March 23, encouraging Wendy to feel optimistic about the
flowers she was planning to plant in front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The blue living room couch was pushed to the center of the room,
facing the window, to make room for the hospital bed that arrived
in three pieces, which Bill helped assemble. Karen lay on it now,
under a blue-flowered sheet and a pillow covered in a Sesame Street
case, a mylar bumble bee balloon tied by a ribbon to the end of the
bed.
</P>
<P>
   On the previous Sunday, after watching ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids'' with Bill, Kris and Rebecca, she tried to get up to go to
bed and collapsed, unable to move. Bill picked her up and took her
to bed. The following morning she couldn't move but was still aware
and talked with Kris about the snow that fell during the night.
Kris called Hospice and they sent over a hospital bed and a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning she was catatonic and doctors told Kris Karen's
body was shutting down _ she couldn't eat or drink. Three hospice
workers came out daily to help Kris care for her sister. When they
first began coming in January it was hard for Kris ``because I had
always helped her and the last few years had been increasingly a
lot more help because she was starting to get forgetful and we
pretty much had to help her get dressed and undressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was becoming a lot more care but I never had thought about
somebody else doing it for me, and it was hard to give up part of
that care of her, for me, because at first I felt I was letting her
down. But it was a wonderful experience because she was able to
touch other people's lives. They felt by them doing things they
could do in their profession, it would give me time that I wouldn't
be getting to just spend with Karen and just do things that I could
do to give her love and comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning Karen stopped breathing for a short time ``and
I thought, `Breathe, Karen! Don't do this to me!' '' Kris said,
adding that Karen started breathing again. Wednesday was the first
day Kris felt like eating since Karen collapsed. It also was the
day she and John began talking about the inevitability of what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning Kris went into the living room and told Karen,
``Good morning! It's Kerry's birthday and if you need to go today,
it's a beautiful day.'' But she waited. The hospice workers had
come by, then Kris' friend, Jackie Osborne, washed and curled
Karen's hair. Wendy ran her hands through the fresh blond curls as
she leaned by Karen at the end of the bed and remembered with her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that three-wheel bike she had?'' Wendy asked, and
Kris giggled. Karen rode that bike up F 3/4 Road then coasted back
down, through the stop sign, so when Kris and Bill heard honking
they knew it probably was Karen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great Karen was out there getting exercise
but the kids came in and said Karen was coasting again,'' Kris
laughed. ``Finally the bike broke and Bill said, `We're not fixing
it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Wendy added, Karen got a baby stroller, which she
took out to the street and pushed as hard as she could in front of
her, trotting after it and pushing it again when she caught up. She
always seemed to push it in a straight line, Kris said, and it
never went in the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``And remember that time grandma called and said Karen flipped
her off?'' Wendy asked. Karen went through a phase in which she
waved at people with a different finger every day, and the day
Bill's mother, Arlene Potter, drove by, Karen was waving with her
middle finger. Wendy and Rebecca told her to wave with her whole
hand or don't wave at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kris listened as Wendy and John's daughter, Lorilynn,
reminisced, pulling out some supplies to brush Karen's teeth. She
dipped the cylindrical pink sponge on what looked like a lollipop
stick into a bowl of warm water and gently rubbed it across Karen's
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Karen responded by reflexively biting the sponge and Kris
laughed, ``Kar-en! I see you smiling, tricker.'' Then Kris used a
black straight comb to restore Karen's curls, rubbed Carmex on her
lips, put a pillow under her knees and straightened the maroon
soccer ball-print blanket over her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then she stood just looking at Karen, listening to her labored
breathing and caressing her cheek with feather touches, quietly
murmuring, ``I love you. Thanks for being such a good sister to
me.'' Karen's eyes occasionally fluttered and Kris softly cooed,
``Beautiful blue eyes. Are you going to open your beautiful blue
eyes?''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Kris just held her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night John's son, David, and his wife brought by
dinner, then John came over at around 10 to sit with Karen through
the night so Kris could sleep. At about 12:45 a.m. he gently woke
her and said, ``I think she's passed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so neat he came because I don't think I could have
stood here and ...'' Kris said Friday morning, not finishing her
thought as she looked at the stripped hospital bed pushed against
the wall under the living room window.
</P>
<P>
   Walking across the sun-dappled front yard with a visitor, a
Kleenex clutched in her hand, Kris said, ``I think about what she's
doing today, free of all the burdens she took on to come to earth.
I know she's running and dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   A BLESSED LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Karen was buried March 27. The morning of the funeral service
breathed spring and inside Clifton Christian Church her family and
friends honored a life represented by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Her silver casket at the front of the chapel was adorned with an
arrangement of blue flowers, her favorite color. On a table covered
by a Holly Hobbie tablecloth in the foyer, Kris had arranged a few
mementos: the blue silk flower halo draped over the glittery white
Cinderella shoes Karen wore at her party, the princess from the top
of her party cake, framed pictures of her and red bead necklaces
and bracelets from her collection.
</P>
<P>
   During the service the Rev. Roger Ferguson cited the Beatitudes
_ blessed is Karen, pure in heart. After his remarks Kris and John
walked hand-in-hand to the pulpit and Kris stepped to the
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month from today Karen would have been 60,'' she began, and
shared some highlights from Karen's life. She talked about a person
championed by their parents, one who treasured fancy purses, loved
fireworks and sledding but hated thunder, who frequently said her
eyes were blue like the sky and loved new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Karen's legacy is her happy attitude and her love of
life,'' Kris said. ``She was always happy with what she was doing
and who she was with, and she had a really positive attitude. She'd
ask me what's for dinner every day and I'd tell her and she'd say,
`That's my favorite!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Karen had a beautiful spirit, she never judged people. It was
for us to learn patience, love and understanding from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kris paused and John took her hand. ``We could not have had
a more perfect person in our lives. She loved us every day of our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   John added he wished he had Karen's genuineness and her purity
of feelings. ``When you have a special sister die, it takes you a
while to realize what you learned from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen was buried that afternoon in Palisade Cemetery with her
family and friends standing nearby and the vast, clear sky overhead
as blue as her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Author Katherine Mansfield wrote, ``Remember you are always in
the heart _ oh tucked so close there is no chance of escape _ of
your sister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember the time you tried to make me play baseball?''
Rebecca asked Wendy one afternoon in May. ``I'd never played it and
I didn't know how to hit a ball and you were like, `Try and hit it
this time' and I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you just got frustrated so easy,'' Wendy explained. ``So
you'd go home crying, `They're trying to make me do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd always make me do all this stuff, pick out clothes for
me. I'd always ask you what to wear, `Does this look OK?' And at
school one time you made me roll up my pants because that's how the
style was. I was in, like, kindergarten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the '80s!''
</P>
<P>
   Now memories like this are funny, not the tear-inducing
melodramas they were 10 years ago. Wendy and Rebecca relate to each
other more as adults, from lives that don't overlap like when they
were younger but with an intangible bond that's stronger. They
discuss it with Kerry over e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was away at college and Wendy and Rebecca were at home,
I was always afraid they'd get hurt,'' Kerry said. ``I was like
this little mother to them. But I think I'm learning more it's
their life and whatever they do is what they do. But I still hope
for the best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``HAPPY BIRTHDAY''
</P>
<P>
   In the days and weeks after Karen died, Kris went through her
things _ her drawer full of beaded necklaces and bracelets, her
collection of purses, her doll house _ boxing some of them for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Karen was buried in her princess dress but Kris kept the size 3
Cinderella shoes, even though her kids told her all they would do
is make her cry. She's done that anyway, and will for a while. On
Karen's birthday, Kris sang ``Happy Birthday'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   The princess' sister led her by the hand to the table where her
cake stood, white and perfect like a wedding cake with a figurine
on top who looked like the princess _ blue flowers in her hair and
an elegant white gown. Her sister made the cake for her, and her
nieces decorated the hall with brown, black and white teddy bears,
blue and silver balloons on ribbons and shiny, multi-colored
confetti 60s sprinkled on the tables.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody at the party wanted to kiss the princess' cheek and
tell her they love her, take her picture and say she looked so
beautiful. She smiled for everyone, but her sister knew what she
really wanted was a piece of cake, so her sister sliced one for
her, took the princess' hand and led her to a table where some of
her friends were sitting.
</P>
<P>
   The princess smiled and told people she saw, people who had
known her and her sister for 20 years or more, ``This is my
sister.''

 &HT;    BARAK RETURNS TO FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL, ARAFAT TO CHEERS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ While Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat returned from
the Camp David peace talks to cheers Wednesday, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak came home to even tougher political challenges
than he faced before.
</P>
<P>
   Barak landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport in
the early evening (Local Time), returning from 15 days of often
tense negotiations with Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some reported progress on the most important issues
separating Israelis and Palestinians, the two sides could not reach
any agreement beyond a joint statement saying they would keep
talking.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak's political opponents, who had opposed his going to
the summit in the first place, the failure was touted as
confirmation that he should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his plane landed, according to Israeli press
reports, Barak worked the phones to rally potential allies against
parliamentary votes next week that could prompt new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Before more than 300 supporters outside his official residence
Wednesday night, he promised he would keep going despite the
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there are moments that you don't have the
strength and just want to throw everything aside,'' he said. ``But
we're not going to give up because the future of the state of
Israel depends on peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, and apparently appreciative of the show of
support, Barak stepped through his high-security guard contingent
to greet people in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arafat returned to the Gaza Strip with widespread
support from Palestinians who were glad he did not buckle under
Israeli and American pressure to make a deal. They seemed willing
to wait _ years, if necessary _ for an agreement that will give
them sovereignty over key parts of Jerusalem, claimed by Israel as
its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Celebratory rallies were held in several cities in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Arafat pledged that he would continue negotiating
with the Israelis in an effort to capitalize on progress made at
Camp David, the presidential retreat in western Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of the two leaders' receptions showed Arafat,
who U.S. officials indicated was not as flexierve to win back all
the land captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Barak's
apparent readiness to concede most, but not all, the land left
Palestinians feeling they would still be giving up what's owed to
them.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the Israeli side, split bitterly down the middle on
peace issues, Barak's flexibility sharpened the attacks of his
right-wing opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Their message: Barak's offers showed only that the Palestinians
do not want peace and they compromised Israel's bargaining position
as long as he is prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ehud Barak finally found out that what the right wing said for
years, 'that we don't have a partner for peace on the opposite
side,' was right,'' said Limor Livnat, a member of the Israeli
parliament in the Likud, the largest opposition party to Barak's
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave up too much,'' she said, adding that any time he
begins talks again, the Palestinians will hold up Barak's offers in
Camp David as the new starting point for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak opponents plan votes on two bills next week that could
force early elections. Barak's governing coalition includes only 42
of the 120 seats in parliament and he was working Wednesday to win
back parties that had resigned when he went to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Barak narrowly staved off a similar challenge in the parliament
just before the summit began, but his support may have slipped
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli pollster Hanoch Smith said a survey last week of 500
voters showed Barak losing in a match-up against his predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, 38 percent to 30 percent with many undecided.
The poll had a margin of error of +/- 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Barak's residence Wednesday evening, the throng of
supporters vowed they would bounce back from the summit setback.
Police separated them from a small group of counter-protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People believe the game is not finished yet,'' said Barak
supporter Yaron Ram, 49, even as a raw egg, hurled by an unseen
opponent, struck his side. ``This is just halftime.''

DUPONT POSTS 7 PERCENT INCREASE IN EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH RUBENSTEIN   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ DuPont (DD:NYSE) reported a 7 percent increase in its
second-quarter earnings Wednesday, exceeding Wall Street's
estimates. The chemical company also reiterated that it would meet
profit expectations for the year, although high energy and raw
material costs would weigh on its results.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter ended June 30, DuPont's earnings
excluding several one-time items, totaled $949 million, or 90 cents
a diluted share, up from $886 million, or 84 cents a diluted share
a year earlier. A consensus of analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial predicted earnings of 88 cents a share in
the latest quarter for the Wilmington, Del.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont said high prices of crude oil and natural gas, two key
raw materials for the company, would push profits for the second
half of the year down by 20 to 25 cents a share compared with a
year ago. But DuPont restated its prediction that it would meet its
17 percent to 20 percent target for earnings growth this year. Wall
Street expects the company to earn $2.99 for the year, according to
First Call//Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of DuPont were trading up 1 1/16, or 2.4 percent, to 44
11/16 midday Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul T. Leming, an analyst for ING Barings, said DuPont's raw
materials costs were not a major concern for investors, since the
company reiterated that it would meet its target for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You worry about how much the U.S. economy is going to slow
down, oil prices _ yes, those concerns are out there,'' Leming
said. ``But right now I'm saying they're going to be able to manage
them. I don't think those issues will prevent them from meeting
their earnings target for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   While raw materials costs are ``an overwhelming issue,'' Leming
said DuPont is counteracting the problem in a number of ways,
including positive volume growth, cost-savings and increased prices
in certain strong aspects of its business. He added DuPont's
announcement Wednesday that it would increase its
share-repurchasing program to $2.5 billion was also good news for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Leming rates DuPont a hold, because he considers it ``fairly
valued'' at $45 a share. ING Barings has done no underwriting for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, which increased 13 percent from a year ago to $7.9
billion, helped DuPont overcome high raw material prices in the
second quarter. The company also said it is benefiting from its
implementation of Six Sigma, a business strategy program used by
companies to improve their bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our businesses performed exceptionally well in spite
of higher raw material costs and weak European currencies, with 11
of 18 strategic business units delivering double-digit earnings
growth,'' Charles O. Holliday Jr., chairman and chief executive,
said in a statement. ``While slowing is now evident in some sectors
of the U.S. economy, most of our global markets remain robust.''

 &HT;    ENGINE FOCUS OF PROBE, AS INVESTIGATORS SIFT THROUGH THE
WRECKAGE OF CONCORDE CRASH
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ The pilot of an Air France Concorde that
crashed Tuesday reported engine trouble minutes after take-off and
was apparently making a frantic attempt to fly the crippled
aircraft to a nearby airport, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Senot, a French jurist conducting a judicial enquiry
into the crash, said tower controllers at Charles de Gaulle
International Airport radioed the Concorde's crew that they could
see flames at the back of the aircraft 56 seconds after it took
off. Air France identified the pilot as Capt. Christian Marty,
apparently known for skill and prudence as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain replied, 'fault in engine number two,''' Senot
said at a news conference. ``After that it seems the flames became
extremely large because (the fire) was once again signaled by the
control tower, and the crew replied that they were no longer in a
position to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew told the tower that they were heading for Le Bourget
Airport, four miles southwest of Charles de Gaulle. This would have
required a half turn rather than a full turn by the damaged
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during this turning maneuver that it crashed on the
hotel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic transport lost power and altitude as the flames
poured from engines under its left wing and crashed into a small
hotel. All 109 passengers and crewmembers aboard the Concorde were
killed, as well as four people at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The plane struck the hotel and earth near fields of wheat and
corn near the suburb of Gonesse, about nine miles from central
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Air France reported that Marty asked mechanics
to make a repair to the engine that began spewing flames minutes
before take-off. Mechanics repaired a thrust-reverser in one of the
two portside engines before the Concorde took off.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the airline said engine No. 2 _ the interior
engine on the left wing _ was inspected and repaired at the pilot's
insistence even though the repair was not required for take-off.
The problem with the thrust-reverser, which is used to slow an
aircraft on landing, was detected after the plane arrived from New
York on Monday, Air France said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pilot was told that the repair wasn't required,
he asked mechanics to make it anyway, the airline said. ``The piece
was immediately taken from a reserve Concorde,'' Air France said.
``The repair was carried out in 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Brousse, the airline's spokesman, refused to speculate
on any relationship between the repair and the accident. ``At the
current state of the inquiry there is no way of knowing
</P>
<P>
   if this has any relation with the accident,'' Brousse said.
</P>
<P>
   While many experts have speculated that a single engine
explosion was probably not enough to trigger Tuesday's accident,
others said that it would be catastrophic if the explosion were not
contained. John Guntrip, a former British aviation accident
investigator, told Sky-TV News that such an event could damage
other of the aircraft's systems perhaps rendering it impossible to
fly. ``A total failure of a jet engine is a rare event, but this
looks like a major uncontained explosion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were examining the cockpit voice recorder and
flight data recorder _ the two so-called ``black boxes'' _
recovered from the aircraft early Wednesday morning. The voice
recorder can shed light on what happened because it records
conversations between the two pilots. The flight data recorder will
tell investigators about the physical condition of the aircraft, as
well as its speed and bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though British Airways resumed flying its fleet of seven
Concordes Wednesday morning, Air France said its five remaining
supersonic planes would remain grounded for now.

   Jean-Claude Gayssot told a news conference that he hoped an
analysis of data from the doomed Concorde's black boxes might be
available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resumption of (Air France) Concorde flights could happen
in the next few days,'' Gayssot said.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather improved during the day, investigators combed the
charred crash site for clues. Typically, they will try to gather
together all the scattered engine parts to try to determine the
sequence of failure. The special metals used in jet engines are not
generally damaged significantly even in the extreme heat of such a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 43 victims were taken to a Paris lab for
examination, police said. The rest were too severely damaged to be
easily moved, and remained at the crash site as emergency workers
picked through the blackened wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six German passengers were killed in Tuesday's crash. The
overwhelming majority of the dead, they were headed to New York for
a luxury cruise to the Caribbean and, for some, on to the Sydney
Olympics. Two Danes, an Austrian and an American _ retired Air
France employee Christopher Behrens _ were also passengers. Nine
crew members died, along with four people in the hotel, including
two Polish hotel trainees.
</P>
<P>
   A special crisis center staffed by psychiatrists, counselors and
medical staff has been opened for relatives at the airport. About
100 family members were expected to come to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said in Germany that his nation was
in shock. Pope John Paul II sent condolences.
</P>
<P>
   One of the crash's survivors on the ground told reporters that
she was spared only because she had been assigned a room at the
front of Hotelissimo, which was engulfed in the blaze fed by the
aircraft's 100 tons of fuel. Alice Brooking, 21, a Cambridge
student, jumped out of a window on the hotel's second floor to
safety seconds after the accident. She had been on the phone with
her sister in England.
</P>
<P>
   She said that flames and smoke moved quickly through the hotel.
``It was like being in an oven,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Gonesse, a town of 20,000 brought unhappily to the
world stage by the crash, expressed a mix of sadness and gratitude
about what had happened. Coming out of a Toys ``R'' Us at a nearby
mall, Marie Hetru said she could not get over the crash, and the
prospect that it could have crashed into the center of Gonesse a
half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would the number of dead be then _ maybe including me and
my children,'' she said. ``Of course it is terrible _ 113 people _
but if it wasn't for the pilot, it may have been much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy said the crash reflected the
miseries of the town's living near one of the world's busiest
airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been saying for a long time that air traffic is
increasing too fast, that even with four runways, you can't safely
manage this amount of air traffic around Paris,'' Blazy said at a
press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived with planes for several decades and we don't
live in daily fear of a crash, but it's on our minds.''

GEN X FINDS SOMEBODY (OR SOMETHING) TO LOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen Xers are looking for something _ or someone _ to nurture and
love. For some, it will be a baby, for others, it will be a pet or
even a pet-like toy.
</P>
<P>
   From Main Street to Hollywood, babies are ``in.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant Annette Bening was the darling of the Oscars. Jada
Pinkett consistently shows up scantily clad and well rounded. While
in years past, Reese Witherspoon might have lost her star appeal by
getting pregnant so young (and, oh my, out of wedlock), today's
trendsetters consider her inspirational _ someone who has it all
and is able to balance a family and a career.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's another Baby Boom, spurred by a good economy.
Babies are expensive, but Xers say they can afford them. Also, many
women are beginning to think that maybe their most important role
is not in the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   We've been seeing signs of this for a while now. Much of this
trend stems from a return to more traditional values such as mom in
the kitchen baking an apple pie for her brood.
</P>
<P>
   One fourth of the respondents in Youth Intelligence's most
recent study of 14- to 30-year-olds listed ``staying home to raise
children'' as a sign of success. And according to a recent study by
the Families and Work Institute in New York City, high schoolers
overwhelmingly said they wanted to land jobs that gave them time
for family activities. Behind this attitude was the fact that the
majority were children of working parents and they wanted to make
sure their own children came first.
</P>
<P>
   But lest feminists fear that this generation is destroying all
of their hard work, understand that this trend is not simply about
going back to the values and customs of the '50s. Rather, it's
about Xers recognizing that it's difficult to be a good parent and
that raising a teen in today's world may be harder than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ``stay-at-home'' parent of choice continues to
be the woman, many of the male trendsetters surveyed by Youth
Intelligence suggested that if the mother of their children had a
better job than they did, they would stay home themselves. They are
just as disenchanted with the workplace as women and are even
jealous of the bond a mother has with her baby.
</P>
<P>
   As for women, a recent NBC News poll showed that only 14 percent
of women claim to work for ``personal fulfillment'' (the rest work
for financial reasons), and a study Youth Intelligence conducted
for Cosmopolitan magazine revealed that 68 percent of women stated
that they would stay home if they could afford to.
</P>
<P>
   Having several children is also deemed a sign of success. As a
28-year-old in New York explained, ``People are over the big houses
or fancy cars. These days it's the number of children you have
Everyone knows how expensive it is to raise kids, so having more
than two means you're well off And I think a woman staying home is
a source of pride for a lot of men who feel proud that their wife
doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The pride factor aside, you don't have to be a parent to express
your need to nurture. It's no longer unusual to see a puppy carried
around in a baby papoose or brought to the office and tucked
happily in the corner. And is it just me, or is the Aibo Robodog
the most endearing character in this season's cast of MTV's ``The
Real World''? From plastic Tamagotchis to puppies galore, everyone
wants something to care for.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old in Los Angeles summed it up by saying, ``I think
it's just a really hard world. People have to be tough and on their
guard so much, but you need an outlet And finding a person to love
is a lot harder than finding a pet to love.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the need to nurture seems to extend to friends as well
as canines, with trendsetters citing extreme devotion to their
peers. As one 17-year-old told us, ``I think teenagers today really
take care of each other. Not everyone has good parents, or their
parents are working or whatever, so you really take care of your
friends and support them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, look for signs of caring all around you. Maybe we really are
becoming a ``kinder, gentler nation.''

OIL PRICES HOVER NEAR 11-WEEK LOW AS FUEL RESERVES RISE, DEMAND
DROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oil prices touched an 11-week low before rebounding
Wednesday, as new data revealed a significant increase in U.S. fuel
stockpiles and a drop in consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, or API, reported late Tuesday
that U.S. stocks of crude oil, gasoline and distillates like
heating oil increased substantially over the past week. According
to the industry group's report, crude oil inventories rose by 1.883
million barrels in the week ending July 21. Gasoline stocks were up
by 1.713 million barrels while distillates increased by 1.732
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the API reported that crude oil imports to the U.S.
reached a near-record 10 million barrels a day over the past week,
with capacity utilization growing about 1 percent to 96.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, skyrocketing gas prices _ as high as $2 a gallon in
some Midwestern states _ finally appear to be affecting consumer
demand. While petroleum demand in North America was unchanged for
the first half of the year, compared with the first six months of
1999, new statistics show it has started to slip.
</P>
<P>
   The four-week average demand for gasoline is now about 8.6
million barrels a day, down sharply from 8.97 million barrels a
year ago, according to the GNI Ltd. research group. In the past
week alone, demand dropped to 8.12 million barrels a day _ down
almost a million barrels a day from the week before.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of increased inventories and decreased demand
weighed heavily on crude oil, as well as heating oil and unleaded
gas prices, for a good portion of the trading day. Brent crude
closed at $26.94 in London Wednesday, barely above its intrasession
low of $26.81.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September
delivery fell as low as $27.95 to mid-May levels early Wednesday
before bouncing back slightly. By early afternoon in New York, the
September crude oil contract was trading up 53 cents at $28.48 a
barrel. Analysts said the rebound came on technical trading.
</P>
<P>
   Futures contracts on unleaded gas were trading up 2.4 cents at
84.4 cents a gallon, after falling to a session low of 81.8 cents
earlier in the day. Heating oil prices were trading up at 77.5
cents, from the opening price (and session low) of 76.1 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market can't generate more of a bounce even in the next
few days, that's going to be the signal that the bull market is
really dead,'' said Tim Evans, IFR-Pegasus senior energy analyst.
``It's potentially panic time.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have dropped nearly $3 a barrel since last week on
mounting evidence that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
producer, has gone ahead with a proposed production increase,
despite the reluctance of other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk here is if we make a fresh break to the downside,
then the market really looks terrible,'' Evans said. ``That's a
very real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC already lifted output twice this year by more than 2.4
million barrels per day _ most recently on July 1, when the group
increased its official daily production quota to 25.4 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   While OPEC's recent agreement raised the daily output ceiling by
708,000 barrels, the actual increase in production is expected to
be much lower. By some estimates, the increase is less than 300,000
extra barrels a day. Many OPEC members were already exceeding their
production quotas, producing at or near capacity before the new
agreement went into effect. In fact, the Oil and Gas Journal
reports that OPEC crude oil production already averaged 27.2
million barrels a day _ nearly 2 million barrels more than the
current quota.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's president, the Venezuelan oil minister Ali Rodriguez, has
said he received assurances from Saudi Arabia that OPEC's largest
member would not initiate a unilateral production increase. But
analysts say the recent drop in crude oil prices was likely
prompted by indications Saudi Arabia may have covertly increased
production by 250,000 barrels a day already and rumors that it
intends to double that figure in August.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Rodriguez said OPEC would increase oil output
in September if demand remains high enough to absorb the extra
barrels. But the likelihood of an official output increase is
diminishing as evidence mounts that prices and demand are easing.
</P>
<P>
   Under an informal agreement reached in June, OPEC oil ministers
agreed to consider increasing production by a half-million barrels
a day if the price of the cartel's basket stayed above $28 a barrel
for 20 consecutive days. But the organization's basket of seven
types of crude oil fell to $25.40 a barrel on Tuesday from $25.70
on Monday, according to Reuters reports, well below the $28
threshold that would trigger extra supply from OPEC.

   PLANO, Texas _ He eats right, exercises regularly and
occasionally drinks a glass of red wine. Still, Kevin has known for
some time that the odds of maintaining a healthy heart are stacked
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his grandparents had open-heart surgery; a year and a
half ago, he was found to have hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   When a friend told the 36-year-old father of three about
HealthScan of Plano, a new medical imaging service, Kevin felt
obliged to have himself checked out.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent scan of his heart and torso, Kevin learned from
doctors that his heart is in good shape, his bone density normal.
</P>
<P>
   But they had some news he hadn't counted on: They found a large
tumor on his right kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is it looks like we found it in time, before
symptoms presented themselves,'' said Dr. Margaret Hansen, medical
director of HealthScan.
</P>
<P>
   HealthScan of Plano is one of many nationwide entrepreneurial
efforts to take advantage of new electron-beam CT scanners and make
them available to healthy consumers who are interested in
screenings for heart and lung disease, cancer, osteoporosis and
other conditions. The service takes about 30 minutes, does not
require a physician's referral and costs $695 up front (the service
is not covered by most insurance providers unless it is through a
doctor's referral). Walk-ins are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   There are four electron-beam CT (computed tomography) scanners
in the Fort Worth-Dallas area. Two are at the Cooper Clinic in
Dallas, another was recently purchased at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, for research and clinical use,
and the other is at HealthScan.
</P>
<P>
   HealthScan President Gerald Friede says the screenings his
imaging center does are an important way for people to find out
about potential health problems that can be fixed with medicine or
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem with heart disease, for example, is there
is no early warning for about 50 to 60 percent of people,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But other health-care experts are not convinced that the
screenings are good predictors of whether patients will have a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very controversial area,'' said Dr. Thomas Andrews,
director of the Dallas Heart Disease Prevention Project at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. ``Not everybody
who has a heart attack will have a positive scan, and certainly not
everybody with a positive scan will have a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more data to know how to interpret the results,''
Andrews says. ``My personal bias is this will have an important
role in screening for coronary artery disease. The key thing is not
so much getting the scan but proper interpretation of the results.
That requires somebody who's got insight into what the scan is
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Friede started HealthScan a little over a year ago after seeing
firsthand the benefits of the electron-beam CT. HealthScan now has
two sites. The other is in San Diego. Here in Plano, about 125
people come in for the $695 procedure each month.
</P>
<P>
   Three other clinics are under construction: in Houston; Orange
County, Calif.; and Pasadena, Calif. Those are scheduled to open
during the fourth quarter of this year.

FIRST, HOME THEATER. NOW, LAPTOP THEATER. 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Laura once pitched an article called ``Guy Bait'' to a
major women's magazine, for which she wanted to take nifty gadgets
into bars and see how long it took patrons of the male persuasion
to sidle over for casual conversation and a little technology
cruising. If portable digital videodisk players had been on the
market then, I suspect that she would have had the men sidling in
from 10 blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   I recently spent time with three new portable DVD players and
found that crowds of both men and women would gather around when I
had one on parade. Alas, I didn't have the similarly high
expectations for the players themselves. I had expected them to
have the visual kick of those square seat-back video screens on
transatlantic flights that let you squint through your own personal
showing of ``Stuart Little'' on an overnight flight to London.
</P>
<P>
   After testing several units, though, I must say that I was
wrong. The portable DVD players that you can get today offer
bright, clear video display, Dolby Digital sound and batteries
powerful enough for a double feature.
</P>
<P>
   There are many models and price levels to choose from in the
realm of portable DVD players, with the price of the high-end units
around $1,500 and lower-end ones about $700. With regular
home-based DVD players selling for as little as $200 in some
places, the hefty price tag of the portables may place them out of
the reach of many consumers. Owners of laptops with built-in or
added-on DVD drives may find the traveling DVD players to be
something of a moot point; the portable models are aimed more at
the dedicated home-theater enthusiast. All the portables I tested
could also be fully integrated with home theater equipment (for
most people without electrical engineering degrees, it is basically
the TV-VCR combo _ and maybe the stereo _ all wired together) or
used as a stand-alone player if you were on the go.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most appealing portable players is Panasonic's new
DVD-LV75 from its PalmTheater line. It costs about $1,400, and if
you read entertainment magazines, you have probably seen the
advertisements for it: a futuristic silver device displaying an
action scene from ``The Matrix'' (a film that was seemingly made
for DVD). At just over three pounds without the flat lithium-ion
battery pack that attaches to the bottom of the unit, the DVD-LV75
feels like it weighs less than the new ``Harry Potter'' book, and
it's definitely thinner. With the screen folded, it is less than an
inch thick and measures about 5.5 inches by 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD-LV75 has a 7-inch screen, which is one of the bigger
video displays available on a portable unit. The flat LCD screen
was sharper than I expected and was bright enough for me to watch
movies comfortably in a variety of lighting conditions. After
charging the battery, which the company says has a four-hour life
span, I made it all the way through ``Chinatown'' without any lag
in the unit's performance. Like all the portables I looked at, the
player comes with an AC adapter to charge the battery as well as
run the player without the battery pack attached.
</P>
<P>
   Once I adjusted to the screen's small size, I forgot about the
fact that I was watching the movie on such a tiny machine and
became absorbed in the film itself. I did notice that the battery
pack began to get warmer and warmer as the movie progressed, and by
the time Faye Dunaway said: ``She's my sister! She's my daughter!''
the whole player itself felt rather toasty. The heat wasn't
searing, by any means, but it was noticeable and enough to keep the
player from being considered a laptop model.
</P>
<P>
   The external speaker on the DVD-LV75 was adequate for the casual
viewer, but attaching a pair of decent-quality headphones was an
immense improvement. In addition to standard audio and video jacks,
the player has a port for an optical digital audio cable and an
S-Video output jack for high-quality display when it is connected
to a full-size television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Electronics recently released a portable DVD player with
similar features. The Sony DVP-FX1 offers the 7-inch LCD screen in
the cinematic, wide-screen 16:9 (width-to-height ratio) format (as
opposed to the squarish 4:3 format used by most standard television
screens). The company says that its lithium-ion battery will last
up to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's model is roughly the same size as Panasonic's version. It
offers Dolby Digital sound and many of the same standard DVD
features like smooth motion scan, which lets users easily stop on a
specific frame of the film. The screen was also clear and bright
and nicely displayed the deep, saturated colors of the ``Wallace &AMP;
Gromit'' disk.
</P>
<P>
   The playback was smooth, even when I wiggled the unit to
simulate what a small child might do in the back seat of the family
minivan on a summer drive across America. Portable entertainment
for cars, boats and vans is one of the uses Sony suggests as a
reason for plunking down the considerable cash for one of these
machines. Sony's DVP-FX1 is priced at about $1,600, but depending
on how badly your children behave on long trips, it could be a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent the youngsters from running off and watching
movies that Mom or Dad may not approve of, Sony is incorporating
the Custom Parental Control System into some of its portable DVD
models. The system allows parents to control access to as many as
50 titles.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to choose between the Panasonic and Sony models, I
would give a small edge to the Panasonic, mainly because of the
slight price difference. Both are fine machines.
</P>
<P>
   There are less expensive options in the portable player market.
The screens on the cheaper models are generally smaller and the
overall design of the units is not as sleek and compact as those of
more expensive models. But for someone who doesn't mind having a
smaller screen and a bigger case in exchange for saving several
hundred dollars, a bulkier portable may make more sense.
</P>
<P>
   Aiwa's XD-DW1 player falls into that category. The company's
suggested price is $850, but the player can be found in stores for
$650 to $700. The screen measures 5.8 inches diagonally, and the
design is a bit clunkier than that of the more expensive
competitors. The active-matrix screen loses some clarity when
viewed from odd angles but looks fine head-on.
</P>
<P>
   The XD-DW1 has built-in stereo speakers and will play audio CDs
as well as DVD movies. It offers Dolby Digital sound and S-Video
output and comes with the cables you need to connect it to your
home entertainment equipment. For the price, the Aiwa XD-DW1 was
pretty solid, and not having the extra inch or so of viewable
screen area that the other two players provided didn't particularly
bother me when I was engrossed in ``The Seven Samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   People will have to decide whether the cost of a portable DVD
player is justified, and I can't honestly say I would buy one
myself if cost weren't a consideration, especially with home
players being so inexpensive. But I can see the appeal of a
portable for those who travel a lot, are serious cinemaholics or
who want to use a single DVD player in a variety of locales.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if I wait long enough, the prices might come down even
more. Remember how much an early Walkman cost?

MICROSOFT ASKS SUPREME COURT TO DECLINE TO HEAR ITS APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking an audience with the federal appeals court
that ruled in its favor once before, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq) asked
the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday to decline to hear its appeal of a
court-ordered breakup and instead to send the case to the lower
court.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that ``full and fair consideration'' of its appeal would
pose an unwieldy burden on the Supreme Court, Microsoft plainly
stated that it hopes to winnow the number of violations included in
the case in the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any issues remain after the court of appeals' decision that
merit the Supreme Court's attention, the Supreme Court could review
them on certiorari,'' the software company wrote in its brief.
</P>
<P>
   The filing is the first in a series that the Supreme Court
scheduled to consider Microsoft's appeal. A federal district judge
ruled that the Redmond, Wash.-based company illegally used its
monopoly position to compete unfairly and ordered it split in two.
</P>
<P>
   Investor reaction was negligible. Microsoft shares fell 1 3/16,
or 2 percent, to 67 13/16 in afternoon trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is trying to steer its appeal to the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, while federal
prosecutors intend to use an obscure law known as the Expediting
Act to send the company's appeal directly to the Supreme Court. A
three-judge panel of the court of appeals, in a related case,
issued an important ruling in Microsoft's favor two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Calling federal prosecutors ``afraid'' of the standard judicial
process, Microsoft on June 19 asked Thomas Penfield Jackson, the
district judge who ruled against the company in the antitrust case,
to deny a prosecution motion to send the company's appeal of his
decision directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company presented a three-fold argument: That
the consolidated federal-state case did not meet the Expediting
Act's narrowly defined statutory application; that the case's
general importance was insufficient grounds to warrant use of the
Expediting Act; and that using the act would actually slow the
appeals process because the Supreme Court would eventually end its
session, possibly sending appeals back down and further convoluting
the whole matter.
</P>
<P>
   The whole move was doomed, as Jackson had already clearly stated
his intention to certify the appeal directly to the nation's
highest court. But it set the stage for Wednesday's narrower
protestations, including Microsoft's most forceful argument _
rephrased and repeated throughout the document _ that the case is
extraordinarily complicated.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing the ``numerous complicated factual issues,''
the ``complexity of the technologies at issue'' and the ``wide
range of substantive and procedural issues,'' the company concluded
that ``the sheer number of issues raised by Microsoft's appeals
makes this case completely unsuitable for direct appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also criticized Jackson for granting interviews to
various news organizations during the trial and said his remarks
indicated he had failed to provide a fair hearing of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district court's blunt comments to the press raise serious
questions about its impartiality and betray a misguided belief that
appellees were entitled to the remedy of their choice, no matter
how extreme, simply because they had prevailed on liability,'' the
company wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which led the antitrust case, had a
muted response to Microsoft's latest argument. ``The appeal is
pending before the Supreme Court, and the department will respond
in its filing,'' said Gina Talamona, spokeswoman for the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors and 17 state attorneys general must file a
formal response by Aug. 15. On June 7, Jackson ordered that
tMicrosoft be split in two and placed restrictions on its business
practices to remedy antitrust violations. He subsequently stayed
both remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court on June 13 volunteered to hear any appeal as a
full panel, rather than as a three-judge panel, ``in view of the
exceptional importance'' of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup ordered by Jackson would place the Windows operating
system in one company and create a second business for everything
else, including software applications, the Internet Explorer Web
browser and the Microsoft Network Internet service provider and
network of Web sites.

DEVICES FOR CYCLISTS CAN GAUGE THE HUMAN ENGINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last winter, when people were still thinking about skiing, the
American cyclist Lance Armstrong was beginning the training that
led to his second consecutive Tour de France victory last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But sharp-eyed fans who saw him during those preseason sessions
might have noticed something odd about Armstrong's bike. Its normal
cranks _ sleek, lightweight models by Shimano _ had been replaced
by a slightly awkward-looking pair. And on his handlebars was a red
cycle computer perhaps twice the size of Armstrong's in-season
model, about the same size as the smallest of cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The differences went beyond appearances. Armstrong's special
cranks, made by the German-based company Schoberer Rad Messtechnik,
or SRM, contained nine sensitive strain gauges. When combined with
the special computer (also from SRM), they allowed Armstrong to
measure exactly how much power he was generating.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, measuring power output has become standard
training procedure for many top-level professional cyclists. Now
SRM and a cycling electronics upstart called Tune, based in
Cambridge, Mass., are hoping that lower-priced units for measuring
power will make converts among amateur cyclists as well. ``We've
gone into this market because we think the general cycling market
is ready for using power measurement,'' said Tune's president,
Gerhard Pawelka. ``It's the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Like race-car drivers, cyclists are keenly interested in power.
Measuring power output allows them to evaluate the effectiveness of
their training and spot potential physical problems. Unlike
automobile racers, however, cyclists are both the engine and the
drivers of their machines, and they measure their power output in
kilojoules or watts instead of horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Racing cyclists already suffer from information overload. Their
cyclometers can track speed (actual, maximum and average),
distance, pedaling rate and elapsed riding times. Transmitters
strapped around their chests radio a running heartbeat count to
their cycle computer or a wristwatch-style receiver.
</P>
<P>
   But Dede Demet-Barry, a professional cyclist with the United
States-based Saturn team, said she had found power measurement to
be a valuable addition. ``It's a more accurate measurement of my
fitness than just the heart rate, which is affected by other
factors,'' she said. ``It's a very good indicator of
overtraining.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the national cycling team, Demet-Barry used power
measurements prior to the 1996 Olympics to alter her usual riding
position to give her an aerodynamic advantage. .
</P>
<P>
   Before 1986, the only way to measure cyclists' power output was
by using stationary bicycles in sports medicine labs. Then Ulrich
Schoberer, a German biomedical engineer who raced bicycles when he
wasn't designing pacemakers, created a device that would take
measurements on riders' actual road bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schoberer's creation, which became the SRM crank, and
Tune's Power Tap rely on strain gauges. In simple terms, they are
pieces of extremely fine wire formed into a series of tightly
spaced U shapes. The wire is bonded to a piece of flexible plastic
before being glued onto either part of the crank (in SRM's design)
or inside the rear hub (in Tune's system). Pedaling by cyclists
slightly distorts the aluminum of either the hub or crank. That, in
turn, stretches the strain gauge wires, which then, according to a
long established principal of electrical engineering, reduces the
voltage of a small electrical current that is constantly passed
through them. Software in the computers mounted on the handlebars
calculate how much power output by the cyclist is represented by
that minute voltage change.
</P>
<P>
   Schoberer, who is now president of SRM, said that his tests had
found that the crank was the only accurate place for measurements
because it was not distorted by power loss caused by inefficiencies
from the bicycle's chain and sprockets. Christopher Zigmont, Tune's
marketing director, acknowledged that, by using a hub for its
system, up to 4 percent of a rider's actual output may be missing
from its readings. But he said that the distortion was offset by
the fact that the hub made it convenient for a cyclist to remove
Tune's system when they don't need power measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have also developed radio telemetry systems that
allow coaches and broadcasters to spy on rider's exertions. So far,
they have been used only on television in a minor men's race in
Germany and a women's race in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while before viewers are able to monitor the
progress of Armstrong or anyone else in the Tour de France. Once
the professional men's racing season is fully under way, power
measuring devices quickly disappear from the bikes of top level
riders. Part of the problem is weight. Both companies say their
systems make a bicycle about 200 grams heavier.
</P>
<P>
   For amateurs, cost may be the biggest factor in keeping power
measuring gadgets off their bikes. SRM's amateur model sells for
about $1,530, and its more accurate professional model costs about
$2,300 at current exchange rates. Both can store power readings,
heart rate, pedal speed, time and road speed for downloading later
to a PC. The devices can be ordered online at www.srm.de.
</P>
<P>
   Tune, which also sells its units on its Web site
(www.etune.com), has priced its basic Power-Tap hub, which stores
up to seven hours of data, at $769 and offers another model without
memory for $499. Purchasers of either unit must spend additional
money to have the hub built into a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Schoberer has found that his crank is more popular with amateur
cyclists in Italy than with Americans. ``Maybe it's because they're
like the Germans,'' he said of Americans. ``They buy the best bike,
get the best wheels and then they say they don't have any money for
the computer,'' Schoberer said. ``But you know, the Italians are
the best cyclists.''

&HT;     TIPPER GORE: THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where's Tipper Gore these days? She did a lot of
solo campaigning during the Democratic primaries but has dropped
out of the political picture in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She recently went on a four-day hiking trip in California's High
Sierras with a girl friend and is planning to take another vacation
with her husband off the North Carolina coast during next week's
Republican National Convention when political opponents
traditionally lie low.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore made it clear in a 30-minute conversation that she
will hit the campaign trail again after the Democratic National
Convention in mid-August in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, she says she's
emotionally ready for the election outcome, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ``fabulous'' to be first lady, she said, because the
job would give her an even greater platform for her big causes _
ending the stigma associated with mental illness and helping the
homeless to get back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, she does not intend to allow politics to
become all-consuming in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own life and my own interests, and I like it,'' she
says, a theme she repeated frequently during the chat.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who has played the drums since her high school days,
definitely marches to her own drummer. She doesn't fit the old
stereotype of a political wife and she captivated Washington this
spring when she banged the drums at a gay rights march.
</P>
<P>
   She also has occasionally turned up at Lafayette Square across
the street from the White House to get acquainted with some people
who are homeless _ and she even invited them to the vice
presidential mansion on embassy row. Her Secret Service agents take
it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways her remarks are reminiscent of the women's
movement, stressing that she is her own person, more than just the
wife of Vice President Al Gore. Politics is part of her life _
``but not my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   She referred to her husband as her ``partner and best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to win,'' she said, but she is prepared ``to let
the reality play out.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that her husband has an image problem _ some
voters find him wooden and detached. But that perception is
``irrelevant'' and will change once voters get to know him, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe the starting point will be the convention''
in Los Angeles next month, she said. The campaign is in the
``warm-up stage and will all come together in the fall. You have to
trust the people.''
</P>
<P>
   If her husband has any problem connecting with voters, she says,
then the root of that problem is that he _ as vice president _ is
``supposed to be a team player and in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore appeared confident that, once the voters tune in, they
will be ready to cast their ballots for her husband over his
personable, but less experienced Republican opponent, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Gore catching up with Bush, who still
maintains a light lead. Gore's strategists believe he will get a
``bounce'' at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles and in the
three October debates, a style of political combat that he has
mastered in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who once worked as a photographer for the Nashville
Tennessean, is a photogenic blonde beauty and an asset on the
campaign trail as an off-the-cuff speaker. She also finds time to
push her causes _ for example, she ran the White House Conference
on Mental Health a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the perennially tardy President Clinton arrived to deliver
a major speech at the conference, she jokingly commended him for
being on time for the first time in his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and the Gores have been friendly throughout the
nearly eight years of the administration, unlike many other
presidential and vice presidential families.
</P>
<P>
   But word got around Washington during Clinton's impeachment
ordeal that Mrs. Gore was deeply upset over his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and wanted her husband to
distance himself from the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Gore has been keeping a relatively low profile, the
Gores' daughter, Karenna, has been much more visible. She often
appears by her father's side as an adviser in the vice president's
inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore has publicly discussed her own bout with depression
and has made mental health a more prominent public issue. ``I'm an
activist and an advocate,'' she says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   While some polls show Bush doing relatively well among women
voters, Mrs. Gore says she is confident that when women begin to
focus on the issues, they will know that her husband ``will fight
for their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They will ``tune in and have a clear-cut choice,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She said she particularly worries about the rightward swing of
the U.S. Supreme Court on women's issues if a conservative
administration takes over the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the relationship between President Clinton and Gore,
she said Clinton ``has been a friend, has given good advice, has
been very helpful. He cares about the next president. He wants Al
to be president. I'm happy with his role.''

IF YOU SMOKE, SHOULD YOU GET A CT SCREENING?

<TEXT>
<P>
   An estimated 164,100 cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in
2000, according to the American Cancer Society. An estimated
156,900 people will die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year survival rate for all stages of lung cancer
combined is only 14 percent, but the survival rate increases to 49
percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized. The
problem is, only 15 percent of lung cancers are discovered that
early.
</P>
<P>
   Finding lung cancer early is believed to be a missing key to
combating this deadly disease, but until now, a reliable screening
technique for early detection has eluded medicine.
</P>
<P>
   With ultrafast CT, the body from the neck to the pelvis can be
scanned in less than 20 seconds _ a single breath-hold.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute says preliminary studies of
ultrafast CT show promise in detecting small cancers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, adenocarcinomas, the most common lung cancer, can
be detected more readily with spiral CT than with a standard chest
X-ray, the National Cancer Institute says. However, the technology
may be less useful for detecting central airway tumors such as
squamous cell carcinomas, and rapid-growing carcinomas such as
small-cell carcinomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Burk, a Fort Worth pulmonologist who sees a lot of
patients with lung cancer, says spiral CT scans can detect tumors
many times smaller than those found with conventional X-rays, but
they will also show many abnormalities that are not cancer.
</P>
<P>
   These ``false positives'' can lead to much more risky and
invasive lung biopsies and even surgery that is unnecessary for
benign disease, Burk says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably is a place for these ultrafast scanner
techniques in screening, but we are still learning where it is.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christine Berg, chief of lung cancer research for the
National Cancer Institute, estimates 20 to 40 percent of CT scans
of smokers will show abnormalities that are not cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is designing a large study that should
conclusively answer whether spiral CT screenings do in fact reduce
the likelihood of dying from lung cancer, the gold standard for any
cancer screening test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to start looking at patients with high-risk
factors for lung cancer _ family history, smoking, radon or
asbestos exposure, petrochemical exposure _ but that's not the
general community,'' says Burk. ``When you develop a screening test
in a high-risk population and then take it to the general
population, you get a lot more false-positive results. We need to
sort through and look at good predictors that tell us more
specifically who needs to be screened.
</P>
<P>
   Will Medicare and private insurance start paying for screening
scans anytime soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the $40 million question,'' Clay says. ``Medicare
didn't pay for mammography for a long time, until the data showed
it saves lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things are asymptomatic for a long time, and you
would like to pick them up earlier. Lung cancer is one of those
things, and screening for it is one of those deals waiting to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it is still in the domain of executive physicals,
but if I had a family member with a history of smoking and any
other risk factor, I would definitely consider CT screening well
worth the costs,'' Clay says. ``The problem is, it's a whole lot of
money for not much cancer.''

GERMANY MOURNS VICTIMS OF AIR FRANCE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
 (With AIRFRANCE-CRASH) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Flags flew at half-staff throughout Germany on
Wednesday as the country mourned its 96 victims aboard the Air
France Concorde that crashed Tuesday near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany is shaken and Germany is speechless,'' Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder said at a a memorial service in Hanover, where
his cabinet had opted to hold its last weekly meeting before the
summer vacation at the German pavilion in the Expo 2000 world fair.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the German passengers whose ill-fated flight was to
have taken them to a luxury cruise embarking from New York,
Schroeder added: ``They were taken from life in the midst of a
moment of joyful anticipation. France and Germany are united in
respect for the victims and sympathy for the relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 people, including most of Schroeder's cabinet,
attended the service, and many wept openly. Bishop Josef Homeyer
asked simply, ``God, where were you in Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   The public outpouring of sentiment and the order from Interior
Ministry Otto Schily to lower all flags to half-staff were unusual
in a generally reserved country that tends to shun displays of
national emotion. ``Ninety-six Germans burned to death,'' screamed
a headline in the mass-market Bild, above a photograph of the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said he had received messages of condolences from
throughout the world. His somber mood, on the eve of a three-week
vacation in Mallorca, contrasted with his ebullience earlier this
week when he gave an upbeat midterm assessment of the work of his
center-left government.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic jet crashed Tuesday shortly after take-off from
the Charles de Gualle Airport outside Paris, killing all 109 on
board. In addition to the 96 German passengers, there were two
Danes, one Austrian and one American, in addition to nine crew
members, all French. Four people on the ground were killed when the
plane crashed into a small hotel in Gonesse, a suburb nine miles
northeast of Paris; three were staff members _ two Polish and one
French _ and one was a British tourist.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a Concorde has crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The German Foreign Ministry said it would not release the names
of the passengers out of respect for the victims' families, who
would face ``a thousand journalists'' if their identities were
known. But a few details of the travelers, who had paid as much as
$11,000 for the flight and planned cruise, emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The Bavarian automaker BMW, based in Munich, said the crash took
the lives of a 57-year-old senior manager, his 36-year-old wife and
their two children, Maximilian and Katharina, 10 and 7. At the two
children's school, classmates and teachers were in tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the northwestern city of Moenchengladbach, city officials
said 13 residents had been killed, six couples aged mostly between
50 and 70 and an 8-year-old child. The couples knew each other and
had all booked their journey through a local travel agent,
Christian Stattrop.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry said 50 relatives of the dead had accepted
an offer from Air France to fly to Paris. The first dozen of them
were met in the French capital Wednesday by Reinhard Klimmt, the
German transport minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concorde has been one of the truly reliable planes,'' Klimmt

   Germans are avid travelers, spending an estimated $43 billion a

   Peter Deilmann, the owner of the tour operator based in northern

passengers a year. ``The situation is horrible and we are still in
a state of shock,'' he said Wednesday.

   The Munich Reinsurance Co., one of the world's largest, said its
initial estimate was that total insurance payouts stemming from the
crash would be in the region of $350 million.

XEROX GETS SLAMMED AFTER EARNINGS WARNING

   NEW YORK _ Shares of Xerox (XRX:NYSE) tumbled as much as 19
percent on Wednesday, after the company warned that it is unlikely
to meet its numbers for the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, Xerox shares were down 3 3/16, or 18
percent, to 15, after earlier hitting a new 52-week low of 14
13/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Stamford, Conn.-based company also reported profits that
were slashed in half, though Xerox met expectations that had been
lowered after the document processing company warned last month of
an earnings shortfall and disclosed that federal securities
regulators are investigating its Mexico business.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the consensus estimate for the third quarter stands
at 38 cents a share and for the full year at $1.56, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter ended June 30, income before special
items fell to $222 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, from $448
million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier, meeting the consensus
estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox took a charge of 11 cents a share for problems with
customer receivables in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue fell to $4.69 billion from $4.86 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, Xerox warned that its earnings would be well below
Wall Street's expectations, attributing the shortfall to slack
demand for the company's high-end printing and publishing products
and higher-than-anticipated costs to run its Mexico business.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission was
announced by the company on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Including special items, including the charge for the Mexican
subsidiary, the company reported net income of $145 million, or 19
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by strong competition in its highest-margin product
lines, problems collecting on accounts in Mexico and upheaval in
its sales force, the company ousted its chief executive last month
after a failed reorganization.

HOW IT FEELS TO BE A TEENAGER IN 13 EPISODES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass.)   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the opening scene of the second episode of
``American High,'' a new half-hour series that has its premiere
Wednesday night on Fox, one of the main characters _ a
``difficult'' high school senior named Morgan Moss _ careers
through his Chicago-area suburban home in search of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The two-minute sequence is shot entirely from Morgan's point of
view. As he passes through the kitchen his mother, off screen,
snarls, ``Clean your room right now!'' Morgan's father comes into
view, sitting at the kitchen table, frowning fiercely and lighting
a cigarette. The camera, shaking with barely controlled rage,
lingers on the gray-bearded man as he reads his son the riot act,
calling him a ``lousy student'' and ``an obnoxious kid,'' among
other things. Morgan's younger brother, revealed by a slight
rightward pan, flips up a middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here, dork!'' Morgan shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother advances into the frame to break up the fight.
Morgan retreats noisily through the living room and up the stairs;
the camera covers his retreat in impeccable MTV
any-angle-except-right style. The door to his bedroom slams and the
camera turns toward Morgan's face for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   He hisses, ``Like I said. . . .'' and, with perfect timing, uses
a mild expletive to describe his parents.
</P>
<P>
   This powerful sequence, tightly packed with information and
emotion and just a touch of black humor, would perk up the resume
reel of many a Hollywood writer, director or cinematographer _ if
it were not executed in its entirety by a teen-ager named Morgan
Moss, who is in fact a ``difficult'' high school senior recording
the details of his real Chicago-area suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first screened it we were astonished,'' said R.J.
Cutler, an executive producer and the director of ``American
High,'' in his office on Wilshire Boulevard recently. ``I mean, we
were like: `Oh, my God! God bless you, Morgan! You actually did
it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the serendipitous, if hard-won, rewards of ``nonfiction
drama,'' a form of serial entertainment that, while previously seen
in England (``1900 House,'' ``Airport'') and on American public
television (``An American Family,'' ``The Farmer s Wife'') is new
to American commercial prime time. ``American High'' will be joined
in late August by ``Hopkins 24/7,'' a six-part series from ABC News
about the Johns Hopkins Medical Center that also uses handheld
digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, 38, an acclaimed documentary filmmaker (``The War Room''
and ``A Perfect Candidate'') conceived of, developed, set in motion
and sold ``American High'' to Fox within a year. Eschewing the
highly paid actors and writer-producers and most of the crew
members used on such teen dramas as ``Party of Five'' and ``Beverly
Hills 90210,'' he set out to illuminate high school life at about
one-third the cost of those series. He did this by marrying cinema
verite techniques with the interlocking storytelling format
familiar to viewers of ``ER'' or ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   In 13 half-hour episodes, tautly edited and overlaid with a
jangly rock 'n' roll soundtrack, ``American High'' unspools the
stories of 14 students at Highland Park, a public high school some
40 miles northwest of Chicago that appears to be predominantly
upper middle class but reasonably diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler obtained permission to film at Highland Park by, among
other things, assigning one of his field producers to teach a
for-credit course in documentary filmmaking; donating the project's
used digital camcorders and other equipment to the school;
promising that no student or faculty member would be filmed
involuntarily; and pledging to show rough cuts, for comments and
objections, well before air time.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 students volunteered for the project; they were
winnowed down after extensive interviews and, in some cases,
several days of preliminary filming.
</P>
<P>
   Although Highland Park was carefully selected _ it was
highlighted in a 1983 book Cutler had read titled ``The Good High
School: Portraits of Character and Culture'' _ and the students had
been carefully ``cast,'' none of the dialogue was scripted or the
filmed situations prearranged. There is no narration.
</P>
<P>
   The raw material of ``American High'' was some 2,800 hours of
digital footage; about 70 percent of it shot by two fly-on-the-wall
documentary crews and the balance provided by camcorded ``video
diaries'' shot by the subjects themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Los Angeles, where the project, amply financed for a
documentary, was under terrific time pressure, six ``loggers''
entered the characters' every conflict, emotion and line of
dialogue into a database. Then an eight-person story department
sifted through the data, selected a tiny percentage of the
cross-referenced footage to be worked into coherent story lines and
episodes, and sent their suggestions to a team of six editors and
Cutler.
</P>
<P>
   Well aware of Fox's reputation, Cutler emphasized that
``American High'' is a product of the network's drama division, not
its reality division, which was responsible for such memorable fare
as ``When Animals Attack'' and ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great Orwellian irony of the phrase reality television is
that there's nothing real about it all,'' Cutler said. ``Whereas
we, as documentary filmmakers, know that we are not reproducing
reality _ we're storytellers, trying to tell the stories we find as
truly and entertainingly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the hallmarks of manipulation or exploitation are
apparent in the first three episodes of ``American High'': There is
no sex, on or off stage, and the only drug in evidence is Ritalin,
taken by a principal character who has Attention Deficit Disorder.
</P>
<P>
   What viewers do get is a long look at this group of ordinary,
extraordinary kids, including Morgan Moss, a solid D student
(``These are the years that you are supposed to go wild,'' he
declares. ``Blame it all on your parents or society!'') who often
argues, sometimes engagingly so, that there is absolutely no
contradiction between his continuing causeless rebellion and his
ultimate goal of making his mark on the world.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Robby Nathan, a sensitive, popular student-athlete
with one eye on his future at the University of Colorado and the
other on his longtime girlfriend, who loves him so intensely that
she can't imagine life after their inevitable separation. Robby's
best male friend is Brad Kresman, who is openly and most of the
time proudly gay.
</P>
<P>
   Mike ``Kiwi'' Langford is the football team's star placekicker.
He may be so psyched up for his nerve-racking specialty that he
can't see that his closest friend and confidant, a dark-haired girl
named Anna Santiago, is silently in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   Most gripping, perhaps, is the story of Allie Komessar. Truant
for four months after her father announced that he had a longtime
mistress who was pregnant and that he was leaving to start a new
family, Allie was back in class, trying to graduate while patching
together her home life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether young viewers accustomed to teen dramas with higher
concepts and clearer skins will take to ``American High'' is
problematic. (``We think it will occupy the space between MTV's
`Real World' and network television,'' Barry Newman, the head of
Fox Television, said hopefully.) But the series has already
satisfied its first audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt like a character in a TV series,'' Kiwi Langford,
who will enter Ball State University in the fall, said in a
telephone interview. ``I still don't. As far as I'm concerned, they
put our lives on television exactly as we lived them.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Robby Nathan, a few weeks from his first college class in
Boulder, said: ``I don't think that just because there were film
crews around we changed what we did or said. Those guys were our
friends. It was just like having a conversation with some good
friends nearby listening to us. Sort of like therapy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Kresman, bound for New York University, said: ``I feel very
satisfied. I got my point across. They benefited from me because I
provided my time and allowed them to come into my life. They
benefited me by allowing me to speak my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Benjamin, an assistant superintendent of the Highland Park
school district and a liaison between the school and the
filmmakers, said: ``R.J. and his staff did what they said they
would do. They told real stories of kids coming of age, without
oversimplifying or exaggerating anything.'' Benjamin added that no
student, teacher or administrator had objected to any of the edited
footage _ testimony to Cutler's considerable experience in
straddling the line between theatricality and real life.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, red-bearded and solidly built, was raised on Long Island
and attended Great Neck North High School; at Harvard he studied
theater under Robert Brustein and Peter Sellars. ``But I was also
in love with journalism,'' he said. During college he worked on an
underground newspaper, and in 1982 he took a year off to work as an
intern at National Public Radio in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he directed several off-Broadway plays,
including ``Right Behind the Flag,'' a 1988 Playwrights Horizon
production that starred a 27-year-old Kevin Spacey. That year the
reporter John Hockenberry, a friend from his NPR days, asked Cutler
to produce ``Heat,'' an eclectic radio program that mixed
interviews, essays, live music and spoken-word performance pieces.
``Heat'' won a Peabody Award but never quite caught on with the
public radio audience; it was canceled after a year. (Its quirky
television descendant, ``Edgewise,'' a weekly series on MSNBC with
Hockenberry as host and Cutler as producer, had its premiere in
1996 and lasted only one season.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Cutler was one of the producers of ``The War Room,''
D.A. Pennebaker's documentary about Bill Clinton's inner circle of
campaign strategists, which was nominated for an Academy Award. In
1994 Cutler was co-director, with David Van Taylor, of ``A Perfect
Candidate,'' which centered on the contentious and rather bizarre
Senate race in Virginia between the incumbent, Charles Robb, and
his challenger, Oliver North. It was nominated for an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   Financed as anemically as most documentary projects, ``A Perfect
Candidate'' took two and a half years to complete. In 1999 Cutler
signed with Moore-Medavoy, a Los Angeles-based management company,
and began to develop a project to sell to a major network. He
quickly decided that high school life would be both fertile and
salable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is familiar territory, but all the stories have a
mythic quality to them,'' he said. ``I don't want to overstate
this, but I think there is a common theme between `The War Room'
and `A Perfect Candidate' and `American High.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme is transition _ people at a crossroads of their
lives and how they are dealing with it. In this case you're in a
moment in life when there's a child within you rushing to grow up
as quickly as possible, and also an adult inside, desperately
holding onto childhood as fiercely as possible.''

Like millions of other young Mexicans, Eusebio de Haro set out for
the United States in May, confident he'd find work like he did
before. Instead De Haro was shot to death, allegedly, by an elderly
Texas rancher after he and another young man knocked on his door to
ask for water in a remote area near the Rio Grande. The option to
the United States for work is as deeply ingrained in De Haro's home
state as the Virgin of Guadalupe. But it is an option that appears
to be getting more deadly every day for those who choose to cross
the border illegally. Migration is
</P>
<P>
   probably the toughest of all issues between these two countries.
And Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox, who is from De Haro's home

political capital was large but his financial portfolio was another

man of his age and stature. He soon set out to change that,
however, joining the boards of seven corporations and investing in
some of those firms. Now that he has been appointed to the U.S.
Senate, he's disengaging from those new business interests_ and, by
all accounts, making a substantial financial sacrifice. (Judd,

tight U.S. labor market. Atlanta-based Home Depot plans to open

   HUNLEY _ For most of the 136 years since it became an icon of
naval history, the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley has been
buried in the soft mud at the bottom of Charleston Harbor - lost,
then found, but always surprisingly safe from the ravages of time.
All that will change next month when a giant crane lifts the
Hunley, encrusted with marine growth, from its watery grave into
the sunlight of a Carolina summer. For Civil War and submarine
buffs the world over, raising the Hunley will mark the realization
of a dream. For archaeologists, it is the start of a race against
time -- one that will ultimately determine how many secrets locked
inside in the 40-foot submarine are uncovered. ``The minute the
Hunley reaches the surfaces, we will have a ticking time bomb on
our hands,'' says'' says Maria Jacobsen, the archaeologist who will
direct the excavation of the submarine in a state-of-the-art
laboratory at the old Charleston Navy Yard. (Toner, Atlanta

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Why oh Wyoming
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after taking his place on the GOP ticket, Dick Cheney
returned to public life with a visit to Wyoming, where he began his
climb to Congress, the Pentagon and the top of the corporate world
before being tapped as George W. Bush's running mate. The
Republican team's first stop after Bush's announcement in Texas was
Casper, where Cheney and his wife, Lynne, attended Natrona County
High School. Back at the school today, Cheney joked that if someone
had predicted Lynne would be back some day with the candidates for
president and vice president, everybody would have believed it.
``But they never would have guessed that it was going to be me,''
he said, to laughter and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   SHORING UP MINORITY SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore told minority leaders today that ``talk is cheap'' and
asked them to look askance at George W. Bush's efforts to win them
away from the Democratic Party. Gore's theme, in an appearance
before the board of Operation PUSH in Chicago, was that actions
speak louder than words. ``They have concocted a strategy of
phrases and photo opportunities to convey the impression of
inclusion and moderation,'' he said. ``I expect even more of it
when the Republicans gather in Philadelphia next week. I bet it's
going to be quite a show.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES, SIZE MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   A new ABC News-Washington Post poll (3 percentage point margin
of error) finds that Al Gore is backed by 80 percent of blacks and
60 percent of Hispanics. George W. Bush was supported by 12 percent
of blacks and 35 percent of Hispanics surveyed. But Bush is
supported by 54 percent of whites in the poll, compared with 39
percent for Gore. Gore's advantage among the minority groups is
aided by their preference for more government services. Hispanics
and blacks said they favored a larger government with many
services, while two-thirds of whites favored smaller government
with fewer services. The approach to smaller government is a more
Republican point of view.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN KERRYING FAVOR
</P>
<P>
   John McCain said today that Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts
would make an excellent running mate for Al Gore. Speaking at a
news conference in Washington where he appeared with Kerry to
promote Internet privacy legislation, McCain praised Kerry's
legislative ability and service to his country as a fellow Vietnam
War veteran. Kerry had met with Gore at a fund-raiser the previous
evening, but declined to comment on his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   CYBER-SQUATTERS SNATCH BUSH-CHENEY
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after George W. Bush announced his running mate,
Democrats were up with a Web site detailing Dick Cheney's
conservative voting record. The Democratic National Committee
gobbled up the site, www.bush-cheney.net, late Sunday and have
posted scores of votes he cast in Congress. The site is also
sprinkled with quotes describing Cheney as ultra-conservative,
anti-abortion and opposed to affirmative action. From ex-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich : ``Cheney's voting record was slightly more
conservative than mine.'' The Bush campaign complained that
Democrats were trying to deceive Americans by making the site
appear to be generated by Bush-Cheney supporters.
</P>
<P>
   THE ABILITY TO OPEN DOORS
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney's lengthy foreign affairs experience helped boost
the overseas reach of Halliburton Co., the world's largest provider
of petroleum support services. About two years ago, Halliburton
executives were having trouble getting a face-to-face meeting with
a top official in tiny, oil-rich Qatar. They had tried for months
to talk with the country's oil minister to discuss a potential
project. No response. No interest. No meeting. That was before
their boss, defense secretary during the Persian Gulf War, got
involved. ``Within an hour, the meeting was facilitated and set
up,'' said Halliburton's chief financial officer, Gary Morris, a
tone of wonder in his voice. ``Having access is a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   OIL TO GREASE THE PARTY COFFERS
</P>
<P>
   With Dick Cheney at its helm, Halliburton Co. and its employees
have been generous supporters of the Republican Party. Donation
records show the oil services giant has given more than $1.6
million to federal candidates and the political parties since Jan.
1, 1991, virtually all to Republicans. More than half that money
has come since Cheney took over the company as CEO in 1995, the
Center for Responsive Politics reported. More than 91 percent of
the company's donations have gone to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A TRADITION!
</P>
<P>
   Long before Dick Cheney's transformation from talent scout to
running mate, George W. Bush was relying on him and other veterans
of his father's presidency. Should Bush get to the White House,
Cheney as vice president surely would be joined by others from the
old Bush administration, in the Cabinet and top echelons of the new
one. Bush has talked of Colin Powell as a prospective secretary of
state, and the retired general has said he'd serve if asked. That
choice could be made in advance for campaign impact. While
Democrats might taunt Bush about the legacy of policy advisers,
there're likely to do the same thing. Presidential nominees always
have.
</P>
<P>
   STILL A PRETTY GOOD LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney has become very rich as a result of his work. Last
year, he earned $1.28 million in salary and $640,914 in other
compensation, as well as stock options that could be worth up to
$18.8 million, according to an analysis by Reuters. On May 31,
Cheney cashed in 100,000 shares of stock just as it neared a
one-year high, which resulted in a $5 million payout, according to
a Securities and Exchange Commission report. If Cheney is elected
vice president, he would earn $181,400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   POLLUTION ON BOTH THEIR HOUSES
</P>
<P>
   As soon as George W. Bush announced that Dick Cheney will be his
running mate, the environmental records of both candidates came
under attack from conservation advocates and Democrats. ``If George
W. Bush represents the biggest threat to the environment in the
2000 presidential election, then Dick Cheney is clearly the second
biggest,'' said Deb Callahan, head of the Washington-based League
of Conservation Voters. At the same time, Democrats went after
Bush's environmental record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   BALL'S IN GORE'S COURT NOW
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore retains ``a whole range of options'' in choosing a
running mate following George W. Bush's selection of Dick Cheney to
be his No. 2, Gore aides say. Gore has stepped up his ``very
private and dignified'' selection process, said Gore aide Mark
Fabiani. There was a lot of speculation that Gore would tap
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry as his running mate, but former
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell's name was on many lists as
well. Florida Sen. Bob Graham's big home state also made him a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   GRAHAM PEOPLE LIKE CHENEY CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Sen. Bob Graham of Florida say his chances of
becoming Al Gore's running mate improved when George Bush chose
Dick Cheney to join the Republican ticket. Graham's Democratic
supporters, according to the Palm Beach Post, are looking for any
hopeful sign because they're convinced that he can push Gore over
the top in the Sunshine State. A victory in Florida, they believe,
could be devastating for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH BY 11 IN OHIO POLL
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, George W. Bush leads Al Gore by 11 percentage points,
47-36 percent, according to a new poll by Fox News/Opinion
Dynamics. The survey also showed Bush to be ahead in the state,
43-34 percent, when Ralph Nader (6 percent) and Pat Buchanan (5
percent) are added to the presidential mix. The survey had a 4.3
percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSALS FOR THE DISABLED
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore unveiled a $2.7 billion package designed to bolster
programs for the disabled by opening the workplace and improving
home-care programs. ``There are millions of Americans who are held
back, not because they have a disability, but because that
disability is misunderstood,'' said Gore. ``They are not recognized
for the abilities they have.'' Aides said the package aims
specifically at opening the workplace to the disabled, citing
statistics showing that up to 75 percent of those with serious
disabilities are unemployed or underemployed.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH THE ONLY ONE LEFT NOW
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes finally dropped his own campaign for the Republican
nomination. Keyes won no primaries last winter and spring, but had
remained on the campaign trail spreading his conservative message.
Asked at an appearance in Boston if he still considered himself a
candidate, he said, ``I am not.'' But a campaign spokeswoman said
Keyes had not yet filed withdrawal papers with the Federal Election
Commission. Keyes said he supports Dick Cheney for vice president
because Cheney's anti-abortion views mirror his own, and that he'll
join other Republicans to unite behind the ticket at the convention
next week.
</P>
<P>
   GAY USED TO MEAN MERRY
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans strongly opposed to elements of the party's
platform are running into roadblocks erected by social
conservatives. Representatives of the Traditional Values Coalition
and the Family Research Council who met with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, chairman of the platform committee, said they were
assured they would be happy with the party platforhe bottom line is
the homosexuals want to neuter the Republican platform, and I'm not
sure that's going to happen,'' said Andrea Laferty, of the
Traditional Values Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   THE DISPLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   Claiming a new TV ad linking him to Rick Lazio is misleading,
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is demanding the Long Island
congressman have it withdrawn. Moynihan, whose retirement opened up
the New York Senate seat, is backing Hillary Clinton. The ad,
unveiled by the Republican Leadership Council, uses the words of
President Clinton to link Lazio and Moynihan, and relies on footage
of the president thanking Moynihan, Lazio and others at a ceremony
for their work on legislation to help disabled Americans. ``There
follows a composite photograph of the two of us, although we have
never, to my belief, been photographed together,'' Moynihan wrote
in his letter to Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC SOOTHES THE SAVAGE DONOR
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee is staging several low-priced
concerts to fill the party coffers, hoping to lure in new donors
willing to fork over just $50 or $100 rather than six-figures. To
aid the cause, Democrats are calling on the likes of legendary
singer Barbra Streisand, male group Boyz II Men and comedian Whoopi
Goldberg. ``We're going to make it exciting for them to give to the
DNC,'' said Peter Knight, who recently took over the party's
fund-raising. Previously, Knight was campaign manager for President
Clinton and chief of staff for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS
</P>
<P>
   Fishing with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. Cocktails with
retired Gen. Colin Powell. Golf with a senator. Ringside drinks
with champion Larry Holmes or an afternoon with race driver Bobby
Labonte. That's for those who've donated five- and six-figure
checks to the Republican Party. In Philadelphia, there'll be
cocktail parties galore, luxury skyboxes, and countless events
offering the lure of casual access to Washington's power brokers.
The attraction is ``going to events that are not boring cocktail
events in nondescript locations, but events that give them a feel
for the city and our rich history and our culture,'' said Martin
Silverstein, a Philadelphia lawyer and GOP donor.
</P>
<P>
   PREGNANT WOMEN ON DEATH ROW
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to Al Gore's recent statement that pregnant women on
death man. No one has shown that the circumstance has ever arisen.
The sponsor of the bill, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), argued
that unborn children had committed no crime. Abortion-rights
advocates said the bill was intended to advance the cause of
abortion opponents by elevating a fetus to the status of a child.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where its future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   PRO-ISRAEL CREDENTIALS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said U.S. aid to Palestinians should be cut off
if they unilaterally declare statehood. ``It must be clear that any
unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would be entirely
unacceptable and should be met with a cutoff of United States
assistance,'' she said in a statement after the Camp David peace
talks collapsed. The New York Senate candidate's position appeared
to go beyond what President Clinton has said in urging the Israelis
and the Palestinians to keep trying to reach an agreement.

ONLINE SHOPPING: A PERSONAL TAILOR FOR DENIMED MASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I panicked one day recently because I could not find my lucky
jeans.
</P>
<P>
   As I pawed through a pile of 10 other ill-fitting pairs _ the
ones with the button fly that is so hard to button, the ones that
shrank in the wash, the ones with the puckered waistband, the ones
that sag after a couple of hours of wear _ I realized that the last
time I felt so desperate was after I discovered that my engagement
ring had fallen out of my pocket while I was gardening.
</P>
<P>
   I hunted for two hours with a flashlight before I found the ring
in a patch of ivy. But finding a pair of jeans that fits right is a
slightly more difficult undertaking. So when I heard about
Interactive Custom Clothes Co., or IC3D, an online retailer that
offers customers the opportunity to build a pair of jeans perfectly
sized to fit their measurements for less than $100, I immediately
went to the IC3D site to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The home page welcomed me with the greeting: ``It's your
universe, wear whatever you want totally custom.'' This statement
conjured up a wondrous world that off-the-rack shoppers like me
have rarely glimpsed: a place where sleeves don't hang down over
hands, waistbands do not slide hipward and sleeveless shirts do not
gape open under the arms.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of owning such a wardrobe has become
increasingly rare since the advent of the mass manufacture of
clothing. Because that trend became firmly entrenched after World
War I, when all those factories that had been producing soldiers'
uniforms turned in peacetime to the fabrication of civilian wear, I
never thought I could do much to fight it. Instead, I just counted
myself fortunate not to have been alive to wear the formless,
waistless fashions of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   But a return to tailor-made clothing makes sense in an era when
manufacturers of items as diverse as computers and automobiles are
building customized products from scratch to satisfy customers'
idiosyncratic desires for big hard drives and metallic paint
finishes. ``Apparel in particular is really ripe for mass
customization because everybody's body is unique and we have been
sacrificing when we buy off the rack,'' said Joseph Pine, the
author of ``Mass Customization: The New Frontier in Business
Competition'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a growing number of online retailers _
Moda1to1.com, E-madeinitaly.com, Americanfit.com _ are selling
tailor-made clothing for prices that range from $100 for a dress to
$780 for a men's suit. Shoppers can point and click to choose
fabric, color and cut, then type in their measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond merely creating jeans that are the right size, IC3D
offers customers the option of specifying every detail _ from
button color to fabric weight to the number of pockets to how wide
the ankle opening should be (the company's software can generate a
pattern accurate to one-tenth of an inch). This level of
specification does not come cheap, however; jeans cost from $70 to
$95 (including shipping) depending on the choice of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Although this excited me at first, I soon realized that it was
going to be no faster than trying on 20 pairs of ill-fitting jeans
under the pitiless glare of fitting room lights. In fact, when I
clicked on my fabric choice, denim, 30 options appeared _ and I
didn't know what most of them were.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I could pick between stonewashed or ``raw,'' all right, but
did I want fabric that was ``ring-spun, left hand twirl,'' or did I
want ``a right-hand twirl?''
</P>
<P>
   It felt kind of like the way they built ``The Six Million Dollar
Man'' on television in the 1970s after the opening credits intoned:
``We have the technology. We have the capability to make the
world's first bionic man.'' Only in this case, the thread color
would be crucial to the outcome. What if I made a mistake?
</P>
<P>
   That is the biggest risk, of course, when shoppers try to design
their own clothes. ``Be careful, or else you might not like what
you get,'' said Robert Leeds, a lecturer in the marketing
department at the University of Southern Florida who worked for
years in the apparel industry. ``The fabric might feel scratchy.
Maybe you won't like the buttons. And don't forget there are
fashions in everything. Even in black socks, the number of ribs
changes from season to season. Are these jeans going to be
fashionable?''
</P>
<P>
   Skittish, I phoned Peter del Rio, the founder of Ic3d.com, who
reassured me. ``We are guaranteeing that they will fit right, and
if they don't, we will determine why and fix them,'' he said,
adding that in the four years the company has been selling online,
95 percent of customers are ``totally happy.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of the company's first-time customers avoid the
headache-provoking choices by opting for the site's Copy Cat
feature, he said, which prompts you to mail in your favorite pair
of jeans. The company creates a copy for you, then mails them back.
Or he suggested using the Denim Wizard feature to get started.
After asking five ``lifestyle'' questions like ``Are you more
concerned about fabric quality or low price?'' and ``What kind of
climate are you going to wear your jeans in?'' the wizard
recommends a denim for you.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I went with ``Riviera,'' described as a ``soft
perfect denim with no unique characteristics.'' Then I went
upstairs to my closet again, where I determined that most of my
jeans were sewn with orange thread and had copper buttons and five
pockets. So I chose those features, as well. Then I measured myself
in 11 places, including some (like ``front rise'') that I had never
heard of before. del Rio said not to worry too much; within an inch
of accuracy, the measurements should produce a pair of well-fitting
jeans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The total came to $85. When the jeans arrived, less than a week
after I placed the order, I followed the company's instructions and
washed and dried them before trying them on. The fit was perfect.
They are in fact the best-fitting jeans I've ever had. I have a new
lucky pair.

&HT;     CAMPBELL WILL PUSH FOR PRO-CHOICE PLATFORM AT GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said Wednesday he will
go to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia next week
to speak out on behalf of abortion rights, a position sure to put
him at odds with the convention's majority.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell faces an uphill fight in his bid to unseat Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif. Voters in the state are heavily pro-choice; so
a prominent stand in favor of abortion rights amid a convention
dominated by anti-abortion Republicans could help Campbell
politically.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell insists that California politics aren't guiding him
in his plan to champion the pro-choice position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly, my purpose is to make sure that people see the
Republican Party as diverse as it really is,'' Campbell told
reporters at a luncheon meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell acknowledged that making a point of his pro-choice
views at the Republican convention is his best hope of inoculating
himself against any Feinstein attack that might materialize on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way: If I went to the convention and was
silent, a fair criticism could be lodged against me for having been
silent,'' said Campbell, 47, a former law professor at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he has sent letters to every pro-choice GOP House
member, senator and governor, urging them to make their views known
at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to speak at meetings of the delegation from
Pennsylvania, California and Illinois. Pennsylvania's governor, Tom
Ridge, is also pro choice.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he is trying to get an invitation to speak before
the New York delegation. New York's Republican governor, George
Pataki, favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley congressman said he has also asked to address
the entire Republican convention, but he admitted, ``I'm not
holding my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he is working with pro-choice Republican activists
who want to delete strong anti-abortion language that is likely to
be approved by the conservative-dominated platform committee, as
well as the convention at large.
</P>
<P>
   The platform's abortion language, still in draft form, parallels
that in the 1996 Republican platform, which calls for a
Constitutional amendment outlawing abortion and makes no exceptions
for rape, incest of the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 abortion plank states: ``The unborn child has a
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We
support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse
legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's
protections apply to unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell insisted he is not trying to create discord at the
conventon, but rather to promote an image of a party that is not
monolithic on abortion.

 &HT;    Hair today, gone tomorrow
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Your average Neanderthals were patient
people. Patient and hairy. This is because they spent lots of hours
crouched in bushes waiting for a mastodon or buffalo to come by,
and it was in the days before Gore-Tex.
</P>
<P>
   It was cold, is the point, especially with all those glaciers,
and they needed something to supplement the mastodon robes they
wore. Back then, a woman liked a hairy man and, come to think of
it, a man liked a hairy woman. It meant they wouldn't lose a limb
to cold at an inopportune moment.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Now we wear layers. Scientists think the
earth is getting hotter. We have dressing systems. Which may be why
some people respond to body hair the way they'd respond to a
cockroach crawling on their necks: Get it off! Get it off!
</P>
<P>
   We don't really need body hair anymore. We're warm enough, so
the standard of beauty in many cultures has become smooth and
essentially hairless. Oh, we'll tolerate some hair, but only on the
right places: heads, for example, or Tom Selleck's chest.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, get thee hence, unwanted hair, we've got many ways to
remove you.
</P>
<P>
   A CLOSE SHAVE
</P>
<P>
   Most basically, there's shaving. Balanced on one leg in the
shower clutching a bar of soap shaving. Soft as a baby's bottom
shaving. Darn it, she used my razor again and now I'm bleeding
shaving. This is how you do it, son, shaving.
</P>
<P>
   Shaving. Thpbbbt. Shaving can cause skin irritation and ingrown
hairs, not to mention flecks of white toilet paper attached to the
skin by a dot of blood on some difficult-to-navigate place _ like
an ankle or neck _ that invariably gets cut.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short-term, it's also the cheapest option and the one
with which we're most familiar. We hit puberty and start shaving,
the mysteries of a razor unfolding like the new hairs we discover
daily. It's exciting at first _ fun, even, because we feel like an
Adult.
</P>
<P>
   Then it became a hassle. It involves things like shaving cream
and replacement blades and after shave. We try, and sometimes stick
with, different options: the Epilady (Remember how bad that hurt?
Yanking duct tape off would feel better.), Norelco products, the
Remington, anything, anything.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, we consider just not shaving at all, in protest of
our shallow, appearance-obsessed culture. That lasts about three
days. Sigh. Get the tweezers, our eyebrows are looking bushy.
</P>
<P>
   CREAMS NO CURE-ALL
</P>
<P>
   So we kick it up a notch to depilatory creams. Raise your hand
if your skin ever turned orange because you left the Nair on a
minute too long. It's more thorough, though, especially on the way
to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   There also are products _ such as Hair No More, UHA Sport and
DermaNude Hair Vanishing Cream _ that claim to seep into the hair
follicle and saturate the hair bulb, inhibiting hair growth. Prices
vary between $25 and $50 per container of product and results have
been reported as varied. But people are looking in many directions
for help in the war on unwanted hair.
</P>
<P>
   OW OW OW WAXING
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to waxing. Some facts about waxing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaving home-waxing kits in the microwave for too long is a
terrible idea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ow. Ow. Ow. Owwww.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hair must be at least a quarter-inch long for effective
waxing.
</P>
<P>
   _ After repeated treatments, the hair gets finer and thinner,
said Terri Kelley of About Face &AMP; Body Health &AMP; Wellness Day Spa,
and waxing hurts less.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a professional do the waxing, he or she will spread
a layer of warm wax on the target area, let it cool a little bit,
then peel it off. That's pretty much what happens if you do it
yourself. Since the entire hair is coming off, it takes weeks to
grow back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of times is more painful,'' Kelley said, but
added that she has as clients swimmers who get full-body waxes and
men who have their backs waxed. There are different waxes for
normal and sensitive skin, and the most common areas Kelley waxes
are legs, eyebrows, upper lips and the bikini area, though hair can
be removed from anywhere it grows, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for waxing can vary according to the type of wax used, the
training of the esthetician and the establishment where the waxing
is done. On average, however, full body waxes can start at $100,
back or chest waxes at $40, underarms at $25 and lips or chins at
$12.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT ELECTROLYSIS
</P>
<P>
   Kelley also does electrolysis, which deserves a new paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   Electrolysis. Where to begin? Back in the day, decades and
decades ago when it was invented, all electrolysis was invasive,
meaning a needle is injected into each individual hair follicle,
conducting a galvanic current into the follicle and killing it.
</P>
<P>
   This method hurts quite a bit and, since follicles vary in
depth, its effectiveness also varies.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, a noninvasive technique was developed in which
a tweezer or a probe is used to deliver the galvanic current at the
base of the hair follicle. Estheticians spread specially formulated
gels on the hair first, gels that will coat the hair and allow the
current to be transmitted down the hair shaft to the follicle.
</P>
<P>
   The probe is held on one square-inch spot for 40 seconds while
the clients hold something to ground themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a fantastic breakthrough,'' Kelley said, ``but
it's not an overnight process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients come back for treatments over a period of nine months to
a year, because hair grows in different stages and one treatment
won't get all the hair. Noninvasive electrolysis treatments can
start at, on average, $35 for the upper lip, $45 for the jaw, $90
for under the arms and $70 for the bikini area.
</P>
<P>
   FOLLICLE LASER SHOW
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, hair removal methods have advanced in amazingly
high-tech directions. Dermatologists now are using lasers and
intense pulses of light to get rid of unwanted hair.
</P>
<P>
   The laser hair removal technique was discovered as a side effect
of tattoo removal, in which a ruby laser not only removed the
tattoo but killed the hair around it. Based on that technology,
scientists and researchers developed increasingly more powerful
lasers with longer wavelengths of light that penetrate deeper and
are kinder to skin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Dahlstrom, who co-owns Lasair, LLC, uses an 810
nanometer diode laser to remove unwanted hair on his patients. The
laser works by targeting pigment in the base of the hair follicle
and achieving photothermolysis, or thermal damage to the pigmented
hair follicle.
</P>
<P>
   The best laser hair removal candidates have dark hair and fair
skin, he said, because the laser targets black melanin, the skin
and hair pigment, which absorbs the heat from the laser and damages
the hair follicle. Tans, dark skin and blond hair can make laser
hair removal less effective.
</P>
<P>
   In laser hair removal treatments, Dahlstrom shaves the target
area and offers numbing cream because it can be an uncomfortable
process. The laser itself is computer-driven and scans a1 1/2-inch
square of skin every six seconds. The skin around the affected
follicles may become red and swollen, especially tan or darker
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlstrom said an average of six to eight treatments are
necessary to get satisfactory cosmetic results, depending on a
patient's age, sex, hormone level, pigmentation and other factors.
He said laser treatments can be used on the face, bikini area,
underarms and most other areas where unwanted hair grows. Patienle
like a haircut. If it's reasonably priced it has value.'' For
example, he said, a laser treatment of the bikini area may be
between $50 and $80.
</P>
<P>
   PHOTO-EPILATION SNAPSHOT
</P>
<P>
   Photo-epilation is the hair removal method most recently
approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Using an intense
pulse of one of the wavelengths of visible light, photo-epilation
targets the follicle without affecting the tissue around it, said
Peggy Hudgens of Plastic Surgery Specialists, P.C., who directs the
PhotoDerm program.
</P>
<P>
   Using a system of filters that sends light into different planes
of tissue, the pulse of light targets the melanin in the hair
follicle and quickly heats it, damaging the follicle. As with laser
hair removal, the ideal candidates for this treatment have dark
hair and light skin.
</P>
<P>
   Each flash of light covers an area of skin the size of a stick
of Trident gum, and is so quick that numbing cream for the skin
rarely is necessary, Hudgens said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she does several test sites before doing a
treatment to see how a patient's skin responds, and does multiple
treatments over the period of a year for a 70 to 95 percent
reduction in the amount of hair on the target zone of skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never make anybody 100 percent hair-free,'' she said,
adding that patients will see an obvious reduction in hair growth.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the point, the goal of all this shaving and waxing and
plucking. It's not necessarily a vanity issue, Dahlstrom pointed
out, but a way to improve self-esteem. Unwanted hair can be
painful, distracting or embarrassing, especially with our stringent
standards of appearance.
</P>
<P>
   What we need is another Ice Age.

   COKE-CADBURY _ Coca-Cola Co. is abandoning efforts to acquire
Cadbury Schweppes' beverage brands in Canada and Mexico. The brands
in both countries were part of a $1.85 billion deal struck in 1998

Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) also promises to
unclog aerial gridlock by allowing planes to safely fly closer
together and takeoff and land at shorter intervals. UPS will begin
equipping its own planes with ADS-B this year, and others including

The show is expected to draw between 3,500 and 5,000 people are is
considered moderate by convention industry standards, but it's
important because it is affiliated with NeoCon World Trade Fair,
which is held in Chicago and draws about 60,000 annually. It's also
one of the most important trade shows in the industry. (Poole,

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. files a brief arguing
why the U.S. Supreme Court should not hear an expedited appeal of
the federal court ruling that it should be split up because it is
an abusing monopoly. (Glass, Cox News Service). 18.

   COKE-CADBURY _ Coca-Cola Co. is abandoning efforts to acquire
Cadbury Schweppes' beverage brands in Canada and Mexico. The brands
in both countries were part of a $1.85 billion deal struck in 1998
between Coke and London-based Cadbury Schweppes. The deal has since
been scaled back because of government antitrust concerns. (Seward,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   UPSAIR _ A subsidiary of UPS is testing a new technology that,
proponents say, can drastically reduce or even eliminate mid-air
and runway collisions. The experimental system known as ADS-B (for
Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) also promises to
unclog aerial gridlock by allowing planes to safely fly closer
together and takeoff and land at shorter intervals. UPS will begin
equipping its own planes with ADS-B this year, and others including
FedEx, Airborne and DHL are likely to follow by the end of 2002
when all cargo planes will be required to carry collision avoidance
equipment. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   AMSOFT _ American Software, an erratic company whose stock is
stumbling along at about $6, is hoping to fix its image on Wall
Street with one, and possibly two, IPO spinoffs. (McNaughton,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FURNISHINGS-SHOW _ Atlanta has snagged a prestigious commercial
furnishings show for 2001 and maybe beyond. NeoCon South is moving
to Atlanta after two years in Miami. In Atlanta's favor is its
central location and boom in development, which fuels this market.
The show is expected to draw between 3,500 and 5,000 people are is
considered moderate by convention industry standards, but it's
important because it is affiliated with NeoCon World Trade Fair,
which is held in Chicago and draws about 60,000 annually. It's also
one of the most important trade shows in the industry. (Poole,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 AN eSPREE OF ART BUYING MAKES A BELIEVER  
 (For release Sunday, July 30)  
(ART ADV: Photos NYT 16,19 are being sent to NYT photo clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By DEBORAH SOLOMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Breton, who was almost as famous for his French arrogance
as for founding Surrealism, enjoyed playing the role of the
anti-snob. He once said that the most interesting artistic
experience in Paris was going to the flea market.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of Breton the other night while sifting through the
riotous jumble of merchandise offered at eBay, the online auction
site. It lists some 3.7 million items organized into 2,900
categories, one of which is fine art. To try it out, I typed in the
name of Vincent van Gogh. The search yielded 617 items ranging from
a supposed original painting (price: $1 million) to a mass-produced
souvenir of artistic torment: a curvy, pinkish rubber objet
described with typical eBay poetry as ``Van Gogh's Ear _ squish it,
squeeze it!''
</P>
<P>
   I placed a bid on the ear. The next morning, an e-mail message
arrived: ``Congratulations on winning Van Gogh's ear. The total is
$2.75.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was at eBay not to accumulate pop-culture artifacts
or the anatomical parts of Dutch masters, but rather to purchase
original works of art. Curious about the growing and radical
phenomenon by which people are buying art they can't see from
sellers they can't see, I decided to shop for art online and
assemble my own art collection. My budget: an even $1,000 (make
that $997.25, after the ear).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I hoped to find a few sterling works and believed I
possessed a sharp enough eye to pluck some rare and lovely gems
from eBay's ocean of indifferent merchandise. There was also a real
possibility that I could wind up with a fake. In May, an abstract
painting passed off as a Richard Diebenkorn made headlines after it
was purchased on eBay for $135,805. Although the sale was stopped,
it serves as a cautionary tale about the hazards of buying art on
eBay, which, not unlike the classified ads, enables any Joe with a
bogus Grandma Moses to post a listing.
</P>
<P>
   At present there are at least 50 Web sites offering art for
sale. Typical, perhaps, is IncredibleArt.com, where you can type in
``landscapes'' or ``angels'' or ``fish'' and view an array of
sincere efforts by living artists in the requested category. At the
high end of the trade, sites like Artnet.com are stocked with work
by brand-name artists, all of it furnished by reputable art
dealers. It's doubtless very convenient if you live in Reykjavik or
Tirana and suddenly crave a Nan Goldin photograph.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, by contrast, is a virtual flea market, the e-flea, with
all the unevenness of quality that implies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It might seem to represent the end of the tradition of the
collector as connoisseur, but you can also view it as quite the
reverse. In an age when collectors are willing to drop $14 million
for a classic Rothko and when $2 million gets you a not-so-great
Pollock, there is something appealing about an auction site that
offers vast availability as well as the chance to buy a work of art
for $200 or even $20.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Here, you can comb through tens of thousands of works culled
from the attics and corner junk shops of America _ and respond to
the values embodied in an object rather than to a wall label or a
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Until the day when I clicked onto www.ebay.com, I had never
purchased a work of art. This negative achievement was no doubt
related to my profession: art critics are obligated to carp, not
consume. Instead of putting my money where my mouth was, I put my
mouth where other people's money was.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, the tax cuts at the heart of Ronald Reagan's voodoo
economics sent art prices soaring, and critics felt predictably
miffed as sky-high records set in the auction rooms of Manhattan
brought on an age in which money seemed to be the sole arbiter of
cultural worth.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, too, is an auction room, but of a vigorously plebeian
stripe. Works of art are treated as priced-to-go merchandise, as if
they were bowling balls or Hawaiian shirts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   So what was I doing here? When I first clicked on, there were
listings for 37,814 fine-art objects, and I found it fascinating to
browse through them. I liked the openness, the lack of pretense of
a place where a signed Christo photograph, a Malevich exhibition
poster from the Tate Gallery in London and a Raphael Soyer charcoal
sketch appeared in the company of pictures that were variously
described as ``Original Impressionist Oil Painting, $5.99,'' or
``Original Painting Signed Alice $9.99'' or ``Artist Has Same
Astrology Chart as Picasso $50.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   What sort of art do Americans display in their homes? EBay
offers an unofficial survey of everything out there, an impromptu
sociology lesson on American taste.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A large percentage of eBay's holdings consists of reproductions
of celebrated works _ for instance, a plaster replica of Degas'
sculpture ``The Little Dancer'' for $24.95, a reminder of the link
that Americans seek with museum masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an abundance of amateur paintings, so many that
you may feel you are living in Kafka's ``nature-theater of
Oklahoma,'' a place where every citizen can be an artist. I saw
countless scenes of the idyllic countryside, pictures of cows and
verdant green hills that were probably painted in musty basements
in the suburbs and reflect a nostalgia for the reassuring past.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a week, I placed bids on about 20 works that
struck me as particularly inspired. Most were minor pieces by known
artists _ prints and smallish drawings that are too inexpensive to
merit wall space in a big-city gallery. They included a Leon Golub
lithograph of a political martyr rendered in strident red and
black, an elegant charcoal drawing circa 1905 by Arthur B. Davies
and an etching of an intensely craggy mountain by the German artist
Lovis Corinth. I also bid on an Op-Art print by Victor Vasarely and
Damien Hirst's delectably besmirched ``Home Sweet Home'' (1996), a
porcelain dessert plate designed to resemble an ashtray overflowing
with butts.
</P>
<P>
   To bid is not to buy and, as eBay's auctions each last 10 days,
many of my early bids proved futile. From one day to the next, a
stream of e-mail messages arrived: ``Heads Up! Another eBay user
has outbid you on the following item . . .'' My initial interest in
eBay's art-for-everyone democratizing possibilities promptly
evaporated when my own needs came into play. Who were these rival
bidders? Why wouldn't they go away? The elation of placing a high
bid was invariably followed by the despairing realization that I
was not the only e-aesthete in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Would I ever score? Finally it happened. The theme song of
``Chariots of Fire'' played in my head as I read the victorious
news: ``You won the Vasarely litho.'' Price: $225 for a signed and
numbered print, frame included.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail message, sent by the seller of the work, requested
that I call him to discuss details of payment and shipping. He
turned out to be Michael Levy, a dentist in Phoenix, married,
gregarious, audibly suntanned. He volunteered to build a wooden
shipping crate at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're so handy,'' I told him without irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in America outside of Manhattan is handy,'' he
replied with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   How fast could he ship the work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 22 extractions to do tomorrow,'' the dentist replied,
``but I'll try to build the crate in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus I secured my first purchase, appropriately titled
``Vertigo.'' Granted, Vasarely is not exactly in the same league as
Cezanne, and the Op-Art movement, which flourished in the '60s, is
snubbed by most serious collectors. But I loved the print _ a
thrillingly jittery blue-and-white checkerboard that appears to
keep moving _ and figured besides that Vasarely could one day come
into vogue, rescued by the same rotation of cool that has lately
enshrined the martini and the Fontainebleau Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   My next purchase was the drawing by Arthur B. Davies, who, much
like Vasarely, does not have what dealers call a strong market.
Although once an important figure on the New York scene _ he was an
organizer of the historic Armory Show of 1913 _ the mention of his
name today tends to elicit blank stares. As I studied his drawing
on eBay, a tiny, charming sketch of a woman in a long dress, her
lowered gaze hinting at her hidden interior life as she walks up
some steps, I wondered why every artist in the world is either
vastly underrated or even more vastly overrated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to see a drawing on a computer screen is not to see a
drawing at all, only a bright facsimile, a picture of a picture,
pixel dots by the millions. Digital reproduction strips art of
essential subtleties of scale, color and texture, as cultural
conservatives are fond of bemoaning. But that's beside the point.
You look at art on the Internet not to have an aesthetic
experience, but to gather visual information. It's no more
compromising than the use of slides in art history classrooms. The
study of art would be most inconvenient if you had to trek to the
Louvre every time you needed to check the precise upward tilt of
the Venus de Milo's torso.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The art trade, too, has long been dependent on reproductions;
art dealers habitually consult 8-by-10-inch color transparencies,
holding them up to the light to see them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, I placed an early bid of $177.50 on the Arthur B. Davies
drawing. Days passed; no one else seemed interested. But then an
hour before the auction closed, other bidders emerged out of
nowhere and the price started jumping up in $5 increments.
Suddenly, I came to understand the frenzied emotion that
accompanies auctionitis. A drawing that I had never even seen until
four days earlier now seemed essential, and I could focus on
nothing but my hunger to own it.
</P>
<P>
   So I went a bit high on the Davies drawing, all the way up to
$380, frame included. Big spender. The seller was Robert Keil, a
New York art dealer. After the auction, I mentioned to him that I
found the frame garish. He offered to replace it. ``The Davies
drawing is en route to you,'' he wrote the next day by e-mail. ``I
hope you like the new frame. I thought I'd really get into the
spirit of the democratization of the art market, so I bought it at
Bed, Bath and Beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be my final eBay purchase, although there were
other objects I very much wanted. I had hoped to get the Damien
Hirst plate-cum-ashtray but couldn't bring myself to bid more than
$400 for it. It was painful to drop out of the auction, but I had
to consider the risks of buying art on eBay: the work could be a
fake, it could be damaged, it could be stolen property. If you're
buying art for investment, eBay is a pointless gamble, but it's
fine if you're buying art for fun. Fun, for me, stops at $400.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, I came away with the Vasarely print, the Arthur
B. Davies drawing and van Gogh's ear. Taken together, they don't
exactly amount to a major collection, and I harbor no hope that the
Metropolitan Museum of Art will offer to name a wing after me in
exchange for the donation of my art holdings. But I treasure my
acquisitions nonetheless. They arrived at my apartment within a
week, and it was a bit startling to see the various packages _
physical objects with scale and real heft sprung from the
weightless ether of cyberspace. The crate built by the dentist came
nailed shut, and I had to call him for tips on how to open it.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting is famously addictive, and before long I saw how my
modest beginnings as an eBay art collector could lead to a more
ambitious enterprise. One recent Saturday, I was making the rounds
of the Manhattan galleries when I paused before a contemporary
photograph, admired it and, to my surprise, inquired into the
price.
</P>
<P>
   As I stood in the gallery, it seemed that the world and the
visible things in it could all be owned. Momentarily, I became
someone else, imagined myself as the acquisitive equal of
world-class collectors like Chester Dale or Albert C. Barnes.
Clearly, my stint as an eBay collector had altered me to the core,
allowed me to become the sort of woman who feels at ease in that
realm where costly and beautiful objects circulate, a woman who
relishes the game of questing, of competing, for masterworks. But
my fantasy was interrupted when I glanced down at my shoes, which
had a hole in them; I needed to get to the shoe repair shop before
it closed. I knew then that my collecting days were over.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That said, I should probably confess that I recently did a
search on eBay for Cindy Sherman. Six items came up, five of them
books of her photographs, the sixth a profile of her that appeared
in The New Yorker last spring. I wondered why anyone would want to
buy a copy of a magazine that was neither new enough to be timely
nor old enough to be an antique, but my bafflement did not prevent
me from placing a bid: 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I was outbid. The article went for 55 cents. So no,
alas, I did not get the Cindy Sherman profile, though it still
pleases me to think that I played a small but decisive role in
inflating the market for articles about art. For right now, as you
are reading this, I am cutting this article out of the newspaper.
Look for it later today on eBay.

BANGLES' TALE TO BE TOLD ON VH1 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The four members of the '80s rock band the Bangles last week
announced their reunion. At a Los Angeles press conference, the
group laid out plans for a 10-date tour in September, to be
followed by recording sessions for the first Bangles album since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangles broke up a year after that album, tired of the grind
of constant touring and tired of the in-studio bickering. But most
of all, they tired of defending their unity as the media, and to
some extent the fans, saw them as one singer with a three-member
backing group.
</P>
<P>
   The unity issue finally drove the band apart, according to an
upcoming installment of the VH1 documentary series ``Behind The
Music,'' scheduled to debut Sunday at 11 a.m. and be repeated at 9
p.m. and 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangles were not the first group to go their separate ways
at the height of their success _ just think of the Beatles, the
Eagles or Led Zeppelin _ but they were the first all-woman group to
do so. The breakup fueled speculation in a male-driven business
about insecurities, backstabbing and enormous clashes of ego.
</P>
<P>
   All more or less true, according to ``Behind the Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Peterson, Susanna Hoffs, Debbi Peterson and Michael Steele
were veterans of the Los Angeles club scene when they came together
through a shared love of the vocal harmonies of '60s groups such as
the Byrds and the Mamas and the Papas, and the short, to-the-point
songwriting of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the band _ first called The Bangs _ put out a single on
its own independent label and got it played on local radio.
</P>
<P>
   Rhythm guitarist Susanna Hoffs, who sang lead on the single, had
led a sheltered life with her wealthy parents in a trendy West
Hollywood neighborhood, and the Bangs' first live show was the
first time she had ever performed in front of a rock 'n' roll
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Vicki (lead guitar) and Debbi Peterson (drums), on the
other hand, had been gigging around Southern California clubs since
they were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Bassist Michael Steele joined the group after the name was
changed to the Bangles. She had been the first singer and bassist
for the Runaways, the all-girl teen band assembled via audition by
a male entrepreneur. Joan Jett was that band's lead guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangles' first Columbia Records album, ``All Over the
Place'' (1984), was a favorite on college radio but didn't yield a
hit single. Each member sang an equal amount of the songs. Their
harmonies were thick and clever, and gave the album a cool,
appealing retro feel.
</P>
<P>
   It was Prince who gave the band the keys to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Smitten by Hoffs' sloe-eyed beauty in an early Bangles video, he
gave them a song to record, which he wanted Hoffs to sing: ``Manic
Monday.'' Although several band members didn't care much for the
song, it became a huge hit and catapulted the Bangles into the
public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the band, a rumor went around that Prince _
then one of the biggest stars in music _ was dating Hoffs. It
wasn't true, but it sold records, and it made the Peterson sisters
and Steele uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffs became a media darling. She was perceived as the Bangles'
``lead singer,'' even though she vehemently denied it every time
she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   The band's first No. 1 single, ``Walk Like an Egyptian,'' was
anything but celebratory, because Debbi Peterson didn't play or
sing on it, having been voted off the song by the band's producer.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Behind the Music,'' the Bangles never recovered
from the ``Susanna is the star'' syndrome, and their second
chart-topping single, Hoffs' treacly ballad ``Eternal Flame,''
sealed their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in management, record producers and other essentials
made things worse, and by the end, the Bangles say, the tension was
so thick you could cut it with a drumstick. Steele was physically
ill, and Hoffs took the opportunity to tell the others she wanted
out.
</P>
<P>
   After their acrimonious breakup, Hoffs launched a solo career,
which flopped, and after she married ``Austin Powers'' director M.
Jay Roach, and following the birth of their two sons, her
priorities changed. She began making overtures to the other
ex-Bangles about re-forming.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Not all wounds had healed, but they all
remembered with fondness the ease and beauty of their harmonies.
And the fun they'd had before it all went sour.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they say, it's different. With hindsight, they know
to take things slow, and agree on every, minute point. And they are
adamant that nothing _ money, ego, management _ will come between
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Music'' remains one of TV's best-researched and
best-written documentary programs. Although the Bangles' story is
all too familiar in rock 'n' roll, it's told here with style, good
taste and an excellent soundtrack.

   If you've ever admired the contrasting colors of a western-style
shirt or the fringed, embroidered splendor of a classic
country-and-western singer's jacket, check out ``Hillbilly
Hollywood: The Origins of Country &AMP; Western Style'' (Rizzoli,
$39.95). It features wonderful historic photos, many full-page, of
the clothes and the musicians who wore them _ Roy Rogers, the
Maddox Brothers, Lefty Frizzell, Johnny Cash _ as well as an oral
history of the style.

   I love Bobbi Brown makeup, I really do. And I know that if you
are a 15-year-old girl (or the parent of one), you probably won't
be able to resist getting a copy of ``Bobbi Brown Teenage Beauty:
Everything You Need To Look Pretty, Natural, Sexy and Awesome''
(Cliff Street Books, $25). Still, it's a little creepy. Call me a
reactionary, but some of these girls just have on too much makeup.
Beauty School 101 features a girl with major frosty pink eye
shadow, and a lot of the makeover girls look like slightly older
JonBenets _ beautifully done faces, but a tad inappropriate for
their ages. Brown does get points for peppering her text with
go-girl affirmations (i.e. Be exactly who you are! Supermodels are
freaks of nature!) and including sections on stuff like braces and
proms.

   The thought of adding one more thing to your schedule probably
makes you want to run screaming from the room. Breathe easy. What's
suggested by spa guru Peggy Wynne Borgman in ``Four Seasons of
Inner and Outer Beauty: Rituals and Recipes for Well-Being
Throughout the Year'' (Broadway Books, $17.95) are activities
designed to help you cope with the stresses of everyday life.
Borgman's book is a pleasant synthesis of ideas for skin and body
care, healthful recipes and ways to incorporate soothing Eastern
meditation and other rituals into your life. There's nothing too
surprising in here (lighten up your moisturizer in the summer; eat
hearty stews when it's cold), but ``Four Seasons'' is still
refreshing to read _ and a much-healthier stress reliever than a
pint of Ben &AMP;Jerry's.

&HT;     CHENEY WAS A TOUGH BOSS AT THE PENTAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 7, 1991, with preparations in high gear for
war against Iraq, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cleared his
schedule to render judgment on a top-priority matter that had
nothing to do with Saddam Hussein but which struck at the heart of
the defense chief's efforts to manage the unwieldy Pentagon
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was whether to continue with plans to build a
super-secret stealth aircraft, the A-12 attack jet, the Navy's
version of the radar-evading B-2 bomber. The A-12 was a $57 billion
effort in disarray _ not a single jet had been built but the
project was more than a year behind schedule and at least $1
billion over budget.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last-minute threats of layoffs from the manufacturers
and pleas from the Navy that the plane was its top priority and was
needed to replace older jets, Cheney killed the A-12 program. His
action stunned the military and sent a shockwave through the
defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon chief said he made his decision because ``no one
could tell me exactly how much more money it will cost to keep this
program going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot spend the taxpayers' money wisely, we will not
spend it,'' he said.The decision had a personal dimension to it as
well. Only months before, Navy leaders and contractors had given
the defense chief glowing assurances the project was proceeding
apace, assurances that Cheney then relayed to Congress. He had put
his own credibility on the line with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But when Cheney found out that the Navy and contractors had
misled him, he ``was ticked,'' said Sean O'Keefe, then the
Pentagon's top financial official. ``He couldn't believe it, that
everybody had duped themselves into believing the A-12 was
salvageable.''
</P>
<P>
   The grisly saga of the demise of the A-12 underscores a Cheney
trait that was in full bloom during his tenure as President Bush's
defense secretary from 1989 through 1993: He was willing to make
unpopular decisions and to exert civilian control over the
military.
</P>
<P>
   His action earned high praise from the New York Times editorial
page _ what many conservatives view as the pinnacle of the liberal
establishment _ which dubbed him a ``hero'' for his ``medal-winning
act of courage'' in killing the A-12 program.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also defied political stereotypes. Here was a
conservative Republican ordering the death of the most expensive
weapons program ever terminated by the Pentagon. He went on to
eliminate many other weapons programs while choreographing historic
post-Cold War reductions to U.S. defense budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney _ a former six-term congressman from Wyoming _ was named
Tuesday by Texas Gov. George W. Bush as his vice presidential
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Cheney began challenging
long-standing U.S. defense policies that guided military spending
and assumed an all-out war in Europe and on the high seas against
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by then-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. William Crowe
and later Gen. Colin Powell, Cheney prodded the military brass to
create the first post-Cold War strategy to focus on possible
regional conflicts rather than a colossal war against the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   One result was that Cheney oversaw a sweeping reduction in the
armed forces, paring the military by some 19.4 percent from a force
of 2.2 million in 1989 to 1.7 million by 1993. He also oversaw
large cuts in defense spending, which has fallen over 40 percent
since the end of the Cold War, with most of the cuts designed by
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   He shut down production lines for the Navy's F-14 and the Air
Force's F-15 jets, the M1-A1 Abrams tank, an Army helicopter
upgrade, the Marine Corp's V-22 Osprey aircraft (later restored by
Congress), the Seawolf submarine and a Navy submarine-hunting
plane.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that angered many in Congress, Cheney proposed
shutting numerous military bases to save money. The reduced size of
the military no longer justified the excess bases, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Congress created the much-dreaded base closure
commission, a non-partisan body that selected bases for
termination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney was the guy who got the base-closure process up and
going, and people didn't like it,'' said John Hamre, a former
senior aide to Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who at the time was the
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to credit Dick Cheney. That was a tough
decision,'' said Hamre, who later became deputy defense secretary
in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also took bold personnel decisions involving top Air
Force generals, signaling his commitment to civilian control of the
military. In March 1989, shortly after taking over the Pentagon,
Cheney publicly rebuked then-Air Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch
for discussing with Congress possible changes to the
administration's strategic weapons mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gen. Welch was free-lancing,'' Cheney explained at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1990, Cheney fired Welch's successor, Air Force Chief of
Staff Michael Dugan, for telling reporters about plans for the U.S.
air war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was a ``skillful defense secretary,'' Hamre added. In the
months leading up to the Persian Gulf War, Cheney was particularly
adept at making the administration's case before Congress for going
to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He effectively brought Congress along. That was a tremendous
accomplishment,'' Hamre said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: WEB SITE OFFERS FOREIGN EXCHANGE DATA FOR
TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: ``Yesterday'' in lede need not be construed as referring to a
specific day.) 
(duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a conversational icebreaker for those interminable hours
that you may be spending in airport lounges as this summer of
endless flight delays grinds on: Did you know that 10 Bolivian
bolivianos got you 3.4 Bulgarian levs at the money-changing
counters yesterday? How about that Cyprus pound, one for $1.62. Or
that Indonesian rupiah _ 9,100 for $1.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of detailed foreign exchange information, which I
guarantee will instantly trump any unwelcome lounge colloquies on
the mind-numbing subject of someone else's frequent-flier miles,
used to be somewhat inconvenient to obtain with any precision and
convenience. But smart international business travelers have
recently been discovering a Web site that offers current foreign
exchange data in exhaustive detail. It's www.oanda.com, extensively
revamped last spring by Oanda Corp., an Internet company that was
spun off four years ago by Olsen &AMP; Associates, the Swiss
econometrics firm.
</P>
<P>
   Oanda.com's most useful feature is called the FX (for foreign
exchange) Cheat Sheet, which allows a user to find a current
exchange rate by clicking on one currency and comparing it with any
of 173 other world currencies. The chart can be printed out. You
also can instantly find out what the historical exchange rates have
been for any of those currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Growing numbers of business people are making multi-destination
international trips. When they come home, they confront the
headaches of filing an expense account that needs to figure, say,
how much that 400,000-lira-a-night hotel room in Milan actually
cost. Answer: one recent day, $194 ; just 60 days ago, $187.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a business traveler, it was always kind of a nightmare
to figure out the exchange rates, especially if you didn't do your
expenses right away,'' said Timothy Kelly, Oanda's chief executive.
``You'd be, `What the heck was the rate two weeks ago or a month
ago, when I had a thousand dollars of expenses in Milan, and some
more in Frankfurt, Paris and London.' It could get a little
hairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hairy even for the beetle-brows in the accounting department, by
the way. ``Those fluctuations can total 10 or 20 percent during an
extended trip abroad,'' he said. ``On extended trips abroad, a 10
percent differential can add up to real money. It's a matter of not
shortchanging yourself and not overcharging your company.''
</P>
<P>
   Oanda said that its currency-converter technology was licensed
by 13,000 clients, many of whom use it on their own Web sites.
Among them are travel and airline sites, and even retail merchants
who can rig their online catalogs with Oanda's software to
instantly display prices in various currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, I am one of those travelers for whom even the
simplest permutations of foreign-exchange remain invincibly
unfathomable. In a long conversation the other day, Kelly managed
to keep my attention when he told me that Oanda is about to join up
with Thomas Cook Ltd., the travel and foreign exchange services
company, to offer an online service for ordering foreign cash and
having it sent quickly to your home. This way, you can have a
modest stash of local currency in your pocket when you hit the
foreign airport.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks and travel service companies already offer similar
foreign cash delivery. But the Oanda site had 25 million hits in
June, and has about four million users, according to WebTrends, an
Internet traffic measurement concern. That's a lot of potential
customers who might be persuaded to push a little button and order
cash, Kelly suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it dangerous to send cash through the mail?'' I asked
him. ``Nothing that would dissuade us from doing this business,''
Kelly replied. He said that the cash would be sent either by
priority mail or, for an extra charge, by express or overnight
shipping _ in envelopes that don't advertise the fact that they
contain loot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outer envelope is of course the generic delivery service
envelope,'' he said. ``It doesn't have a big emblazoned logo like,
Oanda the Currency Site, which would basically be a steal-me
sticker.''
</P>
<P>
   Having thus reassured me on a simple financial point, Kelly
began to outline Oanda's ambitious plans to one day soon become an
``online trading interface for individuals,'' and a
``business-to-business exchange service'' linking importers and
exporters and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three to six months' time we will be a fully integrated
FX trading hub,'' he said, adding that Oanda's online
``penetration, traction and velocity'' will aid in the
establishment of a new electronic marketplace for foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are people, including some reporters, who can
fathom the implications of this. Me, I was listening politely and
taking notes, while at the same time fiddling on my computer with
the Oanda Web site.
</P>
<P>
   I can report that it has many entertaining travel features
besides those currency conversion charts. For example, you can
click on ``Temperature'' and convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice
versa. Another chart has shoe-size comparisons: American, British
and Continental, men's and women's. Another has those old
back-of-the-composition-book favorites like charts for converting
from meters to miles and grams to ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, did you know that a British hectare contains
107,639.10416709722 square feet? &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most people who buy Parmigiano-Reggiano never give a
thought to the variations in the way it tastes. Even I always
assumed the flavor differences had to do with the aging process or
the quality of the cheese itself. Parmigiano, after all, always
looks the same. Unlike Cheddars and chevres, it doesn't wear a
brand name or come in different shapes. It's one cheese, all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Or so I thought until last week, when I tasted
Parmigiano-Reggiano produced in fall, winter, spring and summer
side by side. I was amazed at how distinctive each one was: sharp
or sweet or herbaceous, or just intensely buttery like aged cheese.
One was not better than another _ they were just different.
</P>
<P>
   For only a few weeks in July, DiPalo's Italian specialty market
in lower Manhattan's Little Italy is able to offer these handmade
cheeses of all seasons, each two or more years old. The owner, Lou
DiPalo, and a few others like Richard Rogers of Rogers
International Ltd., an importer of specialty foods in Portland,
Maine, make a point of searching out cheeses from certain seasons
and celebrating their individuality. But they are the exception.
Each year, the differences in what is essentially the same cheese
become harder to distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when Americans are becoming more interested in
nuances in cheese, the people in charge of guarding the sanctity of
Parmigiano-Reggiano are working hard to standardize it, to erase
the variations that different seasons bring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, my tasting session at DiPalo's was eye-opening. The
seasonal differences in the cow's milk seemed very definitely to
affect the flavor of the finished cheese.
</P>
<P>
   When the spring cheese, with a slightly pink cast to its
delicate yellow center, was cracked open, its delightfully
herbaceous quality perfumed the air, though the fragrance
dissipated quickly. To me the spring cheese had the most complex
flavor. It was drier and more crumbly than the other cheeses. The
fall Parmigiano was rich and full-flavored, with a bit of bite at
the back of the mouth, the most balanced and polished of the
cheeses. The winter, which is lightest in color, was the most
delicate and sweet, with a nice mouth feel because it had more
butterfat. DiPalo provided two summer cheeses, both different, one
from the hills and one from the plains. These had the deepest
golden color, and the one from the mountains had the texture of
spring, the taste of summer: sharp with an almost acidic afterbite.
</P>
<P>
   What they all had in common was a flaky, slightly grainy
texture, the famous crunch that comes from the crystallization of
the amino acids in the milk as the cheese ages. The older the
cheese, the more grainy and crunchy. But a thin sliver of any of
the cheeses, held in the mouth, seems to melt.
</P>
<P>
   While the more pungent Parmigianos are better for filling
tortellini or ravioli and for grating, the others are better thinly
shaved on top of other ingredients or eaten in chunks out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano, the industry
group that certifies the authenticity of the cheeses, acknowledges
the existence of the seasonal variations that DiPalo celebrates and
I perceived, but says they are not as great as they once were
because the feeding of the cows has been standardized.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium insists that most differences in taste are due
more to variations in producers. In 1955 the consortium set down
regulations governing the way the cheese must be made. Those who
don't agree with the consortium say that while it may have gotten
rid of the really poor cheeses, it has also gotten rid of the
really great ones.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1984, authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano could be made only
between April 15 and Nov. 15. That made from November to April was
called vernengo. But changes in the breed of cow, the types of feed
and the method of feeding meant that Parmigiano could be made 365
days a year, a fact that the consortium officially acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a few exceptions in the hills of the region where
the cheese is produced, very few cows are out in pastures grazing.
Instead, special grasses are grown and fed to them in the barns
where they are confined. Because the feed is the same for almost
all the cows, the cheese is far more uniform than anything
available before the regulations were set down.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many professionals can discern differences. Robert
Kaufelt, who owns Murray's Cheese in Greenwich Village, says he has
come to understand that the seasons do make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a tasting, and winter cheese is better than summer,'' he
said. Lou Todaro, who owns Todaro Brothers, buys only winter
Parmigiano-Reggiano, which he also thinks is the best.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Rogers of Rogers International buys spring and fall
cheeses only. ``We deal with cows that graze only on natural
grasses,'' he said. ``We emphasize a very narrow niche.'' Rogers
has also been buying some of the very small production from the
Razza Reggiana breed of cows, which used to provide the milk for
all Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. The milk of the Razza Reggiana, or
vacca rossa (red cow), is much richer and higher in protein, and
the cheese can be aged much longer than that from the current herds
of Frisona Italiana, which are the progeny of Dutch Holsteins. Red
cow Parmigiano is also about 80 percent more expensive, Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even chefs are often aware of seasonal differences. At Frank, a
trattoria in the East Village, Frank Prisinzano serves a plate of
two to four different seasonal Parmigiano-Reggianos with figs,
peaches or pears. And at Peasant, an Italian restaurant in Nolita,
Frank DeCarlo prefers the spring and winter cheeses and matches
them with food.
</P>
<P>
   Max McCalman, who is in charge of the cheeses at Picholine,
prefers the summer cheeses, although he finds any
Parmigiano-Reggiano a hard sell on his cheese board because diners
presume to know the cheese already.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario Batali, the chef at Babbo, does not see much
difference among the cheeses. ``In a blind tasting I can't tell
which season is which,'' he said. ``Spring cheese tastes more
herbaceous, but that's all I'm prepared to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Parmigiano-Reggiano, a raw milk cheese, has been made for at
least 700 years in a region of northern Italy that consists of the
provinces of Parma, Modena, Reggio Emilia and parts of Bologna and
Mantua. The district where Parmigiano is made has about 9,000
dairies and about 600 cheese makers. The only ingredients in the
cheese are milk, rennet and salt. The entire rind of each wheel of
authentic Parmigiano is imprinted with the name as the cheese is
being shaped, as well as the month and the year. Cheeses are aged
18 months to three years, sometimes longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but good things to say about the consorzio that
protects the quality of Parmigiano-Reggiano,'' Pamela Sheldon Johns
writes in ``Italian Food Artisans'' (Chronicle Books, $24.95).
``But with big business comes standardization. More and more
dairies are forming cooperatives, and the independent
dairyman-cheese maker is becoming rare. With the disappearance of
the individual artisan goes some of the distinct differences
evident in the past, such as floral qualities in a mountain spring
cheese, or the rich, pungent character in a plains-produced autumn
cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johns goes on to say that fortunately, variations still persist,
because it is impossible to standardize artisanal products so they
always look and taste exactly the same, like Velveeta.
</P>
<P>
   In an introduction to a 1998 cookbook produced by the
consortium, Lynne Rossetto Kasper, an expert on Italian food, says:
``The secrets of Parmigiano-Reggiano's quality are found in its
inconsistencies. In a world of mass-produced sameness this cheese
is made by hand, usually only 8 or 12 wheels at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Topography also plays a role,'' she says, and ``cheeses from
the hills and cheeses from the plains are never quite alike.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Kasper was not quite so
complimentary, contending that the consortium had narrowed the
range of quality. ``Before 10 or 15 years ago there was lousy
cheese, middle-road cheese, high-good cheese and extraordinary
cheese,'' she said. ``In the '70s, it was not unusual to taste
something pretty special, and it was easy to find. The consorzio
got rid of the stuff at the bottom and discouraged the
extraordinary stuff, concentrating on the high good. They saw a
market that couldn't tell the difference between high good and
extraordinary. I think the quality has definitely gone down, and I
think it was stupid, because it commands a premium price and there
are so many alternative cheeses for people to buy today.''
</P>
<P>
   But the consortium maintains that standardization is necessary
to improve the bottom line. ``Americans and northern Europeans
equate consistency with quality,'' said Nancy Radke, the director
of communications for the consortium in the United States. ``It is
counter to artisan products, but in this industrialized world this
is a fact of life. There is a certain sadness that some of that
variation is lost, and with the European Union rules for hygiene,
cheese like this will become an endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Zannoni, a sensory analyst for the department of quality
control for the consortium, defends the standardization. ``The
consorzio has reached a reasonably good quality,'' he said. ``A
portion of the production is considered very good. I'm not sure we
had extraordinary cheese before. I think we had very good cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less variation between the seasons because of the
feeding standardizations. There is still an effect of the seasons
and of the ripening, but it is less than before. The variations are
connected more with the cheese factory than the seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPalo, however, maintains that the seasons are the primary
reason for the differences and that the cheeses he chooses
celebrate the differences. ``I know,'' he said, ``because I have
cut thousands of pounds of cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPalo, whose family has been selling Italian delicacies since
1925, is happy to acknowledge that he is a dinosaur. ``I'm very
traditional,'' he said, ``and I've taken it upon myself to search
out seasonal changes. It's an art that requires a lot of time and
patience on my part and the part of those who buy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement to bring back the vacca rossa may be to his
benefit. Since 1990 a group of 10 breeders have been making cheese
exclusively with this milk, and DiPalo is expecting a shipment of
their cheese shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consorzio is making a big mistake conforming to the
plastic world,'' he said. ``They are telling you this is what you
like, this is what you are going to eat, but I'm going to continue
to look for cheeses with different characteristics.''

   SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER: A Quartet to Make Vivaldi Sing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By MARIAN BURROS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to experiment with seasonal variations in
Parmigiano-Reggiano, here are tips from Lou DiPalo of DiPalo's and
Frank DeCarlo, the owner and chef of Peasant:
</P>
<P>
   Top buttered steamed asparagus with shaved spring
Parmigiano-Reggiano, and run it under the broiler to melt and brown
the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Top paper-thin slices of bres-aola with shaved winter
Parmigiano-Reggiano on a bed of arugula; drizzle with extra virgin
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Add grated summer Parmigiano-Reggiano to a frittata with onions
and peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Top very thin slices of prosciutto with slightly thicker slices
of winter Parmigiano-Reggiano over baby dandelion greens, and serve
with fresh figs drizzled with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   As for complementary wines, DiPalo recommends Chianti or merlot
for fall Parmigiano-Reggiano, prosecco or pinot bianco from Friuli
for winter cheese, Dolcetto d'Alba for spring cheese. Summer cheese
is not good for eating out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGING A CHEESE BY ITS RIND
</P>
<P>
   By MARIAN BURROS
</P>
<P>
   Even if you cannot choose Parmigiano-Reggiano by the season,
here are some rules for getting the best available and storing it
properly:
</P>
<P>
   Look for the date and year the cheese was made, imprinted on the
rind. If the rind has ``X'' marks, the cheese has been rejected by
regulators because it did not meet their standards.
</P>
<P>
   Never buy grated Parmigiano-Reggiano: It loses its flavor. If
you grate cheese, use it within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Buy cheese that has been cracked into wedges, rather than
sliced, which changes the texture.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese should have a crisp but not very dry texture; the color
is not indicative of quality or taste.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for cheese that has been stored either at the proper aging
temperature or in a refrigerated case. At home, remove the plastic
wrap and let the cheese sit at room temperature for a few minutes;
then rewrap it with plastic film and cover with aluminum foil or
parchment paper. Change the wrap every time the cheese is used, or
at least once a week. Keep the cheese in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   If a piece of cheese has become old and dry, wrap it in a
moistened cheesecloth, cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate for
a day. Then, rewrap in plastic. If mold develops on the outside,
clean it off; otherwise, it will bore through the cheese and spoil
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the rinds to add flavor to minestrone or chicken
soup, wash the outside first.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Veteran British actors Patrick Stewart, Ian
McKellen and Christopher Lee have become franchise players.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging in age from 60 to 78, the venerable thespians have
scored recurring roles in multiple sci-fi and fantasy film series,
including ``Star Wars,'' ``Star Trek,'' ``The Lord of the Rings''
and ``X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 60, enjoyed lengthy stage careers with both the Royal
Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre before coming to
Los Angeles in 1987 for the role of Jean-Luc Picard in television's
``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Stewart has continued the role
in three ``Star Trek'' films, with plans for a fourth to be
released Thanksgiving 2001.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Stewart has assumed the identity of ``X-Men's''
wheelchair-bound telepath, Professor Charles Xavier. The big-screen
adaptation of the classic Marvel comics series made $99.3 million
in its first two weekends, ensuring a succession of sequels.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is contracted for at least one more ``X-Men'' film, as
is McKellen, who plays his evil nemesis, Magneto.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, 61, is considered one of contemporary theater's finest
classical actors, particularly for his interpretations of
Shakespeare. Knighted in 1990, McKellen won a Tony Award in 1981
for his portrayal of Salieri in the Broadway production of
``Amadeus.'' He earned a 1998 Academy Award nomination for best
actor for ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to playing Magneto, McKellen will star as Gandalf
the wizard in Peter Jackson's forthcoming three-part adaptation of
J.R.R. Tolkien's ``The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary horror-film star Lee, 78, will play opposite McKellen
as the evil wizard Saruman. The first film is slated to arrive in
theaters December 2001. The second and third installments are
scheduled for December 2002 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whose extensive Hammer Films credits include ``The Curse of
Frankenstein'' and ``The Horror of Dracula,'' also will appear as a
``charismatic separatist'' in George Lucas' second ``Star Wars''
prequel, now being filmed in Australia for a summer 2002 release.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief look at the status of each of the four film
franchises, from their official Web sites and other related
sources:
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR TREK''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Logan has been tapped to write the script for the 10th film
in the series, officially known as ``Star Trek X.'' Logan's
previous credits include 1999's ``Bats'' and work on the
screenplays for ``Gladiator'' and ``Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Rick Berman told ``Star Trek Communicator'' magazine
that it will be ``a very action-oriented story that revolves around
a remarkable villain. A higher percentage of this film will take
place in outer space than in our previous films.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Frakes, who directed the last two ``Star Trek'' films,
in addition to co-starring as Cmdr. William Riker, may not be
available to direct the next installment. Frakes has a sci-fi
project, ``Clockstoppers,'' in development at Paramount. If that
film gets a green light, it could head into production the same
time as Star Trek X, according to Cinescape Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I would just be an actor, I guess, in the ``Star Trek''
movie,'' Frakes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR WARS''
</P>
<P>
   The second Star Wars prequel began shooting on June 26 _ three
years to the day that ``Episode I `` started its shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Hales (''The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'') is the
co-screenwriter for the second chapter in the Star Wars saga, with
director Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is shooting ``Star Wars: Episode II'' using digital
cameras in place of film for most of the movie's live-action
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden Christensen, a 19-year-old Canadian actor most recently
seen in the Fox Family Channel series ``Higher Ground,'' has been
selected to play Anakin Skywalker in ``Episodes II'' and ``III,''
filling the role that was played by 8-year-old Jake Lloyd in ``The
Phantom Menace'' and 82-year-old Sebastian Shaw in ``Return of the
Jedi.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning cast members include Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi),
Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala), Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu),
Frank Oz (Yoda), Ian McDiarmid (Senator Palpatine), Anthony Daniels
(C-3PO) and, alas, Ahmed Best (Jar Jar Binks).
</P>
<P>
   Besides Lee, ``NYPD Blue'''s Jimmy Smits joins the cast as
Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, a character briefly mentioned in
``Star Wars: Episode IV _ A New Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE LORD OF THE RINGS''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is shooting his three-part adaptation of Tolkien's epic
fantasy simultaneously, with New Zealand substituting for
Middle-earth. The three films have a combined budget of $130
million. Filming began Oct. 11, 1999 and continues through March
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and writing partner Frances Walsh adapted Tolkien's
trilogy along with Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair. Jackson
and Walsh earned an Oscar nomination for ``Heavenly Creatures.''
Directed by Jackson, that film launched Kate Winslet's career.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McKellen and Lee, ``The Lord of the Rings''' cast
includes Elijah Wood (Frodo Baggins), Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins),
Sean Astin (Sam Gamgee), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Cate Blanchett
(Galadriel), Liv Tyler (Arwen), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), John
Rhys-Davies (Gimli), Sean Bean (Boromir) and Orlando Bloom
(Legolas).
</P>
<P>
   The character of Gollum will be computer-generated, with a voice
supplied by Andy Serkis (''Topsy-Turvy''). Details on how the dark
lord, Sauron, is represented are sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the characters will speak in British accents. Jackson
also plans to utilize the different languages described in
Tolkien's books, with subtitles for those who don't speak Elvish.
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema has announced a major merchandising agreement
with Marvel Enterprises to supply ``Lord of the Rings `` toys and
products.
</P>
<P>
   A 36-year-old man was arrested in the theft of film clips of
Gollum and other secret special effects from Jackson's studio. He
purportedly tried to post them on the Internet. After a monthlong
probe, the man was charged with making a VHS copy of film footage
and money-laundering. The suspect's name has not been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-MEN''
</P>
<P>
   ``After a well-earned rest, the producers will regroup with Fox
next week to plan the ``X-Men'' sequel,'' McKellen reported this
week on his Web site, www.McKellen.com. ``Patrick (Stewart) and I
are contracted to take part.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``X-Men'' director Bryan Singer and producer Tom
DeSanto have yet to sign for another film, according to Cinescape
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The mutant heroes enjoyed an X-cellent debut, making $54.5
million in the film's first weekend. It was the biggest July
opening ever, as well as the sixth-highest weekend gross and the
biggest nonsequel opening of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Singer has hinted that the next film may escalate the battle
between humanity and mutants with the addition of giant, robotic
Sentinels.

 &HT;    Q: My unfinished basement has many exposed cold water pipes
running through and between the overhead beams.
 &HT;    During hot humid weather these pipes ``sweat'' and often drip
onto the basement floor and on furniture stored there.
 &HT;    Is there something you can suggest that I can do to prevent this
from happening?
 &HT;    A: The problem can be eliminated by covering all the pipes with
foam insulation.
 &HT;    This comes in a tubular, sleeve form that is designed for this
purpose and is sold in home centers and hardware stores.
 &HT;    Available in various sizes to fit different diameter pipes, the
easiest kind to install is the version that comes in sleeves which
are slit open lengthwise to simplify fitting them over existing
pipes.
 &HT;    These have self-adhesive seams, making them easy to seal
lengthwise along each seam.
 &HT;    The joints where individual lengths meet are sealed by wrapping
with duct tape or a seam-sealing tape available at the same store.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We have a large porch awning that was custom-made and
consists of a fabric tightly stretched over aluminum strips that
support it.
 &HT;    After three years the material has stretched so much that the
awning is now leaking at the seams and allows water to drip through
onto my carpet and furniture.
 &HT;    Is there any way I can seal or waterproof these areas and
preserve the awning?
 &HT;    A: Most marine supply stores sell a waterproofing sealer for use
on boat covers and awnings.
 &HT;    Although I cannot say for sure, it is possible that this might
work on your awning. At least it is worth a try.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Several of my storm windows collect moisture on the inside of
the storm window _ between it and the prime window.
 &HT;    So much accumulates that it actually runs down and has caused
some wood rot at the bottom of one window frame. This only happens
on some of the windows, not on all of them.
 &HT;    Short of removing the storm windows, what can I do about this
problem?
 &HT;    A: The usual reason for this is a lack of adequate weather
stripping around the inside windows, at least those where this
occurs.
 &HT;    Warm moist air from inside the house seeps out around the edges
of the window sash and gets trapped in the space between the two
windows.
 &HT;    When this moist air comes in contact with the cold glass of the
outside storm window, the moisture condenses on the glass to form
drops of water that eventually run down the glass.
 &HT;    Increasing the quality or amount of weather stripping around
these windows will prevent moist air escaping from the inside, thus
eliminating the condensation problem.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Ever since I installed a new ball cock inlet valve unit in my
toilet flush tank we notice that just before the tank is full and
the inlet valve shuts off, it makes a loud hissing noise.
 &HT;    Can you tell me what could be causing this?
 &HT;    A: Some brands of ball cock are much quieter than others, so it
is possible that by installing a different model you will eliminate
this nuisance.
 &HT;    It's also possible that this can be caused by too much water
pressure in your system.
 &HT;    There should be a shut-off valve on the intake line under your
tank, so try closing this down a little _ it should help.

&HT;     SENATE UNVEILS INTERNET PRIVACY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain and other leading lawmakers
proposed legislation Wednesday that could dramatically increase the
privacy rights of consumers using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, business should inform consumers in an open manner
how they treat personal information and give consumers meaningful
choices as to how that information is used,'' McCain, R-Ariz., told
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, was joined by
Sens. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., John Kerry, D-Mass., and Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, known as the ``Consumer Privacy Enhancement Act,''
would require Web sites to post a notice describing:
</P>
<P>
   _ What companies are collecting information via that Web site;
</P>
<P>
   _ The types of information collected;
</P>
<P>
   _ How the information will be used;
</P>
<P>
   _ What security measures are in place to protect information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bill will arm consumers with information so they feel
confident they are making the right choices to protect their
personal information, and our approach does so without shutting
down the industry's potential for growth or choking the free flow
of information on the Internet,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Web sites failing to abide by the law would be
fined $22,000 per violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surfing the Web shouldn't require you to share your life story
with the world,'' Boxer said. ``Internet surfers should know
exactly how companies will use the personal information submitted
to Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bill became law, for example, an on-line bookseller would
be required to let customers know that it is collecting information
on what they are buying, and then selling that information to
advertisers or other electronic retailers.
</P>
<P>
   With the issue of Internet privacy registering in the polls as a
top concern among Americans, Democrats and Republicans have been
pushing to find legislation that would reassure the public that
private information will not be misused.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen Internet privacy bills are being considered in
the House. In addition, several bills in the Senate contain
provisions for increasing Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Both the presidential hopefuls, Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore, have expressed support for a privacy law covering
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The debate generally divides along three lines:
</P>
<P>
   _ Should consumers have to ``opt out,'' informing companies that
they would rather not have their personal information divulged
elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should on-line companies have to ask permission first,
requiring customers to ``opt in'' to a consent agreement that frees
their information for use in the public domain?
</P>
<P>
   _ Or should the current system, in which information moves
through cyberspace virtually unrestricted, remain intact?
</P>
<P>
   Direct-marketing companies have always kept dossiers on consumer
habits in order to target people for specific products and
services. The Internet makes that process much easier and more
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who browse the Web now have their habits tracked,
thanks to small software files known as ``cookies'' that are
transferred from certain Web sites to the consumer's computer hard
drive while the user is on line.
</P>
<P>
   The cookies create a roadmap of the user's on-line browsing
habits, allowing companies to compile information on what the
consumer is interested in looking at and buying. Although cookies
can be removed from a user's hard drive, people who intentionally
disable their computer's ability to accept cookies are often denied
access to some Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The information gathered by using cookies allows advertisers to
know which users would likely buy their products. As a result, a
great deal is at stake for on-line companies, some of which have
based their success on the ability to gather consumer information
freely in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Many leading on-line companies, aware of concerns about
confidence, say they already take steps to ensure privacy and see
political motivations behind the current flurry of privacy
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Mahler, vice president of the Computer and Communications
Industry Association, a Washington-based consortium of Internet
companies, said many politicians are ``rushing'' to pass
legislation without considering the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the vast majority of Internet sites are free, but
they rely heavily on the money they make gathering and selling
marketing information on consumers,'' he said. ``If you take that
away, many Web sites will either go out of business or be forced to
start charging fees, something I don't think consumers would be
very happy about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahler said on-line companies are developing their own
regulations that will ``balance'' privacy rights with the needs of
Web sites to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel that people who understand the industry should be
the ones to come up with the rules,'' he said.

 &HT;    Sanchez would put a new face on 2002
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the rhetoric politicians employ about change, they are
skittish as cattle before a storm when the status quo is truly
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Tony Sanchez gubernatorial candidacy has local
politicos scrambling to rewrite their scenarios of the state's
future. Sanchez, a wealthy Laredo lawyer and businessman reportedly
worth $600 million, represents a threat to the establishments of
both Democratic and Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a Latino who doesn't have to ask anybody's permission to
run. Here's a Latino who won't be impressed with lectures about
electability and the need to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   He's rich, and he's ready now. And he's not the kind of guy to
be overly concerned with who likes it. And that's what has
Democrats and Republicans alike reaching for the antacid tablets.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sanchez hasn't said publicly that he will run, he's left
tracks that Jose Feliciano could follow. He was traveling in
California last week, but close friends say that barring a
catastrophe, he will be running for the Democratic nomination for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is a headache for Republicans and Democrats for
the same reason: He is a wealthy businessman who should be able to
excite Hispanic voters who have not voted in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a businessman (banking and oil and gas, among
other interests), Republicans will have a tough time depicting him
as wild-eyed liberal. After all, he has and continues to be a
generous financial backer of Gov. George W. Bush, who appointed
Sanchez to the University of Texas Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a businessman and a contributor to the governor,
liberal Democrats _ particularly the ones who love to tell Latinos
what's good for them _ will grumble that he isn't ``pure'' enough.
Or should that read ``poor'' enough?
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, though. A vato from the barrio isn't going to be
governor. That's a competition where you have to bring lots money _
yours or somebody else's _ to play.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, a Sanchez candidacy would be a radical
departure from business as usual for both parties. Republicans
realize that growth of the Hispanic population in Texas means they
have to reach out to maintain control. Democrats have too long
taken the Hispanic vote for granted, and some are still slow to
acknowledge that the key to recapturing statewide offices lost over
the past several elections lies in that same growth.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican operative opined that a Tony Sanchez candidacy
would speed the state's political evolution significantly.
Hispanics will play a bigger role in directing the state's future,
he said, it's just a matter of time. Throw Sanchez in that picture
and you fast forward to that day.
</P>
<P>
   I always thought that it would be 10 or so years before a viable
Latino candidate for governor would emerge and that he or she would
likely be Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanchez prospect obviously paints a much different picture.
</P>
<P>
   In the two decades since Raul Gonzalez, the first Hispanic to be
elected statewide, there has been an unofficial quota system when
it comes to holding office. Gonzalez was elected to the Texas
Supreme Court, and you can count on the fingers of one hand the
number of Tejanos who have followed him: Dan Morales, a Democrat,
was elected attorney general; Tony Garza, a Republican, was elected
to the Railroad Commission and Al Gonzales, another Republican, was
elected to Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The message from both parties seemed to be, ``We like y'all, but
not too many of you at the same time, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Below state level, things have been better but not much. It
won't take you long to count the number of Hispanics elected
countywide in Travis County _ which loves to proclaim itself the
capital of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   So, Sanchez as a candidate will force big changes in the
political calculus up and down the ballot and across parties. And
with $25 million to $30 million of his own money to toss in the
race, he can buy a lot of calculators.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Sanchez is teaching operatives in both parties a
new phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay, dios.''

   CONCORDE-CRASH _ GONESSE, France _ Working in a dull gray mist,
investigators and medical workers Wednesday began sifting through
the blackened wreckage of a chartered Air France Concorde that
crashed near Paris minutes after take-off Tuesday. As attention
turned to the supersonic aircraft's engines, the airline said that
its mechanics worked on one of the plane's engines just before
take-off. The airline would not say whether the work was done on
the No. 4 engine, the one that apparently caught fire and streamed
flames as the aircraft plunged to the ground. (Roughton, Cox News

praised their leader for not giving into pressure during the 15-day

deadline looming, Clinton and his aides pivoted to the challenge of
trying to help Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat build a consensus for compromise among their

The show is expected to draw between 3,500 and 5,000 people are is

outdoor dinner table and not long after, pink roses take center
stage. In summer, lush foliage forms a cool canopy for sundown
suppers. Structures like Burns' arbor are cropping up in back yards
everywhere as homeowners spend more time outdoors. Arbors and
pergolas lend not only shady retreats for relaxing and entertaining
but also the kind of structure, focal points and transitional areas
that yards and gardens so often need. (Flanders, Atlanta

   GARDENING-LIFE _ Within seconds of one another, I heard two
sounds that rose above the roll of thunder and splatter of rain:
Crrrraaaack! WHUUUMP! In the kitchen of our 110-year-old house, I
felt a thud, but it did not begin to prepare me for what lay in
front of the house. The big old oak next door, a tree that probably
predates the Civil War, had lost half of itself; brushing the top
of our house, crashing into the wrought-iron fence, spreading
across the driveway, reaching even the house beyond ours. Minutes
after the fall, a sweet fragrance wafted, through the house. But,
it was more than newly-broken wood; it evoked the sensory pleasure
of fresh-sliced watermelon, a soothing, life-affirming counterpoint
to the death and decay so evident in the tree that, like so many
oaks in Atlanta, has been dying inwardly for years and whose
falling apart was hastened by debilitating drought and yet another
violent blowdown. (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH PHOTOS.

far gone or too ugly to save, replacing a closet door is also a
simple project. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 26. MOVED.

 &HT;    Coke leaves Cadbury deal in Canada, Mexico
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Coca-Cola Co. is abandoning efforts to buy Cadbury
Schweppes' beverages in Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The brands in those countries were part of an original $1.85
billion deal in which Coke planned to buy Cadbury Schweppes'
beverages, except those sold in the United States, France and South
Africa. The drinks included Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Crush and the
Schweppes line of mixers.
</P>
<P>
   But the December 1998 deal, which was former Chairman M. Douglas
Ivester's first major acquisition as head of the company, has been
plagued in some countries by government concerns over Coca-Cola's
market dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said we're committed to playing by the house rules
wherever we do business,'' Coca-Cola Chairman Doug Daft said
Wednesday in announcing the decision on Canada and Mexico. ``The
authorities in both countries have made their concerns clear, and
we are simply respecting those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Coke has scaled back the Cadbury Schweppes
acquisition, including in much of Europe, to allay those concerns.
The deal now covers 161 countries and is valued at about $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, who replaced Ivester in February, has stressed that the
company wants to improve relations with local governments. He has
moved more decision-making away from Coke's headquarters and posted
his top executives in the territories they oversee.
</P>
<P>
   Beverage Digest Editor John Sicher said Coke's decision to drop
Mexico and Canada and get the Cadbury Schweppes deal behind it
reflects Daft's thinking that his company has ``bigger fish to fry
and bigger opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Daft wants to press regulators to approve deals
they don't feel comfortable with,'' Sicher said. ``He wants to put
pressure on his company to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cadbury Schweppes brands, Coke's market share in Canada
would have climbed to 49.1 percent from 39.4 percent, vs. 34.3
percent for Pepsi, according to Beverage Digest. The rise in Mexico
would have been less dramatic _ to 72.6 percent from 68.4 percent,
vs. 19.7 percent for Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
that while the brands would have been ``terrifically
complementary'' to Coke's operations, ``it's not a negative that
they don't get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Rob Baskin said Coke and Cadbury Schweppes
still need regulatory approval in some countries but do not expect
problems. ``The deal is substantially complete,'' Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin would not comment on whether Coca-Cola is considering
other acquisitions. There is industry speculation that the company
is weighing a stake in the SoBe line of herbal and vitamin-enhanced
juices and teas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Coca-Cola's stock ended Wednesday at $58.57,
down 44 cents.

 &HT;    Cruising just as fast as he can now
 &HT;    By Steve Uhler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Brian Wilson playing a gig in Austin happens
only slightly more often than Mozart playing a dinner show in
Branson, Mo. _ which is never.
</P>
<P>
   But after 35 years of lying low, the reclusive pop legend will
play at The Backyard tonight, which qualifies as a local musical
Event with a capital ``e.'' Backed by a crackerjack band that
includes members of Poi Dog Pondering and the Wondermints, Wilson
has toured the country this summer playing to appreciative _ and in
some cases, disbelieving _ sell-out crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wilson? The leader and co-founder of the Beach Boys? The
pop prodigy who wrote such confectionery classics as ``I Get
Around,'' ``California Girls'' and ``Good Vibrations'' (all of
which he has been performing on tour), and who recorded 11 albums
in four years, all before he was 24? The clean-cut kid who conjured
a musical, mythical California of sun, surf, girls and cars that
persists in the world's collective imagination? The rock 'n' roll
auteur who was writing, producing and arranging his own records a
full year before the Beatles?
</P>
<P>
   Yup, that Brian Wilson. Or rather, those Brian Wilsons. Because
there are as many Brian Wilsons as there are stories about him _
and there are some very bizarre stories about him. His genius and
eccentricities are the stuff of pop-culture legend. He is the
Howard Hughes of rock. A notoriously shy recluse who suffered from
severe stage fright, Wilson stopped touring with the Beach Boys in
1964 after he had a nervous breakdown, and he has seldom performed
live since. But, after decades of troubled waters, the surf's up
again for Brian Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going great, going great,'' he says over the phone before
a sound check. Wilson sounds focused, energized and upbeat _ an
encouraging sign for those who have charted his tumultuous life.
``We're having a lot of fun. We're getting ovations, standing
ovations wherever we go. People love us. . . . They think we're
fantastic!''
</P>
<P>
   If said by any other rock deity, that statement would come
across as egomaniacal hyperbole, but from Brian Wilson, it sounds
strangely endearing and self-effacing. He seems genuinely surprised
and happy that audiences and critics are responding so warmly to
his against-all-bets return to performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' he says in that childlike delivery he
conveys in conversation. ``They're reacting to all the songs.
They're going bananas for everything!''
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm is infectious.
</P>
<P>
   'PET SOUNDS'
</P>
<P>
   In a savvy choice that embraces both his greatest artistic
success and most disappointing commercial defeat, the tour is
showcasing Wilson's epochal 1966 masterpiece, ``Pet Sounds.'' No
less an authority than Paul McCartney has called ``Pet Sounds''
``perhaps the album of the century . . . unbeatable in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, ``Pet Sounds'' was a radical departure for Wilson and
the Beach Boys. Jettisoning the fun 'n' sun formula that had made
the group so successful, Wilson created a spiritual, complex album
about the fragile and ever-changing nature of love. The music of
``Pet Sounds'' (with lyrics by Tony Asher) is peppered with
timeless, breathtaking touchstones _ the wistful, upbeat optimism
of ``Wouldn't It Be Nice?,'' the spiritual incandescence of ``God
Only Knows,'' and the pure heartbreak of ``Caroline, No.''
</P>
<P>
   Although critics and musicians immediately recognized ``Pet
Sounds'' as a towering achievement, the album sold disappointingly.
``Capitol didn't believe in it at all,'' Wilson says, still
sounding wounded. ``They didn't have any faith in it.'' Instead,
the record company rushed into stores a Beach Boys greatest hits
album scarcely six weeks after the release of ``Pet Sounds,''
effectively snuffing out any commercial chance the record may have
had.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Pet Sounds,'' Wilson's life began to collapse under a
series of calamitous events. He spent months of studio time and
substantial dollars recording ``Smile,'' the much-anticipated
follow-up to ``Pet Sounds,'' only to abandon the project when the
Beatles released ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' His
father, Murry Wilson, sold the publishing rights to all of Brian's
songs, effectively denying his son millions in future royalties.
</P>
<P>
   A depressed Wilson retreated to his Bel-Air mansion, ballooned
to 300 pounds and stayed in bed for nearly two years. His 15-year
marriage to high school sweetheart Marilyn Rovell fell apart in
1979. Then came the notorious ``Landy Decade.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, an increasingly fragile Wilson was put under the
dubious care of behavioral therapist Eugene Landy. Originally hired
to wean Wilson from drugs, Landy burrowed his way into Wilson's
life, siphoning off his assets and taking co-writing and
co-producing credits for most of Wilson's solo work. As Wilson
tried to cope, his younger brother and original Beach Boy, Dennis,
drowned in 1983. Then, in an ugly court battle, cousin and fellow
Beach Boy Mike Love, who had written the lyrics to many of the
group's early hits, sued Wilson over songwriting royalties.
</P>
<P>
   It's fodder for a bad TV mini-series _ which is exactly what
happened earlier this year when ABC aired ``The Beach Boys: An
American Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I saw it; I sure did,'' Wilson says. ``I thought it was
not that factual. I thought the characters were way out of line. I
didn't like it, personally. The guy who played me was way out of
whack.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   Happily, things have turned around for Wilson. He married
Melinda Ledbetter in 1995; the couple has two new daughters. Don
Was filmed a well-received 1995 documentary on Wilson, ``I Just
Wasn't Made for These Times,'' that introduced a new audience to
his serious work. In 1996, Capitol issued a four-CD box set, ``The
Pet Sounds Sessions,'' which sold surprisingly well. And his 1998
solo album, ``Imagination,'' helped re-establish Wilson as a
still-vital artist.
</P>
<P>
   He even has a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling a live album over the Web site _
brianwilson.com. My wife handles it,'' Wilson says. ``It started
kinda slow, but it's picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   In six weeks, Rhino Records will re-release Wilson's first solo
album, 1988's ``Brian Wilson,'' featuring the lushly healing ``Love
and Mercy.'' ``I hope they promote it,'' he says. ``It could sell.
It's a good album. It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone whose mercurial life has been so scrupulously
documented, Wilson has a refreshingly benign perspective on his
public image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people think of me as some kind of a little Junior
Maharishi, y'know? Like from the mid-'60s _ a peace-and-love kind
of person.'' And how does Wilson see himself these days? He pauses
before answering, without a trace of self-consciousness, ``I think
of myself as the bringer of good things to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Brian Wilson happy, at peace with his present as much as
with his past, and making great music under the stars on a summer
evening in Austin. Wouldn't it be nice.

BOOKING ON A BABY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and l coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENNINGTON, Vt. _ Kristina Criss looked on with a cheek-to-cheek
grin as her son Seth devoured his new book, ``Pussycat Pussycat.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Criss's pediatrician said, the 6-month-old will
actually read the book, rather than chomping on its corners with
his toothless mouth. Regardless, Dr. Donna Miller said, the book
was a gift for Seth to do with as he saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this age, they're going to chew their books more than
listen to you read them,'' Miller told Criss, as Seth gurgled on
the examining table. ``You give him another few months, and he'll
be pointing things out on the pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the scenes playing out across Vermont these days, a few
weeks into an ambitious, privately financed program that promises
every baby born in Vermont this year a small library of books. The
program, Born to Read 2000, comes in the form of a tote bag full of
children's books, a videotape instructing parents on how to read to
a newborn, and a list of other age-appropriate books.
</P>
<P>
   The packages, distributed at a baby's six-month checkup, will
likely make their way into more than 7,000 homes this year, said
Maxine Brandenburg, president of the Vermont Business Roundtable, a
group of 115 Vermont CEOs who dreamed up the program and provided
much of the more than $500,000 to put it together.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the program is that, when it comes to child
development, there's not much time to waste. Research into the
cognitive development of infants has shown that exposure to books
at a young age accelerates and aids a child's ability to speak,
understand, and read, said Dr. Paula Duncan, principal assistant to
the secretary of the Vermont Department of Health and a
pediatrician who helped develop Born to Read.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the need to help parents expose their infants to
books is apparent in the findings of several recent reports.
According to the National Survey of Kindergarten Teachers, 28
percent of Vermont's kindergartners are ill-prepared to participate
successfully in school. One reason, specialists say, is that many
parents are incapable of preparing their children. About 12 percent
of Vermont adults are are illiterate and cannot read a children's
book, according to the National Institute for Literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, developers of Born to Read 2000 say they want the program
to help acquaint parents with books as well. One last goody in the
tote bag is a voucher for another free book, which parents can pick
up at their local library. The idea is to get parents interested in
their public libraries, in hopes that they might like what they
see, said Grace Greene, children's services consultant for the
Vermont Department of Libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, the important part is for people to
understand that they have a lifelong supply of books in their
public libraries,'' said Greene, who developed the voucher idea.
``What we hope is the voucher will take people into public
libraries that would not normally go in. People don't always know
that there are materials for very young children in libraries, and
that material has grown tremendously recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled in part after Reach Out and Read, an early childhood
literacy program developed in the late 1980s by doctors at the
Boston City Hospital, Born to Read 2000 is the result of more than
a year's worth of development and collaboration by Vermont
corporations, educators, public agencies, doctors, and librarians
on a level never before attempted.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Reach Out and Read, which requires participating
pediatricians to raise the money for the books, Born to Read
provides the books to the doctors. So far, however, the fledgling
program only has enough funding to provide books for babies born
this year, and only for their six-month visit, Brandenburg said. By
comparison, Reach Out and Read provides books to children at
various intervals until their fifth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether enough companies and donors will
sign on to make Born to Read permanent, Brandenburg said, although
officials are busy trying to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Born to Read 2000 has Vermont's literacy advocates
beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those programs that you have dreams about,''
said Sally Anderson, executive director of the Vermont Center for
the Book, an affiliate agency of the Library of Congress that
promotes early literacy. ``You always hoped, maybe someday, every
child in the state will get a packet of books from the doctor, and
then it actually happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people across the state are working to ensure that
all the babies born this year will get their tote bag _ no easy
feat, given the patchwork of tiny hamlets that constitute the
majority of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Vermont Business Roundtable began
shipping out shrink-wrapped packages from the warehouse
distribution center of one company in the organization. Another
corporation produced the instructional video, and still others
orchestrated advertising campaigns that have barraged the public in
newspapers and on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so exciting because, all of the sudden, we had the
experience and the resources of the business community to help out
with early childhood education,'' Duncan said. ``It said something
to many of us, that if they could put in such an effort, the rest
of us could too. The response has been excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Duncan and others readily admit that Born to Read
may, in the end, do little to change attitudes among some parents
toward the importance of books and reading. After all, some said,
several parents may simply chuck the bag in the corner and never
glance that way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really talking about with this program is changing
the culture, and clearly, that's an uphill battle the whole way,''
said Anderson, of the Vermont Center for the Book. ``As a one-shot
deal, skepticism of this program is certainly well-founded. Will
this book make any big changes? I doubt it. But it's a great start,
and we have to keep pushing forward.''

 COLLEGE STOCK PLANS UNDERCUTTING PREPAYMENT PACKAGES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The anxiety began a year ago. Pardaman Bhan had just
finished paying off $170,000 in student loans, and the sting was
still fresh. Watching his 12-year-old son Aman playing soccer,
romping around carefree, he badly wanted to keep the crush of
college debt off of the boy's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel so burdened when you get out, that all you think
is, you have to make money,'' said the dentist. Only an aggressive
investment, he felt, would cover Aman's first tuition bill, and the
next, and the next.
</P>
<P>
   Bhan chose the U. Fund, a state-sponsored program of mutual
funds run by Fidelity Investments. The plan is one of dozens that
have sprung up nationwide since 1998, fueling a fast-growing $6
billion college-savings industry. College officials say the
programs have become the most popular way in years to pay for a
higher education, creating a whole new brand of financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``These savings plans seem to be the first kind to really
capture the attention of both politicians and the public,'' said
Philip C. Johnson, a financial planner who tracks aid issues.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity, in fact, has led to some unexpected
consequences. They're pulling families into the stock market for
the first time, but they're also siphoning money from another
savings vehicle once touted by former governor William F. Weld and
others. Called U. Plan, it is a tuition-prepayment plan that allows
families to lock in current tuition rates years in advance of
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   New data show that after just 16 months of operation, the U.
Fund is outpacing Massachusetts' older prepayment program, the U.
Plan. This year's sign-up period for the U. Plan was the worst by
far: Only 4,700 investments were made in May and June, compared to
13,805 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year-old prepayment program has $102.6 million in
assets. The U. Fund has accumulated $192.3 million in little over a
year.
</P>
<P>
   As in Massachusetts, savings programs appear to be cannibalizing
the prepayment market from coast to coast. In the last two years,
34 states have created or developed savings programs. Only seven
states have similarly embraced prepayment programs during that
time, though there are 19 of them nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are saving for their children to go to college
because of savings programs,'' said Pam Taylor, director of the
National Association of State Treasurers, which lobbies on behalf
of such plans. ``We don't care how it happens, as long as it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Families are becoming more ambitious about preparing financially
for college, say analysts who study the savings market.
</P>
<P>
   More parents are putting away money earlier than in the past, in
part because taxes on savings and prepayment accounts are deferred
until the earnings are used. Several states exempt the funds from
taxes entirely, a proposal now under consideration in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort zone with the stock market also appears to be
widening, observers say. Mutual funds still carry more risk than
the state bonds undergirding many prepayment programs, including
the U. Plan. But the potential payoff is far greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at tuition going up at a slower pace than
what they can get in the stock market,'' said Joseph Hurley, the
founder of savingforcollege.com LLC, an Internet site that provides
advice on college savings. ``And states like the savings plans
because they don't cost anything. The states can hire an investment
company that can flip the cost, so it's cheap and easy to have
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Fidelity name on the U. Fund was a lure for Richard
Connolly, a Winthrop direct-mail marketer. He has invested about
$150,000 so far in U. Fund accounts for his three children _ money
he said he would be less likely to entrust to the government-run
prepayment program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd feel more confident with Fidelity than with any
state-managed program,'' Connolly said. ``Government management
isn't necessarily that which private industry is.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials say their prepayment program is a solid,
safe investment, but they add that changes in higher education have
diminished the luster of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition, for instance, has stopped soaring. Prepayment programs
sprung up in Massachusetts and elsewhere in the mid-1990s to offer
a hedge against tuition inflation after years of double-digit
increases. Sticker prices have been rising only about 5 percent a
year recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tuition rates start to rise again and the markets aren't so
good, people may think that prepaid programs are more
advantageous,'' said Scott Prince, director of external relations
for the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority, which
created both programs and runs the prepayment option.
</P>
<P>
   But some financial planners aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaying tuition limits parents' choices to Massachusetts
colleges and can become too complicated, said Andrew Schwartz of
Schwartz &AMP; Schwartz PC in Woburn, Mass. None of his firm's 1,000
clients has asked about the U. Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead in the water,'' Schwartz said of the prepayment
program. ``It's too intangible. If the person's child goes to
college in the state, it's a piece of cake because tuition's paid
for. But if not, it seems like a nightmare in figuring out how
you're going to get your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers also chafe at prepayment programs' restricted
benefits, which are mostly limited to in-state campuses. The
Massachusetts U. Plan is one of the most innovative because it
includes many private colleges, such as Boston College and Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bernard Pekala, BC's director of financial aid, said he
prefers the savings program as an investment, especially for
parents who have young children and may be eyeing an expensive
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for a family with a 5-year-old kid to be
that risk averse,'' Pekala said. ``If you have 10 to 15 years to
utilize the funds, the history of the market is that the investment
will perform much better.''
</P>
<P>
   An elite few, such as Harvard University and Williams College,
have resisted joining the prepayment program, despite pressure from
Weld and others. Officials at those schools cite concerns about
financial aid that puts families in the prepayment program at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the formula that qualifies students for financial aid, a
dollar of prepaid tuition can reduce each dollar of possible aid.
MEFA has asked colleges to reduce a student's loan burden first,
when possible, before taking away grant money as a result of
prepaid tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The formula treats savings plans and most other investments more
favorably. For U. Fund savings accounts in a parent's name, for
example, only 6 percent is counted against a student's eligibility
for aid.
</P>
<P>
   MEFA officials and their colleagues elsewhere are lobbying the
federal government to change the aid formula to benefit prepayment
plans as well.
</P>
<P>
   For now, parents who considered both the savings and prepayment
options seem to be casting their lot with the savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bhan, who is also putting away money for his daughter, shunned
prepaying tuition because he didn't want his children locked in to
attending a Massachusetts college. Right now, he added, the stock
market seems both a safe and strong bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the children will have in mind when it's
time to go to college,'' he said. ``So I felt, the more the
options, the better.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains will douse parts of New England on Thursday as
tropical moisture streams inland over a stalled front off the
Northeast coast. Thunderstorms will dot the broad shield of steady
rain, producing local downpours. The heaviest rains will probably
occur on the high ground of western and southern New England, where
tropical air originating 2,000 feet over the Atlantic rushes inland
and rises rapidly over the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will erupt over the high Plains from
western Nebraska to eastern Montana as moist air flowing from the
southeast rises over the sloping landscape. A few storms may
approach severe levels, with hail and damaging winds in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms will sprout over the upper Midwest as a
lofty pool of cold air moves overhead.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TROPICAL PATTERN
</P>
<P>
   If this were the heart of hurricane season, the current pattern
over the East Coast would cue forecasters to the threat of a
tropical storm coming up the Atlantic Seaboard. Even though the
tropical Atlantic will stay rather quiet Thursday, tropical rains
will still douse the Northeast. With a ridge of high pressure over
the western Atlantic and a trough of low pressure over the Midwest,
steering winds aloft will continue to blow from the tropics. With a
stalled front off the coast and areas of moisture-enriched low
pressure rippling slowly along it, flooding rains will occur. &QL;

 &HT;    New UPS system could help planes avoid collisions
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The vacationers aboard Campion Air Flight 903 to
Cancun, Mexico, never knew they were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 25, a few miles northeast of Atlanta, their chartered
B727 was converging with Delta Air Lines Flight 1919 at 33,000
feet. An air traffic controller had mistakenly put the two jets on
conflicting paths, and pilots in both planes blindly followed their
misguided instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Delta MD-80 was equipped with a collision
avoidance system that warned the crew in time to avert catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   But the close call over Atlanta, and scores like it each year in
the nation's increasingly crowded skies and airports, are drawing
attention to a new technology that, proponents say, can drastically
reduce or even eliminate mid-air and runway collisions. The
experimental system known as ADS-B (for Automatic Dependent
Surveillance - Broadcast) also promises to unclog aerial gridlock
by allowing planes to safely fly at close, evenly spaced intervals.
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B was launched in 1996 by UPS Aviation Technologies, a
subsidiary of Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Corp. UPS, the
world's largest transportation firm, plans to begin equipping its
own planes with ADS-B this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most surprising thing about ADS-B for a lot of people is
the fact that it actually exists,'' said Steve Alterman, president
of the Cargo Airline Association, a trade group that represents UPS
and others. ``This isn't some aerospace engineer's pie-in-the-sky
idea. It's here right now, and it offers near-term and long-term
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS hopes to sell ADS-B to passenger airlines, cargo carriers
and corporate and private aircraft owners around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``United Airlines has shown tremendous interest already,'' said
Alterman of the Cargo Airline Association. ``They have a situation
in San Francisco where they can't use parallel runways when it gets
foggy _ and that leads to huge delays. ADS-B could solve that
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, designers are marketing ADS-B overseas, especially in
remote regions where radar coverage is unreliable or nonexistent.
UPS officials say they are negotiating with foreign governments to
provide entire air traffic control networks based on ADS-B
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they don't know how large the market for
ADS-B is going to be. The system's standards are open, so all
avionics manufacturers are free to build and sell competing ADS-B
products.
</P>
<P>
   SATELLITES REPLACE RADAR
</P>
<P>
   The current air traffic system relies on a patchwork of
ground-based radar to show the positions of aircraft as they
crisscross the country. And FAA controllers monitoring radar scopes
are the only ones with an overall view of the air traffic picture,
telling pilots the speeds, altitudes and headings they should fly
to avoid traffic conflicts and align their planes with runways.
</P>
<P>
   But ADS-B would fundamentally alter that arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology uses Global Positioning System satellites _
not radar _ to pinpoint each airplane's location. And cockpit
instruments show pilots _ not just air traffic controllers _
real-time images of the traffic around them. The system enables
pilots to follow other aircraft at precise distances, a highly
desirable capability at hubs like Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport and UPS' air cargo facility in Louisville,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been getting maximum utilization of runways because
pilots haven't had the necessary tools,'' said Ken Shapero, a
spokesman for UPS Aviation Technologies. ``In a hub environment
where you have a lot of airplanes converging during periods of
intense activity, the ability to use runways more efficiently is
going to save huge amounts of time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B works like this: Each plane carries a transmitter that
continuously broadcasts digital information about its speed,
heading, altitude and identity to other planes and data links on
the ground. Radio receivers in other aircraft pick up the signals,
and cockpit computers instantly turn them into pictures of the air
traffic scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Designers say ADS-B gives pilots easy-to-interpret information
about potential traffic conflicts and opens the door to a wide
variety of applications that have never been tried before.
</P>
<P>
   For example, FAA regulations usually require air traffic
controllers to keep airplanes at least five miles apart
horizontally during low-visibility conditions. In practice, actual
separation often becomes much greater and traffic backs up at busy
airports. Using ADS-B, pilots could ``see'' and identify other
planes, get in line behind them and maintain the proper spacing all
the way to the runway. And if a plane doesn't clear the low
altitudes or on runway surfaces. Also, their cost of $100,000 per
unit puts them out of reach for most corporate and private aircraft
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Air cargo carriers will be required to have collision avoidance
equipment by the end of 2002, and it's unclear whether upgraded
ADS-B systems will satisfy that requirement. Memphis-based FedEx
Corp. has decided to install airline-style collision avoidance
systems in its planes, then add ADS-B later. Bob Miller, president
of the Independent Pilots Association, which represents UPS fliers,
wants UPS to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety items shouldn't be a buffet,'' said Miller, a B747
captain. ``Safety standards should be the same for everyone. We
don't want the airlines to be able to pick and choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots who have flown with ADS-B say the system isn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit instruments only show detailed information about
other aircraft equipped with ADS-B. And some early tests revealed
that pilots of planes with ADS-B made more radio transmissions to
air traffic controllers _ not fewer as the system's designers
anticipated. Air traffic controllers in early tests also said they
were concerned about potential miscommunications since ADS-B crews
often repeated other aircraft call signs as well as their own.
(Example: ``UPS 402 will follow UPS 406.'')
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B equipment ranges in cost from $13,000 for small planes to
$100,000 for airliners with additional hardware and more stringent
FAA certification requirements. But if ADS-B gains wide acceptance,
the units could be produced in enough volume to substantially
reduce unit prices, UPS officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the CAA's Alterman says if other avionics
manufacturers pick up the technology, that is likely to drive down
ADS-B prices and speed new product development.
</P>
<P>
   ``ADS-B started out as a collision avoidance system, but it's
evolved into much more than that,'' Alterman said. ``It offers all
kinds of safety and efficiency enhancements that seem futuristic
today. But in 10 years we'll look back and all these applications
will seem obvious.''

RUSSIA ENACTS FLAT 13 PERCENT INCOME TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ This onetime capital of the world's workers approved an
income tax Wednesday that seems more regressive that anything
American conservatives could ever hope to see at home.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's move to roll back taxes to a flat 13 percent, one-third
the top US federal rate, says less about political ideology than it
does about Moscow's desperation to change another local tradition:
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, championed by President Vladimir V. Putin and the
International Monetary Fund, and passed by Russia's parliament,
would scrap Russia's graduated income tax, which starts at 12
percent and tops out at 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the change will put more revenue in state coffers
because it will be easier to calculate and collect. They also say
lowering and simplifying the tax system will dramatically improve
Russia's business climate, attract investment and ignite economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a chance to develop the country,'' Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin said of the changes, which, with Putin's
signature, will become law next year.
</P>
<P>
   Tax evasion has been a chronic problem in Russia, and the
nation's complex tax system has stifled investment.
</P>
<P>
   The change was passed despite criticism from some politicians
and labor groups that the flat rate was unfair to the poor. The
change in fact raises taxes for Russia's lowest income earners _
from 12 percent to 13 percent _ while lowering taxes for the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The upper chamber of Parliament, the Federation Council, also
slashed the rate of a corporate tax on revenues, regardless of
profits, from 2.5 percent to 1 percent. Both tax changes were
passed this month by the lower house, the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Reductions in the corporate revenue tax had been opposed by many
regional leaders, because the tax financed a fund to build and
repair roads.
</P>
<P>
   One of the harshest critics was Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get nothing, no region will be without a deficit,'' he
said in floor debate. ``Everyone will be confined to a stall, with
the state proffering handfuls of hay.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has criticized the road fund as unaccountable and rife
with corruption. In an interview last month with the newspaper
Izvestia, Putin pointed out that the road fund is worth $5 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that if these $5 billion were spent only on building
roads, we would now have only highways and autobahns in Russia,''
said Putin, who had sought to eliminate the revenue tax altogether,
but was forced to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Aman Tuleyev, governor of the Kemerovo region in Siberia, said
the changes would benefit Russia in the long run as the economy
improves.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts praised the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all around good for business,'' said James Beatty,
director of Emerging Markets Group, a St. Petersburg-based tax
consulting company. ``I think the Russian government will soon
discover that lowering taxes will actualy increase tax revenues.''

WITTY WEB-BASED GAME USES FLASH TO ENTERTAIN  
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HEROLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mr. Snoozleberg, sound asleep, walks in slippered feet toward
the lion's cage. If the cage door is closed, he will bump into it
and awaken, finding himself in his pajamas, miles from home,
confused and penniless. If the cage is open, he will walk into the
lion's mouth. And if he somehow gets by the lion, he still has a
couple of seals, a gorilla and several very prickly porcupines to
get past. It's a good thing you're watching out for the poor guy.
</P>
<P>
   Part puzzle game, part slapstick cartoon, Sarbakan's ``Good
Night, Mr. Snoozleberg'' is one of the best games you can play on
the Internet and one of the best puzzle games of the last few
years. It is one of many Shockwave games that have been created
using the multimedia animation tool Macromedia Flash, and one of
the precious few whose entertainment value rivals those of
commercial games.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Snoozleberg,'' the player is responsible for keeping a
sleepwalking diplomat asleep and alive as he wanders through
carnivals, back alleys, sound stages and alien spaceships. In each
episode, Mr. Snoozleberg has something important to do the next
day, so if he doesn't make it back into bed by morning, an actor
will not be presented with his award or there will be no one
available to negotiate with aliens. Mr. Snoozleberg is a very
important person.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the game will be familiar to anyone who has
watched enough old Warner Brothers cartoons: someone who is
sleepwalking, in shock or witless walks through a dangerous area
like a construction site and is saved from death or dismemberment
by blind luck. As the sleepwalker is just about to step off the
edge of the building or be crushed under a cement block, a beam
will swing into place or an elevator will open its doors and
disaster will be averted. It is as though the hand of God reaches
out to save these cartoon characters.
</P>
<P>
   In Mr. Snoozleberg, you are that hand, dropping something heavy
on the head of a waiting alligator or laying a beam across the
space between two roofs before Mr.Snoozleberg can plummet to the
sidewalk. Do your job right and Mr.Snoozleberg will never know he
has been out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of the game are simple and, for the most part,
involve nothing more than clicking on the right object at the right
time. If Mr.Snoozleberg is about to walk past the window of a woman
in her underwear, pull down the shade before she sees him and
screams. Don't pull it down too soon or it will flip up at just the
wrong time. Sometimes you'll have to move an object to a new
location or spin something Mr. Snoozleberg is walking on to
redirect him.
</P>
<P>
   Given the limitations of online games, it is remarkable how much
variety there is in this one. There are hundreds of ways in which
Mr. Snoozleberg's dreams can be interrupted. Slapstick cops,
troubadors and bumper cars are all laying in wait for the poor man,
and alligators seem to be lurking everywhere, driving garbage
trucks and exploring deep space, always ready for a snack. Some of
the ways in which Mr. Snoozleberg is awakened are quite
entertaining, and players may want to fail once at each puzzle just
to see what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Flash has become a powerful tool for Internet creativity. There
are increasing numbers of miniature movies, simple games and
elaborate Web sites all run by the Shockwave player, a free
download. The quality of these Shockwave products varies, and most
of the games are nothing but retreads of computer games from the
1980's, not worth the several minutes it can take to load a game
using a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking thing about ``Snoozleberg,'' and about
Sarbakan's other game, the excellent adventure game ``Arcane,'' is
how ambitious they are. It is common to see simple, dumb games like
``Cheesy Poofs,'' in which you slide an open-mouthed character from
the television cartoon ``South Park'' back and forth in front of a
steady stream of snacks, or ``Elvira Monster Smash,'' in which you
drop pumpkins on ghouls. But ``Snoozleberg'' is something else: a
complete game with simple but detailed graphics, catchy
cocktail-lounge music and many levels, each containing a large
number of puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   The better Flash games, like Leo's Great Day, are short, but it
takes many hours to complete ``Snoozleberg.'' You cannot play the
game without thinking that this is as good as any puzzle game you
can buy. ``Lemmings Revolution'' may have the latest in 3D
graphics, but ``Snoozleberg'' gives you the same degree of wit and
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare to find Flash used to its full potential. For every
game like ``Good Night, Mr. Snoozleberg'' or ``Sissy Fight,'' on
which the designers have obviously spent a lot of time and effort,
there are a dozen simple, repetitive games that could have been
created in a week or less. It would be nice if more Flash designers
chose to create games of the caliber of Sarbakan's offerings.
Perhaps ``Good Night, Mr. Snoozleberg'' will be their wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   Good Night, Mr. Snoozleberg; an online game, available free at
sarbakan.com/snooz; for all ages.

FRENCH OFFER SYMPATHY TO FAMILIES OF GERMAN CONCORDE VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Standing on the steps of Sacre-Coeur, the imposing
basilica that sits on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris,
the old woman held rosary beads in veiny hands.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her name was Madame Morauw, and that she had just
prayed for the 113 people, nearly all of them Germans, who were
killed Tuesday as a Concorde jet crashed just after takeoff, just
outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any of her family had suffered under the Germans during
the war, she nodded her head and said, ``Oui, trop.'' Too much.
</P>
<P>
   The woman seemed to know where the line of questioning was
going. She raised a finger to abruptly silence her questioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long time ago,'' Madame Morauw said. ``The French
and Germans are together now.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash, the first fatal accident involving the supersonic
Concorde, redemonstrated that there is no such thing as an
infallible airliner. the reaction to the tragedy has also shown a
remarkable transformation in the relationship between France and
Germany since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago the Nazis bombed Paris and occupied France. By
the time Paris was liberated in August 1944, the Nazis had earned
the hatred of the French people.
</P>
<P>
   Nazi soldiers took special delight in drinking and carousing
around the Eiffel Tower, taunting the French by turning a national
symbol of French pride into a celebration of domination.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Joseph Meinel, a German tourist, stood in line,
waiting for a chance to ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I have gone the last two days, French people have
said they were sorry about what happened to the Concorde, that they
were sorry for the Germans who were killed,'' said Meinel, who
lives near Berlin and who said he has come to France regularly over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been treated with anything but respect,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the crash, the German chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, had given a speech in Frankfurt, lauding the friendship
between France and Germany, saying the two countries were the
undisputed leaders of the European Union and of the drive for
greater European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder spoke of what he called ``the French-German motor''
that drives European integration, an unfortunate choice of words
given the engine failure that seems to have sent the Air France
Concorde crashing in a fireball near Charles de Gaulle Airport.
</P>
<P>
   It was de Gaulle who led the French resistance to the Third
Reich, and last month, the German government invited the Gaullist
president of France, Jacques Chirac, to be the first foreigner to
speak at the newly reopened Reichstag in Berlin. In that speech,
Chirac celebrated the close relationship between the two nations,
saying it was their destiny to lead a united Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The French backed the American revolution and gave the United
States the Statue of Liberty as a gift, while the Americans twice
sent their armies to help liberate France from the Germans in the
last two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with many French reveal that they see Germans as
more natural and important allies. Americans are routinely decried
in France as being too powerful, too arrogant and too disdainful of
the French and other European allies.
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, has called the
United States a ``hyperpower.'' (In France, huge supermarkets with
hardware sections are called ``hypermarkets.'')
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine and his German counterpart, Joschka Fischer, have
repeatedly tried to persuade Britain, their historical shared
enemy, of joining them as leaders of the European Union _ an
invitation the British have continually declined, viewing the
Germans and French with equal suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech before the crash, Schroeder, whose father was a
German solider who died in battle three days before Schroeder was
born in 1944, said that ``German-French relations have not been
this good for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, after learning that almost all of the passengers
who died on the French plane were German, a somber Schroeder said,
``Germany and France are united in their horror over the
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, was visibly shaken after
touring the scene of devastation. He said he was mourning ``the
victims, the flight crew, and our German friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Nelson, an Irishwoman married to a Frenchman, agreed that
relations between the two former bitter enemies have improved
dramatically in the 14 years that she has lived in France. But she
says the French bitterness, especially in the older generation, is
just below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear remarks about Nazis,'' she said. ``You don't have to
dig too deep, especially with older people who lived through the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that bitterness was hard to find Wednesday as the sun shone
and the French came to terms with the loss of both a symbol of
French ingenuity and of more than 100 people, many of whose parents
and grandparents would have been part of an army that occupied
France just 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Madame Morauw said it best, just before she gingerly descended
the stairs at Sacre-Coeur Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans bleed,'' the old woman said, ``just like us.''

BETTER COLON CANCER SCREENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, doctors have been recommending that patients with a
family history of colon cancer or with any symptoms of the disease
undergo a colonoscopy examination. For patients 50 or older with no
special risk of getting the disease, doctors typically recommend
the less-costly sigmoidoscopy of just the lowest third of the large
intestine.
</P>
<P>
   Now the rationale for the less-intrusive procedure has been
shaken by two studies showing that one-half of all patients with
cancer or precancerous polyps in the higher part of their colon had
no evidence of them in the lower section. Their condition was only
detected when they were given a colonoscopy; they would have been
given a clean bill of health by a sigmoidoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   The findings _ based on tests of 5,100 patients _ will force
doctors, insurers, and the public to rethink the way they go about
prevention and early detection of this disease, the second biggest
cancer killer after lung cancer. ``I believe,'' writes Dr. Daniel
K. Podolsky of Massachusetts General Hospital in an editorial in
the New England Journal of Medicine, ``it is time for both
government and private insurers to provide coverage for
colonoscopic screening for all persons 50 years of age or older . .
. ''
</P>
<P>
   But getting insurers to pay the sizable bill for widespread
colonoscopy screening is just part of the problem. As things stand
now, fewer than one third of all persons over 50 undergo either
test, even though many insurers cover one or both procedures. There
are several reasons behind this, ranging from doctors' failure to
encourage patients to be screened to the unpleasantness of the
procedure. And if colonoscopy, which requires more expertise than
sigmoidoscopy, became routine now, there would not be enough
specialists to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Podolsky's position is hard to dispute. The new
studies show how successfully colorectal cancer can be screened
for. Caught early, both cancerous and precancerous growths can be
removed and lives saved. Now it is up to society as a whole to
decide if it wants to make this kind of commitment.

RAIL MERGER SLOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In validating a federal moratorium on rail mergers, a
three-judge circuit court was right to urge speed in developing an
updated set of policies for approval of further amalgamations. Rail
mergers have not always gone smoothly, but the basic logic of
combining some systems is sound and stands to benefit the economy
on a continental scale.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension of rail merger activity by the Department of
Transportation in March followed a proposal earlier this year _ and
abandoned last Thursday _ for marriage of the Canadian National
Railway with Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which would have
produced the largest rail system in North America, including the
first transcontinental system in this country (Canada's rails reach
from coast to coast already) and extensions into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This merger and several others it would spawn would reduce
problems of interconnections between lines meeting end-to-end that
result in delays of long-haul traffic and complications in billing
and other operations. With properly crafted mergers, gains of this
sort can be achieved without diminishing competition.
</P>
<P>
   Railroads do compete with each other in majormarkets _ Norfolk
Southern with CSX Corp., for example, in the Northeast _ but
railroads' most serious competition comes from trucking, which
handles more than 80 percent of all freight. Rail's greatest
strength lies in hauling bulk cargoes like coal and grain, but
improved service should compete more successfully with trucking
with piggyback operations, faster long-distance service, and more
reliable delivery timetables.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension of mergers during the study by the Transportation
Department's Surface Transportation Board has added an element of
uncertainty to an already complex process of railroad evolution _
enough to end at least temporarily the Canadian National-Burlington
Northern Santa Fe negotiations. A coherent policy confirming the
principle of approving end-to-end mergers coupled with preservation
of competition between parallel railroads should permit them to
take place as market and financial conditions warrant.

MONITORING SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Nations observers who had been monitoring the
distribution of food and humanitarian supplies in southern Iraq
have been absent from their posts since July 16, withdrawn because
of security concerns. The withdrawal followed the killing last
month of two people and the wounding of seven others by an Iraqi
gunman at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's mission in
Baghdad. The effect, as described by the director of the Iraq
Foundation in Washington, Rend Francke, is to ``make a very bad
situation catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the UN monitors was to offer a modicum of
protection for Iraqis, who are the most immediate victims of Saddam
Hussein's regime. Without UN observers in Iraq's four southern
provinces, families that have run afoul of the regime become even
more vulnerable to the punitive policies of the authorities.
Whereas UN monitors in southern Iraq had been able occasionally to
help families whose ration books had been confiscated, the absence
of monitors leaves Iraqis utterly exposed to the caprices and the
corruption of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In much of southern Iraq, Saddam's Baathist regime resembles an
occupation force. At night, resistance fighters attack party
headquarters and secret police targets. One of Baghdad's methods
for controlling the population is to use food and medicine as a
means of rewarding the docile and punishing the politically
incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Under the UN's expanded oil-for-food program, Saddam can sell
all the oil he can pump out of the ground. At current prices, his
regime will earn $18 billion this year. The practical meaning of
this arrangement is that the UN economic sanctions meant to force
Saddam to accept inspection and monitoring of his weapons of mass
destruction have become irrelevant. He continues to fight to lift
sanctions so that he, rather than UN monitors, will have the only
say on how to spend his oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   UN monitors should return immediately to southern Iraq with
guarantees of their safety. And then the next US president will
have to come to grips with a Saddam retrieving his arsenal of
nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.

BOWING TO PRESSURE, JAPANESE REGULATORS POSTPONE BANK SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese regulators Wednesday postponed by one month the
sale of the nationalized Nippon Credit Bank to a group of investors
led by the Softbank Corp., one of the world's largest Internet
investment companies.
</P>
<P>
   The delay came after some of Japan's most powerful politicians
applied intense pressure to the Financial Reconstruction
Commission, the agency responsible for overseeing the
rehabilitation and overhaul of Japan's debt-ridden financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Hiromu Nonaka, the secretary-general of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party and perhaps the most influential political figure
in Japan, is leading the push to force the agency to renegotiate
the contract to sell Nippon Credit, one of two large banks the
government nationalized at the height of Japan's financial crisis
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians object to a provision in the contract that would
allow the new owners of the bank to transfer back to the government
loans that lose more than 20 percent of their value for three
years. That provision was also part of the contract governing the
sale of the Long-Term Credit Bank, now known as Shinsei Bank, to a
group of investors led by Ripplewood Holdings LLC, a Wall Street
investment firm, and has kicked off a heated debate here about how
public money is used.
</P>
<P>
   Shinsei used the provision to shift 200 billion yen, or more
than $1.8 billion at current exchange rates, in loans to the Sogo
Co., a failing department store operator, to the government, thus
forcing the government to make a choice between spending public
money to rescue Sogo or pulling the plug on the company and its
9,900 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Since Shinsei and Nippon Credit are both creditors of a number
of visibly struggling companies, like the convenience store
operator Daiei Inc. and the building contractors Hazama Corp. and
Kumagai Gumi, the government will likely face the same tough choice
repeatedly _ unless politicians can somehow ban the guarantee
against further deterioration in loan values. Already, the
government is squirming to avoid making a decision on whether to
waive debts owed to the two banks loans by Hazama, which is
particularly troublesome because construction companies are among
the Liberal Democrats' biggest political supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This special clause was a complete mistake,'' said Yoshimi
Watanabe, a member of parliament who sits on the finance committee
in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Kimitaka Kuze, chairman of the Financial Reconstruction
Commission, insisted Wednesday that the agency would not change the
terms of the sale to Softbank and its partners, including the Orix
Corp. and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commission merely wanted to explain its reasons for
including the provision to the public. Bankers from Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co., which managed the sale of Long-Term Credit Bank, and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, which is handling the sale of Nippon Credit
for the government, have said repeatedly that without such
guarantees, there would be no sales.
</P>
<P>
   Kuze conceded that the delay in the sale, which was to have been
completed next Tuesday, came at the request of politicians, raising
further questions about the independence of Japan's financial
watchdog. ``It is true that I talked to Shizuka Kamei the day
before yesterday,'' Kuze said, referring to the ruling party's
policy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Kamei has joined Nonaka in pushing to change the laws governing
financial reform and the sale of bankrupt financial institutions.
In a television talk show on Sunday, Nonaka questioned the way the
commission has been guaranteeing buyers of failed banks against
further deterioration in loans. ``It's a big problem in the
Financial Reconstruction Law that measures for coping with
subsequent losses were not stipulated,'' he said, adding that the
ruling party would seek to put such clearly defined measures into
law during the special session of parliament that will begin on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any change in the law could be applied retroactively to
the sale of Nippon Credit remains to be seen. The Softbank group
agreed to a delay in the sale in the hope that some of the
controversy would die down, a representative from one investor said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Orix, however, made it clear that the investors
would not accept changes to the agreement. ``That provision is a
very important part of the contract,'' he said. ``It's difficult to
say what would happen if the government tries to remove that from
the agreement, but if that were to happen, there is a strong
possibility that we would pull out.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's five-member policy board met Wednesday and
agreed that it must honor the original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians have already demonstrated a surprising ability
to force the commission to change course, despite the implications
for its independence. Two weeks ago, political pressure pushed the
commission to abandon overnight its decision to participate in a
plan with other banks to forgive some of the $17 billion of debt
owed by the Sogo Co. after Nonaka and others complained about the
use of public money for such a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That about-face pushed Sogo into bankruptcy, setting off waves
of concern about the stability of the Japanese financial system and
the fragility of the economic recovery that are still reverberating
here. Now politicians are seeking ways to protect themselves from a
series of similar debacles, which could occur any time, given the
precarious finances of many of Japan's retail, construction and
real estate companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This argument of Mr. Nonaka's is one that has a lot of popular
support,'' Watanabe said. ``I think the Financial Reconstruction
Commission is in a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no concerns about how such a last-minute change
to terms of a deal that were finalized on June 30 might affect the
government's credibility. ``Already the credibility of and
confidence in the Japanese government has been lost,'' he said.

BALLPARK COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The state political leadership, Mayor Menino, and John
Harrington, the Red Sox chief executive, deserve congratulations
for devising a compromise finance plan for a new Fenway Park in
Boston. The Legislature should approve the plan Saturday,
recognizing that the proposal represents a balance between the twin
needs to keep the team in the city and minimize cost to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The only cost for government not covered by a clear new source
of revenue is the $100 million the state will spend to improve
transportation systems around Fenway Park. The state will be
compensated with taxes generated by economic activity outside the
park from the million more fans the team expects to attract each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Boston will contribute $212 million to build a
parking garage and buy land for the ballpark. This cost will be
defrayed by garage revenues and money from parking and ticket
surcharges, a sliver of the hotel/motel tax, and sales and meals
taxes inside the ballpark. Unlike other cities, Boston's investment
in the ballpark is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Properly, the Red Sox are liable for the biggest share of
expenses, $352 million for construction costs and responsibility
for any overruns. They will be looking for financing from private
sources. David D'Alessandro, CEO of John Hancock, and Chad Gifford,
president of FleetBoston, helped facilitate the compromise, along
with advertising executive Jack Connors. D'Alessandro and Gifford
will be providing another important civic service if they help
expedite the private financing.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative hearing will be held Friday, and ballpark
opponents will no doubt contend that the plan represents a raid on
the public purse. This is not the case. If anything, the finance
package places a heavy burden on the team, and the Legislature
would be wise to include funds to cover any overruns associated
with site preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are a part of Boston's cultural identity and, like
other leisure activities, contribute to the region's economy. The
team benefits from its location in the Fenway, where other
activities are nearby. This finance plan is a mutually beneficial
embrace between the City and the Sox.

U.S. JUDGE APPROVES SETTLEMENT BETWEEN SWISS BANKS, HOLOCAUST
SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge gave final approval Wednesday to a
$1.25 billion accord to settle claims of Holocaust survivors who
had sued a group of Swiss banks that they said had hoarded assets
deposited in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Edward R. Korman in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn takes hundreds of thousands of survivors and their family
members one step closer to collecting the money from the banks. The
ruling requires that a draft of a distribution plan be worked out
in 30 days. The money could begin to be distributed to the
plaintiffs and their heirs by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In the prologue to his ruling, Korman used the words of Ernest
Lobet, a Holocaust survivor who testified in a hearing related to
the case, to summarize the balance that he thought the agreement
struck between an idealized version of equity and real-life
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not say it is fair,'' the judge quoted Lobet as havid
said, ``because fairness is a relative term. No amount of money can
possibly be fair under those circumstances. But I'm quite sure it
is the very best that could be done by the groups that negotiated
for the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The case began about three years ago, when a series of
class-action suits were filed in Brooklyn by Jews who had deposited
money in Swiss banks as the Nazis took power in Germany. The suits
said Swiss institutions, including the two largest Swiss banks, UBS
and Credit Suisse, had blocked the survivors' efforts to reclaim
money that was directly deposited in the banks or that the Nazis
had looted and stored in the banks.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary agreement was reached in August 1998. Since then,
Korman worked worked with lawyers for the survivors and the banks
to hammer out the details.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was greeted by both sides as fair and expedient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wise and thoughtful opinion that crosses a very
important threshhold,'' said the survivors' chief lawyer, Burton
Neuborne. ``Until this settlement was approved, we were locked.
This unlocks the process, and we can start giving the money out.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger M. Witten, a lawyer in Washington who represents the
banks, said: ``We are very pleased that the judge put his stamp of
approval on the fundamental fairness of the settlement. It is an
important step in getting the money distributed to members of the
class.''
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of potential sticking points remain. One possible
pitfall concerns several private Swiss banks and banks run by the
cantonal, or state, governments, that have been reluctant to
publish the names of hundreds of accountholders or allow their
records to be placed in a database of all Swiss accounts opened
during the war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his order, Korman said if those banks refused to open their
records, they would not be protected against future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Korman seized on the intransigence of those banks to
make a larger point about the historical reluctance of the Swiss
banking system to relax its secrecy laws in connection with the
accounts from the Holocaust era. He said in his order that there
was no evidence that the Swiss had destroyed any records of the
victims' accounts, but added that if the Swiss authorities had been
more forthcoming decades ago, recent disputes might have been
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``An historic opportunity was lost,'' he wrote, quoting Paul A.
Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve who led an
independent panel that investigated the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the panel issued a report that said 54,000 Swiss
accounts had ``probable'' or ``possible'' links to Holocaust
victims. As of May, 550,000 people had returned questionnaires in
an effort to be included in the class-action settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The court now turns to the task of distributing the money. A
special master appointed by Korman, Judah Gribetz, is generally
expected to file a draft distribution plan with the court by Sept.
1.

BRISBY GETS ANOTHER CHANCE WITH THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ He is not Keyshawn Johnson, but perhaps there
was some similarity that Charlie Weis, Johnson's coach in New York,
saw in Vincent Brisby that possessed him to phone Brisby shortly
after he had been appointed the Patriots' offensive coordinator by
Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie is a guy I can definitely trust,'' said Brisby. ``I
don't know how long he had been on the staff _ it wasn't very long
_ but he called me up and said he wanted me to be here and get my
status back.''
</P>
<P>
   His status used to be a No. 1 receiver. That was before Terry
Glenn was drafted and before Bill Parcells signed Shawn Jefferson
in 1996. It was then, coupled with injuries, that led to Brisby's
free-falling career. He has been here since he was drafted in the
second round in '93. He's in a class with Drew Bledsoe, Troy Brown,
Todd Rucci, and Chris Slade in terms of service to the
organization, other than Bruce Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought Brisby would have lasted this long? He
was a starter seven years ago. He is a starter again. It was all
the in-between that got so muddled and so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby demanded a trade early last season, but he doesn't
believe it ever got close to being taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was gonna happen,'' he said. ``BG (Bobby
Grier) wasn't gonna do it. He might have looked into it, but once
Troy (Brown) got nicked up, I think the idea was thrown out the
window.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby also got into a fight with Lawyer Milloy at a nightclub
Nov. 24. It spilled over into the next day before a special teams
meeting in front of teammates and coaches, bringing Brisby's
diminishing popularity back to light. Throughout the offseason,
there was steady speculation that his $2.1 million cap number would
be one of the first to go. Instead, he watched as Ben Coates and
Armstrong were unceremoniously cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to the NFL stuff. You're never surprised,''
Brisby said. ``This offseason they made some statements early that
there was some changes. But it's business. It comes and goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The new coaching staff was like a cleansing breath. Brisby gets
to revive a once-promising career. He gets to be a big part of the
offense again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to prove to myself, to the coaches, and there are
a lot of naysayers out there. I'm looking forward to proving what
kind of player I am. I've always known it. I've been injured and I
had coaches who didn't believe in me. The last three years have
been difficult. I wish I could have leaped over those years, but
they're a part of me now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go home in the offseason and wonder why things had
been so bad. I honestly didn't think it was my fault. I thought I
came out here and practiced hard and played hard when I was
healthy. It just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what drives him is showing former coach Pete Carroll he
was way off by burying him on the depth chart and having him suffer
the humility of not being active the first two games of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to prove Pete wrong. I hope he's out there watching me
this year,'' said Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby can't help but hear those naysayers, the ones who believe
he never should have been allowed back. The ones who feel Brisby
must be blackmailing someone in the organization to keep his spot
on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have had plenty of chances to boot him, but instead
the Patriots have held on by tinkering with his contract. Before
training camp, they went to Brisby with a proposition: the team
would cut his base salary in half but allow him to make that back
and more with incentives. His salary tumbled from $1.5 million to
$750,000, but if he catches 70 passes, he could earn as much as
$2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is entitled to their opinion,'' said Brisby.
``Obviously people in this organization feel I have something to
offer. I mean, I think they know what I can do. They know I'm a
good player. So I hear it, but I don't pay any attention to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby, who caught 18 passes for 266 yards in 12 games (and one
start) last season, was asked to take a cut and ``any time someone
asks you play for half of your salary, that's hard,'' he said.
``But they tied in incentives, so where if I could play a lot, I'd
make the money back. I thought that was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe once said that no receiver has ever run a slant patern
better than Brisby. At 6 foot 2 inches, 210 pounds, Brisby can
catch the ball over the middle, which is where the Keyshawn Johnson
comparison comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby said he will be used this season in many roles: inside
route runner, outside route runner, etc. But, barring injury, he
will be used. He said receiving coach Ivan Fears was in his corner
last season and will be again.
</P>
<P>
   `(Fears) told me from Day 1 that it wasn't in his control,''
Brisby said. ``He just told me to come out fighting every practice
and that he would let other teams know how hard I work and the type
of receiver I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby was a loyal participant of the strength and conditioning
program, missing only two of the maximum 48 workouts. All the
while, he was learning Weis's offense, taking throws from Bledsoe
and getting back into the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby followed that with strong minicamps and he's had an
excellent training camp, rivaled only by his fellow starter, Glenn.
So far, Brisby is making Tony Simmons wait a little longer to
become a starter. But he doesn't feel so bad about that. After all,
he caught 169 passes the first three years of his career and only
48 the last four. His career has been on hold long enough.

 &HT;    Cisco Systems plans to wire L.A.-area community to the hilt
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget connecting your computer to the Internet,
Cisco Systems Inc. wants to hook up your whole home.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco announced Wednesday that it was teaming up with a Los
Angeles developer to create what is being billed as the world's
most high-tech community.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for Playa Vista, west of downtown Los Angeles, call for 6
million feet of office and retail space, 13,000 homes and 30,000
residents _ all wired to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   When the development opens next year, Playa Vista homeowners
should be able to unlock their doors and turn on their lights from
their office computer or their Internet-based wireless phone. With
Internet-connected appliances, they'll be able to preheat the oven
from the upstairs bathroom or contact the refrigerator manufacturer
about a leaky connection. With Web cameras and audio equipment,
they can check in on their kids from the office or communicate with
delivery people who knock on the door when they're away. PCs can be
networked by plugging them into a phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the wired homes is an answering-machine-sized
device Cisco calls an ``Internet Home Gateway'' that allows
electronics _ be they computers or televisions or telephones _ to
be connected with each other through power lines, phone lines and
high-speed Internet service. Cisco announced in January it was
working on the gateway equipment along with Sun Microsystems Inc.,
Whirlpool Corp. and GTE Corp. Wednesday, it also formally opened a
1,700-square-foot model home at its San Jose headquarters that
demonstrates the system.
</P>
<P>
   The Playa Vista project is the first of many that Cisco wants to
wire with developers. But the networking giant also wants to sell
the gateway systems directly to consumers. The devices, when they
become available next spring, are expected to cost $500, plus
$1,500 more for wiring in a typical existing house. More advanced
home systems based on Cisco's equipment could cost anywhere from
$15,000 to $100,000. New homes will be cheaper to wire: At Playa
Vista, for instance, the Cisco-based systems add about $1,000 to
the cost of a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really ties into what Cisco thinks is going to happen to
Internet usage in the home,'' said Kristine Stewart, director of
market development for Cisco's consumer business. ``The Internet
will be like a utility, just as you have water, gas and
electricity. And because of that, it will be a natural extension to
do other things with the Internet . . . whether it's entertainment
or videoconferencing or home security.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which last year had $12.2 billion in sales, expects to
earn more than $1 billion in the home networking market within the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco became one of the world's biggest technology companies by
making servers and routers that drive the Internet and corporate
computer networks. The residential gateway equipment is its biggest
push into the consumer market. Other companies ranging from
Motorola Inc. to 3Com Corp. also are developing devices for home
networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Gadget-izing homes is nothing new, of course. Nationwide,
developers are touting technology _ everything from fiber-optic
phone lines in every room to theater-quality entertainment centers
_ as a selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Some communities are already way ahead of Playa Vista. At
Disney's Celebration community in Orlando, for example, almost
every home is wired to one another through a community Intranet. In
Georgia, the city of LaGrange recently began wiring its 27,000
residents to the Internet through cable lines and in Austin, Texas,
several developers are planning communities that feature high-tech
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers, however, have been reluctant _ or unable _ to
wire their homes to the Internet. At the end of last year, only
about 6 percent of all households had high-speed Internet access,
according to researcher International Data Corp., although the
number is expected to increase to 31 percent within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco may run into another hurdle in rolling out its new
equipment at Playa Vista.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Los Angeles is about to embark on a four-month study
into complaints of possible health and safety risks from earthquake
faults and methane gas reportedly underneath a portion of the
1,087-acre development.
</P>
<P>
   Activists also have protested that the development will harm
nearby wetlands and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Playa Vista officials say the worries are overblown and the
development is progressing as planned.

&HT;        WITH CHENEY AT HELM, HALLIBURTON BANKROLLED GOP
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Anand Giridharadas  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (July 26) - The private sector may have taken Dick
Cheney out of politics, but it did not take the politics out of
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the helm at the world's largest oil services
company, Cheney has been an active financial patron of Republican
causes - and appears to have led his firm to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based Halliburton Company - where Cheney has been
chief executive since 1995 - has become a stalwart backer of
conservative causes, pumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into
Republican war chests since Cheney's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Keith, a vice president at Halliburton, said Cheney's
position had brought the company higher visibility in Washington.
And records suggest that visibility was buttressed by a stream of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know him and he has been a presence up there. If you have
a personal knowledge of somebody, you might pay more attention to
them,'' she said. ``We try to persuade Congress to see things our
way. I would think his stature adds immeasurably to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cheney took over, Halliburton has given around $400,000
each election cycle, totaling $1.2 million over six years. All but
$40,000 of it has gone to Republicans, either as soft money - the
loosely regulated gifts to parties - or through political action
committees, which fund clusters of political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cheney arrived, Halliburton's political contributions
were far smaller and fell somewhat more evenly between the parties.
In the 1992 cycle, the company gave $67,000, a quarter of it to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have seized on Cheney's selection as an opportunity to
color the ticket as an instrument of ultra-conservative corporate
interests, particularly the oil industry. Bush is also a former
Texas oilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cheney got to Halliburton, their donations to the
Republican party shot up,'' said Democratic National Committee
spokesman J%rBM

&HT;     PELOSI VOWS TO FIGHT $6.5 MILLION CUT IN S.F. AIDS FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Nancy Pelosi vowed to fight a $6.5 million cut
in San Francisco's federal AIDS program that the House passed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot accept the premise that our region should have to
absorb this kind of cut,'' Pelosi said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was included in the five-year update of the Ryan
White Care Act, which authorizes federal money for care and
medication for people with AIDS who racted the disease through tainted blood
and died in 1990 at age 19. It serves about half a million people
each year and is expected to dole out $7.1 billion over the next
five years to states and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a member of the House Commerce
Committee's Health and Environment Subcommittee, which oversees the
Ryan White Care Act, led the fight to reduce San Francisco's share
of federal AIDS dollars and redistribute the money to 50 other
cities hard hit by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White program provides San Francisco with $5,958 a year
per AIDS case, compared to $3,055 for Oakland, $3,068 for Los
Angeles and $2,980 for Sacramento, according to the General
Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, there is extreme imbalance in the amount of
funding that is going to San Francisco versus other areas,'' Coburn
told his fellow House members during floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ``is not intended to hurt San Francisco,''
Coburn said, but the city is getting more than its fair share.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ryan White federal program began in 1991, the funding
formula was based on two factors: the density of AIDS cases in a
city (the ratio of people with AIDS relative to the city's total
population) and a city's cumulative number of AIDS cases, living
and dead. The formula gave San Francisco a huge jump in funding,
compared to other cities, because AIDS had hit the city so hard in
the early years of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress changed the formula so that it was based on
the estimated number of living people with AIDS in a city. That
change would have slashed San Francisco's funds because many AIDS
patients there had already died.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress limited the funding cuts to San Francisco's
funding to avoid disrupting existing AIDS programs there.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill and the Senate version would reduce the
size of that cushion, though the House version would do it faster.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., the original author of the Ryan
White program, said most members of Congress agree San Francisco
has been getting more than its fair share, but disagree over how
quickly the city's share should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that San Francisco strongly supports the Senate bill,''
Waxman said an interview. ``Others of us have agreed we need a
faster transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the Ryan White Care Act would cut San
Francisco's $35 million annual share of federal AIDS dollars by
only $1.7 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions now go to a House-Senate conference committee that
Pelosi hopes will produce a compromise bill that is less tough on
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to do better in conference,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi noted that the $6.5 million cut for San Francisco was
less than the $8 million cut originally proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill also would direct $30 million to state and local
health officials to notify sexual partners of people who are
infected with HIV. States would determine whether to identify HIV
positive people by name or codes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said the conflict between San
Francisco and other cities over AIDS funding stems from the fact
that Congress ``puts too little money into this and therefore
create these contests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, the answer is, we ought to be taking care of
everyone,'' Frank said. ``The notion that you have to choose
between the needy is outrageous. It is a result of the meanness of
the (Republican) budgets.''

JOHNS HOPKINS SCIENTIST TO HEAD DANA-FARBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has named as its next
president Dr. Edward J. Benz Jr., a Harvard Medical School graduate
who currently holds a prestigious chair at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Benz, a hematologist and Sir William Osler Professor of Medicine
at Hopkins, will replace Dr. David Nathan, president of DFCI since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   He will also become CEO of Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care,
which includes DFCI, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Benz, 54, rejected an offer to become editor
of the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Journal would have meant leaving my university
roots and not being able to continue doing my personal research,
Benz said Wednesday. ``And I thought on balance this was a closer
match to what I hope to be doing for the next decade or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Benz spoke by telephone from Maine, where he has a laboratory at
the Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory. He said he and his
colleagues have been studying proteins in the shark, and ``We've
been chasing a lead we think may be involved in cell growth,''
which goes awry in cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, who is retiring, said in a statement, ``I have known Ed
Benz for many years, and I can't think of anyone more perfectly
prepared to lead Dana-Farber's fight against cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the search committee that picked Benz, Harvard
Medical School Dean Joseph Martin, said, ``Dr. Benz brings much to
the Harvard medical community, and I look forward to working with
him as a close partner to foster greater research collaboration
across all of the Harvard medical institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Benz said that one of his challenges will be keeping Dana-Farber
financially strong and delivering top quality medical care while
adapting to the dictates of managed care. ``And that is getting
trickier and trickier,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Before assuming the post at Johns Hopkins, Benz was chairman of
the department of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine and prior to that was on the faculty in the department
of medicine at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Margaret Vettese, has been on the faculty of
the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. Each has adult children by a
previous marriage, and Benz said an extra lure of the Boston job
was that his daughter and his only grandchild live in New Haven,
Conn. Also, his wife's daughter lives in Boston.

<P>
   To understand why George W. Bush picked Dick Cheney for veep,
imagine this scenario:
</P>
<P>
   It's the vice presidential debate. The candidates are asked to
imagine the conditions in which they'd commit troops. Larry King
hunches into the mike and asks Al Gore's veep choice _ let's call
him Sen. Gohrveip _ if he'd send troops to save the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Larry,'' says Gohrveip, ``you have to understand that we
live in a changing world. Of shifting paradigms. Of
interconnectedness. We have to live locally, yes, but think
globally. It depends on whether threats to the environment
constitute a threat to national security, and I think that's a
debate we need to have.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, then, Mr. Cheney: Would you send troops to save the
rain forest?
</P>
<P>
   (Long look at questioner. Long look at Sen. Gohrveip. Long look
at questioner again.)
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Bush picked him. Not for his humor, his wit, his
Roman-candle persona, his tap-dancing talent or his beefcake
physique. Dick Cheney is a man who can say one syllable and make it
sound like a stack of encyclopedias dropping on an oaken desk.
Cheney has ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, we all know what he has. It's gravitas, an ancient Latin
term that means ``the precise opposite of Richard Simmons.''
Journalists love to use the word, even though it requires
definition in every story. As understood today, it means heft,
presence, stature, the look of solid contemplative calm, with a
slight touch of emotional constipation. George C. Scott, not Robin
Williams. Mr. Spock, not Dr. Smith. Russell Crowe in ``Gladiator,''
not Jim Carrey in anything.
</P>
<P>
   Gravitas is a quality the culture admires _ but only when we're
being asked to admire it. When we're asked to assume it ourselves,
well, that's a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, all candidates had gravitas. It would have been
unthinkable to attempt to stride the political stage without it:
Let us pause to imagine Woodrow Wilson playing the saxophone on a
vaudeville stage. But we no longer elect teachers, father figures,
wiser older brothers, solons and magisterial betters; we elect
peers now, because our egalitarian culture cannot stomach the
notion of ``betters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't overly encumbered with gravitas, but that's OK; lack
of gravitas didn't keep Bill Clinton out of office. Men who
entertain questions about their underwear preference do not have
gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd feel stupid asking a man about his underwear
preference, then he has gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has gravitas up the wazoo, as the gravitas-impaired press
corps would put it. He seems like an actual adult. Of course, if
anyone just grows old, stays still and keeps his mouth shut most of
the time, he has gravitas. Ringo Starr has achieved it; Jerry Lewis
has it when photographed in black-and-white in a tux, until he
sticks hot dogs up his nose. You can fake it for a while, but not
forever.
</P>
<P>
   A safe choice for Bush? Absolutely. But of course he'll take
criticism. He's Bush's dad's pick! We'll hear this a lot _ as if Al
Gore Jr.'s rise in his father's milieu was an act of stunning
coincidence. We're supposed to fear the evil reign of George
Herbert Walker, using his malleable whelp as a surrogate for his
own dark plots. Why, Daddy Bush might use his son to further his
own domestic agenda _ raise upper-class taxes and expand the
Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Cheney recalls the reign of Bush the Elder, this
isn't exactly bad news. Mr. C. was one of three tent poles that
held up the Gulf War tent; along with Stormin' Norman and Colin
Powell, his serious, precise and noncondescending interviews
assured the public that real adults were in charge here. He was the
sort of Republican the media can accept _ moderate, practical, not
one of those vacuous godbothering Rotarian Babbitts who make the
media shudder and snicker.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, why does Cheney want the job? Isn't it worth no
more than ``a bucket of warm spit''? Cheney would give a small
slight crooked smile, and perhaps correct you: ``warm saliva.''
</P>
<P>
   That's gravitas for you.

   Guide Helps Mac Users Get Out of the House  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the city that never sleeps, it can sometimes be difficult to
decide what to do. Vindigo, a ``personal navigation'' program for
Palm and Handspring Visor electronic organizers, can be considered
a digital replacement for the entertainment listings in the
newspaper or weekly city magazine _ with a little something extra.
</P>
<P>
   Vindigo, which is available free for download from
www.vindigo.com, made its debut in March. Recently the company
announced a Macintosh version of the program. The new application
will work on computers running version 8.0 or higher of the Mac
operating system. The PC version of Vindigo can also be found on
the Web site and will work on systems running Windows 95 or later.
In addition to New York, Vindigo offers city guides for Chicago,
Washington, San Francisco and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Users get more than just movie times, a shopping directory and
current nightlife events and restaurant reviews from Zagat.com and
NYToday.com (which is owned by New York Times Digital, a division
of The New York Times Co.). The Vindigo program will also give
walking directions from any starting point. For example, if you are
looking to catch a screening of the new ``X-Men'' movie, Vindigo
will tell you the show times and nearest movie houses showing the
film. The program will also give you a plot synopsis, the running
time of the film, who's starring in it and how to get there. Users
received updated information and listings from the Vindigo server
when synchronizing the Palm or Visor organizer with a computer
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which features tiny advertisements sprinkled
throughout the listings, needs a minimum of 410 kilobytes of free
space on the handheld device. Although that may be a significant
chunk of memory for some handhelds, it still may be preferable to
hauling around the old clunky tree-based media for directions to a
fine night on the town. And just think, no more ink smears on your
nice clothes. &QL;

   Study Claims Downloads Spur Offline Music Sales
</P>
<P>
   While the recorded music industry has kicked off a legal war
against Web-based music sharing, a study by Jupiter Communications
concludes that Napster and similar sites actually spur CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, an Internet commerce analysis firm, says that online
music users are 45 percent more likely than nonusers to have
increased their total music purchases over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way people interact with music is changing but in good
ways,'' said Stacey Herron, a music analyst at Jupiter. ``I don't
think music sharing technologies are a dead end for the industry.
Quite the opposite in fact. An informed consumer is a happy
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America and several
recording companies and musicians argue that Napster and other Web
services that allow people to exchange songs as MP3 files break
copyright laws and deny musicians compensation for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Herron said a preliminary examination of a survey of 2,200
online music users Jupiter made in June shows that MP3s often
inspire listeners to go out and buy CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter is also critical of a study by the trade group that
shows CD sales in stores near colleges have dropped in areas with
high levels of MP3 usage. Stacey said the study partly covers the
time before Napster began operating and does not account for other
factors that affect sales.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Curry, a spokesman for the trade group, which is part of an
effort to obtain an injunction against Napster's service, declined
to comment on the Jupiter report until his organization receives a
copy. However, he said the trade group ``stands by'' its research.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Jupiter study, however, shows that the positive impact
is not universal. Stacey said it found that most 18- to
24-year-olds who spent less than $20 on recordings over three
months have not increased their CD shopping. However, she says that
will change. ``A couple of years from now, they are going to be
adults and buying a lot of music.''

   Some New Antidotes for Computer Viruses  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of this year's nastiest computer viruses have propagated
through Microsoft Outlook. As soon as the viruses hit, they get
into the software's address book and mail copies of themselves to
every e-mail address listed.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that there were some way to lock up those address books,
effectively blocking any chance for the viruses to multiply. A
company called CopyTele has recently added a feature to one of its
high-level encryption devices that is designed to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The device called the Cryptele USS-900 plugs into a computer,
fax machine or telephone. Its primary purpose is to keep voice and
data communications private. If someone tapped the phone line, for
example, the overheard conversation would be unintelligible without
a key to unencrypt it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, engineers added the virus-protection feature. It
does not stop a virus from inflicting damage on a computer if a
malicious attachment is opened. But it does stop the virus from
replicating. ``That virus would die on your computer,'' said Frank
W. Trischetta, senior vice president for sales and marketing. The
device, which starts at around $1,000, is priced for the corporate
market. But Copytele officials say that it could be a boon to
regular consumers, too, if it succeeds in halting viruses before
they spread out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, meanwhile, has released a software patch that it says
will make its address books less vulnerable. Once the patch is
installed, the system alerts its users when an external program is
trying to gain access to the address book and asks their permission
to continue. (The update can be downloaded from
www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/).
</P>
<P>
   Because the patch is a software solution, Trischetta argued,
virus writers may be able to devise their own computer program to
get around it.

&HT;        WITH CHENEY AT HELM, HALLIBURTON BANKROLLED GOP
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Anand Giridharadas  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (July 26) - The private sector may have taken Dick
Cheney out of politics, but it did not take the politics out of
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the helm at the world's largest oil services
company, Cheney has been an active financial patron of Republican
causes - and appears to have led his firm to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based Halliburton Company - where Cheney has been
chief executive since 1995 - has become a stalwart backer of
conservative causes, pumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into
Republican war chests since Cheney's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Keith, a vice president at Halliburton, said Cheney's
position had brought the company higher visibility in Washington.
And records suggest that visibility was buttressed by a stream of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know him and he has been a presence up there. If you have
a personal knowledge of somebody, you might pay more attention to
them,'' she said. ``We try to persuade Congress to see things our
way. I would think his stature adds immeasurably to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cheney took over, Halliburton has given around $400,000
each election cycle, totaling $1.2 million over six years. All but
$40,000 of it has gone to Republicans, either as soft money - the
loosely regulated gifts to parties - or through political action
committees, which fund clusters of political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cheney arrived, Halliburton's political contributions
were far smaller and fell somewhat more evenly between the parties.
In the 1992 cycle, the company gave $67,000, a quarter of it to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have seized on Cheney's selection as an opportunity to
color the ticket as an instrument of ultra-conservative corporate
interests, particularly the oil industry. Bush is also a former
Texas oilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cheney got to Halliburton, their donations to the
Republican party shot up,'' said Democratic National Committee
spokesman Jenny Backus. ``It is no secret that captains of big
industry see Bush as their guy. I think the American people are
going to reject that. They don't want a government of big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney himself has donated $52,000 to Republicans since joining
the company. His giving list favors the most conservative members
of Congress: Sens. Trent Lott of Mississippi, Phil Gramm of Texas
and John Ashcroft of Missouri, as well as Reps. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, and Dick Armey and Tom Delay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton has given most of its money to the political action
committees and to the Republican party, which in turn spends it on
individual races. Company officials have also spent tens of
thousands of dollars sponsoring the annual House-Senate dinners,
which earns them invitations to mingle with party bigwigs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the personal donations of company employees go
overwhelmingly to the Republicans. Federal Election Commission
records show nearly 300 gifts in the last decade, all but a handful
to the GOP. More recently, 17 employees wrote checks to the Bush
campaign. Most of them gave the maximum $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think I'm the token Democrat at Halliburton,'' said
Keith, who gave Bill Clinton $1,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Already in this election cycle, the company and its employees
have put $293,000 into political coffers, and only $9,000 of it to
Democrats. That includes $124,000 to the political committees and
$129,000 in soft money. The company gave $500,000 in the 1998
off-year election, and $418,000 in the 1996 race.

POETRY IN MOTION IN THE EAST VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC KRISTAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christmas 1978 wasn't very merry in certain quarters
of the East Village. Hard drugs, sold openly on street corners,
were a present of choice for some. The air echoed with the wails of
sirens, as hook and ladders put out fires set by addicts in dozens
of abandoned buildings. As for good will toward men: the Ninth
Precinct reported 54 assaults, 157 robberies and four murders for
that December.
</P>
<P>
   That was the month that, on a particularly woebegone stretch of
Avenue B, Roland Legiardi-Laura decided to buy a loft. The cost:
$10,000 and 20 years of sweat equity. The reward: not just real
estate, but a community.
</P>
<P>
   This May, his building _ the former Tompkins Square Boys'
Lodging House, the oldest surviving structure built for the
homeless in New York _ was designated a city landmark, qualifying
its owners for low-interest loans to restore its facades. When that
happens, the exterior will finally reflect the remarkable
transformation that has taken place within. Today, the neighborhood
sports new real estate developments on almost every block. But
Legiardi-Laura's may be the most unusual of all.
</P>
<P>
   A poet and filmmaker, Legiardi-Laura, 47, is perhaps best known
as a director of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the East Village
institution he helped to revive after years of dormancy. His
colorful curriculum vitae also includes ``Azul,'' a documentary he
directed about the Nicaraguan passion for poetry, and founding
Words to Go, a traveling troupe of poets who brought verse to
museum steps and street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is beginning work on a three-part documentary about the
history and purpose of American public schooling. ``Roland is that
rarest of modern social phenomena,'' said John Gatto, the 1991 New
York State Teacher of the Year, who was the project's inspiration.
``He is a significant player in cultural and community affairs
who's not beholden to institutions or corporations _ a citizen, in
the Jeffersonian sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Legiardi-Laura is also the consummate autodidact, the sort who
knows the ages of trees in Tompkins Square Park because he dug up
the original survey maps. And he is passionate about the East
Village. Asked what he likes about it, he replied, ``I'll give you
a history of the neighborhood, briefly.'' Then he continued,
straight-faced, ``Twelve thousand years ago. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Given his flair for the offbeat and his willingness to take
risks, it is perhaps not surprising that he took on the renovation,
not just of his own space, but of much of the 15,000-square-foot
near-ruin enclosing it as well_ and with only the most basic
carpentry and construction skills. Necessity provided the goad: a
developer forced him, and two roommates, out of the
7,000-square-foot NoHo loft they had been renting for $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to sign a lease on a sweet little apartment on
First Avenue,'' he recalled, ``and I took just one more look at the
Village Voice, and there was an ad: Loft for sale; 2,000 square
feet; $20,000. I thought, OK, there's a zero in the wrong place.
But I called up, and the ad was right, and it was this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1886 by the Children's Aid Society, overlooking
Tompkins Square Park from the corner of Eighth Street and Avenue B,
the Boys' Lodging House is today the largest extant structure in
the city designed entirely by Calvert Vaux, co-creator of Central
Park. Here, newsboys and bootblacks, many orphaned, others with
parents too poor or overburdened to care for them, could get a
bath, a meal and a bed _ all for a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The nine Children's Aid Society structures designed by Vaux,
Legiardi-Laura said, ``were built as edifices to impress,'' and his
building's Victorian Gothic architecture, with its mansard roof and
arched Venetian windows, neatly fits his droll description: ``A
poor man's Dakota _ literally.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, the house was sold to Darchei Noam, a Jewish study
center, and then taken over, in the 1950's, by the East Side Hebrew
Institute. But by 1975, with the neighborhood coming apart and
hemorrhaging its Jewish population, the Hebrew Institute had moved
out.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the abandoned, decaying structure was
acquired by Maximilian Olivas, a musician and neighborhood
resident, who planned to open a school. Lacking the finances to
realize his vision, he ran the ad in the Voice, hoping to sell off
several newly planned apartments as co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place had been stripped of everything you could carry out
and sell for a fix,'' Legiardi-Laura said. ``All the copper wiring
and piping, the radiators, the marble wainscoting in the stairwell,
the stair railings and treads, the toilets and sinks _
everything.'' The space Olivas showed him, originally an open
dormitory, had been converted by the Hebrew Institute into four
classrooms accessed by a tiled hall. ``It was a mess,'' he said.
``There were leftover needles and fixings, the windows were all
broken out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he was smitten. ``I loved this building from the
moment I saw it,'' he said. ``To me, it was clear that it had value
beyond its immediate value as a residence. It had historical value,
and value of place in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Legiardi-Laura could not afford it. So he
and Olivas struck a deal. For the loft, he would pay $10,000 and
work off the rest by renovating the building and doing construction
in Olivas' own space. ``I became, in effect, an indentured
servant,'' Legiardi-Laura said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began in January 1979. Legiardi-Laura
sledge-hammered his classroom walls, then carried ``a thousand
buckets of rubble down the stairs.'' The 12 windows, enlarged to
admit more light, took 48 bitterly cold days to complete. Often, he
learned as he worked. ``And I learned the hard way. I'd plumb
something, and flush the toilet, and water would come shooting out
of the sink.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he reconstructed the building's main stairwell
out of used parts, got the boiler up and running and installed an
electrical system. Legiardi-Laura also built cabinets and sanded
floors for Olivas, and fixed up others of the building's seven
residential spaces. (Five of them remain rental apartments.)
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I lived here for three years, basically, with the
most minimal of amenities, before I could stand in the middle of
this space and there not be a pile of dust and debris,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long haul in other ways. Legiardi-Laura counted 19
fires on the block that first summer. But, he said, with typically
mordant humor, ``the drug dealers kept another pernicious class of
people out _ developers.'' Most of his poor and working-class
neighbors, he took pains to add, were in fact law-abiding citizens.
The home that eventually rose from the rubble represents,
Legiardi-Laura said, ``an organic evolution based on necessity and
availability.'' The style? ``East Village Eclectic.''
</P>
<P>
   The bathroom and kitchen, formed from the first of the
classrooms, resemble pie slices facing in opposite directions. In
the bathroom, the floor was elevated to accommodate the water
pipes; this in turn made it possible to put in a sunken tub.
Legiardi-Laura incorporated an existing column into the shower, and
added a high window both to expose the column's capital and to let
in light. The old-fashioned high-tank toilet was, he recalled,
``the first fixture I got and the cheapest thing I could buy.'' Its
rich blue in turn dictated the room's overall color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen widens steadily as it opens toward the living room,
which Legiardi-Laura felt would make both spaces more inviting.
Other decisions were less considered: the 42-inch sink height, half
a foot taller than normal, was determined when, too exhausted to do
more, he simply halved some leftover two-by-fours and built a base.
A 500-pound cast-iron stove, which burns coal, wood and gas, was
spotted in a Queens garage one day as Legiardi-Laura headed past on
the back of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   The principal living space, constructed from two classrooms,
flows the entire 50-foot length of the loft and includes what
Legiardi-Laura described as ``the world's only folding bedroom.''
The room, which is on wheels, takes 20 minutes to deconstruct and
folds like a theater flat. Open, it creates a ``cozy little hearth
area, which contains my only middle-class obsessions, my stereo
system and television.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it had been Legiardi-Laura's initial inspiration upon
first seeing the space, the library, at the loft's opposite end,
was not built for a decade. A pastiche of Wrightian and Japanese
motifs designed with the architect Johanna Woodcock, the elegant
nook is made from oak, cherry and padouk, a Malaysian hardwood.
``It's the place that nurtures my work,'' Legiardi-Laura said.
``And is the center of my home.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fourth classroom, now being used as the office of the Fifth
Night, the screenplay-reading series Legiardi-Laura began at the
Nuyorican, remains untouched. During renovations, he camped out
there, then could not decide what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   But he has a plan. ``At some point in my life I'd like to be
with someone and share my home with her,'' he said. ``For another
person to have a valuable experience, they have to be able to make
their mark, too.'' This raw space will be hers to transform.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as the space evolved, so did Legiardi-Laura's
view of it, and of himself. ``In the '60s, there was a real
debate,'' he said. ``Were you going to commit yourself to
struggling against the evils abroad, or were you going to take care
of the world around you? I made the choice that the life of my
community was the way I could be most effective.''
</P>
<P>
   An important component of that has been his loft, which he
donates for parties and presentations to causes and individuals
that he supports. Half a dozen Latin American writers have given
readings there; he was the host for a wake for the playwright
Miguel Pinero, at which the idea of resuscitating the Nuyorican was
born; and fund-raising beneficiaries have included the East Village
Parks Conservancy, of which he is a member.
</P>
<P>
   There have been more personal events, too. Allen Ginsberg
officiated at a bar mitzvah in Legiardi-Laura's living room. There
are yearly Christmas parties for some 60 children of friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, when he made a presentation to the Landmarks
Commission, Legiardi-Laura recalled the first night in his home, 21
years ago. ``It was a shell that had been pillaged by looters and
junkies,'' he said. ``There was graffiti on the walls, the scars
and smell of fires, and syringes strewn on the floors. But I do
remember waking the next morning knowing that if there was such a
thing as a building having a soul, this edifice was surely endowed
with one.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Village Voice ad would cite a price roughly 40 times
the original. Legiardi-Laura admits that his odyssey was not
initially motivated by community spirit. ``Some part of me knew
that the only way I was going to break out of the trap that had
been laid for me, as someone other than the son of the wealthy, was
to get a piece of the rock that was mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But more came with that rock than real estate, and more was
given back than manual labor. ``When I first got this place, if
someone had said, `You can have a pile of money and go buy yourself
a finished loft on the Upper West Side, or you can have this
place,' I think I would have gone for the money,'' he said. ``And I
would have been much less of a human being as a result of that.''

 &HT;    How Bush selected Cheney more intriguing than the choice itself
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - At first glance, what is most striking about Gov.
George W. Bush's selection of a running mate is not his choice,
former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, as much as the way he was
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   This impression could be due in part to an overachieving media.
The Bush campaign has flatly denied there was anything to Dan
Rather's report of an 11th-hour attempt to get retired Gen. Colin
Powell to change his mind and take the job. Even so, Bush's account
of a gradual settling on the chairman of his search committee as
the best man for the job, and Cheney's praise of Bush's persuasive
abilities, still leave some questions.
</P>
<P>
   What was it about the Republicans Cheney interviewed during his
search that caused Bush to reject them and turn back to Cheney, who
had already turned down the job? What role if any did former
President Bush play in the decision? And what about that reported
remark that his choice was ``going to make people's eyes light up
with excitement?''
</P>
<P>
   That Cheney's name does not get that reaction is at the core of
the Bush campaign's characterization of Cheney, now that he's the
nominee. He is being held up as a solid, mature, non-political
choice, a signal that Bush already has his eyes steadily trained on
the days after his election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, eager for Vice President Al Gore to select an
alternative with more pizzazz, fall right into the assumption that
Cheney is a predictable, dull choice. The rules of political irony
dictate that in such a situation, we can confidently expect Cheney
to pull at least a few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Some indirect Georgia connections are worth mentioning as they
relate to a turning point in Cheney's career. When Sen. Sam Nunn
and other Democrats shot down President Bush's first choice for
defense secretary in 1989, former Sen. John Tower of Texas, he
asked Cheney to leave his Wyoming House seat and take the job. That
opened the post of Republican whip, which Newt Gingrich ran for and
won by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   One reason congressional Democrats remember Cheney more fondly
than Gingrich and Texas Rep. Tom DeLay, the current whip, is that
the Republicans were still a distinct minority when he was around.
But he has a voting record in Congress every bit as conservative as
his successors, something the Democrats have lost no time in
pointing out.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and buttoned-down though he may be, the selection of
Cheney brings up questions about the other choices Bush would make
as president.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis of the impact of two or three Bush appointees
to the U.S. Supreme Court suggested the court might move further to
the right on gun control and other issues, but stop short of
radical revisions such as overturning Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Such logic is much too fuzzy for the Democrats' purposes, and
Cheney's voting record on abortion gives them ammunition with which
to attack it. In the days leading up to the convention in
Philadelphia, this is likely to lead to more discussion of exactly
what ``compassionate conservatism'' means.
</P>
<P>
   More than either campaign seems to have anticipated, this could
end up being an election divided along traditional
liberal-conservative lines.

&HT;     COMPANY TAKES ACTION AGAINST WEB SITES FEATURING NUDE
CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROY BRAGG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Rackspace.com, a San Antonio technology company
that provides Web space for hire, has been hosting more than a
dozen Internet sites that feature pictures of nude children.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would pull the plug on those Web pages,
which feature explicit and sexually suggestive pictures of girls
purported to be as young as 8.
</P>
<P>
   Though no genitalia were directly exposed, most of the girls had
exposed pelvic areas. All of them were bare-chested.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the girls were smiling in the photographs; others wore
heavy amounts of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not previously seen it,'' Rackspace.com chief executive
Graham Weston said Tuesday of one of the sites, a day after being
notified of it by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it and ordered that we pull the plug on it. And as far
as any other Web site is concerned, if it contains pictures of
children, it will be gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston said his lawyers have advised him that the company must
fulfill contractual obligations in the process of canceling the
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Weston called the decision a change in policy for the year-old
company, which in the past would yank a site only if law
enforcement officials found that it contained pornographic
material.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Weston said most Web hosting companies
do not monitor the content of sites they host, and that he was
reluctant to get into the censorship business.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed after he pulled up one of the Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be in the position of judging, but we just
decided to draw the line in a different space,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, it puts us in the position of interpretation, but
we don't want to have pictures of children like that on our site.''
</P>
<P>
   Rackspace.com leases Web server space for more than 1,400 small-
to medium-size business clients who together run thousands of
Internet sites in 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has plans for international expansion, has
filed papers to issue stock in a public offering, though no date
has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Better A Millstone, a Monterey, Calif.-based organization that
targets the exploitation of children in sexually explicit material,
discovered that Rackspace.com was hosting at least a dozen sites
that prominently feature nude pictures of boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Organization officials were pleased with Rackspace.com's
decision to pull the sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad that they've been shown the light of day, and that
they're willing to do the right thing,'' assistant director Bryan
Givens said.
</P>
<P>
   He had initiated contact with Rackspace.com in April about the
sites, but described the company's technical staff as
uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I wish this would've been worked out earlier,''
Givens said. ``Most of the Web-hosting companies and providers
react immediately when we call them and ask them to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Rackspace had done that. I hope that their
powers-that-be and their staff have a new attitude.''
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rackspace.com arrived at its decision even though law
enforcement officials say the pictures probably are able to skirt
the restrictions of the Child Protection Act of 1984, a federal law
that specifies the criteria for child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal law, children must be minors and be
involved in sexually explicit conduct for the image to be construed
as pornographic, said Charles Harrison, associate agent in charge
at the U.S. Customs Service, which investigates reports of child
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the key element is `sexually explicit conduct,'''
Harrison said. ``It is not as straightforward as you might expect
when you deal with pornographic issues. You deal with subjective
interpretations and community issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Scott Poth of the San Antonio Police Department's Vice
Squad said local law enforcement defines that conduct, with respect
to child pornography, as any depiction of a child in real or
simulated intercourse or other sexual activity. Any ``lewd
depiction'' of genitalia would also make a picture pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said, however, that a picture could be within the
bounds of the law _ showing a lone, nude child posed behind a desk,
for example _ but it could be construed as ``sexually explicit'' if
it runs alongside other, more hard-core pornographic pictures, or
even with text that implies explicit sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is hierarchical, with an organized system for
assigning domains, or Internet addresses. Private companies doing
business on U.S. servers must register this domain name and its
corresponding numerical coding with Network Solutions, the Herndon,
Va.-based Internet registrar for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But records on file with Network Solutions showed inaccurate
mailing addresses for at least two of the sites, Givens said. And
that, according to Network Solutions spokeswoman Cheryl Regan,
could violate the contracts of those Web sites, meaning they could
lose the rights to their domains.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites hosted by Rackspace.com focus primarily on girls,
though one site features boys. Each has links to other, hard-core
adult sites, as well as to Web sites that focus on ``child love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about Calvin Klein ads or something like
that,'' said Mike Echols, founder of Better A Millstone. ``We're
talking about egregious and disturbing images when we're talking
about these photos.''

 &HT;    EDITORIAL _A heavy burden on the border
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late last month, U.S. District Judge Royal Furgeson stepped down
from his bench to sit as a witness before a congressional
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who presides over the Pecos Division of the U.S.
Western District, had a lot to say about life near the border.
</P>
<P>
   He told members of the subcommittee of the Committee on
Government Reform that a federal get-tough policy on illegal
immigration and drug trafficking was equally tough on the people
and facilities of the federal court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, the first full year that I presided over the criminal
docket of the Pecos Division, 45 criminal cases were filed,''
Furgeson testified. ``Last year, 386 criminal cases were filed, an
800 percent increase. ... (I)n the first five months of 2000, 252
criminal cases have been filed in the Pecos Division, an average of
50 each month. I expect over 600 criminal cases to be filed by the
end of this year, resulting in a 55 percent increase over last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pecos Division is 30,450 square miles of West Texas that are
among the least-populated in the state. The realities of the drug
business and traffic in illegal immigrants make this area ideal for
entrepreneurs in illegal and clandestine activities.
</P>
<P>
   However isolated the Pecos Division may be, it does not lack
champions for battling its overwhelming burden. Federal judges from
California to Texas, said Furgeson, are carrying felony caseloads
10 times the national average. The numbers paint a picture of
judges forced to dispense assembly-line justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major frustration of the judiciary that we have been
unable to adequately explain to the Congress and to the American
people that criminal activity on the border cannot be addressed
simply by increasing law enforcement efforts,'' Furgeson told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, those arrested for crimes must come through the
rest of the criminal justice system. ...If the courts do not have
the resources to deal with the increases, the delivery of justice
is jeopardized and will be eventually impaired.''
</P>
<P>
   As a stopgap, federal judges from Louisiana are flying in to
help. But more courts with the appropriate personnel are needed and
should be created now.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, joined by colleagues
from other border states, is pushing for the creation of 13 more
federal judgeships. It would be two years, however, before the
first of those judges took office and that would occur only if the
bill passes and the politics of selecting those judges is kept to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal problems become headaches for counties along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Elliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, notes the federal
shortcomings have spawned an unfunded mandate for border counties.
``Federal authorities in El Paso no longer prosecute marijuana
cases under 125 pounds. This policy has shifted 500 cases to
district attorney Jaime Esparza's office.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, Shapleigh said, that counties along the border have
to pick up the costs of incarcerating those defendants, hire
court-appointed lawyers for them and bear the costs of trying them.
</P>
<P>
   So exasperated are border prosecutors that some are refusing to
accept cases federal prosecutors want to unload on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like trade, drug (trafficking) has shifted from east to west
to north to south,'' Shapleigh noted. Texas border counties are
``17th in population and 156th in tax base. These are counties that
can least afford to take these cases. We can't have border
communities bearing the burden of national justice.''
</P>
<P>
   He's absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   Esparza was quoted in the El Paso Times as saying that the price
tag attached to prosecuting federal cases ranges from $2 million to
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should pay attention to these genuine fiscal concerns.
More judges, prosecutors and detention facilities are needed along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the federal government's get-tough policy is going to
punish more border county judges, commissioners, prosecutors and
sheriffs _ not to mention taxpayers _ than it does crooks.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL _ Is it a surplus or a shortfall? Both
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they might say in a movie classic, we're in Chinatown now _ a
subtle realm where things are rarely what they seem and never
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Recent news stories about the state budget may remind taxpayers
of a moment in ``Chinatown.'' Actress Faye Dunaway confesses her
character's shocking family secret, in which two seemingly
contradictory facts are both true.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer's mythical Austin remake, she confesses ``It's a
shortfall, it's a surplus, it's a shortfall, it's a surplus, it's a
shortfall'' until viewers slowly grasp that both these seemingly
contradictory facts are true.
</P>
<P>
   State agencies are spending more money than the Legislature
authorized for the current two-year budget period. That much seems
undisputed. Rapidly escalating medical and prison costs, among
other problems, will leave the state over its budget. The exact
amount of the shortfall remains to be tallied.
</P>
<P>
   But the state also is taking in money faster than estimated in
spring 1999, when the budget became final. That creates an income
surplus. When the Legislature convenes in January, it will have to
raid the surplus to cover the shortfall, rather than rolling the
extra money forward or socking it away into the state's sadly
depleted rainy day fund. (The fund is well-named: Budget writers
figure it would cover about one day of state operations.)
</P>
<P>
   State budget developments have become a particularly hot topic
because of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential candidacy. His
critics say cost overruns prove the tax cuts he insisted on were
ill-advised and that budgets for social services were unrealistic.
They've blasted Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander, a Bush ally,
for exaggerating estimates of the surplus to save the boss
political embarrassment. And they suggest that agencies are
low-balling spending estimates for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Rising costs, a puny rainy day fund and a budget overrun likely
to exceed $400 million on a $98 billion two-year budget don't add
up to happy news. When financial publications such as The Bond
Buyer start talking about ``the Texas-sized hole in the state's
annual budget,'' it looks bad, even if the overspending won't break
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Rylander and most other budget insiders predict that revenue
surplus will cover the budget deficit, barring disaster. Enactment
of a bigger than usual ``emergency spending bill'' in January will
most likely tidy up the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the budget flap rattled the governor enough for him to
dent his nice-guy image. ``It's a little early to project the
amount of money the Legislature will be dealing with,'' Bush told
reporters. ``And as you know, I hope I'm not here to deal with it.
I'm seeking another office.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lull in talk about ``the smirk,'' a much-analyzed Bush
facial expression, his supporters can't have been happy for him to
produce the expression's verbal equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mario Gallegos Jr., for one, was unamused. ``The last
time I looked, he's still the governor of Texas,'' the Houston
Democrat remarked tartly.
</P>
<P>
   He's the governor, he's the candidate, he's the governor, he's
the candidate.

REPORT SAYS LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IS LAGGING ON NEW MEDIA

(EDS: budgeted earlier as LIBRARY-OF-COMMERCE) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Library of Congress is charged with collecting the creative
work of the American people. This has come to include such varied
output as the papers of Thomas Jefferson and the Wright brothers,
the original compositions of Leonard Bernstein and the video
archives of the Martha Graham Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's creativity now extends to Web sites, electronic
journals and magazines, and CD-ROMs of every sort, and the library
has fallen behind in collecting and archiving that digital
material, according to a report released on Wednesday by the
National Academy of Sciences. Unless its administrators act
swiftly, the report says, the library will risk diminishing
relevance.
</P>
<P>
   The 260-page report is the most comprehensive overview to date
of the Library of Congress' digital preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's creativity is at this point significantly
represented by what's happening electronically,'' said James
O'Donnell, vice provost of information systems and computing at the
University of Pennsylvania and chairman of the committee that
produced the National Academy's report. The committee included
outside experts in digital libraries, databases, computer
networking and digital preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep the mission of the library what it has been, the
change in the landscape brought about by networked information is
dramatic and brings about unavoidable challenges for the library,''
O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Those challenges are, of course, shared by scores of other
research libraries faced with the task of collecting, making
accessible and preserving the nation's assorted electronica:
scholarly journals, books and magazines published in electronic
form; multimedia products like CD-ROMs; digital photographs, music
and films; and millions of miscellaneous pieces of Internet-based
material.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the report stated, there are built-in limits to the
library's ability to respond quickly to trends: As a creature of
Congress, it is often mired in governmental bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it saw ``signs that the library is already
losing the momentum and purchase required to make the next steep
ascent'' to respond to the new challenges ``in a timely and
effective way.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is inadequate infrastructure. The library urgently
needs a sophisticated system for receiving and managing digital
documents deposited with the library and registered for copyright.
The library also needs to recruit and retain computer experts from
a field already suffering a labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The report also emphasized the need for the library to
collaborate with other national libraries and institutions. Ann
Okerson, a committee member who is associate university librarian
at Yale University, said: ``At a time when we are trying to build
large, interconnected systems, it is unlikely that a single
institution could create such complicated systems independently of
other key players. That goes for the Library of Congress or any
other large library or organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee expressed less concern over the library's ongoing
efforts to make digital copies of items in its physical collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digitizing your analog material is less urgent,'' O'Donnell
said. ``You can manage that by asking: `What's there a need for?
Why should it be made digital?' But if you don't do it this year,
it'll still be there in five years, and you could do it then.
Digital information that you're losing is probably lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, who commissioned
the study two years ago, said he was encouraged by the committee's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as extremely positive that they are stressing the
importance of this,'' Billington said in an interview. He pointed
out that a Digital Futures group within the library is already at
work on many of the problems pinpointed by the National Academy
report. But the report, he said, brings a renewed sense of urgency
to the situation. ``We've seen that this is a problem, and we now
have a strong reinforcement for doing something on it at a more
accelerated rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a set of recommendations only, and the library is
not required to act on them. Margaret Hedstrom, a committee member
who is an associate professor in the School of Information at the
University of Michigan, said, ``I suppose to some degree, a test of
how serious they are is which of them they act on, and how soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Billington said one of the main obstacles to carrying out the
report's recommendations is financing. In its 2001 budget request,
the library asked for a $21 million increase for digital archiving,
but the actual increase will probably fall far short of that. ``A
major unresolved issue is how to fund this effort,'' Billington
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Private partnerships are one answer. Six years ago, the library
embarked on the National Digital Library Program, paid for in large
part by corporations, foundations and individual donors. By the end
of this year, the library will have placed 5 million of its 119
million items on its American Memory site (memory.loc.gov), for use
by the public. The site gets more than 4 million hits each day,
most of them from schoolchildren who go there to view artifacts
like old baseball cards, Lincoln's papers and historic pamphlets
from the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
</P>
<P>
   A few other pieces of the digital puzzle are falling into place.
The library has preserved many of its digital resources, including
the full-text databases of the Thomas system for legislative
information and its own bibliographic databases.
</P>
<P>
   The library has an extensive collection of CDs and CD-ROMs, and
it is about to sign an agreement with the American Physical
Society, which will regularly deposit its eight online physics
journals. The library is also referring researchers to databases
that serve as portals to specialized sources of online information,
including the table of contents of 10,000 journals and the full
text of every doctoral dissertation written in the United States
since 1861.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the rapid clip at which digital information of all
kinds is proliferating has caught the Library of Congress largely
unprepared,'' O'Donnell said. ``The sheer quantity of networked
information is astonishing, and it keeps increasing at astonishing
rates.''  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the course of studying the library's digital future,
committee members pondered some fundamental questions. What, for
instance, constitutes a publication? And what really deserves to be
saved?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you accept that the Internet should also be collected, what
does that mean?'' asked Ginnie Cooper, director of libraries for
the Multnomah County Library in Portland, Ore., and a committee
member. ``Today's Internet? Tomorrow's? All? And do you collect
just the first layer of a Web page and none of the links? Three
layers? Ten?''
</P>
<P>
   The library applies the same criteria to digital material that
it applies to physical material, Davenport said. ``We say, `If you
would have been selecting it in physical form, then select it,'''
she said. ``The format does not make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Merely archiving digital material isn't enough, however. The
Library of Congress and other research libraries are wrestling with
the problem of finding an effective means of preserving it. Much
digital material is actually more vulnerable than its
acid-free-paper counterparts. That is because computer hardware and
software quickly become obsolete, and the durability of magnetic
storage media like tapes and disks is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based documents that are filled with links pose yet another
preservation problem because keeping an electronic research paper
vital and relevant means keeping its links alive.
</P>
<P>
   Billington said the library is looking into a number of
preservation methods.
</P>
<P>
   In general, O'Donnell said, ``I think they've done a worthy job
of thinking their way through some pilots, saying, `Let's dip our
toe firmly into the water and see what we can do.' We say, `We
applaud that, but now it's time to jump in.'''

WHEN INSTALLING A FLOOR-MOUNTED TOILET, A TIGHT SEAL IS IMPORTANT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Installing a floor-mounted toilet _ as opposed to the type
mounted on a wall _ is not difficult, but it has to be done
carefully and methodically or else the toilet will leak.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying a new toilet, remove the old one and measure the
''rough-in'' dimension. This is the distance from the wall behind
the toilet to the two closet bolts projecting up from the floor
flange.
</P>
<P>
   The rough-in is the amount of space that you need to fit the new
toilet in. Some toilets need a 12-inch rough-in, while others
require a 13-inch rough-in. The new toilet can have a shorter
rough-in _ this will provide extra space behind it _ but it cannot
have a longer rough-in. So it is better to have some extra space
than too little.
</P>
<P>
   The most common type of floor-mounted toilet comes in two
pieces, the bowl and the tank. This is sometimes called a
close-coupled toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of toilet has the bowl and tank joined in one
piece.
</P>
<P>
   The installation procedure for both types is the same, but it is
harder to install a one-piece toilet simply because the unit is
heavier than the close-coupled model.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential that an installed toilet remains fixed and
immobile. A toilet that tilts or pitches, even slightly, when
someone uses it indicates that the joists and supporting floor are
weak. These should be braced before installing the new unit.
</P>
<P>
   When you purchase a new toilet and get it home, remove the
wrapping and look carefully at all parts to make sure there are no
cracks or defects.
</P>
<P>
   Possible defects include a deformed inlet (the opening between
the bowl and tank), a warped horn (the outlet piece that projects
from the base of the toilet) or a misshapen base.
</P>
<P>
   Also make sure that all the hardware as well as the tank
mechanism is included. Keep the carton, wrapping material and
paperwork in case you have to return a defective unit.
</P>
<P>
   When you remove the old toilet, the flange will still be screwed
to the floor with two closet bolts projecting upward through slots
in the flange. You can use these, provided they are in good
condition. If the bolts are rusted or corroded, they should be
replaced. You will have to buy new closet bolts, as they are not
part of the hardware kit that comes with the new toilet.
</P>
<P>
   You will also have to buy a wax gasket. The gasket forms the
seal around the toilet horn and prevents leaks. Plumbers differ on
whether it is better to place the gasket onto the horn and then
push the toilet in place on the floor flange, or to position the
gasket on the flange and lower the toilet onto it. Either method
will work, provided you maneuver the toilet carefully onto the
flange to avoid damaging or distorting the soft wax gasket. Turn
the bowl upright and lower it slowly onto the closet bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Some books suggest that you press down hard with your full
weight to seat the bowl and shape the gasket to make a watertight
seal. If you try this, be very careful to apply even pressure to
the toilet rim. If you lean too hard on one side, you will distort
the wax gasket and it will eventually leak. Also be careful of
applying too much pressure; this could also distort the gasket.
</P>
<P>
   A better way to seat the bowl is by tightening the nuts on the
closet bolts. Start on one side and give the nut five or six turns
then move to other side and do the same. Repeat this alternate
tightening routine until the bowl is snug to the floor. Do not
overtighten these nuts or you could crack the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to mount the tank onto the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The installation procedure for the tank is straightforward;
detailed instructions should be included with the toilet hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Invert the tank so the large opening, the flush-valve outlet,
mates with the inlet opening on rear of the toilet rim. Push the
two tank bolts through the bottom the tank and bowl rim. Align the
tank so it is parallel with the rear wall, then tighten the bolts.
Hook up the supply tube to the inlet opening under the tank and
turn on the water.
</P>
<P>
   The last step is to draw a bead of caulk around the base of the
toilet and the finish floor.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good idea, however, to wait a week before doing this.
This will allow time for you to inspect the toilet base for any
leaks that may occur around the wax seal. With the caulk bead in
place, these leaks may be blocked and run under the floor where
they will remain undetected until the water damages the space
below. &QL;

CLINTON HOPES TIME WILL HEAL PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two weeks of deal-making that ended without a
deal, President Clinton said Wednesday that the key to a Middle
East peace agreement was more time for internal debate and
reflection by the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the U.S. envoy for the region, Dennis Ross,
would travel there in the coming weeks to gauge any
post-summit-meeting progress, but officials ruled out follow-up
negotiations in the United States any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is going to be an agreement here, it must be one
which meets the legitimate interests of both parties,'' Clinton
told reporters at the White House. ``And that requires a certain
imagination and flexibility of defining those interests and
figuring out an institutional and legal framework for them that,
frankly, just takes more time and more reflection and probably less
pressure than was available in our 15 days at Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the historic nature of the talks, he added, ``You've got
to get used to talking about something for a little bit before you
can then entertain how you can create an edifice that you hadn't
previously imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials Wednesday refused to disclose details of
the back and forth of the closed-door negotiations. They said they
believed that they would have to build on the progress of the Camp
David talks in the coming months, and did not want to hamper future
deals by disclosing the Israeli and Palestinian negotiating
positions.
</P>
<P>
   As they looked back on the negotiations, White House officials
did describe Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel as being far more
willing to deal than Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians, with respect particularly to the issue of
Jerusalem, were not as prepared to compromise,'' Sandy Berger, the
president's national security adviser, said in an interview on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the talks enabled Clinton Wednesday to turn his
sights back to his domestic agenda. He staged events celebrating
the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and
criticizing Republican tax cut plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the president, responding to questions from reporters,
eagerly offered a post-mortem of the talks. He said a deal would
emerge only when both sides accepted partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any negotiation, it must be possible for both sides to say
they got most of what they wanted and needed, that they were not
routed from the field, that there was honorable compromise,'' he
said. ``The issues cannot be framed in a `you have to lose in order
for me to win' and `in order for you to win, I have to lose'
framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the two parties faced possible violence in the weeks
leading up to Sept. 13, the date on which Arafat has said he will
declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties do face a fundamental crossroads,'' Berger said.
``Down one road is confrontation and conflict. Down the other road
is an agreement and peace, and that involves compromise.''

<P>
   The first thing that comes to mind when you think of
Italian-American food is probably pizza. Followed, perhaps, by
spaghetti and meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many newer and more interesting ways to put the
two culinary cultures together for those who want something simple
and different.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer season when the corn is as high as an elephant's
eye _ unlike last summer when there was so little rain in the East
_ I want to use the ears on every possible occasion. (This year it
is so sweet, I've even eaten it raw.)
</P>
<P>
   What more natural combination than fresh corn to give texture
and sweetness to the Italian version of cornmeal _ polenta. The
fresh corn is all-American; the polenta, distinctly Italian. And so
is the use of sage with polenta. The powerful herb adds a pungency
to the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in Parmigiano Reggiano and you have a very fresh and rustic
Italian-American creation.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the time of year to use fresh herbs wherever they
might add some fragrance and flavor to greens that otherwise seem a
bit bland. I have suggested basil, thyme and oregano for the mixed
green salad, but you can use any combination of herbs that appeals
to you: chervil, marjoram, rosemary, etc.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ Sleek electric signs appeared in late June
over the neo-Renaissance balustrades that frame the walkways of the
Tromostovje, or Three Bridges, at the heart of this capital. Had
the signs offered directions to the business district or a historic
landmark, they would have attracted scant attention in a city where
past and present mingle easily. But these signs, created by Selja
Kameric, a Sarajevo artist, are meant to conjure up the new Europe,
or one vision of it.
</P>
<P>
   In large white letters against a vibrant blue background,
evoking the notices that direct arriving passengers toward Customs
at many European airports, the words ``European Union'' beckon,
illuminated from behind at night. On the other side of the
Ljubljnica River, in black and white, is just one word: ``Other.''
</P>
<P>
   Kameric, 23, is one of 59 artists and groups from both European
Union nations and the ``other'' Europe _ countries like Poland,
Macedonia, Slovakia, Russia and Kameric's native Bosnia and
Herzegovina _ whose works are being exhibited here, near the
frontier that long divided Europe into East and West. They are part
of Manifesta 3, the European Biennial of Contemporary Art, which
continues until Sept. 24; the exhibition contains no traditional
painting or sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manifesta wants to reflect Europe,'' said Kathrin Rhomberg, an
Austrian who is one of the show's four curators. ``But it is a very
difficult thing to do because Europe is such a complex and
unhomogeneous continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Manifesta 3 offers a snapshot of a Europe where the political
distinction of East and West has given way to a web of new
divisions. Scattered among Ljubljana's public squares and museums
are works ranging from semidocumentary videos to highly conceptual
installations that address issues like inclusion in or exclusion
from the European Union or NATO; national identity; immigration;
and conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop talking about East vs. West,'' said Maria
Hlavajova, a Manifesta 3 curator who is the former director of the
Soros Center for Contemporary Art in Bratislava, Slovakia, and now
works in Utrecht in the Netherlands. ``We want Eastern artists
mingled with Western artists. You have to put all these countries
in a box and shake them up differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Manifesta go back to 1993, when a group of Dutch
arts professionals decided to organize a biennial that would create
a pan-European colloquy. They wanted the show to be nomadic, with a
new host city and new team of curators every two years, to reflect
an ever-changing Europe.
</P>
<P>
   More established exhibitions like Dokumenta in Kassel, Germany,
or the Venice Biennale have rarely included artists from outside
the European Union. And exhibitions that focused solely on art from
the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe segregated artists,
Manifesta's founders felt.
</P>
<P>
   The first Manifesta was held in 1996 in Rotterdam. In 2 1/2
months the exhibition attracted several hundred artists, curators
and critics and 20,000 viewers. Two years later the exhibition
moved to Luxembourg and this year, for Manifesta's first foray
beyond the European Union, more than 1,000 people traveled here for
the opening during the last weekend in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go to Manifesta a lot more than to other
biennials,'' said Sonja Wilk, a curator at the Nordic Institute for
Contemporary Art in Finland, who came from her native Norway. ``I
knew that here the art would probably surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the art was created for this show. For instance,
``Exchange 2000'' is a recorded radio broadcast in which people of
different ethnicities discuss problems caused by immigration,
obliquely addressing the psychological borders erected by
nationalism. Daniel Jewesbury, who lives in Belfast, said he had
created the piece because of his ``discomfort at being a citizen of
Fortress Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A room-size installation by Stalker, a decade-old group with
headquarters in the Campo Boario section of Rome, a magnet for
recent arrivals from Moldova, Senegal and Kurdistan, focuses on
immigration to the European Union. Called ``Transborderline,'' it
consists of a room bisected by a floor-to-ceiling spiral of plastic
tubing. As visitors shuffle through the passageway, white soccer
balls, many inscribed by the residents of Campo Boario, roll from
place to place. One, signed Mebin Biger, reads in English: ``Kurde
from Turkey. At the 5 mounth I live in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   In another large installation, Pravdoliub Ivanov has arrayed
more than a dozen brightly colored, battered teapots and kettles on
hot plates, connecting them to a network of black electrical cords
that snake across the floor. The water in the vessels never quite
reaches a full boil. Ivanov, who lives in Bulgaria, calls his 1998
work ``Transformation Always Takes Time and Energy.''
</P>
<P>
   To create Anton Olshvang's `Battlefield,'' discarded home
photographs, rejects purchased from photo-processing laboratories
near the provincial Russian city of Samara, were enlarged to the
size of posters and mounted with the triangular corner tabs used in
old photo albums. The images create what Olshvang calls an
``unconscious'' portrait of contemporary Russian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Among the numerous videos is Agnese Bule's ``Discover Latvia,''
a wry 1950s-style faux documentary that spins a myth about the
origins of the Latvian nation. The war in Kosovo is the subject of
the 1999 videos ``Simple Instrument'' and ``How to Make a Refugee''
by Phil Collins, who lives in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   In one, an interviewer asks a series of simple questions, like
``Do you ever wear a hat?'' and ``What is a border?'' ``A border,''
says one woman, ``is something that makes you problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders is the theme of Manifesta 3. During the year Rhomberg,
Hlavajova and their colleagues traversed Europe to select artists
for the show, they were struck, they say, by new borders, both
geographical and psychological, reflected in the work they saw.
They were also influenced by the war in Kosovo, which was about to
break out a few hundred miles to the east of this city when the
curators met in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new borders seem to have risen in Europe's cultural
community. Olshvang, who lives in Moscow but has worked in the
Netherlands and the United States, said that much of ``the place
that is in between'' East and West was still routinely ignored by
the Western art world, a criticism shared by other artists from
Eastern Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Dunja Blazevic, a curator from Sarajevo, said her country
suffered from a cultural isolation that did not exist when it was
part of the former Yugoslavia, and its artists and intellectuals
often worked with colleagues from the West. But, she said,
``Manifesta is the only international biennial in which the two
parts of Europe _ and there are really still two parts _ are
connected.''

 &HT;    Ole Miss has first legitimate Heisman candidate since Archie
Manning
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Birmingham _ The last time the University of Mississippi had a
legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate, Richard Nixon was president
and the Watergate was just a hotel complex.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday here at the SEC preseason meetings, Mississippi
officially began the Heisman campaign for running back Deuce
McAllister. It is the school's first since Archie Manning in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a chance,'' Vanderbilt coach Woody Widenhofer
said. ``Deuce has got all the skills you look for in a great
player. We will see him at the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   The pros agree. The National Football Scouting Service, one of
two combines for 27 NFL teams, has rated him the No. 1 prospect for
the 2001 Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who was the No. 2 rusher on his team last
season. Joe Gunn led the Rebels in rushing with 978 yards.
McAllister had 930, which included four consecutive games over 100
yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-1, 222-pound McAllister will get into the Heisman race
because of his amazing versatility as a runner, pass receiver and
kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Last season McAllister set a Mississippi record with
</P>
<P>
   1,682 all-purpose yards. He broke Parker Hall's 61-year-old
record of 1,592 yards. In 1998, McAllister became only the second
Mississippi back to rush for 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   This season, McAllister, from Morton, Miss., will touch the ball
in every conceivable fashion, coach David Cutcliffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's by far the most complete player I've been around, and
I've been around some pretty good ones,'' said Cutcliffe, a
longtime Tennessee assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a 225- pounder who can run a legitimate 4.3 (in the
40-yard) dash and can bench 400 pounds,'' the coach said. ``He's a
very special talent.''
</P>
<P>
   McAllister is no ordinary Heisman candidate. He came to
Mississippi as an honors graduate from high school. He once
performed at Carnegie Hall with his high school choral group.
Earlier this year, he spent three weeks in Costa Rica in an
accelerated study program to pick up some extra credits in Spanish.
He plans to graduate in December with a degree in criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deuce is not only a great football player,'' Cutcliffe said,
``but he's the kind of guy you want to represent the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   McAllister could have turned pro after his junior season and
become financially secure. But he decided to return to lead a
Mississippi team that legitimately can compete for the SEC Western
Division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt that if I'm destined to play in the NFL, it will
be out there,'' he said. ``Getting my degree is important,
especially to my mother. I just wanted to see how good this team
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The early favorites for the Heisman are quarterbacks Michael
Vick (Virginia Tech), Drew Brees (Purdue) and Chris Weinke (Florida
State). But Mississippi has committed significant resources to the
effort of getting their man into the minds of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister has his own Web site (thedeuceisloose.com). The
school will send out schedule cards and postcards bearing his
likeness, and Mississippi's first three games are televised.
</P>
<P>
   If McAllister is going to make a serious run at the Heisman, the
key dates will be Oct. 14 and Nov. 23. On Oct. 14, the Rebels
travel to Tuscaloosa to meet Alabama, which should be ranked in the
top five nationally. A great performance against the Crimson Tide
would go a long way towards McAllister's hopes.
</P>
<P>
   If McAllister still is a Heisman candidate in November, he will
play his last regular-season game against Mississippi State on
Thanksgiving night on national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we've got to win some big games, and I'm going to
have to make some plays in those games,'' McAllister said. ``It's
still about what happens on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   McAllister already has had several conversations with Manning,
who did not win the trophy, on how to handle the Heisman hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archie and I have talked about how to handle certain
situations and the importance of making yourself available to the
media,'' McAllister said. ``But I've grown up watching Michael
Jordan and Magic Johnson and now Tigers Woods handle themselves. I
know that all you can do is be yourself. I'm just going to let it
happen.''

GOP TO REVIEW N.H.'S FIRST-IN-THE-NATION PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With some Republicans openly peeved at New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary status, the political pride of the
Granite state is on the chopping block as members of the Republican
National Committee explore a new system of nominating presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have long called New Hampshire's continuing
starring role unfair. With the growth of the Republican party in
the Southwest and West, many Republicans wonder why any lawmaker
seeking the party's nomination should have to begin with voters in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, with California's decision to hold its primary
March 7th, the GOP nomination was effectively wrapped up before
voters in about two-thirds of the other states had an opportunity
to cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rules Committee has about had it,'' said Tom Rath, a
leading New Hampshire Republican and a member of the committee.
``The whole process is very much in flux.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Rules Committee took no action that would affect
New Hampshire or Iowa, other than holding a series of test votes to
ferret out friends and foes of the various restructuring plans.
More debate and votes could come Friday at the first meeting of the
convention rules committee.
</P>
<P>
   Three options are currently in play, with serious consequences
for New Hampshire's political tradition.
</P>
<P>
   --The Delaware plan would have a dozen of the smallest states
hold their primaries first in March, followed by medium-sized
states and then by the largest states. New Hampshire and Iowa,
which holds the first-in-the-nation caucuses, would be treated like
any other state under this system.
</P>
<P>
   --The Ohio plan would let the smallest states hold their
primaries first, followed by states in one region of the country to
the next. Those regions would rotate their order every presidential
election. And Iowa and New Hampshire would continue to precede
every other state.
</P>
<P>
   --The flexibility option, which is backed by New Hampshire
Republicans, would shelve the Delaware plan and allow the RNC to
decide on nominating rules in between conventions, as well as to
negotiate on primary dates with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from California and New York have threatened an ugly
floor fight on Monday, the first day of the convention, if the RNC
approves the Delaware plan. In response, operatives working on
behalf of Texas Governor George W. Bush have made it clear that the
presumptive nominee would prefer the flexibility plan, avoiding any
confrontation and putting off a permanent solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party faces none of this same squabbling because
its rules already dictate that no state other than Iowa or New
Hampshire may hold its primary or caucus earlier than the first
Tuesday in March.

GORE ZEROES IN ON CHENEY CONSERVATISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore and his campaign Wednesday
opened a new front in their attacks against Texas Governor George
W. Bush by focusing on the conservative voting record of Bush's new
running mate, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign hopes that the former Wyoming representative's
votes will become a campaign issue and excite Democratic
constituencies who have been ho-hum about Gore. They also hope it
will skew perceptions of the Republican ticket just ahead of next
week's GOP convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The first salvo was fired here on the opening day of the
convetion of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, a group based
in the swing state of Illinois, where black voters can make a
decisive difference in the election.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the coalition's board of directors, Gore attacked
the perception of Bush and Cheney as moderates. He also appealed to
black voters to shed their cyncism about politics and turn out in
November. ``I will not let you down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore applauded Republicans for being ``smart enough to know that
people do not want to go back'' to the economic, racial and social
problems of the past. But, he said, ``They have concocted a
strategy of phrases and photo opportunities to convey the
impression of... moderation. I expect even more of it when the
Republicans gather next week in Philadelphia. I'll tell you, it's
going to be quite a show,'' he said, quickly adding, ``but you and
I know both know this is not show business.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from similiar talking points, Jackson offered a harsh
critqiue of the voting record of Cheney, who also was defense
secretary when Bush's father was president and was chief of staff
to President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that image is a big part of high-tech politics,''
Jackson said. ``How someone looks on TV can hide flaws. Dick Cheney
has an image that is palatable. But Jesus warned us to be aware of
wolves in sheep's clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then rattled off a list of Cheney's congressional votes,
saying he had voted against funding for Head Start, civil rights,
and women's rights. ``He was against sanctions in South Africa not
once, but six times. He was against our freeing Mandela from
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Gore came to letting his feeling be known about the
selection of Cheney was to compliment Jackson for speaking
``eloquently.'' Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett dismissed the criticism
as more of the Gore campaign's ``old style, negative campaiging.''
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign appearance in Wyoming Wednesday, Cheney explained
his South African votes by saying, ``I consistently opposed the
imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. I don't believe (they)
work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore's vice presidential choice, Gore and his aides have
largely kept their own counsel. The vice president will leave
Thursday for a family vacation in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One senior campaign official said that because several in Gore's
inner circle had worked with several of the people whose names are
being bandied about as running mates, including Massachusetts
Senator John F. Kerry and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,
their advice might be considered biased and of little use to Gore.
Besides, the vice president was better at making decisions, this
aide said, when he made them from his own ``gut.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore said now that Bush had made his choice,
there was ``absolutely no doubt'' that the choice for the American
public would be between the ``old guard'' versus a ``new vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, teasing the audience about his choice, Gore said,
``There's been a lot of talk about running mates.''
</P>
<P>
   When silence fell over the audience, he quipped, ``Everybody got
quiet.'' Then everyone laughed.

AFTER YOU GO UPSCALE, THEN WHERE?
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Have you noticed how many things
are becoming upscale?
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new store, associated with khaki and adventure, and described
by promoters as upscale, is moving into one of the nearby malls.
Another shop, which majors in career clothes for the hip
professional, is the new upscale jewel in a suburban shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
   The center, as the story goes, is aiming for a Rodeo Drive feel.
The beauty parlor is moving out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an old steakhouse known for its country music and
shot-and-a-beer image is being transformed, we read, into an
upscale Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I personally prefer squash raviolis to a
T-bone and will be in line to check out the lush gardens and doors
imported from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   And those high-style stores are the type that I've often wished
we had close to home. They smell good. The clerks have expensive
haircuts. Normally found in big cities or fancy suburbs, now
they'll be next door.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, upscale means you pay more. The cost of a T-shirt in
those shops may make your eyes water, but the bag you take it home
in is chic. Upscale Italian doesn't usually include meatballs and
candles in Chianti bottles.
</P>
<P>
   But if upscale is moving in, something's happening. We're no
longer a backwater in the eyes of high-end retailers. Somebody's
marketing research has decided that we've got money to spend. And
apparently, judging from the soaring cost of Wine Country real
estate and influx of dot-com royalty, plenty of people do.
</P>
<P>
   A few of us were talking about this the other morning, and
hoping we don't get too upscale. Not only do we worry that the
housing costs are pricing out teachers and people who make music
and artists who once lived here pretty cheaply, ``upscale'' creates
an image of privilege that doesn't fit most of us commoners.
</P>
<P>
   There are dangers of growing too tony. What would happen if your
gym turned upscale and you couldn't go there in the morning with
bed hair? If the county fair went upscale would they have to ban
corn dogs and get rid of Farmers Day?
</P>
<P>
   When upscale is just part of the mix, it's a welcome addition.
When it takes over, you get stuck on yourself. They write stories
about you like they do about the Hamptons, where there are no real
people left, just people with ``buckets of money,'' spending
thousands of dollars on imported shower nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   People need an antidote to upscale so they don't forget that man
and woman cannot live on duck confit and Donna Karan alone.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it's important to keep supporting the plain and
simple places. One of my favorites is a restaurant where they don't
worry about food trends. It's where you go when you crave home
fries that stick to your ribs and want to feel comfortable putting
ketchup on your food. Where if you start to tell the waitress you'd
like your eggs prepared any style but the three ways the menu
offers, she'll say ``remember where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Where we are, people still like to spend weekend mornings at a
flea market and shop for clothes in discount stores where you wheel
through the aisles with a grocery cart. This is not only
economically essential for some people, but also a place to score a
designer top for under $10 by those who might also shop upscale,
where the sweaters are folded in stacks.
</P>
<P>
   Where we are, people like to sit at a counter drinking house
coffee as much as they like to go to an umbrella table and sip
fresh espresso. You can still find donut shops and barber shops and
dark bars that smell like old tobacco and where you know not to
order the wine.
</P>
<P>
   It depends on whose scale you're going by as to what is up. In
some towns, a new superstore where you can buy hot peppers in
gallon-sized jars is an upscale move.
</P>
<P>
   When I first moved to Northern California in the '70s, I was
thrilled by the ocean, hills, hippies and redwoods. I was also
relieved to find a JM store. JM, for Joseph Magnin, which no longer
exists, was to me, back then, a necessity of civilized life and an
assurance that there was style along with natural attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Now I would add theater, music, every kind of restaurant, book
stores, coffee houses and upscale bakeries with gourmet bread like
the one where my friends and I sat, calculating how much our
property is worth and hoping that things don't get too precious.

HARRY POTTER FANS FIND THE WEB'S WIZARDS
</HEADLINE>
  By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   ``You've read the book, now see
the movie,'' was the way the progression used to be. Now it's:
``You've read the book, now visit the Web site.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Harry Potter fans, there are many sites available. The
July/August issue of Children's Software Revue lists five that
Hogwarts aspirants may want to visit:
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters can find out about J.K. Rowling at
www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/home.asp. Scholastic publishes the
series, and this Web site is, by far, the most professional of the
bunch. (By ``most professional,'' I mean the graphics are well
done, it is well arranged, and there are no obvious misspelled
words that seem to plague some of the other sites.) Kids can also
download a Harry Potter screensaver, write an Owl Post to their
online friends, take a wizard trivia test and join discussions of
the four books.
</P>
<P>
   Another site _ www.surfnetkids.com/harrypotter.htm _ offers
several links to other Potter-related sites, including an
encyclopedia defining some of the words used in the books. Look
under the ``related items'' at the upper left of the screen to find
a Potter crossword and a word-search game.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry Potter characters hang out at Hagrids's Hut _
www.hagridshut.com. The books' characters are described in detail.
</P>
<P>
   The official site for the Warner Bros. movie, ``Harry Potter and
The Sorcerer's Stone,'' is www.harrypotter.com. Kids shouldn't get
their hopes up when they see the offer to star in the upcoming
movie to be filmed in England this summer (with a release date of
Nov. 16). The fine print: The company is looking for English
children to send in a recent picture of themselves and a video of
them telling a joke and reading a paragraph from their favorite
Potter book. (Maybe American children could fake the British accent
after listening to some ``Monty Python'' recordings?)
</P>
<P>
   Other than an interview with the film's director, Chris Columbus
(''Home Alone,'' ``Mrs. Doubtfire''), there's not much there right
now.
</P>
<P>
   At www.homestead.com/bumbledore, kids can write reviews of the
books or leave comments and read what others have said. Children
(and adults, too) can vote on their most hated character in the
books. Currently, Draco Malfoy, Harry's antagonist in the Slytherin
house, leads, followed closely by Professor Snape, the potions
teacher who heads the Slytherin house.

BARAK, ARAFAT FACE CHALLENGES AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Bible says ``blessed are the peacemakers,'' but
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat returned home from a failed Camp David summit Wednesday to
the political hell they must survive before they can be so blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders face almost impossible domestic challenges. The
atmosphere is pregnant with the possibilty of resolving the 52-year
old conflict _ but also consumed by a fear that Israelis and
Palestinians might end up fighting rather than compromising on
their claims to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Barak, who arrived home Wednesday night, will have
to move ``straight from the tarmac,'' as one put it, to rebuild his
government.
</P>
<P>
   His coalition, One Israel, collapsed the night he left to begin
14 days of negotiations at Camp David. The religious and
conservative flank, fearful that he would compromise too much at
Camp David, bolted and forced a ``no confidence'' motion that Barak
very narrowly survived.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is caught between those who say he did not move enough
toward a peace deal and those who say he raised Palestinian
expectations too high by offering so many concessions.
</P>
<P>
   He must either invite the more conservative opposition Likud
Party into a national unity government, or perhaps shift the axis
of his political future to the left and rebuild a coalition among a
traditionally secular peace camp.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, whose plane touched down in the new but hardly used
international airport in Gaza, arrived to a hero's welcome. He
stopped first in Egypt to meet with the Egyptian president, Hosni
Mubarak. Arafat's stance on Jerusalem (Barak has characterized it
as intransigence) has improved his standing not only among the
Palestinians, but throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   However, if he fails to consolidate sufficient support among
Arab leaders and ordinary Palestinians to find a way to share
sovereignty in Jerusalem, he will not succeed in reaching a
comprehensive peace agreement before a Sept. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has vowed on that date _ with or without a final peace
deal _ to declare an independent Palestinian state. However, if
Arafat declares statehood without recognition from Israel or the
United States he is likely to reverse many of the gains of a
seven-year peace process and a 35-year struggle for Palestinian
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are no less, military strategists say, than a
military confrontation between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a former general who is the most highly decorated soldier
in the history of the Israeli army, blamed Arafat for failing to
seize a historic opportunity, saying, ``The Palestinians didn't
realize that for peace you have to give up some of your dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key players in a difficult Israeli political terrain
is another former general, Likud leader Ariel Sharon. Barak was
considered likely to meet with Sharon, and some analysts suggested
he could emerge in a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made no speech, and does not have to worry about the
democratic process in his government. But he cannot go kept
negotiating without the support of the Arab world. And his tough
stance at Camp David seemed to go over well there.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank, captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967, is a
vital part of a final peace process. So far, the Palestinian
Authority has full or partial control over roughly 40 percent of
the land. Barak reportedly offered to withdraw Israeli troops from
as much as 95 percent of the West Bank to Arafat in exchange for a
declaration of the end of 52 years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement was not reached, collapsing over sovereignty in
Jerusalem. Israel declares Jerusalem its ``eternal and indivisible
capital.'' Palestinians say east Jerusalem and the walled Old City,
which Israeli captured in 1967 and annexed, must be the sovereign
capital of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, there were small
demonstrations in support of Arafat. A billboard of Arafat with his
arms folded in defiance loomed over the about 100 marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Nimeh Rashadeh, 52 and a mother of 10, wore a traditional
embroidered dress and a white headscarf as she lifted an Arafat
poster. ``Jerusalem is ours or it's a war and the blood will run
knee deep. We suffered in the intifadah. We suffered a lot. We
suffered in 1967. I was born in the war of 1948 when my family was
forced from its home. Yes, I want another war if that's what it
takes to get our country back.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Murad Audeh, 23, who was working at his family's jewelery
shop, ``I hope there won't be a war. I hope peace will come, but
something tells me there will be a confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was similar on the string of Jewish settlements in
the West Bank. Paul Ross, who emigrated to Israel from California
and lives in Rimonim settlement, said, ``We are out here with the
Indians around us.''
</P>
<P>
   As bulldozers grounded away, expanding the settlement, Ross
added, ``As soon as the Indians come over the hill, we have a war
on our hands.''

 &HT;    VH1 movie gives 'warts-and-all' view of rocky career
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Most people are afraid of going to hell. Meat
Loaf has already been there.
</P>
<P>
   As a portly kid, the future rock star and singer of such hits as
``Paradise by the Dashboard Light'' and ``Two Out of Three Ain't
Bad'' was often teased and bullied. He was given the name Meat Loaf
(his real name is Marvin Lee Aday) because of his rotund frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children were very cruel to me because of my size,'' Meat Loaf
said during a 1995 interview. ``But you develop a strength from
cruelty. You don't go along with the crowd because the crowd won't
let you go along with them. So you learn to be your own person.''
</P>
<P>
   But that took years of hard living and soul-searching. His
mother died of cancer when he was 16. After his mother's funeral,
Meat Loaf's father, in a drunken rage, chased him out of the house
with a butcher knife. He never went back. And, like countless other
musicians, Meat Loaf had legendary bouts with drugs, alcohol and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the perfect VH1 movie, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Meat Loaf: To Hell and Back'' (today, 9 p.m.) tells the true
story of one of rock's most unlikely heroes who followed overnight
fame in the 1970s with career-destroying problems and a rise back
to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of warts-and-all story,'' says director Jim
McBride, who knows something about rock and rage, having directed
the Jerry Lee Lewis story, ``Great Balls of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gaspin, VH1's executive vice president for programming and
production, says the decision to make a film about Meat Loaf's life
was a no-brainer. After all, the singer was one of the first
subjects of the wildly popular documentary series ``Behind the
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the tortured, 53-year-old rock icon is played by W.
Earl Brown, perhaps best known as Cameron Diaz's mentally
challenged younger brother in the film ``There's Something About
Mary.'' In several scenes, Brown looks eerily similar to Meat Loaf.
</P>
<P>
   Brown definitely could relate to his painful upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the same, torturous thing of picking on the fat
kid,'' he recalls. ``And there were things that obviously still
haunt him. And I could draw on my own experience because things
still bother me from being beaten up when I was 6 years old by the
10-year-old bully.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown considers himself an avid Meat Loaf fan, he
studied hours of taped performances and old films to capture Meat
Loaf's larger-than-life stage presence.
</P>
<P>
   He points out, however, that it was important for him to play
the man behind the entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meat Loaf considers what he does just entertainment,'' Brown
says. ``He says, `I'm an entertainer. Like a plumber comes and
fixes your pipes, you come to my show. I entertain you.' But I
think there's a lot more to him than that. I think he's an artist
and he deals with his own issues through his performances. He is
this gregarious, funny, slap-on-the-back, always got a joke (guy),
but there's more going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown says he met Meat Loaf in person and had lengthy
discussions about his life. Meat Loaf was somewhat reluctant,
though, to talk about his tough childhood and his fractured
relationship with his mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the two really hit it off when Meat Loaf learned
Brown is a die-hard softball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm sitting at Meat Loaf's house, he asks me if I play
golf, and I said, `Yes, but poorly.' I said, `Softball's my big
thing,' `` Brown remembers. ``His eyes light up. He goes, `Are you
playing now?' I said, `Well, our season starts next week, but I
can't play the first five games because of the film. I don't want
to risk twisting something.' To make a long story short, Meat Loaf
ends up playing on my softball team, playing my position.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how'd he do? After all, Meat Loaf hadn't played softball in
about five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went 1-for-4,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   And who's the better player?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Brown says, laughing, ``I play every week. And, you
know, I'm 17 years younger.''

SUIT DROPPED AS AOL SAYS SOFTWARE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO BLIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Inc. has fended off a lawsuit that could have
compelled all Web sites and Internet service providers to make
their services available to blind people.
</P>
<P>
   AOL was sued in Boston last year by the National Federation for
the Blind (NFB). The group argued that AOL, the world's largest
Internet access provider with 22 million members, is required by
the federal Americans with Disabilities Act to make its services
accessible to blind users.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, AOL said it was already at work on a version of its
software that would be compatible with ``screen readers,'' which
can read the contents of a computer screen aloud. ``We've always
been committed to meeting the needs of underserved communities,
including the (disabled) community,'' said AOL spokesman Rich
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took months of discussion to resolve the dispute. NFB
attorney Joseph Davis of Adler, Pollock &AMP; Sheehan said it took time
for his client to accept that AOL was acting in good faith. ``Once
it became apparent to us that there really were committed people at
AOL, then there was a better dialogue,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of AOL software, due for release this fall,
should be usable by anyone with a screen reader. AOL also has
promised to consult with the NFB on future software upgrades. In
return, the NFB has withdrawn its lawsuit, but it reserves the
right to refile the suit in a year if insufficient progress has
been made.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement leaves unresolved an interesting legal question.
Some advocates for the disabled say the Internet is now such a
pervasive part of American life that an inability to use it has
become a severe disadvantage. They argue that Internet providers
and Web site operators should be subject to the Americans with
Disabilities Act, which requires businesses to make reasonable
accommodations for disabled employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said AOL's accessibility policy should send a strong
message to other Internet companies that they ought to do the same.
He added that the NFB is keeping an eye on major Internet
businesses and may sue others that don't make special provision for
blind users.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The corps of young Americans setting the sports world afire, and
dominating Europe at its own games this month, is a testament to
determination, hard work and the American spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's Lance Armstrong, 28, muted his detractors in Europe's
competitive bicycling circuit by winning the Tour de France for the
second consecutive time. Armstrong's inspiring story is well-known
around the world by now, but his victories didn't come without
sacrifice and a punishing training regime, something often
forgotten in the glow of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's lead early in the grinding, three-week endurance
race left the outcome assured. Hardly less certain was the other
young American victor Sunday, Tiger Woods, who won the British Open
golf tournament at St. Andrews, Scotland, to become the youngest
golfer ever to win all four major professional tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, only 24, was properly respectful about winning at the
birthplace of modern golf. But his modesty doesn't hide a fierce
competitor who practices long hours, stresses physical conditioning
and works to improve his strokes even as he dominates the game.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the month in England, 20-year-old Venus Williams won
the tennis title at Wimbledon, beating her younger sister, Serena,
on the way. The talented Williams sisters are now forces to be
dealt with on the women's professional tennis circuit and are
likely to remain so for some years.
</P>
<P>
   These young athletes are unusual sports heroes. Armstrong was
raised in difficult circumstances and was stricken by cancer just
as he was beginning to ascend in the cycling world. The Williams
sisters are African Americans from the famously poor Los Angeles
suburb of Compton and competing in a sport associated with white
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the golfing world saw Tiger Woods coming from a very
young age. But he is still a rarity, a blend of races and cultures
that made him both the first black man to win the British Open and
the first of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   These champions are the face of America _ black, white and
blended. They are the soul of the country, too _ intense,
hard-working and iron-willed. More importantly, they are its heart.
</P>
<P>
   America's dominant position among the world's nations today make
it an easy target. But look beneath the veneer of a rich, powerful
nation and you see that the true value of the United States is in
these young men and women, these competitors, these winners.

PUTIN WINS FIGHT WITH GOVERNORS, WHO WILL LOSE SEATS IN
PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After two months of maneuvering, President Vladimir
Putin and 89 of Russia's most powerful leaders _ the nation's
czar-like regional governors _ faced off Wednesday in a
long-anticipated political showdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was not even a contest.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of hours, the governors accepted almost without
protest Putin's proposal to overhaul the federal tax code, a plan
that promises to break their control over billions of rubles in tax
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   They also voted _ as Putin had also demanded _ to abolish their
own seats in the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation approved Wednesday, the governors and 89
members of provincial legislatures whom they had handpicked will
leave by January 2002, giving way to a full-time, and somewhat more
independent, group of legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's entire proceeding belied the predictions of
politicians and pundits alike that the governors, who have run
their provinces like fiefs since the days of President Boris
Yeltsin, would fight to the end Putin's plan to curb their powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since his inauguration in May, Putin has moved to reassert
Moscow's historic grip on the regions, arguing that the governors _
some of whom have ignored the constitution and even pondered
secession _ must be subservient to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Over the concerns of some analysts that the Kremlin is
effectively rebuilding the all-powerful state of Soviet days, Putin
now seems to have accomplished much of his goal.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 119-18 to end the automatic right of governors
and their legislative appointees to sit in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will of the emperor, or that of the president, is
tantamount to law,'' said the council member and governor of
Chuvash, Nikolai Fyodorov, during the debate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the council may have had little choice. The lower
house of Parliament, the Duma, which has always bristled at the
governors' claim of superiority, had already agreed by a virtually
veto-proof margin to Putin's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The council members agreed to their own ouster after persuading
the lower house and the Kremlin to accept a compromise that holds
out the prospect of a new constitutional convention to set a final
form for the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also allowed members to remain in the council
until their terms expire, and gave the governors the right to
appoint and remove their successors. Council members from the
provincial legislatures, who had been named in the past by the
governors, will now be elected by their peers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lower house had already overridden the governors' veto of an
earlier law that gives Putin the right to fire governors and
dissolve provincial legislatures should they act in violation of
the federal constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's victory in the battle over tax laws was every bit
as complete, and potentially as significant.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation Council voted in unexpectedly lopsided fashion,
115-23, to adopt a package of changes that will cut the income tax
to a flat 13 percent from a top rate of 35 percent, slash a
much-derided tax on the cash flow of businesses, and marginally cut
payroll taxes for pensions and other social programs.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the bill abolishes a warren of special funds
that had been created for various taxes, giving the federal tax
service the power to collect and administer their receipts. The
move is expected to reduce corruption and favoritism in government
offices where officials had used the money more or less as personal
kitties.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-flow tax, a 4 percent levy on the revenues of
profitable and unprofitable businesses alike, will be cut to 1
percent. The Kremlin had sought to abolish the tax, but settled for
the reduction to appease the governors, for whom it has been a
major source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many outsiders thought the Federation Council would veto at
least some of the tax changes to protect their own sources of
revenue, especially because some of the more contentious provisions
had barely squeaked through the lower house earlier. Some said the
council would approve the law but block a second technical measure
that actually implemented it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, a furious lobbying effort by the Kremlin _ and a
threat to put the law into effect by executive order, whether the
council approved the technical measure or not _ appeared to win
over the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are expected to reduce corporate taxes by about 20
percent overall. Putin's prime minister and former finance
minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, had told the legislators that
passing the tax code was crucial if the Russian economy, which
lately has been growing at a 5 percent annual clip, was to avoid a
slowdown and a potential recession.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov said the economy has all but exhausted the benefit it
got in 1998 when the ruble was sharply devalued, making Russian
exports a bargain for foreign buyers and sparking a small
manufacturing boom. Further growth, he said, would have to be
fueled internally by lowering onerous taxes and removing government
obstacles to a free market.
</P>
<P>
   The stiffest objections of the day came from the Parliament
member and mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, who said the changes
would effectively leave regions like his beholden to the Kremlin
for handouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will be confined to a stall,'' he said, ``with the
government offering handfuls of hay.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While George W. Bush and Al Gore await the cues
that will summon one of them to stage center as America's next
president, Bill Clinton is traveling and performing as if he were
beginning rather than ending his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The peripatetic president shuttles from one major event to
another _ such as the failed Israeli-Arab peace talks at Camp
David, Md., and the Okinawa summit of the leaders of Russia and the
world's great industrial nations. He is so involved with the
potency and perquisites of his job that one almost expects his
successor to have to wrench the scepter of power from Clinton's
tight grip when his term expires at high noon on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the reigning superstar of American public life for
nearly eight years, shows little inclination to yield the spotlight
that has illuminated his every action, including his sordid sexual
misadventures, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   When the White House curtain finally falls, he will be 55, in
excellent health and in search of projects to satisfy his
restlessness.
</P>
<P>
   His wife may be a newly elected U.S. senator from New York, and
he, like his recent predecessors, probably will write his memoirs
and oversee construction of a Clinton Library and Museum in
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   But that will not be enough for a man of Clinton's relentless
energy and questing intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he probably would have sought a third term if the
22nd Amendment did not limit a president to two terms. ``I like the
job,'' he explained rather plaintively.
</P>
<P>
   What he did not add is that the people would probably refuse to
re-elect the president who was impeached by the House for lying
under oath about his relations with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a week of intensive efforts to convince Israel's
Ehud Barak and the Palestinians' Yasser Arafat to enter into a
peace agreement, Clinton left Camp David and jetted across the
Pacific to his final economic summit.
</P>
<P>
   Then after two days of conferring with the other seven leaders,
he again climbed aboard Air Force One 747 and headed back to Camp
David. But before he left, his fellow summiteers toasted him as
``the great leader of the free world.''
</P>
<P>
   That accolade was tantamount to a shot of adrenalin for a weary
president who needed a stimulant to restore his energy and
alertness as he searched for an elusive Middle East peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Critics will contend that Clinton was simply trying to burnish
his tarnished image and assist Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid to
become a U.S. senator from a state with a heavy Jewish population.
Nevertheless, he waged a desperate but futile struggle to find
common ground between Barak and Arafat before Arafat unilaterally
proclaims a Palestinian state on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton understands how history judges presidents. He also knows
that a Barak-Arafat accord could provide security and peace for the
embattled Jewish and Palestinian peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hostility between Israel and the Palestinians
reaches back to Israel's creation as a nation in 1948, the
negotiations were, by Clinton's assessment, the most difficult he
has ever participated in.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that deadlocked the Camp David talks was the control
of Jerusalem. While Clinton was unhappy with the outcome, he
recognized from the beginning that it would be almost impossible to
win an accord on the future of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
   The president's next public extravaganza will be a triumphant,
and probably nostalgic, farewell speech to Democrats at their
national convention in Los Angeles. That will be followed by
campaign appearances on behalf of Al Gore and other Democratic
office seekers across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton leaves the White House, he will be 14 years younger
than President George Bush was when his term ended 1993 and 23
years younger than Ronald Reagan when he returned to private life
in 1989. He will be 15 years younger than Bob Dole when he sought
the presidency in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Clinton is probably the most detested
Democratic president since Harry Truman, who fired one GOP icon,
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, from his command in Korea and opposed the
presidential bid of another, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   History must judge Clinton's shoddy personal behavior against
his intelligence, the great economic strides made during his tenure
and the influence he has exerted abroad.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet he will remain active up to Jan. 20. He will battle
Congressional Republicans to try to provide seniors with Medicare
payment for prescription drugs and he will spar with his fellow
Democrats as he seeks permanent normal trade relations with China.
He will veto tax cuts approved by Republicans and seek passage of
his own cuts for middle class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The president will not sneak secretly out the back door of the
White House.

JUDGE OK'S POST-EXECUTION DNA TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERRY, Ga. _ In what is believed to be the first such order in
US legal history, a judge has authorized DNA testing of evidence
from a death penalty case to determine if the executed man was
indeed guilty, or innocent as he had said.
</P>
<P>
   The order to conduct DNA testing, issued by Judge L. A.
McConnell Jr. of the Houston County Superior Court two weeks ago,
had been sought by The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   After the order was issued, CBS News and two Georgia newspapers,
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and The Macon Telegraph, asked
the court for permission to join in the DNA testing. McConnell
granted the motions. The testing, which will be funded by the news
organizations, is expected to take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Wayne Felker was executed by the state of Georgia in
November 1996. To his death, he said he was innocent of the rape
and murder of Evelyn Joy Ludlum in December 1981. Ludlum's body was
discovered two weeks after she had been reported missing in a rural
stream near this central Georgia community 90 miles south of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ludlum, a 19-year-old waitress, met Felker at the Holiday Inn
where she worked. They talked, and she expressed interest in a job
at the leather-working shop he owned, according to court data.
Felker invited her to his home for a job interview, the reports
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Felker was convicted of binding, raping, and strangling her
before dumping her body in the forest stream.
</P>
<P>
   There was contradictory testimony at Felker's trial, however,
regarding the date and time of Ludlum's death. Witnesses for the
defense and prosecution differed on how long she had been dead when
her body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Felker's defense lawyers said their client could not have had
the time to kill Ludlum and dispose of her body, because he had
been released from prison for another sexual assault conviction and
so was put under police surveillance as soon as Ludlum was reported
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution and its witnesses, however, convinced the jury
that Felker could have used the few hours before the police learned
Ludlum was missing to commit the murder and to dispose of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Felker was found guilty, and was sentenced to death in 1983.
Weeks before he died, his lawyers employed the Georgia Open Records
Act to examine the prosecution files in the case. They found a
police rape evidence kit, scrapings from beneath Ludlum's
fingernails, and the clothing she wore when she was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, however, was not subjected to DNA testing. And
after he was executed in the Georgia electric chair, Felker's case
became a symbol in the political and legal war now raging over the
death penalty _ one of two dozen cases frequently cited by Amnesty
International and other foes of capital punishment as a possible
case of wrongful execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``A DNA test could very well have proven his innocence,'' said
Michael Mears, the Georgia lawyer who handled Felker's final
appeals. ``We could not physically get our hands on the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne did some bad things, but I don't think this is one of
them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As DNA testing has freed dozens of innocent men from prison and
death row in the past few years, a nationwide ``innocence
movement'' has raised the specter of wrongful executions to spur
doubts about capital punishment. Support for the death penalty,
meanwhile, has dropped in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe saw the Felker case as one in which forensic evidence
might be available to test the theory that there have been wrongful
executions. Members of the New York-based Innocence Project, the
Death Penalty Information Center and other criminal justice
organizations said that this would be the first time such testing
has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, the Globe approached the Houston County district
attorney, Kelly R. Burke, with the request. Though Burke and other
law enforcement officials here say they have no doubts that Felker
was guilty, they were willing to search for and locate the
evidence. Lawyers for the Globe then asked Judge McConnell, under
the terms of the Georgia Open Records Act, to allow the DNA
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe won its order on July 13. Five days later, CBS News
and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution filed motions seeking to
intervene. The Macon Telegraph published an article Wednesday
morning about the news organizations seeking the DNA test, then
joined the case itself later in the day. The afternoon Atlanta
Journal followed the Macon paper Wednesday with its own account of
the testing effort.

SUHARTO ABOUT TO BE CHARGED, INDONESIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Marzuki on 2nd reference is cq.)  
(No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 26 _ Former President Suharto will be
charged with corruption in a few days, Attorney General Marzuki
Darusman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki, who has faced death threats and a bombing at his office
while investigating Suharto, said his staff had finished compiling
a thick dossier of evidence against the former strongman and would
forward it to the state prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully before August all will have been completed,'' he
told reporters today after his staff met to draft the charges.
``Hopefully by the end of this month or early in August the
dossiers would already have been handed over to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, it seemed unthinkable that Suharto, the most
dominant political figure in modern Indonesian history, could be
held accountable for his actions, let alone be hauled before a
court. The former army general, who took office in 1966 and ruled
for 32 years, was widely believed to control the country's
judiciary, as well as other institutions like Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and critics say that in his three decades in power
Suharto abused his office to amass a fortune while also enriching
his children and business associates. He was forced to resign in
1998, when his government crumbled in the face of Indonesia's worst
economic crisis in decades, social unrest and violent street
protests that sought greater democracy and clean government.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's successor and protege, B.J. Habibie, ordered a
corruption investigation after taking office, but the case was
dropped. Officials said they lacked evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Abdurrahman Wahid, who was catapulted to the presidency in
October after the first open election here, immediately ordered
Marzuki to reopen the case. Wahid has said he will pardon Suharto
if he is found guilty and returns any ill-gotten wealth to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, who has been in frail health since suffering a mild
stroke last year, is a pariah and living under house arrest here.
His political and military supporters are believed to be behind
recent unrest and violence in what may be an attempt to stop the
corruption case from proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's legal team says he has irreversible brain damage and
is unfit to stand trial.

IN WAKE OF CRASH, CONCORDE PILOTS PONDER A SAFETY PARADOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AIRFRANCE-CRASH) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash of an Air France
Concorde near Paris, some of the pilots who have flown them
pondered a paradox Wednesday. The supersonic airliner, according to
one, is tough and robust, with ``tremendous reserve capacity'' to
power its way out of trouble. But, according to another, if the
plane lost a side-by-side pair of its four engines at low speed
just after takeoff, it would be ``impossible to control.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in France reported Wednesday, that the pilot of
Concorde Flight AF4590 reported the failure of one engine that had
been repaired earlier in the day. But that, a former pilot said,
would not fully explain the flaming contrail of flame that
witnesses saw just after the airplane lifted off from Charles de
Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That great long plume of flame implies some sort of
catastrophic failure, when the engine breaks up and blows apart,''
said John Hutchinson, a former Concorde pilot. And failure on that
scale, aviation experts said, could well have damaged the plane's
control systems, or even another nearby engine housed in the
Concorde's wings close to the fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of both engines at low speed just after takeoff is
impossible to control,'' said another former pilot, Germain
Chambort, in a television interview in London.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have yet to establish the extent of the engine
failure that caused the flame. But pilots from the elite corps of
Concorde aviators, flying airplanes whose value is calculated far
more in corporate prestige than dollars-and-cents return on
investment, insisted that the Concorde's design _ with its engines
much closer together than on most sub-sonic planes _ would not have
contributed to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have complete confidence in that part of the design,'' said
Mike Bannister, the chief Concorde pilot for British Airways. Brian
Trubshaw, the former Concorde test pilot who flew the plane on its
maiden flight over Britain in 1969, told reporters at the
Farnborough Air Show that ``she is in her essence a safe plane.''
He was at the show to promote his autobiography, called ``Concorde:
The Inside Story.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hutchinson, the former pilot, said he regarded the Concorde
as ``a very safe airplane that has got at least 10 years and maybe
15 years of life'' left in it.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the former pilots and aviation experts who spoke to
reporters Wednesday ventured an opinion on how the Concorde might
have behaved in its final moments. But Malcolm English, editor of
Air International, said the drill would have been to avoid a stall
_ when an airplane loses the airspeed it needs to fly _ and seek a
safe landing. If, however, an intense fire burned through the
controls, even the most rudimentary anti-stall maneuvers would be
impossible. ``If that's what happened, then it looks like they lost
flight control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, an airplane would pitch and stall.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot reportedly suggested that if the experience of a
Concorde simulator was anything to go by, a simple engine failure
would be easier to control on a Concorde than on some subsonic
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with those, ``keeping Concorde on centerline is a piece
of cake,'' Capt. John Wiley, a USAirways pilot, was quoted as
telling a Farnborough Air Show news bulletin published by Aviation
Week. With a double engine failure programmed into the simulator,
he said, the plane veered to one side while rolling to the other.
But regaining control was ``not even a bad dream, much less a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But how difficult is Concorde to fly?'' Wiley ruminated. ``One
simulator session may not be the best measure for this answer, but
let's just say it takes a lot of commitment to fly Concorde.''

<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ended Tuesday without a
comprehensive settlement, but there were encouraging signs that
both sides moved toward peace on some issues other than Jerusalem.
The challenge now is to see whether the parties can build on this
apparent progress, or whether they will slide back toward
recriminations and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's acceptance of Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza and
most of the West Bank is the perfect example of how far things have
come. Such sovereignty was once a taboo subject for most Israelis
and American policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   But among other issues, East Jerusalem remains outside the grasp
of the negotiators. Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Yasser
Arafat could not escape domestic political constraints against
compromising historic claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat's ability to maneuver is nil,'' a Palestinian official
said over the weekend, referring to how both the Palestinians and
the larger global Muslim community demand a return of East
Jerusalem. Barak showed flexibility in talking about shared
sovereignty, but what was not enough for Arafat was too much for
many Israelis, to whom any agreement will be submitted by
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   There is no point in criticizing leaders for not making a deal
that they could not make, except at the risk of losing the support
of a majority of the people they represent.
</P>
<P>
   What next? Both sides talked _ probably too much _ about the
inevitability of fighting if the negotiations ended without a final
agreement. If this scenario plays out, the progress made at Camp
David will be seriously diminished and hopes for genuine peace, at
least in the near term, will fade.
</P>
<P>
   But if violence can be prevented or controlled, time itself may
provide an answer, just as time provided an answer on Palestinian
statehood. Peacemaking in the Middle East is a process, not an
instantaneous event. Progress is sometimes measured in small steps
_ from the original Camp David in 1978 to the 1991 Madrid
Conference to the 1993 Oslo peace agreement through the present to
the future. Time changes things, and as realities change, minds
change. What was taboo yesterday can become thinkable today and
doable tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of settling an issue so deeply rooted in Muslim
and Jewish faith and identity is not to be minimized. But the long
view is more hopeful than the short view.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton deserves real credit for convening the Camp
David talks and for offering and advocating proposals on how to
settle differences.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   The administration has had seven years and six months to push
this process along. The proper function of the Camp David summit
should have been to tie up loose ends. Instead, the leaders, under
tight deadline pressure, considered many important issues directly
and face-to-face for the first time. It should not be surprising
that they could not do years of work in 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the Geneva meeting last March between Clinton and
President Hafez Assad of Syria ended in failure. Comprehensive
peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without peace between
Israel and Syria. Arguably, the Israeli-Palestinian issues would
have been more easily settled if Israel and Syria had made peace
first. And the principal issue with Syria _ return of the Golan
Heights _ is much less complicated than most of the final-status
issues between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Though his approach at Camp David was creative and proactive, I
fear that at Geneva, Clinton may simply have presented the Israeli
position to Assad and recommended that he accept it, because it
offered to return practically all of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach would have been for the United States to make
its own proposal, recommending the return of all the Golan
conditioned on Assad's then agreeing to the firm security and
access arrangements on the ground that Israel required, including
restrictions on the the Sea of Galilee and on a narrow strip along
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   This compromise should have satisfied both Israeli and Syrian
political needs. Assad could have claimed to have received back
``all'' of the Golan to the June 4, 1967, lines, while Israel would
have received the protection it required for the Galilee, which
provides much of its water.
</P>
<P>
   The administration should prepare Congress and the American
people for the fact that the United States will be asked to help
finance the agreement, if it comes, by providing substantial funds
to move Israeli military bases, establish new borders, resettle
some Israelis from the West Bank and compensate Palestinians for
land taken by Israel. Within reason, we should be prepared to pay
our share of these costs. There will be no peace unless we do, and
both our national interests and our values cry out for that peace.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now for Israel, the Palestinians and the United
States is to accept the disappointment that the talks ended without
a comprehensive settlement, recognize the progress that was made,
avoid rash actions and keep the process alive so that one day the
descendants of Abraham may live together in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Such a result would answer the Psalmist's prayer for Jerusalem.
``May those who love you be secure. May there be peace within your
walls and security within your citadels.''
</P>

   LUBBOCK, Texas _ George W. Bush was seething with frustration.
Here he was, feeling as Texan as the chaw he liked to tuck under
his lower lip, and he had to smile gamely while the audience
snickered at him as an alien in cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1978, and the 31-year-old Bush was trying to get a start
in politics by running for Congress here in West Texas. A
candidate's forum was under way, and his rival was needling Bush
with an oft-repeated joke in which he was the punchline, a yarn
that reinforced a perception of him as a spoiled rich kid from back
East.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Hance, the Democratic candidate and a smooth-talking good
old boy, was telling a yarn about working in a field along a rural
road. Then along came a fancy car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Mercedes,'' drawled Hance, raising his eyebrows, and
the audience tittered knowingly at the hint that Bush was the kind
of man more comfortable in a Mercedes than a pick-up. ``The guy
rolled down the window and wanted to know how to get to a certain
ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hance recounted how he'd given the man directions, telling him
to turn right after a cattle guard, a metal grate ubiquitous in
rural roads to keep livestock from straying. ``Then,'' Hance
continued, ``he said, `what color uniform will that cattle guard be
wearing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared with laughter, and just to be sure that the
voters got the connection with the Connecticut-born Bush, Hance
said he had noticed something else about the Mercedes: ``It had
Connecticut license plates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost that race for Congress. Yet the story of his entry
into politics, and particularly of that campaign, suggests that it
left a deep imprint on him, one evident today as he campaigns for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Bush ran an energetic but deeply flawed campaign. He
chose a race that may have been unwinnable, and then muffed up and
let himself be portrayed to many voters as an intelligent,
over-educated phony out of touch with ordinary voters _ ironically,
a bit the way some Bush supporters now look at Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush first entered the congressional race, he was still
single and struggling to start an oil company. He was not obviously
congressional material: He lived in a bachelor's flat, his bed
frame tied together with one of his neckties, and he dressed
exclusively in ratty denim or in clothes that did not match.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand what a bad dresser George was,'' said
Joe O'Neill, an friend from those days. ``George didn't dress down,
which intentionally looks bad. He just dressed bad. He dressed in
the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned feverishly from morning to night in his white
Oldsmobile Cutlass, usually running late, his volunteers sitting
beside him and struggling to domesticate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chewed tobacco,'' recalled Lisa Nowlin, one of those
volunteers, ``and we always had to carry a spit cup so he could
spit out the tobacco before he saw the Methodist preachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Older people were sometimes put off by what they saw as Bush's
cockiness, but the young volunteers were dazzled by his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how late the activities of the previous evening, he
was always up early the next morning and working in a way I'd
rarely seen in Lubbock,'' said J. Michael Weiss, whom Bush met
while shaking hands at a shopping mall and turned into a volunteer
county chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Weiss added reflectively, ``Lubbock is maybe not
the high-energy capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is often seen today as a late entrant into
politics; he is running for president after holding elective office
for just five years. Yet in another sense, young George has been
engaged in politics in one way or another since his teens and has
considered various runs for office since he was in his 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was first exposed to politics at the age of 17, when his
father ran for the Senate, and later he worked full-time on Senate
campaigns in Florida for Edward J. Gurney and in Alabama for Winton
M. Blount, nicknamed ``Red.'' The lure of these campaigns was not
policy but the adventure of a statewide campaign; a friend recalls
Bush saying that he spent his time in Alabama drinking and dating.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Paul, a girlfriend of Bush's when he was in his mid-20s,
says that Bush was fascinated even then by politics and searching
for a way to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very active trying to see how he could get his nose
into politics,'' she said, ``trying to figure out what was going to
be his next move.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, when he was 25, Bush found a spot. A seat in the Texas
state Senate was coming open in Houston the next year, and he
chewed over the idea of running for it with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He explored it, he had conversations with the mayor, and he
went to a couple of functions to test the waters and talk to people
about it,'' said Donald B. Ensenat, his roommate in Houston at the
time. ``I assume he decided not to run because he thought he
wouldn't win, because he thought he wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bush went off to Harvard Business School and then started
business in 1975 as an oilman in Midland, the West Texas town where
he had spent his childhood. Just two years later, a terrific
opportunity seemed to tumble into his lap. George Mahon, the local
congressman, announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   George W. immediately leaped into the race to succeed him.
Shortly afterward, he resumed an acquaintance with a seventh-grade
classmate, Laura Welch. After a whirlwind courtship, they married
on the first weekend available.
</P>
<P>
   It was a useful marriage. For a candidate like Bush who some saw
as a rootless and immature carpet-bagger, it was helpful
politically to settle down and start a family, particularly with a
local girl who was an authentic West Texan. But the young couple
also seemed absolutely in love as they roared around the district
on the campaign trail, and so there was almost no muttering about
the sheer political convenience of it all.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What drew Bush into politics?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he rejected the suggestion that he had followed
his father into politics, saying instead that he had been angry at
the Carter administration's policy on natural gas pricing. But in a
1995 conversation with a historian, Herbert S. Parmet, Bush
emphasized the degree to which his own family legacy pushed him
into the political world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a passing on of tradition, passing on legacy, passing
on responsibility,'' Bush said then, according to Parmet's
transcript of the conversation. ``So I don't think it's a conscious
effort. I don't think it's any of this thing where, you know, `by
God, young man, if you play your cards right you, too, may end up
in politics.' It's more of an inherent trait.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may not have had a decent suit when he announced his
candidacy, but he had other assets _ among them a first-rate name.
``George Bush'' had been a prominent name in Texas ever since his
father had launched his political career in 1964 with an
unsuccessful campaign for the Senate and then winning two terms as
a congressman from Houston. The elder Bush had run for the Senate
unsuccessfully again in 1970, had been mentioned three times as a
possible vice president and had become famous by holding a series
of posts such as ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the
Republican National Committee and director of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush's key backers in the 1978 campaign were his
buddies in Midland, people like Donald L. Evans (now the chairman
of his presidential campaign). In addition, friends of the father
helped out the son or contributed money to him.
</P>
<P>
   Financial reports showed that among the donors were William
Ford, vice chairman of Ford Motor Co.; Donald M. Kendall, chairman
of Pepsico; A.W. Clausen, chairman of Bank of America; Peter
O'Malley, owner of the L.A. Dodgers; and even Mrs. Douglas
MacArthur..
</P>
<P>
   It would have been difficult to imagine Bush, an unknown
31-year-old who had barely held a job, running for Congress in 1978
if it had not been for his name and his family connections. But it
soon became apparent that there was also a downside to this
pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidate in the Republican primary, Jim Reese, the
courtly and conservative mayor of Odessa, launched attacks on Bush
using themes that still reverberate today. Some of the epithets
associated years later with Ann Richards in her contest with Bush
for the governor's job, such as ``Junior'' or ``Shrub,'' were first
used by Reese back in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the perception that he was simply playing on his
name and background _ a sensitivity that continues to this day _
Bush asked his father not to campaign for him and downplayed the
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need Dad in this race,'' Bush told the newspaper in
Midland. ``We don't need anyone in this race but the people of this
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the congressional primary became a proxy battle between two
national Republican giants, for Ronald Reagan and the elder George
Bush were dueling in preparation for the 1980 Republican
presidential nomination, and Reagan did not want a Bush family
victory in Texas. As a result, Reagan contributed $3,000 from his
political action committee to Reese's campaign and taped a
television commercial for him. This infuriated the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in getting into an argument with Reagan,''
the elder Bush told The Washington Post at that time. ``But I am
surprised about what he is doing here, in my state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making a real effort to defeat George,'' Bush added
indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   Young George also found himself pummeled by conspiracy-minded
right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush was a member of the Trilateral Commission, a
group of prominent internationalists working for cooperation among
the United States, Europe and Japan, and word spread among farmers
that the commission intended to create a world government and was
responsible for depressed crop prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going broke farming, and we were fighting anything
that was keeping us down,'' recalled J.C. Lewis, an Oklahoma farmer
and retired Air Force pilot who flew down to Texas to campaign
against Bush in rural towns like Wolfforth.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McCathern, a prominent farmer in the area, said: ``We
were always voicing the opinion, `if you support the Trilateral
Commission that your father is in, then farmers can't support you.
And he wouldn't back down. He would say `he's my father and I
support my father.'''
</P>
<P>
   The most common interpretation of the 1978 campaign is that Bush
was a wonderful campaigner and natural-born politician. But this
seems to be a gloss burnished by time and the selective memories of
Bush and his friends, for here in West Texas people say that Bush
was personable and a quick study but still made a series of
mistakes, largely through inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there was the day, early in the campaign, when
there was a candidate forum on a farm near the small town of
Dimmitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the first time I've been on a real farm,'' Bush
announced, beaming at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Reese, who was next to speak, began his talk by saying: ``I want
to assure you, this is not the first time I've been on a real
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the television commercial Bush dreamed up to show
how energetic he was: It showed him jogging on a track. In those
days, joggers were about as common in West Texas as Martians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time folks around here go running,'' Hance, the
Democratic candidate, told audiences, ``is when somebody's chasing
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Angelo, a Midland businessman and prominent Republican
leader in Texas, says that people either have a natural instinct
for politics or they do not. And back then, Angelo did not see it
in the younger Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his campaign in `78, I didn't get the feeling that he had
the knack for it,'' Angelo said. Since then, Angelo has revised his
opinion and now believes Bush has tremendous political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Bush beat Reese handily in the Republican
primary, with 56 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has been underestimated every time,'' Reese reflected
the other day, as he sat on his couch in his home in Odessa. ``I
did it initially. Ann Richards did it in the governor's race. And
Al Gore may be doing that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knew that the winner of the Democratic primary, Hance,
would present tougher competition. A smooth-talking farmboy who had
grown up in the district, Hance was a rising political star who
represented a state senate district that largely overlapped with
the 19th congressional district that they were fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent Hance was a down-home boy, real homey, and George W.
wasn't homey like Kent,'' recalled Johnnye Davis, a Republican
leader in Odessa. ``He didn't come across to the voters as well as
Kent did, with the little jokes that Kent told.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush now is sometimes mocked for ignorance of policy
details, back then people thought he had the opposite problem: He
had a tendency in his speeches to throw in policy references that
baffled audiences. ``He was quick, a bit too quick, so that people
didn't always get it,'' Mrs. Davis said. ``He was so darn
intelligent that a lot of what he said went over people's heads.
He's learned to explain things a little better since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was that while Bush never really had a clear
campaign strategy, Hance did: he focused his campaign on
emphasizing local ties and on making Bush out as a carpet-bagger
from the East. One of Hance's most effective radio spots was this
one, read by an announcer:
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1961, when Kent Hance graduated from Dimmitt High School in
the 19th congressional district, his opponent George W. Bush was
attending Andover Academy in Massachusetts. In 1965, when Kent
Hance graduated from Texas Tech, his opponent was at Yale
University. And while Kent Hance graduated from University of Texas
Law School, his opponent'' _ the announcer's voice plunged - ``get
this, folks, was attending Harvard. We don't need someone from the
Northeast telling us what our problems are.''
</P>
<P>
   Otice A. Green, a long-time political consultant who has worked
on campaigns since 1956 _ including Hance's in 1978 _ said that
Bush made a ``good entry'' into politics and was an impressive
candidate. But, he added: ``Kent Hance was one of the best I ever
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have helped Bush if Republicans had united around him
and vouched for him as a genuine West Texan. In retrospect several
Republicans think Bush should have tried harder to use Reese's
support in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I was asked, I told people I was supporting George,''
Reese recalls. ``But I don't remember him asking me to campaign for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent one-third more than Hance in the general election
campaign, but the extra spending played into the Democrats' hands.
Hance denounced Bush for getting 64 percent of his campaign
contributions from outside the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those contributions from the Northeast concern me,'' Hance
declared at one public meeting. ``The Northeast has been in direct
conflict with us on oil and gas and agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush complained that Hance's numbers were wrong. Overall, he
said, only 48 percent of the money came from contributors outside
the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been attacked for where I was born, for who my family
is, and where my money has come from,'' the Midland
Reporter-Telegram quoted Bush as saying. ``I don't think that's
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no particular ideological or policy difference between
Bush and Hance. Indeed, the Midland newspaper reported that the two
men were asked at one joint appearance what difference there was
between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Bush said finally, ``I've got more hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I did,'' Hance, who was balding, responded wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hance would have made a good Republican,'' Bush told the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Bush would have made a good conservative Republican,''
Hance affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   So in the absence of policy differences, their differing
backgrounds and styles loomed over the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yale and Harvard don't prepare you as well for running for the
19th congressional district as Texas Tech does,'' Hance told
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers continued to ask the candidates about the Trilateral
Commission, and Hance shrewdly replied: ``I don't know anything
about it. But in 1973 when the Trilateral Commission was formed,
what were you getting for corn and wheat? And what are you getting
now?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father was appalled that his membership in the Trilateral
Commission was hurting his son's candidacy. So he wrote to
McCathern, the farm organizer and suggested a meeting to clear the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote me a four-page handwritten letter asking me to meet
him in Houston any time that was agreeable,'' McCathern recalled.
``He wanted to help his boy any way he could.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a ``very, very affable meeting'' in Houston, and the
upshot was that Bush resigned from the Trilateral Commission a few
days before the election. But if the elder Bush kept his cool over
the issue, the son occasionally lost his.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Turner, a local radio personality and a Republican, said he
was leaning toward Bush but was troubled by the matter of the
Trilateral Commission. So, at a candidate forum at the Branding
Iron restaurant in Odessa, Turner stood up and asked Bush about the
Trilateral Commission and whether his father was working for
one-world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jumped like he'd been pricked,'' Turner recalled. Then
after the meeting, Turner stood at the door to say goodbye to the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior Bush comes up, refused to shake my hand, looked me
square in the eye and said, `you...''' using a crude epithet.
``Then Kent Hance came up and said, `Mel, I'll see you up at the
Tech game.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a Republican candidate stepping on the wrong toes,''
Turner said. ``He was an arrogant rich kid, a spoiled brat.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Late in the campaign, disaster struck the Bush forces.
</P>
<P>
   A university student was organizing a ``Bush bash'' to recruit
young people from Texas Tech, and he placed an advertisement in the
student newspaper promising free beer. In fact the event was tame
and ended early, but the Democrats had their ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the election, a law partner of Hance wrote a
public letter denouncing the Bush campaign for using alcohol to
lure young people. The letter went to 4,000 members of the Church
of Christ in Lubbock, and copies were put under windshield wipers
of cars of people attending church services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent's opponent, young Mr. Bush, apparently is using tactics
to secure votes which do not indicate the same high character,''
the letter declared. ``Mr. Bush has used some of his vast sums of
money in an attempt, evidently, to persuade young college students
to vote for and support him by offering free alcohol to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The local newspapers wrote about the incident, quoting Hance as
saying: ``Maybe it's a cool thing to do at Harvard or Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called a news conference in which he fumed: ``His campaign
has been funny. First he attacked my family, then my background,
and now my morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Bush found out that Hance owned a building that
was leased to Fat Dawgs, a bar in Lubbock. Some of Bush's friends
urged him to accuse Hance of hypocrisy, but he refused; voters
would reward a candidate who took the high road, he told
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``His weakness was that he wouldn't go for the jugular,'' said
Jane Anne Stinnett, a cotton broker and long-time Republican in
Lubbock. Stinnett said that she was arguing for a tough response to
the beer bash accusations, but ``he just didn't want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Bush was beaten, 53 percent to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were glad the race was over,'' Hance said. ``He was really
improving every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bright guy, and he picked up the issues and got better
as time went on. If it'd been two weeks earlier, we would have
beaten him worse. If it'd been two weeks later, it would have been
really close.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Bush had won, it might not have been the best
thing for his career. He would have become part of the Washington
establishment, and he would not have cultivated the
beyond-the-beltway aura that has been his strength since he
re-entered politics by running for governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hance, he ran for Senate in 1984 but lost and ended up as
a Republican lawyer in Austin and a supporter of the Bushes. Hance
recalls that while in Congress, he met another young southern
Democrat, a Tennessean named Al Gore, and grew friendly with him.
After seeing both men in action, he concludes that Bush is a far
more effective campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that Bush is going to be beat him and beat him
soundly,'' Hance said. ``I served with Gore and I know him, and I
like him. But I'd hate to ride from Lubbock to Los Angeles with
him. If you rode from Lubbock to Los Angeles with Bush, it'd be
loads of fun. And Gore'd be saying things like, `I see some
mountains.'''
</P>
<P>
   So what did Bush learn from his first political contest? How did
it change him?
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have learned that a candidate needs to pick his
races, for it may have been impossible for a Republican oilman from
Midland to win in an overwhelmingly Democratic district dominated
by agriculture and the rival city of Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interesting lesson,'' Bush said in an interview.
``Sometimes there are races you just can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson, some of Bush's friends say, is the need to
respond forcefully to accusations, like those about the ``Bush
bash.'' The high road may be honorable, he discovered, but it does
not necessarily lead to elective office.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, that first campaign taught Bush, as his old pal
O'Neill puts it, ``don't let your opponent define you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He defined George as a carpet-bagger, and it's nonsense,''
O'Neill mused. ``So that's the lesson George learned, when someone
comes out with something, he's on it like a chicken on a June bug,
because he's not going to let someone else define him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hance's take is that he taught Bush a twofold lesson. First, he
says, he showed Bush the need to cultivate the religious right,
those church-goers whom he had largely ignored during the campaign
and who in the end voted against him on the alcohol issue. And
second, he thinks, he helped teach Bush the need to be more folksy.
</P>
<P>
   As Hance puts it: ``He wasn't going to be out-Christianed or
out-good-old-boyed again. He's going to be the good old boy next
door.''

MCCAIN SAYS HE STRONGLY BEHIND BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though he now characterizes his following as a
``reform movement'' and compares himself to the late insurgent
Democrat Robert F. Kennedy, Sen. John McCain said Wednesday he is
going to Philadelphia committed to the election of Gov. George W.
Bush and the retention of a Republican majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Senate office, McCain said he intended to
``devote a significant portion'' of his speech Tuesday night at the
Republican national convention to ``arguing for the election of
Gov. Bush'' rather than promoting his own agenda, which includes
campaign finance reform and other issues inimical to the GOP
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk about campaign reform in a broad sense,'' he said,
``but I'll talk strongly about cynicism and how it affects young
Americans who need to restore their faith in government.'' The
Arizona senator said the Bush campaign had not asked to approve his
prepared remarks, adding that he had no plans to try to rally his
loyalists in the manner of Patrick Buchanan's fiery speech at the
1992 Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also forego the opportunity to clash with
vested party interests at another high-profile appearance in
Philadelphia during a ``shadow convention'' hosted by the
socialite-columnist, Arianna Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pushing his favorite issues on Bush, McCain said he
would campaign with the new Republican nominee for three days
following the convention, a mission that includes an overnight stay
by Bush and his wife, Laura, at the McCains' retreat in the
picturesque Arizona desert.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the fall, McCain said he would campaign for
Republican House and Senate candidates and planned another week of
travel with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as McCain insisted that his relationship with Bush was
cordial, there are still lingering signs of animosity between the
Bush headquarters in Austin and the remnants of the McCain
campaign, which have been relocated in private offices on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was said by one of his lieutenants to have been
``bemused'' by events late last week which resulted in a brief
boomlet to put him on the GOP ticket before Tuesday's announcement
that Dick Cheney would serve as Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Republican sources, the affair was triggered after
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge was dropped from consideration and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott advised Bush not to consider
either McCain or two of his supporters in the Senate, Chuck Hagel
of Nebraska and Fred Thompson of Tennessee, because they were ``not
team players.''
</P>
<P>
   (When asked about Lott's warning in a separate interview,
McCain's chief political advisor, John Weaver, reflected the
hostility between McCain and the Senate leader by saying, ``It's
hard to be a `team player' when the leader takes you to the same
canyon over and over again.'' Lott has repeatedly undercut McCain's
initiatives on campaign finance.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was content with the choice of Cheney _ ``I think
he's entirely capable of attracting independent voters'' _ while
confirming details of his conversation with Ridge that led to
speculation that McCain might wind up as Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was obviously concerned about the ticket,'' McCain said.
``He never said to me he was out of the running, but the fact he
called seemed to me that he had been told he was not on the list.
He said: `Would you accept if asked?' I said: `If I was directly
contacted by Gov. Bush if would be very difficult to say no.' He
said: `You ought to call Gov. Bush.' I said: `I don't want to
call.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, nothing had happened,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he preferred to remain in the Senate and cultivate
his national audience. He said he had moved from campaign mode into
``what I think is a reform movement. Probably not one out of 100 of
my supporters could tell you details of McCain-Feingold'' _ the
campaign finance bill _ ``but I think they sense that something's
wrong in America, that the best sense of ourselves is not being
expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked which political figure he compared himself to, McCain said
without hesitation: ``Bobby Kennedy. I think we struck that same
sort of chord of enthusiasm with young people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was intrigued by Ronald Steel's recent book, ``In
Love With Night,'' which deals with RFK's political passions as
well as his dark, vindictive side; the ``Good Bobby'' and the ``Bad
Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, he made up for all the Bad Bobbies,'' said McCain,
who has his own personal history of poor discipline and foul
temper. ``It's almost a redemption story, a story of a boy who
became a man. Bobby took all the intensities he misused when he was
basically the henchman, the royal executioner'' for President
Kennedy ``and he channeled them into the good'' in the 1968
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When he discussed the book with his friend and colleague, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, McCain said, ``Ted didn't agree. He sent me
another, more adulatory book about his brother.''

 &HT;    Widow of Texas Democrat will be among those introducing George
W. Bush
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - On a Thursday night next week when George W.
Bush accepts the Republican Party's nomination for president, the
widow of a prominent Texas Democrat will be among those introducing
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock, widow of former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, said Bush
campaign manager Joe Allbaugh extended the invitation about two
weeks ago. It's a gesture fraught with symbolism _ a nod to Bush's
late friend and mentor that also seeks to make political hay by
underscoring Bush's bipartisan popularity in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For Texans, it may well be the most emotional moment of the
convention; for those in the other 49 states, the larger context
may be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an honor,'' Jan Bullock said. ``My husband would be
thrilled to death.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's a good chance Bullock _ who died in June 1999,
not long after leaving office _ would have stood up for Bush
himself. Bush sought Bullock's counsel shortly after winning his
first gubernatorial race, and the two became close friends. Bullock
pushed Bush to run for president and even introduced him as a
future president at the governor's 50th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   ``From then on, Bob told him, 'You need to do this. You owe it
to the people,' `` Jan Bullock said. ``Getting Gov. Bush elected is
unfinished business for Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   A fierce but pragmatic Democrat, Bullock _ for whom the new
Texas history museum, now under construction, is named _ was
nevertheless not beyond kicking up dust within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   He even backed Bush when the governor was running for
re-election against Democrat Garry Mauro, Bullock's protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad she's getting her day in the sun,'' said Mauro,
who's running Al Gore's Texas campaign. ``She's a good friend of
mine and she deserves the national press.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mauro said Jan Bullock's speaking on behalf of
Bush wouldn't resonate much in the world outside Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all these guys are trying to come up with symbols, but
aside for a few inside players, who notices?'' Mauro said. ``I
can't remember who introduced John Kennedy or Bill Clinton, can
you? In the long term it has little impact. It's appropriate
considering what we're talking about. It's a nice gesture for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bullock was Mr. Democrat in Texas,'' said state Sen. David
Sibley, R-Waco. ``If he were still alive, he'd be glad and proud to
have a role in the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Will Davis, a Bullock friend and former Democratic Party
head: ``I'm very pleased, the fact that the governor and Mrs. Bush
would include Jan with them. There's no doubt Gov. Bush and Gov.
Bullock were great friends. Bullock thought the world of Bush, and
Bush felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock said she knew the move might not be universally
popular with Texas Democrats, but said the friendship between Bush
and her husband ``transcended politics to begin with. That's how I
feel. I certainly support Democrats and Republicans alike. So
hopefully I won't get rotten eggs thrown at me. I think all Texans
are very, very proud that they're going to have a president from
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's a certain irony at work here.
</P>
<P>
   As Bullock entered his last campaign for lieutenant governor, he
told Jan her speechifying days were almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five thousand speeches later,'' she said, ``here I am.''

 &HT;    DNA testing ordered in case of man already executed
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly four years after his execution, Ellis Wayne
Felker is becoming part of the debate over DNA evidence and capital
punishment. A Middle Georgia judge has ordered evidence in Felker's
case be made available for DNA testing, a technology that did not
exist when he was tried for murder 17 years ago in Houston County.
</P>
<P>
   Houston County District Attorney Kelly Burke still must approve
an agreement between four news organizations, including The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, to determine how the testing and distribution
of the results will be handled. The prosecutor, who was not in
office when Felker was tried, said Wednesday he was satisfied with
all but one component of the agreement and that problem should be
worked out soon.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence could be prepared for shipping this week.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order is believed to be a first nationally for a
case in which a suspect was convicted and executed for murder. DNA
evidence has exonerated eight inmates across the country who were
under death sentences but has not yet been used to shed light on
the guilt of someone who has been put to death.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Felker tests, if conclusive, could raise the
stakes of a national discussion about the fairness and fallibility
of the death penalty. One state _ Illinois _ has formally suspended
executions while officials study reforms of the system, and five
others are considering whether to keep their capital punishment
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Felker, professing his innocence until the end, died in the
electric chair Nov. 15, 1996, for the murder of 19-year-old Evelyn
Joy Ludlam, a college student and cocktail waitress. The evidence
against him was largely circumstantial. The strongest physical
evidence _ hair the State Crime Lab said might have been Felker's _
was found on Ludlam's clothes and can now be analyzed to determine
whether it actually contains his DNA. Prosecutors conceded their
case against Felker was circumstantial. They argued he was the last
person known to have seen Ludlam before she disappeared in November
1981 and fibers from a blanket and her wool coat showed she had
been in his house. The attack was similar, they added, to a 1976
assault for which Felker was convicted of aggravated sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   Felker had told police Ludlam came to his house twice and his
leather shop once on the day authorities believe she disappeared.
He said they had met the night before in a Warner Robins lounge and
had talked about her working at his shop. Felker said he last saw
Ludlam when she left his shop.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, DNA testing has become recognized as a
technology that can unequivocally tie a suspect to evidence such as
hair, tissue or bodily fluids. DNA _ deoxyribonucleic acid _ is the
genetic material contained in human cells and, except for identical
twins, is unique to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   When Felker was tried, analysis of hair evidence was a highly
subjective process in which a technician examined hairs under a
microscope looking for similarities. With the advent of DNA
testing, some states _ though not Georgia _ have limited the use of
microscopic hair analysis in criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable DNA test can analyze bodily fluids or hair
roots and identify the source to a certainty of one in several
billion. Another method, used on less substantial specimens such as
hair fragments, is less precise but can determine that a sample
came from either an individual or one of his maternal relatives. In
the final months before Felker's execution, his lawyers tried to
get a delay and the court's permission to do a DNA analysis of the
hair and other evidence. The courts refused, saying the request
should have been made sooner. The courts allow for such last-minute
requests only when there is a new law that has not been reviewed by
the federal courts or new evidence that had not been available
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Felker might have won that delay if there had been as much
public attention in 1996 on DNA testing in death penalty cases as
there is today, said Mike Mears, one of the attorneys involved in
Felker's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the courts would have given the evidence to us then.
Unfortunately, it's too late for Wayne,'' Mears said. ``But they
owed it to the victim to turn it over. As it is, this poor innocent
victim is still being bandied around.''
</P>
<P>
   Although DNA testing is becoming a new hope of anti-death
penalty activists and lawyers, it is only an option in cases with
hair or bodily fluids as evidence. In Georgia, only 20 of the 130
people on Death Row were also convicted of a sex crime that would
indicate the availability of suitable evidence for testing.
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing has worked against some inmates under a death
sentence. Texas Gov. George W. Bush stopped the execution of Ricky
McGinn on June 1 until evidence found on his victim, his
12-year-old stepdaughter, could be tested. Earlier this month,
preliminary results said the DNA was either McGinn's or a maternal
relative's, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the courts have allowed post-conviction DNA testing
only before an execution. In Virginia, death-penalty opponents
failed in May to get court approval for DNA testing in the case
against Joseph O'Dell III, who had been executed in 1997. Once the
appeals were over, Virginia authorities destroyed the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the Felker case, Houston County Senior Superior Court Judge
L.A. McConnell determined that the evidence was a ``public record''
and available for testing.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell signed court orders specifying that two newspapers _
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Boston Globe _ can have
the evidence tested. The Macon Telegraph and CBS-TV's ``60
Minutes'' news magazine are also petitioning the court to gain
access to the evidence. It could take several months to get the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said McConnell's ruling is the first kind in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anywhere it's been done,'' said Jane Siegel
Greene, executive director of the New York-based Innocence Project
at the Benjamin Cardozo Law School, which has been a leading
advocate for DNA testing in criminal cases. ``It's great that the
state (of Georgia) is at least taking the stance that they aren't
afraid to let the truth come out.''

VILLALONGA QUITS TELEFONICA UNDER PRESSURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Juan Villalonga, the chairman of the Spanish telephone company
planning to buy Lycos Inc., resigned under pressure Wednesday. But
his company, Telefonica SA, said it would press ahead with what it
called ``strategic operations.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Spanish company wouldn't elaborate on
whether those operations include the planned acquisition of Lycos,
a major Internet portal based in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Lycos shares rose 10 percent on expections the departure of
the controversial Villalonga would smooth the way for the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos chief executive Bob Davis said he has been told by
Telefonica executives and board members that its new chief
executive, Cesar Alierta, plans to complete the $12.5 billion deal
announced in May.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said Villalonga will no longer become chairman of
Terra Lycos, the global Internet content and services company to be
created by the merger of Lycos and Telefonica's Terra Networks
division. Under the original deal, Villalonga was to have been its
chairman and Davis its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While Villalonga was the architect of a rapid expansion campaign
for Telefonica, his high pay and flashy lifestyle had alienated
many in Madrid. Lately those included Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's
prime minister, who appointed Villalonga to head the former
telephone monopoly in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga also faced an investigation by regulators into
insider-trading allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga had denied wrongdoing, but many saw his resignation
as an effective concession to political critics. Villalonga's
decision makes the merger plans ``easier on a whole bunch of
fronts,'' Davis said. ``Villalonga, as strong a leader as he was,
had become an overhang. His departure adds certainty to the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to agree, driving up Lycos shares $6.0625 to
close at $65.75 in Nasdaq trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga ``was a controversial figure, and there were concerns
there might be more conflict if he stayed,'' said Deutsche Bank
analyst Andrea Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are still trading far off the projected $97.55 level that
each holder would receive if the merger is completed. Rice cited
concerns that Alierta might not provide enough support to Terra
Lycos, such as access to Telefonica's big wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal's prospects seemed brighter overall Wednesday, said
Lycos institutional shareholder Brian Grove, of the Vaughan, Nelson
unit of Boston-based Nvest LP, an investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like everybody's throwing up their hands and saying,
`Wouldn't it be easier if we all just got on down the road with
someone else?' '' Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   Grove said he will likely vote in favor of the merger, which is
now expected to be put to a shareholder vote in September.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Telefonica didn't discuss the reasons behind
its management change, and a spokesman declined to comment.
Telefonica's new chairman, Alierta, was already a board member and
has been head of Spain's largest tobacco company. Alierta is also a
board member of the Terra Networks division.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica said its board of directors has ``reaffirmed the
company's commitment to carry out all the strategic operations,
which are pending.''

   WATER (Undated) - Arizona and the other six Colorado River
states have reached a tentative deal on long-term water use that
should give California time to reduce its use of the river and
still protect its thirsty neighbors. The deal, which they will
present to Interior officials in Washington Thursday, depends on
Arizona allowing Nevada and perhaps California to participate in
water banking and will occasionally lower Lake Mead by as much as
75 feet during dry years. It does not address the Mexican delta,
which environmentalists say is suffering as U.S. states suck the
river dry. By SHAUN MCKINNON. Story will move in the ``A''

   MORALES (Undated) - The odyssey many face trying to cross the
border from Mexico to the U.S. often is colored by naivete about
how brutal an excursion it can be. Many dismiss the warning about
how hard it is as propaganda, so desperate are they to come to what
they think will be a better life. Using a recent desert death as a
springboard, we travel to Mexico to check out the funeral of the
man and talk to would-be immigrants. On the other side of the
border, we talk to U.S. officials and to people who have made it
and didn't realize how difficult it would be. By THERESA BORDEN.

STOCKS SLIDE IN WAKE OF WARNINGS ON EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks tumbled Wednesday after several companies
warned that their profits would be lower than expected in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said that its third-quarter profits would come in below
forecasts and that second-quarter profits were half what they were
a year ago. Shares of Xerox dropped 2 15/16, to 15\.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, despite an 18 percent jump in second-quarter
profits, said that new-product costs and stiffer competition in
North America would push earnings for the rest of the year below
expectations. Its stock fell 13/16, to 69|.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, Amazon.com reported that its
second-quarter loss had more than doubled, compared with last year,
and that its revenue had fallen a little short of market
expectations. Shares of Amazon tumbled in-after hours trading,
falling below 33, before recovering a bit to $33 11/16. Earlier in
the day an analyst from Lehman Brothers lowered her rating on the
stock. On Tuesday, the stock dropped after the announcement that
Amazon's president and chief operating officer had resigned to
become chief executive of VerticalNet Inc., a Web site manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 183.49 points, or 1.7
percent, to 10,516.48. The Dow was led lower by sharp declines in
Hewlett-Packard and J.P. Morgan. The Nasdaq composite index fell
41.85 points, or 1 percent, to 3,987.72, while the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22.05 points, or 1.5 percent, to
1,452.42. The Nasdaq was pulled lower by declines in Nextel
Communications, Altera, Intel and Microsoft. The S&AMP;P was pulled
lower by General Electric and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices and yields were little changed. The
yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 6.02 percent, from
6.03 percent Tuesday, as the price, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose 2/32, to 103 15/32. The yield on the 30-year bond
was unchanged at 5.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices have been locked in a trading range since April and
it is hard to tell how they will break out of it as long as the
possibility looms that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise
interest rates to slow economic growth and keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   The overall earnings outlook for the second quarter is still
positive, with reports coming in better than expected, according to
both IBES International and First Call/Thomson Financial, which
collect analysts' earnings estimates on the companies in the S&AMP;P
500 index. But that is not helping investors at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that two negative messages are coming through to
investors at the same time. One is the possible rise in rates when
Fed policy-makers meet Aug. 22. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
made that clear Tuesday when he told Congress that the August
decision would depend on whether economic data for July confirmed
that the economy was slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The other is that the growth rate of earnings will slow in the
second half of the year, especially if the Fed is successful in
taming economic growth. While a small slowdown in earnings has been
in the forecasts collected by First Call and IBES, investors may
not have focused on it yet.
</P>
<P>
   The report earlier this week that demand for personal computers
was weaker than expected in the second quarter has also weighed
down the technology sector.

   YAMATO, Japan _ When a serious courtship began nine years ago
with the man who was to become her husband, Yukari Takada grew
tense with apprehension over an ancient problem in Japan that has
only grown more urgent in an increasingly childless age.
</P>
<P>
   As the second daughter in a family of only two children, Takada
was already feeling strong pressure from her parents to preserve
their family name. Furthermore, since her older sister's husband
was a firstborn son who would have to care for his parents, she
expected that the burden of nursing her own parents in their old
age would fall upon her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   So when Makoto Takimura, a reporter with the local newspaper,
finally overcame his shyness and proposed, Takada accepted, but
with the condition that he come to live with her in her parents'
house and adopt her family name. This would reverse the
longstanding practice in Japan of a woman's joining her husband's
family, taking his name and caring for his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother really wanted him to become an adopted groom,'' said
the 34-year-old woman, a classical Japanese music teacher. Adopted
grooms are men who take their wives' names, an age-old but fading
custom.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the young couple agreed on the kind of hybrid living
arrangement that sociologists say is rapidly redefining the
Japanese family in response to pressures as varied as falling
birthrates, the world's most rapidly aging population, sky-high
real estate prices and persistent economic uncertainty after a
decade-long recession.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of some in his own conservative farming
family, Takimura agreed to an arrangement almost unheard of just a
generation ago: living with his wife's family, and assuming the
burden of eventually caring for his mother-in-law, now a widow. He
held the line, though, on the question of his own name, as
evidenced by the dual shingles that hang at the entrance to their
two-story home in this suburb of Yokohama; one bears his
mother-in-law's name and the other bears his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were very reluctant to have me come live here, and
said that if Yukari's family insisted on this, they should come and
visit, to make their case directly, and pay their respects,'' said
Takimura, 39. ``From my family's way of thinking, living like this
was a big sacrifice. To drop my name on top of that would have been
difficult to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Takimura had an older brother who accepted
primary responsibility for their parents' care.
</P>
<P>
   As compromise arrangements like that reached by the Takimura
family grow in number, experts say the Japanese family is shifting
from a model that was once heavily centered on male-based
succession and inheritance, to one of highly variable geometry.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind this shift is the increasingly open and
sometimes raw tug of war between the parents of brides and grooms
to determine which side will reap such vital benefits from their
children as care in old age and maintenance of the family grave
site.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's elderly are the beneficiaries of this country's economic
golden age of the 1960s and 1970s. Many have huge personal savings,
and immensely expensive urban real estate as a result. And,
consequently, the contest between families for the allegiance of
children has become inevitably intertwined with struggles over
inheritance rights. Indeed, more and more men are being lured away
from their own families toward those of their wives by the promise
of financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very big competition taking place for the care that
the children's generation can offer the elderly,'' said Mariko
Fujiwara, research director of the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and
Living in Tokyo. ``Suppose you have both a son and a daughter. The
chances are that you prefer to have your own daughter take care of
you in old age, rather than depend upon my daughter who marries
your son. You might not get along with your daughter-in-law, but
you know your daughter very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggles that are increasingly taking place along these
lines are eroding the male-driven family structure common in Japan.
The problem is only intensified by the fact that many families now
have only one child, making the struggle for children's loyalty
particularly fierce among aging parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that more wives' parents tend to live locally in the
city makes it more reasonable for the daughters to bring their
husbands into their parents' house, even though they accept the
husbands' name, which is a very twisted arrangement,'' Fujiwara
said. ``Instead of patrilineal and patrilocal families, we are
quickly moving toward a system that is bilateral. There is no
difference between the status of the husband or wife's family.
Often, wealth, property or social status determines which side
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Takimura family, Shigeko Takada, the
66-year-old mother of Yukari Takimura, shifts from the indirectness
and euphemism typical of women her age to a matter-of-fact manner
when discussing inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is taking care of me, it is only natural for me to
leave my property to them,'' she explained in the living room of
her handsome, two-story home. ``Of course, I should also leave
something for my other daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Takimura was hearing his mother-in-law's intentions for the
first time, but also made it clear that property considerations had
helped sway his decision about which family to live with.
</P>
<P>
   ``My salary was not big enough to buy a house in Yokohama,'' he
said. ``I figured as long as I live here, I don't have that
problem. Maybe eventually, I thought, I would inherit the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects are still subtle in many cases, playing themselves
out behind the closed doors of the home, but many experts say that
ultimately among the most important consequences of the emergence
of the wife's family as a powerful force will be the strengthening
of the role of women themselves in Japan. They now stand to take a
large stride toward equality with men.
</P>
<P>
   By reputation, Japanese husbands are a fairly callous lot, prone
to spending scant time with the children, doing almost no
housekeeping and staying out late several nights a week drinking
with buddies from work. A traditional adage told here captures both
the husband's and the wife's roles with the three commands uttered
upon his arrival home in the evening: dinner, bath, bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are becoming much stronger in Japan, and their strength
often derives from the strength of the parents, including their
financial strength and property holdings,'' said Masahiro Yamada, a
sociologist at Gakugeidai University in Tokyo. ``We call young men
living with their wives' families in urban areas apple polishers,
meaning they are always trying to be more considerate of their
wives' needs. If not, they risk being thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are well aware of this new power,'' Yamada said, ``and
are growing much less patient with their husbands, and susceptible
to anger.''

<P>
   As a firstborn son, Hiroshi Shimazawa, 45, a writer for the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper in Tokyo, was expected to live with
his parents, but he took up with his new wife's family instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well known that wives often don't get along with their
in-laws, so in the interest of harmony I agreed that we would live
with her family instead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As in most such decisions, there were other, complex
considerations, he allowed, from the fact that his wife's family's
home was more convenient for his commute to work, to the fact that
his wife was pregnant and it made sense to have her near relatives
since his workday often stretched late into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in fact, Shimazawa and his parents-in-law agreed to
buy land together in Chiba, a southern suburb of Tokyo, and build a
two-story house, with the living quarters joined by an external
staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Since their wedding in the mid-1980s, though, Shimazawa said he
had felt the growing influence of his wife's parents over his
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that if we have a little quarrel my wife can always
run up to the second floor to get away from me,'' he said,
chuckling at the thought. ``If I look for the positive side,
though, when she goes upstairs, her parents often say that what she
is quarreling about is a petty thing, and she will come back down
and maybe the whole thing will be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he had accustomed himself to this kind of oversight by
his wife's parents, he sighed. ``Sometimes, I admit, I want to get
away for a while,'' he said. ``I just feel like going on a trip
alone.''

 &HT;    DANFORTH TELLS CONGRESS GOVERNMENT BLAMELESS AT WACO
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a nearly empty hearing room Wednesday, John
Danforth reiterated the major findings of his 10-month, $12 million
investigation into the 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound
near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is absolutely overwhelming,'' Danforth told a
Senate subcommittee. ``The government did not start the fire. The
government did not direct gunfire at the Branch Davidians. The
government did not improperly use the military. And there wasn't
any broad cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a former senator from Missouri, was summoned to
Capitol Hill by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, who sit on the Senate subcommittee on administrative
oversight and the courts. They wanted Danforth to detail his
interim report into the controversial raid.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released last week, cleared the government of any
wrongdoing and said that Davidian leader David Koresh and his
followers were responsible for the fire and the death of about 80
people. The report also cleared the government of engaging in a
massive cover-up or improperly using military personnel at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Branch Davidians started the fire. (They) spread fuel
throughout this complex. The Branch Davidians then began shooting
their own people, including children,'' Danforth told the senators.
``One of the children _ around 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 half years of age we
believe _ was stabbed to death. ... That's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who chairs a task force on Waco, has said he wanted to
hear from Danforth before deciding whether to hold more
congressional hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Although three other senators briefly came in and out of the
hearing room, Specter for the most part was sitting alone on the
dais during the polite exchange with his former colleague.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Danforth if the use of pyrotechnic tear gas grenades at
the raid was part of the plan authorized by Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Danforth responded. ``In fact, the attorney general was
quite concerned about the possibility of fire, and she said she
asked for and received assurances that the pyrotechnics would not
be used in the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his investigation is 95 percent complete, but that
he is still looking into the question of who knew about the
pyrotechnics and why the information wasn't shared.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the evidence points to ``human mistakes'' and not
any conspiracy. He said, for example, that a young lawyer in the
Justice Department knew about the use of pyrotechnic devices and
failed to tell anyone about it. Aware of her mistake, she covered
it up in fear of losing her job and ruining her career, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth also told the senators that the use of pyrotechnic
devices is ``inconsequential'' and has ``nothing to do with the
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The three pyrotechnic rounds were fired four hours before the
fire broke out. They were fired in a direction away from the
building itself and they caused no damage to anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Reno appointed Danforth to answer what he called the
``dark questions'' surrounding the Waco raid, including whether
federal agents started the fire that consumed the Davidians or
whether they fired on sect members during the standoff's last
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said the conclusions of his interim report are based on
more than 2 million pages of documents, interviews with almost 900
witnesses and examination of volumes of physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The government was also vindicated in a civil trial earlier this
month in Waco, where a five-member jury decided the government was
not responsible for the deaths. The ruling came in a $675 million
wrongful-death suit brought by surviving cult members and the
victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said at Wednesday's hearing that
he hopes the latest investigation into the raid will be the last
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been picking the Waco siege apart for years now. Senator
Danforth's meticulous report should be the coda. Enough is
enough,'' he said.

 &HT;    A soulful Tina Turner for the '00s
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take Tina Turner. Drop the last name, replace the ``T'' with a
``K'' and subtract a few decades from her age. Now what have you
got? This. Really.
</P>
<P>
   Were the soulful rocker formerly known as Annie Mae Bullock
making her bow this year rather than in 1956 (and were she doing a
better job of choosing material than she did on her recent coaster
``Twenty Four Seven''), it's pretty easy to imagine that she would
sound like Kina.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of Brownstone (``If You Love Me''), just before
that early-1990s R&AMP;B trio went away, Kina returns with a solo debut
of love-me (``Girl From the Gutter''), love-you (``Give and Take'')
and leave-me-alone (``Have a Cry'') songs roared in Tina's husky
twang. At times it becomes a little too easy for a listener to
drift away into the prominent guitars, rendered unable to make out
a hook or her seemingly straight-from-the-journal lyrics. But then,
out of this nowhere, comes Kina imitating a fiery wah-wah guitar,
on ``Hurt So Bad,'' or stabbing away with every line of
crowd-rouser ``U Don't Know.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Kina, we may not ``know you or your situation,'' as you so
snappily snarl on the first release from this album. But we can't
help but feel you. And be moved.
</P>
<P>
   'Kina'
</P>
<P>
   Kina. Dreamworks. 11 tracks. Grade: B+

 &HT;    CD mini reviews

   ``Hahn Plays Barber and Meyer Violin Concertos''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Hahn, violin, St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Hugh Wolff,
conductor, Sony Classical.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the opening minute and a half of Hahn's recording of
Samuel Barber's lyrical Violin Concerto and you'll reach for
``replay'' on the CD player. It's a long moment to savor. In that
exposed first theme, as throughout the concerto, she phrases with
an authority and a sincerity that's disarming, tender and extremely
moving. There's bloom in her tone, and never a hint of received
interpretation. Wisely, she's also starting to explore contemporary
music. But Hahn's (or more likely Sony's) choice of Edgar Meyer's
Violin Concerto, written for her in 1999, is thin: a charming and
disposable work of forced Americana, rescued by ample opportunities
for the soloist to shine. In the future, Hahn needs to find gutsier
projects. Yet at 20, she has already moved into the front rank of
active violinists. Where will she be in a couple of decades, in her
prime?

   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell shakes off the
pressures of his job with a liberal dose of Freddy Cole. The
Atlanta jazz pianist and vocalist could teach relaxation technique
to Deepak Chopra. The way Cole's voice gently melds with tenor
saxophonist Eric Alexander's work on the standard ``It's
Impossible'' could calm any road rager on Ga. 400. The song
selection adds to the joys of taking a whirl on ``Merry Go Round''
as well. For the majority of the project, Cole has chosen rarely
recorded standards that fit snugly with his laid-back stylings. For
example, the title track, written by Herb Martin and Bobby Scott,
feels like a song you're well-acquainted with but arrives without
the cliched baggage that yet another rendering of, say, ``My Funny
Valentine'' would have brought.

<P>
   Eve 6 exemplifies ``modern rock'' _ aka alternative. It's slick,
palatable, occasionally engaging, but mostly faceless. Not that it
stops them from selling records. The band's 1998 debut went
platinum and sounded just as personality-challenged. The photogenic
Los Angeles trio fares best when it kicks into high gear, offering
a glimmer of individuality on ``Nocturnal'' and the appropriately
titled ``Amphetamines.'' Sadly, that's all too rare.

   Dogstar. Ultimatum Music. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   If one-third of the rock trio Dogstar didn't happen to be named
Keanu Reeves, these guys would not be getting much attention, and
they're not getting that much as it is. Unlike stars of many other
laughable movie star vanity projects (Bruce Willis' ``The Return of
Bruno'' is still
</P>
<P>
   the ultimate), Reeves keeps a low profile in the band, just
playing bass. Singer-guitarist Bret Domrose is the focus (he has a
little of Reeves' stoner-surfer inflection on some songs, and
sounds like Creed's Scott Stapp on others), while Robert Mailhouse
plays drums.
</P>
<P>
   Their U.S. debut CD (they had a Japanese-only release in 1996)
is standard post-grunge alt-rock, ranging from nicely melodic
(``Enemies,'' ``Stagger'') to yawn-worthy (``Swim'') to
what-were-they-thinking (a cringe-inducing cover of Leon Russell's
``Superstar'').
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is touring with the band this summer, then heads to
Australia to make ``Matrix 2.'' Good career move, dude.

   Scorpions with the Berlin Philharmonic. EMI Classics. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the sturm und drang of it: Germany's premiere bombastic
metal act teams up with what until now has been one of the most
conservative orchestras on the planet for a set of musical excess.
Think the Scorpion's 1984 hit ``Rock You Like a Hurricane'' was
overwrought? Wait till you hear the string-swamped update,
``Hurricane 2000.'' Conductor and arranger Christian Kolonovits,
who has worked with the Three Tenors, certainly whips the
philharmonic into a frenzy _ even Wagner never elicited so much
sawing and blowing. Meanwhile, Scorpions vocalist Klaus Meine's
famously thin wail struggles to rise above it all. Yet ``Moment of
Glory'' isn't unlistenable, and at times you'll find yourself
giggling with glee at the Spinal Tap-style heavy-handedness. Only a
sappy rendition of the Diane Warren ballad ``Here in My Heart''
will have you reaching for the off button.

 &HT;    Move over King: Rice takes first chapter of `Merrick' online
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've finished reading the first chapter of Stephen King's
online novel, ``The Plant,'' and are looking for something else
scary, click onto www.contentville.com for a first-chapter preview
of Anne Rice's next book, ``Merrick'' (Knopf, $26.95). The book's
second chapter will be posted before the novel is published Oct.
17.
</P>
<P>
   A special boutique at the site also features an interview with
the author about the novel, her writing process and some of the
issues she addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrick Mayfair, who is referred to in the book as an
`octoroon,' is not the first character of mixed race that I've
written about,'' Rice says in the interview. ```The Feast of All
Saints,' which was published in 1978, is about the free people of
color, as they were called before the Civil War, or the Creole _
the mixed-blood descendants of the French, the Spanish and the
African.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the creatures of the night. The novel
weaves together Rice's two haunting worlds of witches and vampires
when the beautiful Merrick meets David Talbot, a storyteller,
adventurer and ``almost-mortal vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   Other electronic serials and original works are planned, says
Heather Byer, senior editor for Contentville.com. Earlier in July,
the site published ``Widespread Panic,'' a collection of five
fiction and nonfiction pieces by James Ellroy (``L.A.
Confidential'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A King's royalties: Demand for King's first serialized digital
novel fell short of the numbers for his first e-book in March. More
than 400,000 downloaded ``Riding the Bullet'' within the first two
days it appeared. So far, only 41,000 copies of the first chapter
of ``The Plant'' have been downloaded from www.stephenking.com
since Monday. But King's assistant, Marsha DeFilippo, told The New
York Times that the author was ``very pleased'' with the sales.
Readers were asked to pay $1 per chapter using an honor system.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the air: Athens author Terry Kay has gotten the word that
Hallmark Hall of Fame will begin filming his novel, ``The
Runaway,'' on Aug. 16. The location hasn't been announced, but
Campbell Scott, son of the late George C. Scott, will play the key
role of the sheriff, says Kay, whose novel ``To Dance With the
White Dog'' also was a Hallmark project.
</P>
<P>
   The plot for ``The Runaway'' centers on two 12-year-old boys _
one black, one white _ who were born the same hour of the same day.
When the friends set out on a rafting trip, a discovery of a human
bone sparks an investigation that makes the people in the rural
Georgia county examine their feelings about justice and racial
equality. The show is scheduled to air Dec. 10 on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Online: CNN.com will host an online book chat with Anne Rivers
Siddons at 1 p.m. Tuesday at CNN.com/chat. Siddons will discuss her
book ``Nora, Nora'' (HarperCollins, $25). The chat will be open to
online users worldwide, and questions for Siddons will be taken
directly from the chat. A transcript of the chat will be archived
online at CNN.com/chat. In the novel, Siddons explores the life of
Peyton McKenzie, an angst-ridden adolescent who has founded the
Losers Club, where she and two other misfits share their daily
doses of unhappiness. But everything changes when her cousin Nora
shows up for a visit.

 &HT;    A day of momentous events
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families, love and
forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with small
miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
three-hour epic about a day in the San Fernando Valley is
exhilarating and exhausting. It's the sort of movie you live
through as much as watch.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is well worth it. Among the stellar acting talents:
Tom Cruise, Jason Robards and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution: According to the e-mail and conversations I
had during its theatrical run, ``Magnolia'' seemed to be the one
movie of 1999 that people either really loved or really, really
hated. That's one thing that makes it great: the power to inspire
strong feelings.
</P>

   `Magnolia'

<P>
   &QR;  ``The Beach'' (R) _ Sand, surf and a secondhand plot. In his
first film since ``Titanic,'' Leonardo DiCaprio plays a restless
young man who travels with other aimless, privileged young people
to a hidden paradise _ and they mess it up. It's hard to get
attached to characters who care about only one thing: their next
moment of pleasure. The cinematography makes the most of exotic
locations. But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the
film's gorgeous emptiness. Grade: C

LEARNING TO LIVE WITH BIG BROTHER

 BC - CPT-EMAIL-SURVEILLANCE-REVIEW-NYT  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (The Week in Review)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1928, the Supreme Court took up the case of Roy
``Big Boy'' Olmstead, a bootlegger whose phones had been tapped by
federal agents without a warrant. The court ruled that evidence
obtained in that way was legal, prompting a remarkable dissent by
Judge Louis D. Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress of science in furnishing the government with the
means of espionage is not likely to stop with wiretapping,''
Justice Brandeis wrote in a dissent that the court adopted as the
law nearly 40 years later. ``Ways may some day be developed by
which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers,
can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to
expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ubiquity of e-mail and the ingenuity of the FBI,
that day has arrived. Over the last couple of weeks it has been
widely reported that the FBI is now using a computer program called
Carnivore, which, once installed on the network of an Internet
service provider, can troll through millions of e-mail messages and
hone in on the electronic correspondence of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FBI has reported using the program fewer than 25
times since it was developed 18 months ago, but that number is
expected to grow quickly, since the the bureau expects it to become
an indispensable law enforcement tool, particularly in
international espionage and terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, say critics, but Carnivore is also capable of
simultaneously monitoring the communications of people not
suspected of a crime. That has caused civil liberties groups and
privacy advocates to worry that the technology might be used to
monitor unpopular groups or political enemies, and not just
suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill began voicing their
concerns, the White House moved to calm the growing storm. John
Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, outlined legislative
proposals that would set legal requirements for surveillance in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that some kind of legislation is needed to make
sense of the existing patchwork of laws and court cases on
electronic surveillance. At present, for example, e-mail sent via
cable modem is more strictly protected that any other communication
form _ even telephone conversations _ while law enforcement
requests for lists of telephone calls to or from a particular line
must be granted without question by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed replacing these illogical distinctions
with a uniform, rational set of standards. Civil liberties and
privacy groups support this idea in principle, but are highly
critical of the administration for refusing to explain how broadly
it intends to use Carnivore or to describe what safeguards are in
place for preventing its abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that computer systems like
Carnivore are necessary because e-mail is becoming more frequently
used for communication among criminals. And the officials note that
these cybermonitors can actually be set to record communications
much more selectively than a phone tap.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore could, for instance, be programmed to pick up the
e-mail from only one sender and a particular computer, while
excluding such e-mail as messages to or from, say, the sender's
lawyer or wife. Phone taps, on the other hand, pick up everything.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing on Friday, top FBI officials also announced
plans to submit Carnivore to analysis by independent academics, and
noted that the system kept a log of what it was asked to pick up,
which could be used by a court to spot any violations.
</P>
<P>
   In making their case, supporters of cybersurveillance say that
the only way to track e-mail is by combing through all of the
messages on a particular network, because e-mail consists of a
series of digital packets that are broken apart at the sending end
and transmitted along multiple electronic paths before being
reconstituted by the recipient's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, privacy groups and some Internet service providers,
or ISPs, say there remains a less intrusive alternative. The
providers, like AOL or the Microsoft Network, could be ordered by a
court to turn over specific material, rather than give the FBI
unlimited access to a network. That is precisely how telephone
companies are treated; they cooperate with warrants for wiretaps
and lists of telephone numbers called from a particular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is who should be in control,'' said James X.
Dempsey, staff attorney for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a civil liberties group in Washington. ``It upsets the
balance among competing interests and privacy for law enforcement
to, in essence, kick the companies out of the way, hook up a black
box, and say, don't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that it was time for a reappraisal of all the
standards used by the government to eavesdrop, particularly as the
world moves into an era of digital communications that can be more
readily monitored by computers and more easily masked by
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   As even household appliances begin to be wired into the Internet
and many of our most personal thoughts and associations are now
shared with the computer, the issue has taken on a new imperative
and is being debated on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The British government (whose house-to-house searches in the
English colonies led to the Fourth Amendment prohibition against
unreasonable searches) is near to adopting a law, the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Bill, or RIP, that would require Internet
service companies to finance the permanent installation of a
Carnivore-like system for government use.
</P>
<P>
   A similar system is already in place in Russia, while in the
Netherlands a debate is raging over whether the government should
have the authority to tap into e-mail at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate really cries out for a return to first
principles,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a research organization that studies
privacy issues and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important of such principles, he said, is that
the government should always use the least intrusive investigative
techniques before taking the invasive step of trying to intercept
telephone calls or e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the solution?'' he asked. ``A lot of oversight, a lot
of accountability, and a great deal of concern about the potential
surveillance capabilities of the electronic police state.''

SURVEY SHOWS STRUGGLING DOT-COMS ARE SHEDDING WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIC   c.2000 San Francisco Examiner   SAN
FRANCISCO _ Since December, 122 dot-com companies have announced
staff cuts leaving a total of 7,952 workers out of a job, according
to a survey released this week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And of the 122 dot-coms that announced job cuts, about 20
percent of them have shut their doors for good, according to the
survey released by the New York-based outplacement firm Challenger,
Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com period of survival of the fittest could be
expected to escalate, and so it has,'' said John A. Challenger, the
chief executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   One are that has been less affected by the job reductions is the
business-to-business field, known as B2B, or the direct exchange of
supplies and products between enterprises. ``As an early entry to
the Internet, B-to-B is proving to be better prepared to withstand
major changes in the marketplace than some of the newcomers,''
Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey divided the Internet industry into five major
sectors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retail accounted for 24 percent, or 1,812, of the total job
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The service sector trimmed 1,287 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entertainment cut 948 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet portals shed 786 workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The health and fitness sector furloughed 671 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 122 companies reporting job cuts were:
</P>
<P>
   _ BabyCenter.com, an e-commerce site based in San Francisco that
laid off 80 workers in February.
</P>
<P>
   _ Violet.com, a San Francisco boutique, let go all of its
workers (total unknown) before folding in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Francisco's HealthShop, a health food store, dismissed 60
workers before selling the company in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City, Calif., portal, fired 15
people in April.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salon.com, the San Francisco Web magazine, layed off 19
people, or 9 percent of its staff, in June.
</P>
<P>
   _ eBay, the San Jose auction site, reduced its staff by 13
people in July.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Video games, DVD players and even the PC are
moving out of the home and onto the road, which has made owning a
simple CD or cassette player for your set of wheels last century's
news.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuries usually strewn about the family room are becoming
popular gadgets in cars and in roomy SUVs. Ever since Oldsmobile
introduced a videocassette player for its minivans in 1998,
car-stereo enthusiasts have been adding more dazzle to audio
systems with the addition of video. And the automotive world is
jumping on the bandwagon; every major manufacturer now offers video
in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment systems, equipped with everything from video-game
consoles to TV tuners, are not only making the open road more
enjoyable but also more peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Want to keep the kids occupied on a long road trip? Let them
watch their favorite movies on 5- to 7-inch headrest monitors or on
overhead screens in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families bring the minivans in,'' says Jason Krimm,
owner of Stereo-In-Dash in Dayton. ``We'll hook up a VCR or DVD
player and a few screens with headphones, and you don't have to
hear Barney singing. All the noise will stay in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming sales of comfy SUVs and the continuing popularity of
spacious minivans have created a growing market for video-enhanced
joy rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-car entertainment seems to be the most popular catch phrase
right now,'' says Sean Pate, public relations coordinator for
Pioneer, one of the biggies in the world of car electronics.
``People want to set up their cars like they would their homes with
DVD and video games and surround sound. Sales show that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the price tag for such systems isn't as exciting. Most
systems require some type of controlling head unit for the
dashboard. Add a few screens and a six-disc DVD/CD changer, and
you'll be looking at approximately $5,000 for a Pioneer system.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic has a similar setup. Head unit ($2,000), DVD player
($1,200), a 7-inch LCD screen ($1,100) and a Dolby processor for
surround sound ($800) will run $5,100.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a display screen in the front seat? Check out
Clarion's motorized head unit equipped with a 6.4-inch LCD screen
($1,100) and audio/video inputs. Tack on another $1,000 for video.
</P>
<P>
   But these high-tech gadgets aren't all about fun. Get some work
done on the go with Clarion's AutoPC, which runs on Microsoft's
Windows CE software. The information superhighway can be accessed
while on the interstate with the mobile minicomputer's wireless
connection. E-mail and even stock quotes are a few clicks away.
</P>
<P>
   Want to groove to trendy MP3 music files? Software should be
available soon for the AutoPC to play your favorite downloads.
</P>
<P>
   But the features don't stop there. The $1,300 voice-activated
system can be outfitted to get navigation directions, check your
gas mileage or to alert you of engine problems. And though sales
are sluggish now, Krimm sees a future for in-car information
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could run a business right out of your car if you wanted
to,'' said Krimm. ``You can get full-blown computers installed in
your trunk with wireless keyboards. But you're going to pay five
times as much for the (mobile) versions. It'll probably get big in
the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   But bombarding a driver with so many distractions does have its
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These video systems pose the same threat as using a cellular
phone does,'' says Sergeant Eric Widmyer of the Ohio Highway
Patrol. ``If you're going to include one of these systems, be sure
that all display devices are out of the driver's view. There's too
much happening on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some states ban all display devices within the driver's
view, Ohio has no such law.
</P>
<P>
   Widmyer says that voice-activated systems provide a better
alternative than systems that require fiddling with knobs and
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like with a cell phone,'' he says. ``If you need to
divert your attention, pull over and get off of the road.''

RESEARCHERS LINK SIDS TO HEART DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers from Italy have provided the first genetic evidence
linking sudden infant death syndrome to a rare heart disorder
called long-QT syndrome, they are reporting Thursday in The New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter J. Schwartz, first author of the report and chairman
of the cardiology department at the University of Pavia, estimated
that the heart problem might account for 25 percent to 30 percent
of sudden infant deaths, and he suggested that many babies could be
saved if all newborns were given electrocardiograms to screen for
the heart disorder. Those found to have it could then be given
preventive treatment, usually drugs called beta blockers.
</P>
<P>
   American experts praised Schwartz's research, but not his
suggestion to screen all newborns. They warned that it would
require testing thousands of healthy infants to save even one life,
and that some infants with ambiguous electrocardiograms would be
given unneeded treatment for the heart disorder. Critics of the
proposal also said there were not enough experts to read
electrocardiograms on the nearly 4 million babies born each year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julian Hoffman, a pediatric cardiologist at the University
of California at San Francisco, estimated that if all babies were
screened, it would cost $500,000 to save one life.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz said, ``If I were a parent, I wouldn't want my son
to die just because we didn't do an electrocardiogram, and I
wouldn't give a damn if we had to screen 1,000 to save my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudden infant death syndrome, also called SIDS or crib death,
kills 0.7 in 1,000 babies in the United States, about 2,800 a year.
The babies, seemingly healthy, die unexpectedly in their first
year, usually in their sleep. The cause is not known, but many
cases appear related to breathing problems, and in 1994 doctors
began urging parents to put infants to bed on their backs rather
than on their stomachs, to avoid blocking their airways. In recent
years, deaths from the disorder have fallen by about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said he and his colleagues had been studying another
possible cause of SIDS since the early 1970s, heart-rhythm
abnormalities. The focus of their interest is long-QT syndrome, an
electrical abnormality in the heart that causes a greatly increased
risk of sudden death in children and young people. It is rare,
affecting only about one person in 10,000, and is caused by any one
of several genetic mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the researchers studied 33,034 infants who had
electrocardiograms at birth and were followed for a year. Of 24
babies who died of SIDS, half had long-QT syndrome. Overall,
infants with the heart problem were 41 times as likely to die of
SIDS than those with normal electrocardiograms. But a majority of
babies with long-QT syndrome remained perfectly healthy. No genetic
testing was done.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Schwartz and other researchers did not recommend
routine electrocardiograms for newborns. But they did recommend
them for infants at high risk because of a family history of SIDS
or long-QT syndrome, or a near death from a heart or breathing
problem resembling SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The paper being published Thursday shows that family history
cannot be trusted to identify high-risk babies. The article
describes one case in which parents found their 44-day-old son
blue, not breathing and with no pulse. He was taken to a hospital
and revived, and he survived without brain damage. His
electrocardiogram showed long-QT syndrome, and genetic testing
revealed a gene defect known to cause the heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing about the case, the researchers said, was
that neither parent had the gene defect, which therefore must have
developed in the child as a spontaneous mutation. Theoretically,
such a random mutation could strike anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Myerburg, director of cardiology at the University
of Miami Medical Center, said of Schwartz: ``He has demonstrated
that the long QT can be the basis for SIDS. What percentage of
cases are accounted for by that mechanism is unknown. Schwartz
probably thinks 30 percent. I think lower.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the percentage were 10 percent, Dr. Myerburg said,
treatment could still save a significant number of babies.
</P>
<P>
   But he agreed that routine screening of all newborns was
impractical. It might become possible, he said, if software could
be developed to help analyze electrocardiograms and single out
abnormal ones needing expert analysis.

   Taking the classic ``Panic Button'' concept and giving it
multi-functionality, Dakota Alert's Dial Alert ($170;
www.dakotaalert.com) will automatically dial up to nine
pre-programmed phone or pager numbers and send individual
pre-recorded voice messages to each. Designed to augment other
security devices such as their Wireless Door Contacts ($50 each),
Wireless PIR Sensor (a motion detector, $60) or the Wireless Panic
Button ($60 each), these affordable security devices are ideally
suited to the small business office, retail store or warehouse.
It's one thing to trigger a blaring alarm but quite another to have
a telephone contact-person safely detached from the alarming
situation and able to respond calmly and objectively. The Dial
Alert is AC-powered but also has a battery backup so a power
failure or disruption will not affect operation.

KERRY CRITICIZES CHENEY'S CONSERVATIVE VOTING RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John F. Kerry Wednesday sharply criticized
the conservative voting record of GOP vice presidential candidate
Dick Cheney, while acknowledging he remains under consideration to
be Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those watching as well as participating'' in Gore's
search, Kerry said, but he refused to discuss any conversation he
had with Gore during a $250,000 Democratic fund-raiser the night
before at the senator's Georgetown home.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol Hill news conference on Internet privacy
legislation, Kerry condemned Cheney's congressional votes against
Head Start funding, the Clean Water Act, and a resolution calling
for the release of Nelson Mandela. ``I think what George Bush has
done is help define the race, and in that way it may be very
helpful to the country in the end,'' Kerry said, referring to the
GOP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism earned Kerry an instant rebuke from Senator John
McCain, the Arizona Republican who had joined Kerry at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered Kerry a near-endorsement and tribute as one of
``the best Americans in both parties,'' but when Kerry criticized
Cheney, McCain complained: ``Any voting record can be selectively
described ... That happened to me in the primary campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry refused to relent, adding, ``I think you have to examine
overall thought, and that's the health of a good debate.''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted McCain to break off the mini-debate by quipping,
``To be continued on `Crossfire.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is continued buzz that Gore's short list includes Kerry,
Senators Bob Graham of Florida, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Dick Durbin
of Illinois, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and Tom Harkin of
Iowa, as well as former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to announce his choice Aug. 8 or 9, less than a
week before the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Gore
spokesman Mark Fabiani mocked any handicapping of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone in the Gore campaign not named Al Gore or Warren
Christopher who tells you they know what's going on, they're
basically trying to impress you without knowing what's going on,''
said Fabiani, referring to the former secretary of state heading
Gore's search.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry joked about the speculation Tuesday night before about 50
donors who paid $5,000 each to join Gore at a Democratic National
Committee fund-raiser held at the federalist mansion the senator
shares with his wife, Teresa Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that a number of you have come up to me
tonight and asked me if I have any interest at all in serving as
vice president with Al Gore. Actually, none of you asked me that,
and I'm a bit ticked off,'' he said to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   He then introduced Gore with a sharp attack on Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two words that I think will brighten your eyes for the
next several months: Dick Cheney,'' Kerry said. ``I mean, he really
makes the words `compassionate conservative' as difficult to utter
as `Red Sox' and `World Series.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, McCain was asked about the
prospect of Kerry's being chosen for vice president. McCain
replied: ``I think it would be very helpful to Vice President Gore.
I think Senator Kerry has proven his service to our nation and his
ability as an accomplished debater. He personally knows the issues
and, therefore, I strongly recommend that Vice President Gore not
select Senator Kerry as his running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   After the resulting laughter, McCain added, ``I think that the
best Americans in both parties should be the nominees; I would
certainly put Senator Kerry in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kerry was asked about Cheney, he alluded to the ``I knew
John Kennedy'' put-down by Democrat Lloyd Bentsen during a 1988
vice presidential debate with Republican Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served with Dick Cheney in Congress,'' Kerry said. ``I knew
him as a secretary of defense, obviously, so I know Dick Cheney,
and Dick Cheney is a friend of mine, and Dick Cheney is no John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator added that Cheney's voting record ``reflects a
thought process'' worthy of debate. It was then that McCain
delivered his rebuke.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Macintosh program gives worldwide radio
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few sights are as rare as the review of a Macintosh
program in this space.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, that's what we're going to do today.
</P>
<P>
   I am not fond of the Macintosh _ and I'll thank you to refrain
from bombarding me with e-mail in protest _ but it falls to my lot
to use one at work.
</P>
<P>
   A publicist from Aladdin, which generally produces its little
programs first for the Mac and later, if they prove popular, for
the PC, interested me in something called the Aladdin Tuner.
</P>
<P>
   This is a really neat little application that presents the user
with a world map from which he can select a country, or, in the
case of the United States, a state, and get a list of plugged-in
radio stations and, in some cases, television stations there.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to the stations' home pages from the list, or just
click to begin receiving their broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, requires RealPlayer, but most of you, I
imagine, have already got a version of that.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned that some of the stations seem to require a pretty
recent version of RealPlayer, which can be downloaded at
www.realplayer.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The list of stations is broken down into formats _ jazz, heavy
metal, even, where available, that most unusual of formats,
classical. There is a search function that, for instance, allows
the user to find all the available gospel stations in Georgia or
all the talk stations in China.
</P>
<P>
   On my Power Macintosh G3, television comes through in a window
too small to be useful except in the most extreme emergencies.
Radio, for the most part, comes through pretty cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an available station that's not on the list, you can
ask Aladdin to add it, and the company promises updates once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   You can set up a menu of your own favorite stations. Aladdin
Tuner will also play CD and MP3 music.
</P>
<P>
   You can download a free version of the tuner that will work for
30 days before you have to register it or let it die. The price of
registering is $30.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, and downloading, go to the company's Web
site at www.aladdinsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's available now only for Macintosh computers
running System 8 or better. One hopes it will be forthcoming for
the PC in due time.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Receiving offensive e-mail no joking matter to many
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a recent trip we stayed with friends. My girlfriend
was showing me her computer, and an e-mail joke appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The joke contained references to drunkenness, adultery and
public indecency. It was not a very funny joke and seemed even more
tasteless considering the source was a 15-year-old relative.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail prompted a conversation about the unwanted e-mails
that she receives from friends. She described one e-mail with
cartoon images of President Clinton involved in unpresidential
activities and another e-mail with naked men in baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   The bad jokes put her in an awkward position. Should she ask the
senders to refrain from sending jokes, or should she just delete
them without insulting anyone?
</P>
<P>
   I believe she should request to be taken off her friend's and
family's joke mailing lists. Why should anyone feel obligated to
accept unwanted and offensive e-mails? This computer, like many
family computers, is shared among the two adults in the home and a
grade-schooler. Her daughter does not need the added education
provided in these e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Bad jokes traveling through cyberspace end up in businesses as
well as homes. Many people complain about receiving these offensive
e-mails at their work addresses.
</P>
<P>
   These jokes are more alarming to some computer users than spam
because they know the senders. They should also be easier to
eliminate than mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   There should be required cyber-education to tame the reckless in
cyberspace. One key lesson would be to treat your e-mails as if
they were your conversation. Would you walk into a luncheon with
friends and pass around cartoons of naked men? Would you put them
in envelopes and send them through the U.S. Postal Service? Why
would you e-mail them? Would you tell dirty jokes at the
playground? Why would you send them to those same people from your
home computer?
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect other drivers to observe the rules of the road, and
the same is true as we travel through cyberspace,'' according to
LearntheNet (www.learnthenet.com) on its netiquette page.
</P>
<P>
   Netiquette, or etiquette for the Internet, should begin with
basic courtesies. E-mail users should not waste time and space
sending unwanted messages. Senders should refrain from mailing
dirty jokes to every e-mail address they know.
</P>
<P>
   The inappropriate use of e-mail is growing, and someone ought to
tell computer users to follow a decent code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   There are many Web sites with advice on Internet etiquette,
including www.albion.com/netiquette/introduction.html.
</P>
<P>
   I have asked to be removed from these lists and have maintained
relationships with the jokesters. Tell your friends how much you
enjoy their actual conversation. Then ask them to take you off the
jokes, prayers or other nonsense lists if you do not wish to be
included. Good friends will find a better way to communicate with
you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not getting enough jokes, you can sign up for joke
mailing lists or read them at Web sites. The Jokester's joke list
(www.jokester.com/listinfo.html) is a free subscription-based
service (intended for mature audiences).

</P>
<P>
   PC Language
</P>
<P>
   A computer was something on TV from a science-fiction show of
note.
</P>
<P>
   Window was something you hated to clean.
</P>
<P>
   And ram was the cousin of a goat.
</P>
<P>
   Meg was the name of my girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   And gig was a job for the nights.
</P>
<P>
   Now they all mean different things.
</P>
<P>
   And that really mega bytes.
</P>
<P>
   An application was for employment.
</P>
<P>
   A program was a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   A cursor used profanity.
</P>
<P>
   A keyboard was a piano.
</P>
<P>
   Compress was something you did to the garbage, not something you
did to a file.
</P>
<P>
   And if you unzipped anything in public, you'd be in jail for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Log on was adding wood to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drive was a long trip on the road.
</P>
<P>
   A mouse pad was where a mouse lived.
</P>
<P>
   And a backup happened to your commode.
</P>
<P>
   Cut you did with a pocketknife.
</P>
<P>
   Paste you did with glue.
</P>
<P>
   A web was a spider's home.
</P>
<P>
   And a virus was the flu.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'll stick to my pad and paper and the memory in my
head.
</P>
<P>
   I hear nobody's been killed in a computer crash but when it
happens they'll wish they were dead.

 &HT;    Prestigious commercial furnishings show relocating here from
Miami
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta has landed a prestigious commercial
furnishings show.
</P>
<P>
   NeoCon South is moving from Miami to Atlanta. The show will be
April 4-5 at the Georgia World Congress Center and there is a
possibility it could settle here.
</P>
<P>
   The show is expected to draw 3,500 to 5,000 people, which is
considered moderate in size by convention bureau officials.
</P>
<P>
   NeoCon South is affiliated with one of the most prestigious
furnishing shows in the industry, the NeoCon World's Trade Fair in
Chicago, which draws more than 60,000 people annually.
</P>
<P>
   The shows attract designers, architects, facility managers and
business executives who are involved in furnishing offices,
restaurants, hotels and other commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a talented and large design community in Atlanta and
it's thriving, so a regional show like NeoCon South seems to be a
good fit,'' said Barbara Copeland, an interior designer at Gensler.
</P>
<P>
   The regional show started two years ago in Miami, but was ``not
drawing the type of attendee we were looking for. There weren't
enough corporate and business users,'' said Melvin R. Schlitt, vice
president of marketing for Chicago-based Merchandise Mart
Properties, the show's producer.
</P>
<P>
   The NeoCon show in Chicago ``is without question the biggest and
most important event to this industry in North America,'' said
Jennifer Busch, editor-in-chief of Contract magazine, a trade
publication. ``Within the last few years the people who own NeoCon
have purchased or started up regional shows in markets throughout
the county.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the Chicago show, they ``make up a package of a
strong national show and strong regional shows.''

   ATLANTA _ Atlanta has landed a prestigious commercial
furnishings show.
</P>
<P>
   NeoCon South is moving from Miami to Atlanta. The show will be
April 4-5 at the Georgia World Congress Center and there is a
possibility it could settle here.
</P>
<P>
   The show is expected to draw 3,500 to 5,000 people, which is
considered moderate in size by convention bureau officials.
</P>
<P>
   NeoCon South is affiliated with one of the most prestigious
furnishing shows in the industry, the NeoCon World's Trade Fair in
Chicago, which draws more than 60,000 people annually.
</P>
<P>
   The shows attract designers, architects, facility managers and
business executives who are involved in furnishing offices,
restaurants, hotels and other commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a talented and large design community in Atlanta and
it's thriving, so a regional show like NeoCon South seems to be a
good fit,'' said Barbara Copeland, an interior designer at Gensler.
</P>
<P>
   The regional show started two years ago in Miami, but was ``not
drawing the type of attendee we were looking for. There weren't
enough corporate and business users,'' said Melvin R. Schlitt, vice
president of marketing for Chicago-based Merchandise Mart Phicago
``is without question the biggest and most important event to this
industry in North America,'' said Jennifer Busch, editor-in-chief
of Contract magazine, a trade publication. ``Within the last few
years the people who own NeoCon have purchased or started up
regional shows in markets throughout the county.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the Chicago show, they ``make up a package of a
strong national show and strong regional shows.''

IN INDIA'S SILICON VALLEY, WORKERS DREAM OF THE USA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (EDS: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATTHEW YI   c.2000 San Francisco Examiner   BANGALORE, India _
It is a familiar scene here: A young software engineer with dreams
of a big salary and a recruiter representing an American technology
company sit across the table from each other, talking about
careers, opportunities and, most importantly, money.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annual salaries of a few thousand dollars are respectable here
but a pittance when compared to the $50,000 or more American
companies are offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very poor family, and I want to earn enough
money to support my mother, my three sisters and my brother,'' the
29-year-old man said after his interview. ``It's my life's
ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   His desire reflects that of many young Indians working in
Bangalore, India's version of Silicon Valley _ minus the big
paychecks. With a per-capita annual income of about $1,700 in
India, it is money that lures many young talents away from their
close-knit families and into the tech centers of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are more than happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of the high-tech industry over the past 20 years
led to a desperate scramble for skilled workers. American companies
turned to India, known for a good education system and highly
skilled, English-speaking workers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 300,000 Indian high-tech workers employed
abroad, about 80 percent work in the United States, said Rafiq
Dossani, an economist from India who works at Stanford University's
International Studies, Asia Pacific Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   India's education system, which focuses on math and science, has
a mission to produce information technology, or IT, professionals
in great numbers. In Bangalore alone, colleges pump out 30,000
engineering graduates every year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its latte shops, cyber cafes and
hip-by-India-standards reputation, though, Bangalore has a long way
to go to match the amenities of California living.
</P>
<P>
   There are hints of change: The technology industry has brought
new high-rise buildings to this south-central Indian city of 5.2
million people and cars to the growing middle-class, sure signs of
a boom.
</P>
<P>
   In many other ways, though, Bangalore, the capital of the state
of Karnataka, is like the rest of India, with roads shared by
automobiles, three-wheeled auto-rickshaws, cows and pedestrians.
Air pollution is so bad that a walk down the street leaves clothing
smelling like auto exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the old-fashioned American dream is pursued by IT
graduates in Bangalore and other tech-savvy cities here, making
India a magnet for high-tech recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple. They have an outstanding education system
there. You're able to get very, very highly qualified engineers and
programmers,'' said Vivek Ranadive, chief executive officer of
Tibco Software Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ranadive himself made the journey, partly to escape the rigors
of India's education system.
</P>
<P>
   After a year at the India Institute of Technology in Bombay, he
transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975
because the courses in India were too difficult. At MIT, he earned
a master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science
and a master's degree in business administration from Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get someone from . . . the India Institute of
Technology, you're getting the cream of the cream of the crop,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After years of producing skilled workers only to have foreign
companies pluck away many of the brightest, there is talk that
India's technology industry has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I do have concern of there being this heavy brain
drain in the past 10 years or so. If that talent had stayed, the
situation in India would be vastly different,'' said Yogesh Sharma,
editor of Siliconindia, an English-language business and technology
magazine for South Asians.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no sign that the brain drain will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be happy to send them to the United States. We'll just
produce more people,'' said Vivek Kulkani, information technology
secretary of Karnataka state.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians go to America mainly through a visa program for
skilled workers called H1-B, which allows them to work in the
United States for six years. Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials estimate 40 percent of all such visas go to India each
year. Until 1998, the United States had an annual cap of 65,000
H1-Bs, but Congress increased the number to 115,000 for 1999 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, the number of H1-Bs is scheduled to drop to 107,500.
The cap is set to return to 65,000 in 2002, but industry groups
like the Information Technology Association of America are lobbying
Congress to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every indication is that the demand will grow faster than the
supply side,'' said Harris Miller, president of Information
Technology Association of America in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Although the H1-B program enjoys high levels of support in
Congress, labor unions and many high-tech workers contend the
industry has used the visas to hold down wages and discriminate
against higher-paid American workers. Still others say that layoffs
at struggling dot-com companies should provide a new pool of
workers to meet domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
   Most workers go to the United States on temporary visas, leaving
Indian officials with the expectation they will return one day to
help fuel their own high-tech revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an increasing trend of people going back to
India,'' Sharma said. ``There's also the liberalization of the
whole economy. There has been a slow elimination of (the
government's) licensing systems, and the old world socialist
economics are transforming into market economies.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has encouraged more workers to return in recent years,
Dossani said.
</P>
<P>
   India's economic shift started in 1991, when the government
stopped requiring special licenses to start companies, Dossani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks were given freedom to approve more loans, and venture
capitalists were encouraged to invest more money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a major shift from the government-controlled economy, India's
telecommunications industry began encouraging technology
entrepreneurs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although the majority of high-tech companies in India are owned
and operated by foreigners, locally owned businesses are on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Dewang Mehta, president of India's National Association of
Software and Service Companies in New Dehli, said the growth is
evidence that the brain drain is slowing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bangalore has helped push India's software industry from $164
million in exports in 1991-1992 to $2.5 billion in 1998-1999. About
58 percent of the exports end up in the United States. Next in line
is Europe at 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has played a key role in that growth. In
1991, it created a nonprofit agency that helps entrepreneurs and
foreign companies wanting to do business in India.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Software Technology Parks of India, or STPI, the
government provides a wide range of services including a
clearinghouse to start a new company and to promote products made
in India.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government also allows duty-free import of computer
hardware for companies that want to do business here. Upstart
companies do not have to pay corporate income tax for the first 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the south end of Bangalore, the STPI has developed its own
400-acre industrial park, Electronics City.
</P>
<P>
   The property is a mix of mounds of dirt and greenery dotted by
large concrete buildings that house a number of software companies.
</P>
<P>
   In these buildings, young software engineers await their call to
work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to have a couple of years of experience here
before going to the USA, but their ultimate goal is to go to
America,'' said A. Jayaprakash, director of Zelos Technologies Pvt.
Ltd. in Madras, about 170 miles east of Bangalore. ``It's the call
of USA that they want to listen to.''

BRIEF NEWS ITEMS ABOUT THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds.: Bylines at end of briefs) c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   APPLE AND MICROSOFT TOGETHER AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   It may not be ``Sex and the City,'' but relationships in the
computer industry often run from frosty to passionate awfully
quickly. Just look at that old yin-yang pair, Apple and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft antitrust case, the longtime adversaries traded
charges once more, depicting even their apparent armistice in 1997
as a kind of corporate hostage deal. Apple testified that Microsoft
threatened to stop development of its popular Office suite for the
Macintosh, unless Apple agreed to distribute Microsoft's browser.
Microsoft replied that Apple was blackmailing it with a
long-running patent dispute and paid it $150 million to stop the
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But last week at the Macworld exhibition in New York, Microsoft
and Apple were again the best of friends. ``Our relationship with
Microsoft has been getting better and better,'' Steven Jobs,
Apple's co-founder and chief executive, told the assembled
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, Microsoft executives trooped to the stage with good
news for Mac users. Microsoft announced its new and improved Office
2001 for the Mac. A new look, new packaging and a raft of new
features developed ``only for the Mac,'' as Kevin Browne, a
Microsoft executive, put it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Next up came Ed Fries, vice president of Microsoft's games
division, who said the company planned to bring popular Microsoft
games like the ``Age of Empires'' series and ``Flight Simulator''
to the Mac in an alliance with a new company, headed by Peter
Tamte, a former senior Apple executive and a former senior
executive at Bungie Software.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Microsoft acquired Bungie, a company with deep Mac
roots. The purchase, Fries explained, prompted Microsoft to revisit
its approach in games, publishing most of its games for the Mac as
well as for machines running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
``We didn't want to exclude some people,'' he said, ``just because
they chose a certain platform,'' meaning the Mac instead of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   As they left the stage, Jobs warmly thanked the Microsoft
executives. ``Microsoft has done a great job for us,'' he said.
``Who would have thunk it a few years ago?''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MAKING MONEY VS. DOING GOOD?
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley entrepreneurs fall into two categories, John
Doerr, the Valley's most prominent venture capitalist, told a group
of Internet executives last week. There are the missionaries, he
said, and there are the mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missionaries obsess on the customer,'' explained Doerr, a
partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers. By way of an example,
he offered Jeff Bezos, the somewhat embattled chief executive of
Amazon.com, a Kleiner investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercenaries,'' he continued, ``obsess on compensation.'' His
example was an executive who has founded several Kleiner-backed
companies, Jim Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, in fact, had just an hour earlier astounded the 800
executives at the $4,200-a-head Internet Summit sponsored by The
Industry Standard magazine by saying he opposed the government's
plan to break Microsoft up. Clark, of course, is the founder of
Netscape Communications, who played a role in convincing the
Justice Department to bring the antitrust suit in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But since Microsoft had won the browser software war, Clark told
the audience, he had purchased 1 million shares in the company.
``Since I own the stock,'' he said, ``I'd rather see Microsoft stay
together.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clark did not tell the audience is where he got the money
to buy the Microsoft shares: Earlier this year, he sold the entire
stash of America Online shares that he had received when that
company bought Netscape last year. AOL's subsequent deal to buy
Time Warner turned him off, he explained in an interview. He argues
that that content producers, like magazines and cable networks,
should be separate from distribution systems like AOL's online
service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the AOL stock proceeds, he said, are still in cash. But
in addition to Microsoft, Clark said, he has also bought a big
stake in Amazon. Still, it is not clear that Clark is as enamored
as Doerr with companies run by missionaries. ``So far I've lost $40
million on Amazon,'' he said.

HEY, NETWORK HONCHOS: GET REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Remember when we could discuss the male or
female sex without blushing? Now it's ``gender'' this and
``gender'' that because ``sex'' means something else entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Same with ``gay.'' I'm a fairly jovial sort, but if you were to
say I'm a gay fella I'd have a lot of explaining to do to my life
partner, who happens to be of the female gender.
</P>
<P>
   Since language is fluid, it serves little purpose to gripe about
these changes in linguistic fashion. But it is fair to warn
everyone that another perfectly good word is being pirated by those
who have trouble calling a spade a spade.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking ``reality,'' a word now being tossed about to
describe pretty much every type of TV programming that doesn't
involve a written script or a trained actor. This might seem to
encompass an awful lot of what's on TV, but it centers on the stuff
coming to our shores from other civilizations where the invasion of
one's privacy isn't so much abhorred as it is applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressed by the ratings success of ``Survivor'' on CBS,
American programmers are preparing to let loose a dose of
``reality'' not seen since a peeper named Tom got pinched for
sneaking a look at Lady Godiva in the altogether. Nowadays, you can
spend a couple of months on a deserted island with a gay guy who
likes to skip naked along the beach and win a million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of this type of contrived reality dominated the formal
presentations and the idle chitchat at this year's summer press
tour of TV critics in Pasadena, possibly because the fall slate of
shows _ the ``real'' reason for the press tour _ looks weaker than
Gervase's backstroke on ``Survivor.'' Unlike last summer, when
``The West Wing'' and ``Once and Again'' stood out immediately as
shows to keep an eye on, nothing on the 2000-2001 prime-time
schedule has similar cachet.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, critics haven't seen everything yet. Several series
offered only trailers of coming attractions at the press tour, some
others are recasting and reshooting their pilots, and still others
have nothing to show because they have the luxury of a late start
to the fall season, courtesy of the summer Olympics. But programs
that are late to the party usually don't make a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   And so the networks talk about reality at the same time that
they're denying it. Indeed, if game shows are to be lumped into
this genre on the grounds that they involve ``real'' people rather
than actors, then ABC's reliance on ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' is the biggest denial of all.
</P>
<P>
   With four of its 22 prime-time hours each week devoted to
``Millionaire'' this fall, ABC is introducing only four new
scripted series and claiming that this demonstrates amazing
stability. My mom would call it laziness, but she's over 50, and we
all know the networks pay no attention to people in such an
unattractive demographic.
</P>
<P>
   They crave youth more desperately than Ponce de Leon at an
explorers' reunion. Even Les Moonves, president of CBS Television,
told critics last week that all the nice things he's been saying
these past few years about older viewers _ the people who tend to
watch CBS _ were not true.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves was joking. But he added: ``We have always said our goal
was to get younger while maintaining our strength in our core
audience. CBS is still the network of `Judging Amy' and `Everybody
Loves Raymond' and `Touched by an Angel' and `JAG' and `60
Minutes,' and we will continue to serve these audiences in all our
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Grecian Formula approach. If Moonves can pull it
off, be assured that every programmer in the solar system will
follow his lead. ABC already has two ``reality'' shows in the
works, NBC has one and Fox checks in next Wednesday with ``American
High,'' another unscripted view of life, this time featuring real
students in a real high school in a real suburb of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Even The WB, which has stuck to traditional programming on its
way to capturing the hearts and minds of young female viewers, is
working on an American version of ``Popstars,'' an Australian TV
phenomenon not unlike ABC's ``Making the Band,'' in which viewers
get to witness the creation of a pop-music group, all-female in The
WB's case, from initial casting across the country to filming of a
video and release of an album. This, in spite of Jamie Kellner's
disdain for the me-too approach.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner, chief executive officer of The WB, says he has
witnessed copycat programming for 30 years. ``It's always the same
thing,'' he said. ``One thing happens, it gets big, and then you
see the me-toos, and all of a sudden there are a lot of me-toos.
And then for some reason the whole thing seems to burn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner doesn't seem to see any conflict in decrying the
industry's lack of originality while hedging his bets with a little
``reality'' programming of his own. Nor does Dick Wolf, producer of
``Law &AMP; Order'' and one of NBC's new fall shows, ``Deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to burst bubbles,'' Wolf said, ``but I think they're
going to run out of deserted islands. ... The one thing I've seen
time and time again is that unless you're first (with an idea),
there's no sense in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Wolf is the brains behind a new syndicated show,
``Arrest &AMP; Trial,'' which will follow real cases from apprehension
to deposition, the way ``Law &AMP; Order'' does on the fictional side.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, quality prevails. We've seen it already with failed
clones of ``Millionaire.'' And even if you don't like the premise
of ``Survivor,'' it is well conceived and smartly produced, which
has much to do with its wide appeal. On the other hand, CBS's
second entry in the reality sweeps, ``Big Brother,'' is
monumentally boring and poorly made on purpose, as if to lend a
rugged familiarity to its brand of realism.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this whole ``reality'' thing may be an attempt to
have us forget last season's big story: the lack of racial
diversity in prime-time casting. Could it be that the networks
cooked up this reality craze as a cheesy diversion? Think about it.
It even allows them to get people of color on their schedules
without changing Hollywood's myopic casting traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Fiendishly clever of them. And, sadly, much closer to the
conventional definition of reality.

&HT;     SENATE UNVEILS INTERNET PRIVACY BILL
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ Sen.
<TEXT>
John McCain and other leading lawmakers proposed legislation
Wednesday that could dramatically increase the privacy rights of
consumers using the Internet.
<P>
   ``Clearly, business should inform consumers in an open manner
how they treat personal information and give consumers meaningful
choices as to how that information is used,'' McCain, R-Ariz., told
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, was joined by
Sens. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., John Kerry, D-Mass., and Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, known as the ``Consumer Privacy Enhancement Act,''
would require Web sites to post a notice describing:
</P>
<P>
   _ What companies are collecting information via that Web site;
</P>
<P>
   _ The types of information collected;
</P>
<P>
   _ How the information will be used;
</P>
<P>
   _ What security measures are in place to protect information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bill will arm consumers with information so they feel
confident they are making the right choices to protect their
personal information, and our approach does so without shutting
down the industry's potential for growth or choking the free flow
of information on the Internet,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Web sites failing to abide by the law would be
fined $22,000 per violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surfing the Web shouldn't require you to share your life story
with the world,'' Boxer said. ``Internet surfers should know
exactly how companies will use the personal information submitted
to Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bill became law, for example, an on-line bookseller would
be required to let customers know that it is collecting information
on what they are buying, and then selling that information to
advertisers or other electronic retailers.
</P>
<P>
   With the issue of Internet privacy registering in the polls as a
top concern among Americans, Democrats and Republicans have been
pushing to find legislation that would reassure the public that
private information will not be misused.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen Internet privacy bills are being considered in
the House. In addition, several bills in the Senate contain
provisions for increasing Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Both the presidential hopefuls, Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore, have expressed support for a privacy law covering
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The debate generally divides along three lines:
</P>
<P>
   _ Should consumers have to ``opt out,'' informing companies that
they would rather not have their personal information divulged
elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should on-line companies have to ask permission first,
requiring customers to ``opt in'' to a consent agreement that frees
their information for use in the public domain?
</P>
<P>
   _ Or should the current system, in which information moves
through cyberspace virtually unrestricted, remain intact?
</P>
<P>
   Direct-marketing companies have always kept dossiers on consumer
habits in order to target people for specific products and
services. The Internet makes that process much easier and more
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who browse the Web now have their habits tracked,

COMPUTER STUDENTS' RANKS GROW, BUT WITH FEWER WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study predicts that while undergraduate enrollments in
computer science will increase rapidly, the proportion of women in
that enrollment is unlikely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are going to be left behind,'' said Dr. Tracy Camp, a
professor at the Colorado School of Mines who is co-chairwoman of
the Association for Computing Machinery's Committee on Women in
Computing, which has done several studies analyzing the proportion
of women studying computer science. Camp is the lead author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The new research found that women account for about 17 percent
of the undergraduate computer science majors at U.S. universities
that offer Ph.D.s in computer science. The study predicts a nominal
increase in this percentage, to about 17.5 percent for the
2000-2001 school year, followed by a drop to between 16 and 16.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly more students than in the past,'' Camp
said. ``The raw numbers are increasing. But the percentage of women
is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1983 and 1996, the percentage of women earning
bachelor's degrees at universities and colleges in computer science
dropped from a high of 37.1 percent to a low of 27.5 percent, a
25.9 percent decrease. ``Our study confirms that this trend will
continue,'' Camp said. ``There is no evidence that these low
percentages will rise.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest U.S. Department of Education figures for enrollments
of women in computer science are for 1996. ``We did the study
because the U.S. Department of Education is so far behind,'' Camp
said. ``Computer science enrollments have changed so rapidly that
we felt we needed to find out what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentages of women majoring in other sciences, including
engineering, biological sciences, physics and math, have risen from
the 1980s to 1996. ``It's not a huge increase, but it's there,''
Camp said. ``But in computer science, the percentage is stagnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``The Incredible Shrinking Pipeline Unlikely
to Reverse,'' was supported by the Association for Computing
Machinery and the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Gurer, co-chairwoman of the association's Committee on
Women in Computing and a technologist at the 3Com Corp. in Santa
Clara, Calif., said that there was a substantial attrition rate for
women as they moved through the computer science career pipeline,
from college to work. ``It starts early,'' she said. ``Women get
turned off not only in college, but once they are at work.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons women leave computer science are complex, but one
cause is clear, Gurer said. ``The image of the white, male,
antisocial nerd who sits in front of a computer turns women off,''
she said.

 &HT;    AFTER CAMP DAVID: FOR ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS, WORK FOR PEACE IS
JUST BEGINNING
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-0727.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the dust settled Wednesday from the collapse of
the Mideast summit at Camp David, President Clinton made clear that
the curtain hasn't yet fallen on his long-running quest to broker a
peace accord for the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   The next act in the drama, he said, is for Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to move quickly
to build a consensus for compromise among the people they
represent.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides set to resume working-level talks as early as
next week, Clinton said he remained hopeful that Arafat and Barak
could reach a final peace accord before their self-imposed Sept. 13
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be able to do it,'' Clinton told reporters at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just when and how he might reinvigorate formal negotiations,
though, Clinton couldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't yet tell what would be most in aid of the process,''
Clinton said. ``I just can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, U.S. diplomats were already in motion,
contacting governments across the Arab and Muslim worlds, as well
as Europe, to try to build a united global front backing the
U.S.-led peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to dispatch a senior envoy to the region
over the next two or three weeks to consult with leaders there and
assess the prospects for renewed talks.
</P>
<P>
   The job of selling a potential peace accord _ and the painful
compromises that would entail _ to the region, however, is one the
White House is leaving to Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attempts to sway public opinion not only wouldn't work,
administration officials assert, they'd likely backfire, with
Palestinians and Israelis alike regarding such efforts as
heavy-handed superpower meddling.
</P>
<P>
   The message Clinton and his diplomats hope to get out, though,
is that the Camp David talks dramatically advanced the prospects
for a comprehensive peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians,
who, for the first time ever, sat down and seriously locked horns
over the sensitive issues at the core of their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are way beyond where they have been on this issue,'' said
the State Department's Aaron Miller, deputy Middle East coordinator
for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is for them to determine what happened at
Camp David and, perhaps just as important, did not happen, and to
see how the political and public elite digest what happened,''
Miller told a small group of reporters. ``What is required is a
sustainable domestic base to support leaders' decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``You've got to get used to talking about
something for a little bit before you can then entertain how you
can create an edifice that you hadn't previously imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants U.S. partners abroad to discourage Arafat
from going through with his threat to declare a Palestinian state
Sept. 13 _ with or without a Palestinian-Israeli peace accord.
That, Clinton fears, could trigger violence.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants the Arab world to soften its opposition to
Palestinian concessions on the question of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David summit fell apart on Tuesday after two weeks of
talks centered on the thorny web of security and territorial issues
at the heart of 52 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both
sides were willing to deal on prickly matters like the fate of
Jewish settlers and Palestinian refugees. Gains were made also in
the area of security.
</P>
<P>
   The straw that broke the summit's back, though, was the question
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians both claim the holy city as their
capital. Barak offered Arafat limited sovereignty over parts of
East Jerusalem, which Israeli troops seized during the 1967
Israeli-Arab war. Arafat, though, stuck by his long-held demand
that all of East Jerusalem be placed under Arab control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat showed little flexibility on the issue during the summit,
and U.S. diplomats became convinced that he could move no further
without the support of the larger Arab and Muslim worlds _
including countries like Egypt, Jordan and even Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, though, was not Clinton's last card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think the embers are out of the fire,'' said noted
Arabist Michael Hudson, of Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson suggested that Clinton look to an outside mediator _ he
mentioned former President Jimmy Carter and former U.S. Senator
George Mitchell as possibilities _ to try to help gin up support
for continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were to send Jimmy Carter, if he were to send George
Mitchell, an important political person with some diplomatic skill
back in, the summit might yet be salvaged,'' said Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who brokered the historic Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty
at Camp David in 1978,
</P>
<P>
   has particularly broad cache within the Arab world. The Clinton
administration has yet to reach out _ at least publicly _ on this
issue to Carter, who was en route to Venezuela this week and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of offer hasn't been made, and I can't speculate on
what his reaction to it would be,'' said Carter spokeswoman Carrie
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has played important roles as citizen-statesman in trying
to broker a cease-fire between Bosnians and Serbs, in breaking a
dangerous U.S.-North Korea impasse over Pyongyang's suspected
nuclear weapons program and in averting a U.S. military invasion of
Haiti.

U.N. SEEKS HELP OF BUSINESS IN PROTECTION OF WORKPLACE AND
ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Executives of Nike, Shell and and
DaimlerChrysler filled a chamber on Wednesday where diplomats
usually conduct business, as the United Nations recruited many
well-known multinational companies to help protect workers and the
environment in places where governments do not.
</P>
<P>
   SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan organized the session to encourage
companies that operate across borders to spread Western-style human
and environmental values or risk seeing the erosion of the
consensus that favors open trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 multinationals joined 12 labor associations and watchdog
groups to sign a ``global compact'' that commits them to support
human rights, eliminate child labor, allow free trade unions and
refrain from polluting the environment wherever they do business.
</P>
<P>
   Several signers are among the leading targets of protest groups
that say the companies exploit workers and abuse the soil, water
and forests in poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies should not wait for governments to pass laws before
they pay a decent wage or agree not to pollute the environment,''
Annan said after he had presided over the daylong meeting here.
``If companies lead by example, the governments may wake up and
make laws to formalize these practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of world trade talks and noisy street
protests in Seattle last year, multinational companies have been
scrambling to forge alliances with some of their critics, including
unions and human rights and conservation groups. The compact
sponsored by the United Nations is the most visible example of such
alliances, and it is an attempt by Annan to make the world body a
more effective force for social and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   The effort seems highly unlikely to alter the global economic
landscape immediately. The pact, which took 18 months to negotiate,
binds the signers to a declaration of principles rather than a
legal code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Several watchdog groups said the United Nations was
participating in a ``bluewash'' _ allowing some of the world's
largest and richest corporations to wrap themselves in the
organization's blue flag without requiring them to do anything new.
</P>
<P>
   But the session showed how world governments and corporate
leaders increasingly rely on each other to demonstrate that they
are helping the people left behind when companies move capital and
manufacturing plants around the world. The United Nations and other
international organizations have tried to address the side-effects
of growing international trade and investment but have found it
difficult to act in isolation. Multinational companies,
particularly those subjected to a barrage of criticism about the
way they do business in poor countries, are now eager to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This global compact has the potential to become an historic
partnership,'' said Philip H. Knight, chairman and chief executive
of Nike. ``We hope it provides the framework for real global
progress versus each of us struggling with these issues alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, Ericsson, Unilever, Healtheon/WebMD, and Dupont were also
among the companies that signed the accord, as did Amnesty
International and the World Wildlife Fund. But U.N. officials
acknowledged that they had trouble attracting some American
companies because the companies feared endorsing something that
might legally bind them to act in a certain way and subject them to
fresh scrutiny from watchdog groups.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1980s, the United Nations made a similar effort to
forge international standards for foreign investment and treatment
of workers, but it collapsed after rights groups, U.N. officials
and business executives ended up clashing over the terms of their
agreement. This time, Annan, who became secretary general in 1997,
selected nine loosely worded principles drawn from international
accords, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
the 1992 U.N. Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, seeking to build
agreement around some long-established codes.
</P>
<P>
   Annan stressed that companies should adhere to the standards
even when the nations where they do business do not require them to
do so. He said, for example, that a company operating in a country
that does not allow free trade unions should nonetheless permit its
workers to organize and bargain collectively, a position that could
put companies at odds with the government of China, where almost
all of the companies that signed the compact have investments.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations will not insist on strict compliance.
Annan said that the international organization does not have the
``capacity or the mandate'' to police the companies involved.
Several corporate executives warned that the compact would fail if
it became the basis for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some social and environmental activist groups, including the
environmental group Greenpeace, declined to sign the agreement. The
groups complained in a letter to Annan that some of the companies
that participated _ it cited Nike, Shell and the British-Australian
mining company Rio Tinto _ had poor records of operating abroad and
did not deserve to be U.N. partners.
</P>
<P>
   The letter urged Annan to ``reassess your overall approach to
U.N.-corporate partnerships. The mission and integrity of the
United Nations are at stake.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, some outside observers see the partnership as vital as
the world grapples with the reality that nations cannot regulate,
tax and set standards for commerce as effectively when companies
spread the operations over many countries, rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, compared
the process to regulating labor, food, safety and the environment
in the United States, which took decades to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a huge number of issues that have to be
addressed globally and there is no real infrastructure to do it,''
he said. ``They can only be dealt with in partnership agreements
between governments, business and nongovernment organizations.''

WEB SITES ARE THE TOMBSTONES OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID SIMS   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   c.2000
N.Y. Times News Service   I found myself in the virtual cemetery of
the future last week. It was my first time, but it isn't likely to
be the last.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend and colleague with whom I worked for two years in San
Francisco died in his sleep a few weeks ago. He was relatively
young, but suffered from several congenital conditions that made
his death, although unexpected, not unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   He shared several groups of friends _ people from his
neighborhood, from his childhood, a Hollywood group he hung out
with, and the one to which I belonged, his Web friends and
colleagues. We reacted to his death in the only way we really know
how to acknowledge anything: We made a Web site:
www.garybrickman.com.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the site was live and we all added pieces to it
that I realized this was the tombstone of the modern age: A
memorial prominently marked and easy to find in a place where we
all work and visit every day: cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The stories, pictures and links we leave there are like the
flowers or messages our ancestors might have left on the tombstones
of their friends when they passed the churchyard on their way to or
from work.
</P>
<P>
   They are our way of showing our respect and reminding each other
that we are still thinking of him. Gary's memorial is bookmarked,
and any time I miss his wisdom or his humor, I know that his
knowing smirk is just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   I don't pretend that these memorial sites are permanent. But few
memorials are, with a few notable exceptions for pharaohs and
emperors.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and wind, those material agents of time, wear down stone
and metal. A change in operating systems or network infrastructure
may make Gary's site unreachable. But for now, in our time, it's a
solid marker.
</P>
<P>
   I can imagine that in the future there will be virtual plots of
friends and families, and that each of our memorial sites may
belong to several of these sites _ your family network, your
network of friends, your professional network. Each of these plots
may have a portal page linking the members' sites together, a
funeral portal, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   There may even be a business in hosting such sites in
perpetuity. Pay an extra $1 per month to your Internet service
provider, and the ISP will in return guarantee to host your site
for 99 years after your passing.
</P>
<P>
   The site MyFamily.com already has earned a position in the Top
20 most visited Web sites by making it easy for families to set up
intranets that help them share recipes or schedule time at the
family cabin. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine them
extending this service beyond the pale. (I know what you're
thinking, but don't bother: familyplot.com is taken.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where Gary's remains are today. But I know where
his memorial in cyberspace is. And I can visit it any time. I hope
someday someone does the same for me.

BC TO NAME HELEN PETERS MANAGEMENT SCHOOL DEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHRYN TONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston College's Carroll School of Management is
expected Thursday to announce the appointment of Dr. Helen Frame
Peters as dean, making her the third female dean of a top-50
business school in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The other two female deans are Carolyn Woo, at the University of
Notre Dame and Laura D'Andrea Tyson at the University of California
at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The Carroll School has been searching for a dean since last
August when its former dean, Jack Neuhauser, was promoted to
academic vice president of the school. Robert Taggart, a professor
of finance at the business school, acted as interim dean during the
academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Before her appointment, Peters was a managing director of the
Global Bond Group of Scudder Kemper Investments in Boston, where
she managed a $150 billion bond group with 300 employees worldwide.
She has also served as chief information officer of Colonial
Management Associates, where she oversaw $17 billion in mutual fund
investments.
</P>
<P>
   As the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in finance from The
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Peters is used to
working in male-dominated situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been at an environment where there hasn't been
that many women,'' she said. ``I will continue on and do great
things so that women can go into many areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Santomero, one of Peters' former finance professors at
Wharton, remembers her to be someone who ``has never been viewed as
someone who was in the finance program as a female.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just evidence of good people rising to the top. She
just happens to be female,'' said Santomero, who is currently
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, the first female dean at the Haas School of Business at
the UC Berkeley, who was also former chief economic adviser to
President Clinton, says that gender is not a big consideration
during the selection of a dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of an institution matters. Here, the culture was
conducive to the selection of a female dean,'' Tyson said. ``Some
institutions would have cultures not conducive to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many faculty members of the Carroll School were enthusiastic
about Peters' appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With her experience in the business community, I think that
she will be able to help move the school forward,'' said Taggart,
professor of finance who also acted as interim dean at the business
school.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major issues that business schools face in choosing a
dean is whether to find someone with a purely academic background
or with private-sector experience. In the Carroll School's final
candidate pool of eight people, four were non-academics, said Dr.
G. Peter Wilson, Joseph Sweeney chair of accounting and the
chairman of the dean search committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is riskier to bring in a non-academic, but the upside could
be very large,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson pointed to top business schools like Wharton, Stanford,
and Northwestern, all of which successfully appointed deans from
the private sector in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best years at those schools had a non-academic at the
helm,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Peters was one of the rocket scientists in the early
1980s who went from academia to Wall Street, she has continually
remained active with her alma mater as a member of the Trustees'
Council of Penn Women.
</P>
<P>
   Peters has always bucked the trend. When she first went into
Wall Street, her colleagues told her that ``it was not the place to
for academics to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everyone is going into Wall Street and I think that it is
a great time to be in education,'' said Peters.
</P>
<P>
   She says that she plans on strengthening the Carroll School's
ties with the business community and ``making sure that the school
is responding to changes in the business world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peters has two children, a 24-year-old son and a 16-year-old
daughter. Her husband, Judson Garrett Parker, is chief financial
officer at Risk Management Foundation of the Harvard Medical
Institutions Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.

HIGH-TECH PRIVACY SLEUTH JOINS RESEARCH CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By   MATT RICHTEL c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard M. Smith, a software engineer turned high-tech sleuth
who tracks how personal data is gathered via the Internet, said
Tuesday that he would join forces with researchers at the Privacy
Center, a new group based at the University of Denver that
investigates privacy concerns in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the center said they would gather data on whether
and how personal information was captured by software makers,
operators of communications systems and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the center would focus initially on whether personal
privacy was jeopardized by the use of wireless phones with Web
access, digital television set-top boxes, software that can send
user information back to its maker over the Internet and other such
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at anything to do with a computer, and stuff that
is networked together,'' said Smith, who helped track the possible
origins of the malicious ``Melissa'' and ``I Love You'' computer
programs. ``We'll focus on how we're being monitored in our daily
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was looking forward to helping other people use
some of the techniques he had developed. ``We're trying to train
other people to do the work I do,'' said Smith, a co-founder of
Phar Lap Software, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Among Smith's accomplishments in recent years was the discovery
that the Microsoft Word program embedded a unique identifier in
users' computers that was sent back to Microsoft when the software
was registered. Microsoft subsequently stopped putting the
identifier in the software. Smith has also explored the
data-collection practices of Amazon.com and RealNetworks. He filed
a complaint last year with the Federal Trade Commission asserting
that Alexa software, a subsidiary of Amazon, could gather far more
personal data about consumers than Amazon told customers it was
collecting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith technically is not affiliated with the University of
Denver, but has signed on as the chief technology officer of the
Privacy Foundation. The foundation is a Denver-based nonprofit
agency _ also scheduled to be announced today _ that is financing
the privacy center. The Privacy Foundation was started and is
largely underwritten by Peter Barton, a Denver entrepreneur and
former chief executive of the Liberty Media Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The financing will help support research at the university by
David Martin, an assistant professor of math and computer science,
and three associates. They will work with Smith, who will work
mainly from his home in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than Richard being the lone ranger, he's going to have
a posse to help him,'' said Stephen Keating, executive director of
the Privacy Foundation. Keating said the foundation's first-year
budget would be around $1 million.

 &HT;    AFTER CAMP DAVID: FOR ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS, WORK FOR PEACE IS
JUST BEGINNING
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-0727.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the dust settled Wednesday from the collapse of
the Mideast summit at Camp David, President Clinton made clear that
the curtain hasn't yet fallen on his long-running quest to broker a
peace accord for the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   The next act in the drama, he said, is for Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to move quickly
to build a consensus for compromise among the people they
represent.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides set to resume working-level talks as early as
next week, Clinton said he remained hopeful that Arafat and Barak
could reach a final peace accord before their self-imposed Sept. 13
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be able to do it,'' Clinton told reporters at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just when and how he might reinvigorate formal negotiations,
though, Clinton couldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't yet tell what would be most in aid of the process,''
Clinton said. ``I just can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, U.S. diplomats were already in motion,
contacting governments across the Arab and Muslim worlds, as well
as Europe, to try to build a united global front backing the
U.S.-led peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to dispatch a senior envoy to the region
over the next two or three weeks to consult with leaders there and
assess the prospects for renewed talks.
</P>
<P>
   The job of selling a potential peace accord _ and the painful
compromises that would entail _ to the region, however, is one the
White House is leaving to Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attempts to sway public opinion not only wouldn't work,
administration officials assert, they'd likely backfire, with
Palestinians and Israelis alike regarding such efforts as
heavy-handed superpower meddling.
</P>
<P>
   The message Clinton and his diplomats hope to get out, though,
is that the Camp David talks dramatically advanced the prospects
for a comprehensive peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians,
who, for the first time ever, sat down and seriously locked horns
over the sensitive issues at the core of their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are way beyond where they have been on this issue,'' said
the State Department's Aaron Miller, deputy Middle East coordinator
for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is for them to determine what happened at
Camp David and, perhaps just as important, did not happen, and to
see how the political and public elite digest what happened,''
Miller told a small group of reporters. ``What is required is a
sustainable domestic base to support leaders' decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``You've got to get used to talking about
something for a little bit before you can then entertain how you
can create an edifice that you hadn't previously imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants U.S. partners abroad to discourage Arafat
from going through with his threat to declare a Palestinian state
Sept. 13 _ with or without a Palestinian-Israeli peace accord.
That, Clinton fears, could trigger violence.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants the Arab world to soften its opposition to
Palestinian concessions on the question of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David summit fell apart on Tuesday after two weeks of
talks centered on the thorny web of security and territorial issues
at the heart of 52 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both
sides were willing to deal on prickly matters like the fate of
Jewish settlers and Palestinian refugees. Gains were made also in
the area of security.
</P>
<P>
   The straw that broke the summit's back, though, was the question
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians both claim the holy city as their
capital. Barak offered Arafat limited sovereignty over parts of
East Jerusalem, which Israeli troops seized during the 1967
Israeli-Arab war. Arafat, though, stuck by his long-held demand
that all of East Jerusalem be placed under Arab control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat showed little flexibility on the issue during the summit,
and U.S. diplomats became convinced that he could move no further
without the support of the larger Arab and Muslim worlds _
including countries like Egypt, Jordan and even Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, though, was not Clinton's last card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think the embers are out of the fire,'' said noted
Arabist Michael Hudson, of Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson suggested that Clinton look to an outside mediator _ he
mentioned former President Jimmy Carter and former U.S. Senator
George Mitchell as possibilities _ to try to help gin up support
for continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were to send Jimmy Carter, if he were to send George
Mitchell, an important political person with some diplomatic skill
back in, the summit might yet be salvaged,'' said Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who brokered the historic Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty
at Camp David in 1978,
</P>
<P>
   has particularly broad cache within the Arab world. The Clinton
administration has yet to reach out _ at least publicly _ on this
issue to Carter, who was en route to Venezuela this week and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of offer hasn't been made, and I can't speculate on
what his reaction to it would be,'' said Carter spokeswoman Carrie
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has played important roles as citizen-statesman in trying
to broker a cease-fire between Bosnians and Serbs, in breaking a
dangerous U.S.-North Korea impasse over Pyongyang's suspected
nuclear weapons program and in averting a U.S. military invasion of
Haiti.

HYPERLINKS FOR HYPOCHONDRIACS: OLD MALADY IN A NEW WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (The Science Times) 
 By EMILY YOFFE c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Recently, an
article in a newspaper stated that ``at least 60 million people
visit Internet health sites each year.'' This is not entirely
accurate. I visit Internet health sites 60 million times each year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the development of the Internet, I kept my unhealthy
interest in check by limiting my medical library to a few essential
texts. That's the same principle that keeps me from bringing a
deluxe Whitman's sampler box into my house: I would eat it all in
one sitting. But now, it is as if my computer were spewing mocha
cremes at me.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, the Wonderful World of Diseases _ a real Web
site, found at www.diseaseworld.com _ is available 24 hours a day.
With a few clicks, I arrived at my own escalating diagnoses for a
hoarse voice, starting with seasonal allergies and moving quickly
to hypothyroidism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The more I
read, it seems, the sicker I can get.
</P>
<P>
   Using Hegelian dialectics: thesis, antithesis, I-feel-sick, I
decided to see if the Web could help me understand my case of
Internet invalidism. So I typed ``hypochondria'' into a search
engine and immediately found the Whiteley Index, a test for
hypochondria. Here are some questions from the index and my
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think there is something seriously wrong with your
body?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, especially when I shop for bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you worry about your health more than most people?
</P>
<P>
   A. Naturally; most people don't worry about my health at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you feel ill and someone tells you that you are looking
better, do you become annoyed?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't, but no one ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If a disease is brought to your attention (through the radio,
TV, newspapers or someone you know), do you worry about getting it
yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe that a disease being brought to my attention is a
sign that I already suffer from it.
</P>
<P>
   According to the index, I am not a hypochondriac, which raises
the even more alarming possibility that I really am sick. For
further treatment, I began surfing health sites and came up with
this possible diagnosis: Internet addiction disorder. I could get
online counseling to help cure it. But this seemed a little like
getting advice on anger management from Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Internet has only exacerbated my problem, it
did not create it. For that, I blame my childhood. Google and
Excite might call themselves search engines, but they could never
command enough gigabytes to match the knowledge of things that
could go wrong that my beloved grandmother amassed in her 90 years.
If you are raised hearing that the germs on everything you touch
are ``going right to your brain,'' aren't you entitled to spend
wads of time perusing brainnet.org?
</P>
<P>
   As with any malady, hypochondriacs supposedly find comfort
knowing about celebrities who suffer from the same condition. At
least all of the hypochondria Web sites I found had lists of famous
people who were convinced that they were sick, including Proust,
Poe, Tolstoy, Kafka and Darwin. Notice that all of these supposed
hypochondriacs are dead. This brings to mind the chilling story of
Moliere, which I also discovered on the Web. He was an actor as
well as a playwright, and after writing the hypochondriac's
manifesto, ``The Imaginary Invalid,'' he starred in the title role.
It was a short run, however, because Moliere died the night of the
fourth performance.
</P>
<P>
   It has been consoling to find out that many of my friends,
instead of improving their well-being by, say, taking a walk, are
sitting around looking up their ailments. One, who seems remarkably
healthy (possibly because he treats his home as a Biosafety Level 4
containment site), does not search for symptoms; he looks up
causes. He is a slave to the Environmental Protection Agency's Web
site (www.epa.gov). He uses it to keep track of the chemical
contaminants that, he is sure, are killing him. Another friend said
that she stopped looking up her medical problems after she kept
discovering that she was either pregnant, menopausal or had ovarian
cancer. Instead, she has switched to hypochondria-by-proxy,
spending hours on the Internet diagnosing deadly diseases of other
people.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail messages have also made it possible to be a passive
recipient of freshly minted medical discoveries. For example, I
read that antiperspirants cause breast cancer by blocking the lymph
nodes. Of course, I stopped using antiperspirant. After a few days,
I came to believe that this information was being spread by the dry
cleaners of America.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing what to do, I asked a breast surgeon about it. She
said that several patients had raised this issue, but that she
could find nothing in the literature to support the thesis, and
anyway, it did not make scientific sense. But what does she know?
She is just a doctor, which means she is too busy to spend her
entire day looking up medical information on the Web.

 &HT;    Party eases stand on education policy
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The draft Republican platform that will be made
public today maintains the party's call for a no-exceptions ban on
abortion, while softening past GOP opposition to a federal role in
education.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues are expected to draw the most debate over the next
few days, but Republican officials are hoping that softer rhetoric
in the platform will help avoid a divisive fight and set the tone
for a convention free of harsh words and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The platform is another demonstration that the Philadelphia
convention is firmly under the control of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the party's nominee-in-waiting. He has called for a positive
gathering to highlight his campaign theme of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The 107-member platform committee will hold hearings on the
document Friday and Saturday, and is expected to adopt it Saturday.
Convention delegates will vote on the document next week, and while
a floor challenge to the platform is possible, it is considered
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), a co-chair of the committee, said the
uplifting, progressive message is an improvement over the 1996
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bashing. In 1996, the platform, at least in my
opinion, had a kind of angry, bashing tone to it,'' Myrick said.
``We've spent a tremendous amount of time behind the scenes meeting
with people who have differing opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those people acknowledge that the tone is better, but
fear that the substance is out of step with the majority of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, for example, the platform takes a harder line than
does Bush, who favors allowing abortion in the case of rape and
incest.
</P>
<P>
   The insistence on retaining the call for an absolute ban on
abortion will hurt Republicans in the fall, said Susan Cullman,
chairman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the platform bogs us down,'' Cullman said. ``I think
it's a disaster for the party. You've got the vice presidential
nominee (who opposes abortion rights), why keep this in the
platform?''
</P>
<P>
   Republican abortion-rights supporters would prefer silence on
the issue, or a statement that acknowledges other opinions.
</P>
<P>
   But platform officials have made it clear that no change is
likely, on orders from the Bush camp, Cullman said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bush's choice of former Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney as his running mate may make delegates who favor access
to abortion more willing to speak up, Cullman said. Cheney opposes
abortions in almost all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative leaders, delighted with the selection of Cheney,
said they expect the platform to be generally acceptable and for
Bush's lieutenants to keep firm control of the process, meaning
squabbling will be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of concern to conservatives are most likely to be in
foreign affairs, education and other social issues, including gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Don Devine, vice chairman of the American Conservative
Union, said that even if the platform no longer calls for
elimination of the Department of Education, conservatives probably
could live with language that touts local control of schools and a
limited federal role in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect any major battles at the end of the day,'' he
said.

COMPUTER PROGRAM LEARNS TO WIN AT CHECKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Science Times) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Ever since an IBM
computer defeated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, in
1997, much of the suspense has gone out of the old battle of man
versus machine: the machine won. But the lessons of a much humbler
game have again made that battle fascinating. The game is, of all
things, checkers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two computer scientists have leveled the playing field by asking
a computer program called a neural network to do something much
more difficult than beat a defenseless human at checkers. Knowing
only the rules of checkers and a few basics, and otherwise starting
from scratch, the program must teach itself how to play a good game
without help from the outside world _ including from the
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The program did just that, using the electronic equivalent of
natural selection. A sort of colony of the programs, each slightly
different from all the others, played checkers against one another
_ quite ineptly at first _ and chronic losers were killed off.
Slightly mutated versions of the winners were allowed to reproduce.
After hundreds of generations, blind evolution produced an expert
checkers player, but not an infallible one.
</P>
<P>
   The work was described last week in San Diego at the 2000
Congress on Evolutionary Computation by Dr. David B. Fogel, a
computer scientist at Natural Selection Inc., a company in La
Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the work, which Fogel did with Kumar
Chellapilla, a doctoral student in electrical engineering at the
University of California at San Diego, goes well beyond checkers to
a question that has dogged computer science for decades: Can
computers be designed to solve problems under circumstances that
their human programmers never envisioned?
</P>
<P>
   The question is relevant for circumstances that vary as widely
as an interstellar probe that loses contact with Earth and must
adapt to unforeseen problems, and an automated factory scheduler
attempting to deal with unexpected shortages or breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a good, but not perfect, game of checkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is that it learns to play by itself,'' said Dr.
Christopher Welty, a professor in the computer science department
at Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   Because any particular version of Deep Blue, the IBM program
that defeated Kasparov, was based on strict rules and specific
strategies given to it by humans, Welty said, ``the way it played
chess was very predictable. Given the exact same game, it would
play the same way twice.'' But Fogel's program can adapt without
intervention by humans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program made short work of about two dozen casual players at
last week's conference, winning 25 timed ``challenge matches,''
losing none, and battling one player _ Dr. Edmund Burke, a
professor of computer science at the University of Nottingham in
England _ to a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fogel's best checkers program can improve beyond its
current skill level is uncertain; it can hold its own with
expert-rated players in official rankings but is generally blown
off the board by players in the higher echelons of master and grand
master players. The question of just how far such an adaptive
algorithm can progress is a matter of intense debate among computer
scientists, Welty said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ali Zalzala, a computer scientist at Heriot-Watt
University in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the principal organizer of
the conference, said that just by taking on such questions, Fogel's
work may be shedding light on much deeper issues. Zalzala called
the research ``a very serious attempt to understand the operation
of biological evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The neural networks that Fogel has bred into checkers players
exist as software programs on his personal computer. To understand
them, however, it helps to visualize the physical structures that
the software is modeling. Those structures consist of a rather
crude representation of the interconnected networks of neurons in
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Living neurons are sometimes called ``integrate-and-fire''
structures. A neuron somehow integrates, or adds up, all the
electrical stimuli it receives from other neurons that are
connected to its receptors. If the sum rises above a certain
threshold, it fires off its own electrical pulse, stimulating yet
another set of neurons that behave in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The threshold for firing can be different for each neuron; so
can its own firing intensity compared to the amount of input
stimuli it receives, an amplification factor sometimes called the
connection strength. At one end of the network might be sensory
input from a pair of ears, for example, and at the other a
conclusion like, ``That is Bob's voice'' or ``That is not Bob's
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Any small part of the network might have connection strengths
and thresholds to recognize one particular feature, like average
pitch or the way a single vowel is pronounced. Because all parts of
the network are interconnected, it can put all of these clues
together almost simultaneously to draw a conclusion about whose
voice is being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Humans learn; no one is born able to recognize Bob's voice.
Likewise, the thresholds and connection strengths in Fogel's
network, which are geared toward recognizing sequences of moves in
checkers rather than voices, can change as the program learns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a human being, you are a pattern-recognizing device,'' said
Fogel, who added that his simple network could do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not give away the game by telling the network how.
The network begins with 32 ``sensory'' inputs, one for each
possible position on the board. Those inputs take on different
values depending on whether a square is occupied by nothing, by an
ordinary red or black piece, or by a king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neurons'' carrying those signals cross in a complex pattern of
nested connections, reminiscent of a switchboard. Each neuron has a
variable connection strength and each connection has a threshold.
For a given configuration of checkers, the output of the network is
a single number.
</P>
<P>
   That number is in some way the network's evaluation of the
pattern on the board, a sort of output of pleasure or pain. At each
point of the game, the computer evaluates it for the existing
configuration and for possible ones it could create by making
certain moves. Based on that information, it maximizes the number
and makes moves, plays games.
</P>
<P>
   Fogel began by creating several variants of his program, each
with random connection strengths and thresholds. They played each
other, and the regular losers _ those for whom ``pleasure'' was not
a reliable guide to playing a good game _ were eliminated. The
others, with random ``mutations'' that could allow better players
to evolve, were given offspring. Eventually, he arrived at an
expert player, a fact he verified by matching the program against
ranked human players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance is remarkable,'' said Dr. Michael Conrad, a
professor in the computer science department at Wayne State
University. ``I'm still sort of surprised how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from getting beat by some humans, however, the program is
not in the same league as Chinook, the computer checkers player
devised some years ago by Dr. Jonathan Schaeffer, a professor of
computing science at the University of Alberta in Canada. Chinook
does not have a human equal at any level, Schaeffer said. But he
said his program, like Big Blue, was infused with human expertise
from the beginning rather than learning on its own.
</P>
<P>
   How good Fogel's program might someday become, and whether it
could ever approach something like Chinook, is unknown. But Dr.
Silvano Colombano, a computer scientist at the NASA Ames Research
Center in California, said the same sort of evolutionary strategy
could be built into computers aboard spacecraft that range too far
from Earth to stay in contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``By analogy with the checkers game,'' Colombano said, ``the
computer can play games with itself and become smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing such a spacecraft would have plenty of, he said,
is time. In the long night of space, it might even decide to hone
its checkers game.

CHENEY, BUSH BASK IN HOMETOWN GLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ Debuting their newly-packaged Republican
presidential ticket, Governor George W. Bush and Dick Cheney
Wednesday breezed through the remote outpost where Cheney grew up,
using their first joint appearance on the campaign trail to convey
an image of solid Western conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   The venue they chose was safe and familiar: the town, with a
population of 46,000, is mostly Republican. People here know Cheney
as senior class president at the Natrona County High School, where
he met his wife, Lynne, long before becoming a congressman and
Pentagon chief.
</P>
<P>
   So when Cheney returned triumphantly to his alma mater,
addressing supporters in a gym festooned with newly-minted
``Bush-Cheney'' signs, he was met with an unusually rousing
reception. ``I assure you, they never treated me this well when I
was their congressman,'' Cheney said. The crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar surroundings shielded Cheney from a barrage of
partisan criticism aimed at his fledgling candidacy, as Democrats
challenged him on three fronts: his conservative voting record (he
refused to ban plastic guns and opposed abortion even in cases of
rape and incest); his ties to the oil industry (he is chief
executive officer of Halliburton Co., one of the largest oil
services companies in the world); and his health (he has suffered
three mild heart attacks).
</P>
<P>
   As Democratic leaders quickly labeled the Bush-Cheney alliance
the ``Big Oil ticket,'' Cheney sought to cast his company in a
sympathetic light, describing Halliburton as a one-man operation
that grew into a multinational corporation thanks to the American
entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reports that Vice President Al Gore had accused
him of holding ``extreme views,'' Cheney defended his record,
telling reporters he was satisfied with how he had voted during his
11 years in Congress. In particular, he said he voted against
imposing sanctions on apartheid South Africa on principle, saying
it was ``not necessarily because I was concerned about South Africa
so much as because I don't believe unilateral economic sanctions
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're often imposed not for foreign policy reasons
but for domestic political reasons,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not elaborate on his vote against banning so-called
``cop-killer'' bullets, or his opposition to banning plastic guns
that can elude metal detectors, or his opposition to federal
funding of abortions even in cases in which a woman has been raped
or is a victim of incest.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Cheney address this apparent conflict: While Bush has
long said he hopes to expand the federal pre-school program Head
Start, moving it into the Department of Education, Cheney voted
against Head Start funding in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am generally proud of my record in the House, the job I did
representing the state of Wyoming,'' Cheney said. ``I'm sure if I
were to go back and look at the individual votes I could probably
find some that I might tweak and do a bit differently. But that was
also the 1980s, a time when we had huge budget deficits, no money,
and one really had to be concerned about federal spending.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview the night before, Cheney said that he
might reverse his vote on Head Start if he were to cast it again
today. He said he might well take a different approach to spending
issues, now that the nation is in ``a different era'' _ an season
of prosperity and surpluses which Gore and President Clinton
believe they deserve considerable credit for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a surplus,'' he said. ``We've got the opportunity
now, I think, to do some things we could not have done 20 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed unruffled by the questions about his running mate, a
longtime foreign policy adviser and family friend whom he sought
for the vice presidential slot from the beginning. And Bush
insisted the former defense secretary was chosen neither to lend
heft to a his candidacy nor to harken back to the administration of
his father, President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to have Dick Cheney by my side,'' Bush told
reporters. ``He brings such strength to an administration. I also
think it speaks volumes that I'm willing to pick somebody who is as
strong a man as he is, that I'm comfortable with having excellence
by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Cheney's record, Bush said: ``This man is a
conservative, and so am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he was proud to ride into the campaign with
another man of the American west. ``The West is a place of
straightforward people -- people who say what we mean, and mean
what they say,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign seemed ill-prepared to reconcile the
uncompromising conservatism of Cheney's record with the Bush mantra
of ``compassionate conservatism.'' And it remained unclear exactly
how familiar Bush is with Cheney's background. Originally chosen to
lead Bush's search for a running mate, Cheney solicited stacks of
paperwork from other candidates, reviewing personal and financial
details. But as a candidate himself, Cheney submitted his personal
information directly to Bush. Communications director Karen Hughes
said she did not know whether Cheney actually filled out forms, or
whether the process was more causal than that.
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, mock attempts by Democratic leaders to turn
the vetting process into a campaign issue, given that Cheney has
been cleared at the highest national security levels on three
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to make the fact that Al Gore voted for
Secretary Cheney's confirmation an issue in this campaign,'' Hughes
said, referring to his confirmation as defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the questions that emerged after Cheney's
appointment began to subside _ his health.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, after a statement released by Cheney's doctor
confirmed he is in good physical shape, the most probing medical
questions he faced were about his allergy to pomegranates, an odd
affliction Cheney said he discovered at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief news conference in Wyoming, the campaign plane
dropped Cheney and his wife off in Dallas before returning Bush to
Austin. The two are expected to resume campaigning on Friday;
Cheney said he will then spend the weekend at home working on his
speech for the Republican National Convention, which begins in
Philadelphia next week.

FRENCH LESSON IN GOING WIRELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first sighting of this handy little device was not in Boston
or Silicon Valley. It was in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   We were nestled at a table at Ma Bourgogne, inches away from a
French couple, whose tiny dog lapped occasionally at her owner's
plate. (``Non, non, Penny!'' the lady quietly scolded.) It's the
kind of restaurant where waiters wear black vests and bowties, and
white aprons that hang to the floor. Grilled beef is bathed in wine
sauce, and the terrace overlooks Place des Vosges, home to French
kings and queens in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until late in the evening, the '97 Chateauneuf du Pape
nearly finished, that we noticed: The waiter didn't jot patrons'
orders on a note pad. He punched buttons on a wireless gadget the
size of a Palm Pilot _ sending orders straight to the kitchen and
to a central computer. He swiped our credit card across the compact
machine right at the table to settle the bill.
</P>
<P>
   This, in the city of romance and Old World charm, yet not in
technology-obsessed Boston? Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Americans are about as far behind in adopting this
kind of technology as we were with cell phones. Everyone in Europe
and Tokyo had a mobile phone glued to his or her ear a few years
ago; we've only recently followed suit. Wireless pros say it's been
easier to roll out services in Europe because digital
communications became the norm sooner, and countries there tend to
have one central system that everyone uses, while we have several.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be cultural reasons, too, for our slow embrace
of what seems a quintessentially American kind of efficiency tool.
As one restaurateur suggests, subtlety is hard to come by here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Paris, they're secure. They aren't trying to create an
experience,'' suggests Jim Miller, chief executive of Fire &AMP; Ice, a
popular Cambridge, Mass. restaurant. Meanwhile, in the States, he
said, ``We're the antithesis of authenticity.'' He worries that
little computers could be ambience wreckers: ``It has a kind of
tacky feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet high-tech gizmos were apparently all the rage at this year's
National Restaurant Convention in Chicago. Industry people are now
talking about the concept of a wireless restaurant. In such a
world, the bus boys wear beepers and signal the host when a table
is clear. Wait staffers take orders on handheld units and runners
deliver food from the kitchen. A request for a new fork can be
handled without the server ever leaving the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   W.J. Kitchen (not a pseudonym, he swears) is chief executive of
Ameranth Technology in San Diego, a start-up with Microsoft venture
backing that makes software for handheld devices and electronics
for the hospitality industry. A former Motorola executive with a
deep Virginia drawl that makes you long for greens and black-eyed
peas, he suggests restaurant customers could even pay for valet
parking along with their meals, and find their cars at curbside the
moment they walk outside.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen says restaurants could turn tables over up to twice as
fast with the new devices, ``and the customer's not realizing he's
being hustled.'' The system could pay for itself in nine months to
a year, he says, unwilling to specify its exact cost.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, in Paris, there is no rushing through meals. Dinner is
frequently a three-hour affair, and when you're ready to leave,
you've got to flag down your server. There, and perhaps in high-end
restaurants here, the electronics would seem to be more about good
service than fast food.
</P>
<P>
   But this is America. We like to know we can buzz through an
entree and make it to the late movie. The wireless ordering units
would seem ideally suited to large, busy restaurants and chains,
like Legal Sea Foods, Bertucci's, or Brew Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Berkowitz, chief executive of Boston's Legal Sea Foods,
said he considered the units a few years ago, but the signals
didn't always work. It was like trying to talk on a cell phone
while you drive through a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Like many restaurants, Legal has computers stationed around the
dining room where servers place orders electronically. He's not
convinced there's a huge benefit to doing it at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk 10 feet to a terminal, punch it in, and it might
be less obtrusive that way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen says servers can learn to use the devices (made by his
partner, Symbol Technology, as well as by Hewlett-Packard, Casio,
and Compaq) in 20 minutes. His company is running focus groups with
California wait staffers to see if they like it. Most do, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Halloran, a restaurant consultant in Jamestown, R.I., and
former executive chef at Cornell University, thinks restaurants are
going to have to adapt to the new technology to boost profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at your tables as a little sales area for a waiter,''
Halloran says. ``Time is money these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he notes, ``Any gimmick works in America.''
</P>
<P>

at $1.75 billion. The Boston firm _ one of many descendants of TA
Associates _ specializes in communications deals. Managing general

invested in Europe. Investments will range from early-stage deals
of $5 million up to $200 million.

A LONE VOICE CRYING IN THE HIGH-TECH WILDERNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Mass. _ Every group needs a gadfly. For the Silicon
Valley crowd, it's Clifford Stoll, a self-proclaimed propellerhead
who thinks the Internet is a vast sinkhole for time better spent
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   To Stoll, computers are little better than television, and they
certainly don't belong in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent book, ``High Tech Heretic,'' Stoll writes
that computers ``dull questioning minds with graphical games where
quick answers take the place of understanding.'' In his book, Stoll
skewers calculators, laptops, desktops, and cell phones as gizmos
that do nothing to provoke critical thinking. Instead, they swallow
up time and waste money that should be spent on books and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, of which there are many in the Valley, Stoll is
a Luddite, an extremist whose philosophy is as outdated as last
year's calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``His book should have been titled, `High Tech Lunatic,' '' said
John C. Dvorak, a well-known technology pundit and writer in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other critics of technology, Stoll is no technophobe.
After getting his doctorate in planetary science, Stoll worked for
various astronomy labs, including the Lawrence Berkeley Lab at the
University of California. There Stoll became famous in 1989 for
catching a German hacker who had been selling computer secrets to
Russia in exchange for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   His career as computer contrarian didn't begin until 1995, when
he published ``Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the
Information Highway,'' an unsparing attack on the burgeoning cult
surrounding the Internet. It was selected by Business Week magazine
in 1995 as among the best business books of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll, now 50, agreed to an interview last week in his Oakland
home. The first thing one notices upon entering Stoll's house,
besides a cluster of manual typewriters sitting on the floor of the
entryway, is that there are no televisions, computers, video
cassettes, or Game Boys. The most modern item in the house is a
tiny boom box in the kitchen, which belongs to Stoll's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because of a dislike for technology, but out of a
love of technology that I wrote those books,'' said Stoll, whose
unruly head of hair gives him the look of a mad yet harmless
scientist. ``As tickled as I am by gizmos, I worry that the field
is being mired by hype. It's not computers that bother me; it's the
cult of computers that gives me the heebie-jeebies.''
</P>
<P>
   The gadgets in the Stoll household are banished to a cluttered
cottage behind the house. There, Stoll keeps two Macintoshes, along
with a collection of old mechanical calculators that he is
currently fixing as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   He also hand-blows Klein bottles, oddly shaped flasks that
theoretically exist only in the fourth dimension because their
inside is also their outside. He advertises the bottles on a Web
site and receives an order every day or two from curious
mathematicians. ``It's fun,'' Stoll said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he likes about technology, Stoll scampers off to a
closet and, after much rummaging, emerges _ beaming like a child _
with a white cardboard box. It contains a device he built several
years ago out of two coffee cans and a handful of electrical
components that he used to measure the speed of cars on his street.
He found that 85 percent of the cars were speeding. Armed with that
data, Stoll and his neighbors petitioned the city to install speed
bumps. ``I want technology to be used to make our cities and
neighborhoods better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Stoll is a full-time father, having quit academic
research years ago. He's living off the royalties of his first two
books. (``High Tech Heretic'' is his third.) His two children
attend a school where parents agree not to have televisions in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll, who has been in the Bay Area for over 15 years, bemoans
the changes he has seen in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chase after dot-com riches has warped the feeling of
closeness that all of us are seeking here,'' said Stoll. His
solution? ``We are seriously considering moving to Vermont.''

MALLS STAKING THEIR CLAIM ON THE WEB

<P>
   The Internet opened up a new and vibrant channel for purchasing
toys, books, and other merchandise. But for the most part,
customers still waited a few days for packages to hit their
doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Now, imagine ordering online from stores in your local mall, and
instantly gratifying your desire for the latest Lauryn Hill CD or
Harry Potter book. You could request same-day delivery or grab
packages at the mall drive-through. Or, you could pick up your
filled bags from a mall booth while taking the kids to see Santa.
</P>
<P>
   Those days may not be far away. After years of dismissing or
downplaying the electronic marketplace, the nation's malls are
trying to stake their claims on the Web by leveraging long-standing
relationships with thousands of retailers. Their push online will
put them in direct competition with Internet portals like Yahoo and
Lycos _ which have invested heavily in their shopping meccas.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth Properties Inc., the nation's second-largest mall
owner, is now building online versions of its shopping centers,
selling software tools and Internet space to both mom-and-pop
stores and retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is core business for us,'' said Charlie Graves, senior
vice president of e-business for the Chicago-based real estate
investment trust. ``We already have business relationships with
15,000 retailers, so we're already committed to helping them
improve their sales. . . . Now, we're giving our retailers a new
tool set to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first shopping centers to leap online will be Natick
(Mass.) Mall, which will start opening Net stores this fall.
General Growth has set up Web addresses, such as Natickmall.com,
for all its 136 shopping centers. Customers can access General
Growth Properties at a central site called Mallibu.com.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth wants to give its merchants templated software
tools and broadband Internet connections to help them set up their
virtual stores. At each online mall, customers will be able to pay
for all purchases in a single credit-card transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The program is clearly in its infancy. Right now, customers can
use the Natick Mall's Web site to get information on mall stores,
operating hours, directions, and the spring arrival of the Easter
Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Even these rudimentary e-offerings need more attention. For
example, the directions link at Natickmall.com did not work last
week. And the stuffed hare has long since scurried back to his
hutch, though the site is still promoting his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Only one General Growth property is up and run-
</P>
<P>
   ning. RiverTown Crossings near Grand Rapids, Mich., introduced
the service in June along with a drive-through window. Next month,
General Growth will debut an e-commerce site for Stonebriar Center
in Dallas. Northridge Fashion Center in California and North Point
Mall in Alpharetta, Ga., follow later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, CheckerFlag Lightning, which carries NASCAR clothing and
collectibles, is the only merchant inside RiverTown Crossings
that's actually selling through the Web site. It offers just three
products, including a Dale Earnhardt Monopoly game and a Jeff
Gordon inflatable car.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth also must figure out a way to integrate its
online malls with existing e-commerce sites operated by Macy's,
Gap, and other national retail chains. Until then, big retailers
like J.C. Penney will only provide links to their online stores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, General Growth's new focus on Net sales represents a
marked departure from its position just two years ago. Back then,
mall owners and retail brokers regarded the growth in e-commerce
with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took this job a little over a year ago, and I think I got
the job more out of a defensive position,'' Graves said. ``Before,
I think the attitude was `Oh my God, what are we going to do about
the Internet?' Now it's, `What are we going to do with the
Internet?' ''
</P>
<P>
   During last year's holiday season, Saint Louis Galleria, a
suburban mall in Richmond Heights, Mo., took the extra step of
barring tenants from promoting their Web sites on shopping bags,
storefronts, or anything on the mall property.
</P>
<P>
   The unpopular ban was dropped after it proved largely
ineffective. Many of the mall's 170 stores griped about the rules,
one merchant threatened to sue, and others blatantly ignored the
Galleria's management.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, mall owners also realized that the e-commerce
threat had not materialized. Sales at mall stores rose a robust 7.7
percent during the holiday selling season, according to the
International Council of Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   General Growth's change in attitude has occurred against a
backdrop of consolidation in the retail industry. Under pressure to
deliver fresh and entertaining concepts, mall owners are
introducing stores such as teen e-tailer Delias.com and J. Jill _ a
catalog and online merchant _ into traditional centers like Natick
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business has changed tremendously in the last four
years,'' Graves said. ``Of our top-performing retail concepts,
probably eight out of 10 are new.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that even giants like General Growth and Simon
Property Group Inc., the nation's largest mall owner, have been
slow to migrate to the Web. And today, they say, the mall owners
continue to lag online counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think General Growth has a bigger learning curve,'' said
Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for the International Council of
Shopping Centers. ``There's not a lot on (Mallibu.com), but they're
working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mallibu.com, Simon Property's Web site, Shopsimon.com,
provides a large number of links to well-known retailers such as
Best Buy, Nordstrom, Gap, and Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, however, this is ancient stuff. Online portals
like AOL, Yahoo, and Lycos introduced their shopping areas years
ago. And they now offer sophisticated search tools that allow
customers to simultaneously sift through thousands of stores for a
single item.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a search for cufflinks at Yahoo yields more than
940 items, including silver terrier cufflinks for $11.10 and
sapphire cufflinks for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost anyone can be a shopping mall. In a sense,
Amazon.com Inc. is the Web's biggest mall, offering books, toys,
CDs, antiques, refrigerators, and much, much more. EBay is the
Net's biggest flea market. Then there are a host of sites like
fashionmall.com, campmall.com, and jewelrymall.com trying to carve
out niches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, everyone is a mall on the Web _ except the
bricks-and-mortar malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best General Growth and other mall developers can
hope for is that they're able to deepen the relationships that they
already have with consumers,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst with
Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm. ``I don't
believe that sites like Mallibu will ever become significant
destination points.''
</P>
<P>
   Where General Growth seems to be having some success is with
smaller retailers that want to promote their businesses without
spending millions of dollars on e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows about the London Harness name in this area,''
said Sandra Macaluso, manager of the London Harness Company leather
store in Natick Mall. ``This would give us exposure across the
country, if not internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon Accessories, a British retail chain that opened its
first and only US store in Natick Mall, also is interested in
Mallibu.com. The company operates a Web site in the United Kingdom.
Due to customs complications, however, US Web shoppers can look but
can't buy, said manager Heather Ahlburn.
</P>
<P>
   Mallibu.com, she said, would give her a place to steer US
customers and a way to grow her revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, (Mallibu.com) is the perfect solution,'' Ahlburn said.
``For me, it would mean a massive increase in business.''

SEGA SAYS WEB SITES, AUCTIONS SHUT DOWN TO HALT PIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Music and movies aren't the only things being pirated and
distributed over the Internet these days.
</P>
<P>
   Video games are also big targets.
</P>
<P>
   Sega of America said last week that it has shut down 60 Web
sites and 125 auctions trafficking in pirated video games played on
Sega's Dreamcast console.
</P>
<P>
   Software pirating has existed for as long as software has been
around. What's new is the unprecendented ease brought by the
Internet for pirating and distributing software, leading to a crop
of new applications such as Napster for copying and sharing music,
and DivX, which can be used to duplicate movies.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming industry estimates that over $3 billion is lost every
year from piracy, a huge sum considering the industry itself pulled
in just $6.9 billion in 1999 from sales of both consoles and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Console makers earn a majority of their cash from licensing
software,'' said Michael Goodman, a senior analyst with the Yankee
Group. ``So piracy is literally a direct attack on their revenue
stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega, which is based in Japan and has operations in San
Francisco, is teaming up with other console makers and software
publishers to fight back. Their arsenal was considerably beefed up
when Congress this year passed the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, which allowed copyright holders to go after Web sites and
Internet service providers that host sales of pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest broadside, Sega began issuing cease and desist
orders to five auction sites, including those hosted by Yahoo!,
eBay, Lycos, Excite and Amazon.com, according to Charles Bellfield,
Sega's spokesman. In addition, the company asked Internet service
providers to shut down Web sites that sell pirated games, as well
as companies hosting virtual hard drives that are used by their
customers for storing pirated games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies that do not comply will face both civil and
criminal prosecution by both federal and state authorities with
whom we are working with,'' said Bellfield.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, all the companies Sega has approached have cooperated,
according to Bellfield. Sega continues to issue cease and desist
orders daily, he said. The company, which said it loses millions of
dollars a year to piracy, is working with European officials and
negotiating with Asian law enforcement on its crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Sega teamed up with game-maker Nintendo and
Electronic Arts, a large game publisher, to file a lawsuit against
Yahoo! to prevent pirated games from being sold on Yahoo's Web
site. The case, filed in U.S. District Court in California, is
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   But game industry analysts question how successful companies
will be in stamping out illicit copying of digital products via
Napster, DivX or a simple $200 compact disk ``burner'' that can
duplicate CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a bigger picture of piracy,'' said P.J.
McNealy, analyst with the Gartner Group. ``As more things become
digital, they will become more portable and easier to exchange,
particularly over the Internet. Instances like this will continue
to crop up more often.''

<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ George W. Bush was seething with frustration.
Here he was, feeling as Texan as the chaw he liked to tuck under
his lower lip, and he had to smile gamely while the audience
snickered at him as an alien in cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1978, and the 31-year-old Bush was trying to get a start
in politics by running for Congress here in West Texas. A
candidate's forum was under way, and his rival was needling Bush
with an oft-repeated joke in which he was the punchline, a yarn
that reinforced a perception of him as a spoiled rich kid from back
East.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Hance, the Democratic candidate and a smooth-talking good
old boy, was telling a yarn about a fancy car coming down a rural
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Mercedes,'' drawled Hance, as the audience tittered
knowingly at the hint that Bush was the kind of man more
comfortable in a Mercedes than a pick-up. ``The guy rolled down the
window and wanted to know how to get to a certain ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hance recounted how he had given the man directions, telling him
to turn right after a cattle guard, a metal grate ubiquitous in
rural roads to keep livestock from straying. ``Then,'' Hance
continued, ``he said, `what color uniform will that cattle guard be
wearing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared with laughter, and just to be sure that the
voters got the connection with the Connecticut-born Bush, Hance
said he had noticed something else about the Mercedes: ``It had
Connecticut license plates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost that race for Congress. Yet the story of his entry
into politics, and particularly of that campaign, suggests that it
left a deep imprint on him, one evident today as he campaigns for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Bush ran an energetic but deeply flawed campaign. He
chose a race that may have been unwinnable, and then muffed up and
let himself be portrayed to many voters as an intelligent,
over-educated phony out of touch with ordinary voters _ ironically,
a bit the way some Bush supporters now look at Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush first entered the congressional race, he was still
single and struggling to start an oil company. He was not obviously
congressional material: He lived in a bachelor's flat, his bed
frame tied together with one of his neckties, and he dressed
exclusively in ratty denim or in clothes that did not match.
</P>
<P>
   But he campaigned feverishly from morning to night in his white
Oldsmobile Cutlass, usually running late, his volunteers sitting
beside him and struggling to domesticate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chewed tobacco,'' recalled Lisa Nowlin, one of those
volunteers, ``and we always had to carry a spit cup so he could
spit out the tobacco before he saw the Methodist preachers.''
</P>
<P>
   So what drew Bush into politics?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he rejected the suggestion that he had followed
his father into politics, saying instead that he had been angry at
the Carter administration's policy on natural gas pricing. But in a
1995 conversation with a historian, Herbert S. Parmet, Bush
emphasized the degree to which his own family legacy pushed him
into the political world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a passing on of tradition, passing on legacy, passing
on responsibility,'' Bush said then, according to Parmet's
transcript of the conversation. ``So I don't think it's a conscious
effort. I don't think it's any of this thing where, you know, `by
God, young man, if you play your cards right you, too, may end up
in politics.' It's more of an inherent trait.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may not have had a decent suit when he announced his
candidacy, but he had a first-rate name. ``George Bush'' had been a
prominent name in Texas for years, and friends of the father helped
out the son or contributed money to him in his 1978 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon became apparent that there was also a downside to
this pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidate in the Republican primary, Jim Reese, the
mayor of Odessa, launched attacks on Bush using themes that still
reverberate today. Some of the epithets associated years later with
Ann Richards in her contest with Bush for the governor's job, such
as ``Junior'' or ``Shrub,'' were first used by Reese back in 1978.
The jabs struck a chord; Bush asked his father not to campaign for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the congressional primary became a proxy battle between two
national Republican giants, for Ronald Reagan and the elder Bush
were dueling in preparation for the 1980 Republican presidential
nomination, and Reagan did not want a Bush family victory in Texas.
As a result, Reagan contributed $3,000 from his political action
committee to Reese's campaign and taped a television commercial for
him. This infuriated the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in getting into an argument with Reagan,''
the elder Bush told The Washington Post at that time. ``But I am
surprised about what he is doing here, in my state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making a real effort to defeat George,'' Bush added
indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Young George also found himself pummeled by conspiracy-minded
right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush was a member of the Trilateral Commission, a
group of prominent internationalists working for cooperation among
the United States, Europe and Japan, and word spread among farmers
that the commission intended to create a world government and was
responsible for depressed crop prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McCathern, a prominent farmer in the area, said: ``We
were always voicing the opinion, `if you support the Trilateral
Commission that your father is in, then farmers can't support you.
And he wouldn't back down. He would say `he's my father and I
support my father.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father was appalled that his membership in the Trilateral
Commission was hurting his son's candidacy, so he resigned a few
days before the election.
</P>
<P>
   While the younger Bush was regarded as personable and a quick
study in his first campaign, he still made a series of mistakes,
largely through inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there was the candidate forum on a farm near the
small town of Dimmitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the first time I've been on a real farm,'' Bush
announced, beaming at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Reese began his talk by saying: ``I want to assure you, this is
not the first time I've been on a real farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the television commercial Bush dreamed up to show
how energetic he was: It showed him jogging on a track. In those
days, joggers were about as common in West Texas as Martians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time folks around here go running,'' Hance, the
Democratic candidate, told audiences, ``is when somebody's chasing
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Bush beat Reese handily in the Republican
primary, with 56 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody knew that Hance would present tougher competition.
A smooth-talking farmboy who had grown up in the district, Hance
was a rising political star who focused his campaign on emphasizing
local ties and on making Bush out as a carpet-bagger from the East.
</P>
<P>
   Hance had graduated from Texas Tech and the University of Texas
Law School, and he liked to remind audiences that Bush had gone to
Yale and Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yale and Harvard don't prepare you as well for running for the
19th congressional district as Texas Tech does,'' Hance told
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the campaign, disaster struck the Bush forces.
</P>
<P>
   A university student was organizing a ``Bush bash'' to recruit
young people from Texas Tech, and he placed an advertisement in the
student newspaper promising free beer. In fact the event was tame
and ended early, but the Democrats had their ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the election, a law partner of Hance wrote a
public letter denouncing the Bush campaign for using alcohol to
lure young people.
</P>
<P>
   The local newspapers wrote about the incident, quoting Hance as
saying: ``Maybe it's a cool thing to do at Harvard or Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called a news conference in which he fumed: ``His campaign
has been funny. First he attacked my family, then my background,
and now my morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Bush found out that Hance owned a building that
was leased to Fat Dawgs, a bar in Lubbock. Some of Bush's friends
urged him to accuse Hance of hypocrisy, but he refused; voters
would reward a candidate who took the high road, he told
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``His weakness was that he wouldn't go for the jugular,'' said
Jane Anne Stinnett, a cotton broker and long-time Republican in
Lubbock. Stinnett said that she was arguing for a tough response to
the beer bash accusations, but ``he just didn't want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Bush was beaten, 53 percent to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were glad the race was over,'' said Hance, now a Republican
lawyer in Austin and a Bush supporter. ``He was really improving
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bright guy, and he picked up the issues and got better
as time went on. If it'd been two weeks earlier, we would have
beaten him worse. If it'd been two weeks later, it would have been
really close.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did Bush learn from his first political contest? How did
it change him?
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have learned that a candidate needs to pick his
races, for it may have been impossible for a Republican oilman from
Midland, the West Texas town where Bush had grown up, to win in an
overwhelmingly Democratic district dominated by agriculture and the
rival city of Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interesting lesson,'' Bush said in an interview.
``Sometimes there are races you just can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other lessons, some of Bush's friends say, is the need to
respond forcefully to accusations, like those about the ``Bush
bash,'' and, more broadly, ``don't let your opponent define you,''
as Joe O'Neill, a friend from those days, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Hance's take is that he taught Bush a twofold lesson. First, he
says, he showed Bush the need to cultivate the religious right, and
helped teach him the need to be more folksy.
</P>
<P>
   As Hance puts it: ``He wasn't going to be out-Christianed or
out-good-old-boyed again. He's going to be the good old boy next
door.''

`LIBERACE': A BIOGRAPHY AS INTENSE AS ITS SUBJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By   JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a discussion of the import of ``I'll Be Seeing You'' as
Liberace's signature song, the star's inexhaustible biographer,
Darden Asbury Pyron, manages to invoke Dante's Beatrice, ancient
Jewish elders, the Greek goddess Artemis and ``The Sound and the
Fury.'' All this is by way of contemplating the meaning of
``seeing,'' and it blessedly is not accompanied by any great claims
for Liberace's theoretical wisdom on the point.
</P>
<P>
   But Pyron, who previously trained his hyperanalytical eye on
Margaret Mitchell (in the well-received ``Southern Daughter'') and
``Gone With the Wind,'' is daffily intent on making a scholarly
study of the performer famed for introducing rhinestone-studded hot
pants to Las Vegas. And at the very least, he winds up making his
own biographical impulse understood. There may be no urgent need to
plumb ``the inner vision adumbrated in the lyrics of ``I'll Be
Seeing You,''' but Pyron makes a reasonable connection between
Liberace's carefully created persona as ``Mr. Showmanship'' and the
cultural climate in which he sustained his gaudy, big-hearted brand
of celebrity for 50 years. It was a career fittingly immortalized
in ``Bartlett's Familiar Quotations,'' which cites Liberace for
coining the phrase ``laughed all the way to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Pyron's stupefyingly serious ``Liberace'' carries too
much baggage (including 54 pages of chatty footnotes on top of a
dense 427-page text) to resemble ordinary show-business
hagiography, it does reveal that Walter Liberace first wowed
listeners as a 3-year-old playing ``Yes, We Have No Bananas'' on
the family upright piano in his Wisconsin home. ``The first
manifestation of his genius is legendary,'' notes Pyron, who claims
to have approached Liberace without any great affection but
obviously warmed to his subject, just as readers may.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy who loved to entertain, to make silk flowers and to
carve animals out of soap, one who spoke ``in a voice you don't
often hear at football games,'' little Wally shaped his nascent
stage personality to blunt classmates' enmity, escape a domineering
father and brighten the workaday gloom of the Depression. Pyron,
who lards his thoughts about Liberace with as many larger
references as possible, especially when Greek mythology is an
option, notes the entertainer's lack of satisfaction with his early
success by saying: ``When asked what labor wanted, Samuel Gompers
supposedly cried `More!' It was an American idiom. Liberace spoke
it with his soul.''
</P>
<P>
   So he created a piano act featuring candelabra inspired by a
movie about Chopin, classical-sounding renditions of popular music,
piano lessons for audience members, frequent references to his
mother (he solicited tuna recipes for her benefit) and outrageous
visual trappings that became legendary in their own right. And the
essence of his performance, even in the years when it marked him as
``a cultural Antichrist,'' was its delight in being square.
``There's a whole, big, wonderful country between L.A. and
N.Y.C.,'' he proclaimed with typical gusto. ``It's full of lots of
smart people with opinions and tastes of their own. You have to be
prepared to please that whole country. You have to be prepared to
entertain everyone. If you have something for everybody, they'll
have something for you . . . their love and appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Liberace's homosexuality was not liable to please everyone.
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
And public awareness of it could have done great damage to a career
based on his appeal to women as ``the greatest lover since
Valentino,'' in the words of one delusional Chicago newspaper, or
at least as a friendly figure who approached consumerism with
religious fervor. ``The main thing about Liberace,'' one fan told a
reporter, ``is that he is through and through a Continental. When
he kisses your hand, you know he isn't going to chew off your
arm.'' He needed to sustain that aura, as well as the gaudy
caricature of wealth and high culture that appealed so successfully
to middle-class America, as a professional matter of life or
death. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Liberace was so glittery a star in the early 1950's that
the book includes a picture of Elvis Presley gazing up at him
delightedly as part of a Las Vegas audience, his career hit an ugly
patch in the latter part of that decade. Innuendoes from
publications like Hollywood Confidential (``Why Liberace's Theme
Song Should Be `Mad About the Boy''') nearly did him in. And it was
an extraordinary sign of the times that he chose to sue an English
newspaper for hinting at his homosexuality, replying, ``No, sir,
never in my life'' when asked in court, ``Have you ever indulged in
homosexual practices?'' Pyron is at his best in explaining why, for
a man with an incongruously conservative, even retrograde vision of
Americana, a lie like that was a curious, backhanded way of telling
some larger truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he grew more artificial, he became more genuine,'' Quentin
Crisp commented about Liberace. And this biography, in refracting
the life of ``the showman'' (a virtual pronoun as Pyron uses it)
through such watershed American events as World War II, the birth
of television, the creation of Las Vegas style, the Stonewall
uprising and the scourge of AIDS (which killed Liberace in 1987,
though he refused to acknowledge the disease), makes that point in
a larger sense.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, so imprisoned by vanity that he nearly refused a
face-lift if it meant removing his wig, Liberace had become a true
American bellwether, a man whose life was fraught with signs of his
times even if his memoirs, contrary to Pyron's claim, do not
warrant comparison to Benjamin Franklin's. He had achieved a
strange and enduring feat of self-creation. And ``finally,'' in the
words of one person quoted here, ``it was impossible to make fun of
Liberace because he was having too much fun making fun of
himself.''

JUDGE LEANING AGAINST TOYSMART IN CUSTOMER DATA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A bankruptcy judge says she has ``fundamental
problems'' with a Federal Trade Commission settlement allowing
failed Web retailer Toysmart.com to sell customer data.
</P>
<P>
   The toy seller withdrew the controversial database from auction
during a court hearing in Boston, avoiding a possible ruling
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Toysmart.com and its creditors rejected current
bids as too low in price, though they hope to sell the data at a
later date.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Carol Kenner indicated that she believed opponents of
the deal have a strong case against the company. And she promised
Wednesday that her concerns over the settlement ``will be difficult
to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   If the retailer had not withdrawn the sale, Kenner said she
would have backed 40 states that have registered objections to the
auction. Attorneys general and privacy advocates say Toysmart.com,
which promised consumers it would never sell their personal
information, should be blocked from selling such data.
</P>
<P>
   Kenner plans to address the FTC settlement in another court
hearing. No date had been set.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities, consumer advocates, and Internet firms are
anxiously awaiting Kenner's decision, which could set a precedent
in an industry that is grappling with growing concerns over
consumer privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com closed its Internet doors in May after its majority
owner, Walt Disney Co., pulled its support. Last month, the company
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code.
</P>
<P>
   Although Toysmart.com posted a policy on it Web site clearly
stating it would never sell personal information about its
customers to a third party, it collapsed and soon began advertising
the sale of its assets in The Boston Globe, Wall Street Journal and
other publications.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC sued Toysmart.com earlier this month in US District
Court in Boston, seeking to block the sale of the database. But
last week the two sides reached a settlement that permits the
online retailer to sell customer information under certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Toysmart.com must delete about 2,000
records allegedly collected in violation of the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act of 1998. It can sell the data only to a
family-oriented business that purchases the entire Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What harm can fall from that?'' Harry Murphy, an attorney for
Toysmart.com, asked Kenner.
</P>
<P>
   Eric London, an FTC spokesman, said the commission helped craft
an agreement that ``balances the ability of a company to sell
itself with consumers' privacy rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general, however, have rejected the settlement, saying
it does not go far enough in protecting the rights of consumers.
The states argue that all customers should be notified of the sale
and given the opportunity to have their files deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Kogut, assistant attorney general for Massachusetts, said
she also objects to the possible sale of the customer database to a
unit of Disney. If no suitable buyer emerges, the subsidiary has
offered to pay $50,000 for the list and have it destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toysmart made a very specific promise to consumers that it
would never sell the list,'' Kogut said. Selling the list to Disney
``gets to the right result in the wrong way.''

AS CELL PHONE USE EXPLODES, DEBATE OVER HEALTH RISK GROWS
</HEADLINE>
  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many people, Tim Keck, the publisher of two weekly
newspapers in the Pacific Northwest, has come to depend on his cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   And like many other cell phone users, he has begun to worry
about possible health risks connected with its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sometimes scared my brain is getting boiled,'' said Keck,
whose newspaper in Seattle, The Stranger, is known for its jaded
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's so convenient that I couldn't imagine not using it,''
he said, ``so I push these worries to the back of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   After several of the world's largest cell phone manufacturers,
including companies like Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson, said last
week that they planned to release more information on the radiation
levels of their devices, it will be harder to ignore the debate
over health risks and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Even though federal agencies, relying on the results of various
studies, say cell phones are safe, it is not surprising that
concerns about the possible risks are increasing. Cell phones are
emerging as perhaps the best-selling electronic device in the
world. More than 400 million units are expected to be sold this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate has to do with the amount of radiation
emitted.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission in
1996 established a level of 1.6 watts per kilogram _ or 2.2 pounds
_ of human tissue as the highest amount of radio waves a device can
emit when held against a given part of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Although devices currently available meet the FCC standard,
there is a lot of confusion as to what the level means.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, a
group representing wireless companies, to provide more information
on what the watts per tissue level means on pamphlets inside each
package.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, manufacturers will offer information on the
packages that let consumers know that the device has been approved
by the FCC, and will list addresses of government and corporate Web
sites that provide more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found there is a great deal of misinformation out there, so
our aim is to provide as much transparency as possible,'' said Tom
Wheeler, the president of the industry association, which is in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the topic of cell phones and health risks can be
confusing. Almost all studies conducted have failed to show any
conclusive evidence that cell phone use can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few studies have linked cell phone use to the risk of
brain cancer in laboratory animals. One study showed that mice
genetically predisposed to a type of cancer developed twice as many
such cancers when exposed to cell phone radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, all sides in the debate have called for
additional research. The industry association recently said it
would spend $25 million to study possible cancer risks from cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   In light of recent rulings against tobacco companies, phone
manufacturers may be able to shield themselves from the possibility
of future legal action if they can show that they have tried to
make users aware of any information related to radiation levels and
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply smart for the companies to show they've done
everything possible to ensure their devices are safe,'' said
Mitchell Lazarus, a lawyer at Fletcher, Heald &AMP; Hindreth in
Arlington, Va., which specializes in telecommunications law.
</P>
<P>
   There are skeptics regarding the safety of cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people point to the need to conduct long-term
research, since cell phones have only been available on a
widespread basis since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``On numerous occasions, microwave radiation from sources
similar to cellular phones has been showed to increase the chances
of cancer,'' said C. Ross Adey, a former professor of physiology at
the Loma Linda School of Medicine. ``It is far too early in the
game to say that cell phones are the harmless little objects the
industry makes them out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, anyone concerned with the potential health
risks can take several steps to lessen the possibility of cancer,
however distant it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Earphones can keep the phone away from the brain, although it
could expose a different part of the body to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, cell phone users could simply opt to have shorter
conversations, which would lower their exposure to radio waves.
There are also a increasing number of shields being sold that are
designed to protect the user from radiation, although some critics
say the shields might actually increase exposure because some
phones may need more radio-frequency energy to communicate with
nearby towers.
</P>
<P>
   As for comparing the radiation levels of each phone,
manufacturers and scientists seem to agree that this is somewhat of
a useless exercise since the amount of radiation emitted can wary
widely depending on where the device is used.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a cell phone used in Manhattan could have a higher
radiation level because more energy is needed to communicate with a
tower given the interference from buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But even in these situations, the devices are below the FCC
limit of 1.6 watts per kilogram of human tissue, according to the
Cellular Telephone Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wheeler, the head of the manufacturers' association,
said, few devices reach that level because it was established with
a 50-fold margin of error and the energy they need rarely reaches
that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand behind scientific consensus that no health risks have
been demonstrated,'' said Norman Sandler, director of global
strategic issues at Motorola. ``But we support the need for more
research into the matter.''

EGYPT WELCOMES ARAFAT FOR BRIEFINGS ON CAMP DAVID 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Trying to mine some hope from the failed Camp
David peace talks and prepare for new negotiations, Egyptian
officials Wednesday welcomed the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat,
for consultations on his way home from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat did not treat himself immediately to an enthusiastic
homecoming in Gaza, but instead flew to Alexandria, the summer
retreat of the Egyptian government. There he briefed President
Hosni Mubarak and Arab League officials on his two weeks of
intensive negotiations with Israel over the contentious issues of
Jerusalem, land and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three hours of meetings, Arafat emerged and spoke
defiantly at a news conference, accusing Israel of inflexibility
and promising his host that one day they would both pray in an
Arab-run Jerusalem, ``whether some people like it or hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have run out of patience,'' he added. ``In fact, we are far
beyond the limits of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   But his decision to fly directly to Mubarak, his closest ally in
the ranks of often hostile Arab leaders and the one with the best
relations with American officials, indicated that Arafat was
already beginning his preparations for another plunge into
negotiations before Sept. 13, the deadline he has given for his
declaration of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in Arafat's interest _ and it for sure is not in
Egypt's interest or Jordan's or America's _ to have a unilateral
declaration of statehood without a broader framework agreement,''
said an Egyptian official involved in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to act to limit the sense of despair about Camp
David and prevent a deterioration of the situation,'' the official
added.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt is expected to sponsor a round of consultations among Arab
leaders to build support for Arafat as he and the Israelis try to
rescue some accord from Camp David in the next seven weeks. King
Abdullah II of Jordan, as well as several leaders of Persian Gulf
states, are expected in Alexandria for meetings with Mubarak next
week.
</P>
<P>
   If past crises in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are a guide,
Mubarak may also meet with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel to
try to defuse tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has long played a pivotal role in garnering Arab support
for talks with Israel. After 19 years in office, he has developed
good relations with the United States and has acted as a mediator
in Israel's sputtering negotiations with the Palestinians and with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   During the Camp David talks, he spoke with Arafat and with Barak
by telephone. While many American officials in Washington have
expressed disappointment that Mubarak did not press the
Palestinians to accept a compromise on the difficult issue of
Jerusalem, he did present the options on Jerusalem to other Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak flew to Saudi Arabia, for example, last weekend, when
the the talks appeared to have reached a particularly intense stage
as specific proposals for partial administrative control over some
sites in Jerusalem were offered by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts in Cairo said Mubarak was testing the waters
with Crown Prince Abdullah on the Israeli offer of partial
Palestinian self-rule in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis, keepers of Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and
Medina, apparently responded coolly to any compromise on full
Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem and its Old City. After
the trip, Mubarak gave his full support to Arafat's rejection of
the Israeli plan, Mubarak's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the issue of negotiating the status of
Jerusalem, Arafat is too weak, personally and politically, to act
on his own,'' said Wahid Abdel Maguid, the deputy director of Al
Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is too weak even to take a decision to delay a decision,''
Abdel Maguid added. ``To make a decision you need a consensus
between three or four big Arab countries, because it's a matter of
historical responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Mubarak, who still fears an Islamic
fundamentalist insurgency at home, is interested in seeing Arafat
accept less than full Palestinian sovereignty over the Arab part of
Jerusalem and its mosques, which are sacred to Muslims all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But Mubarak does have the credibility to explore options that
Arafat, who has a long history of rocky and mutually suspicious
relations with his fellow Arab leaders, does not. As Egyptian
president, Mubarak also has more influence over Arafat than any
other leader, in part because Egypt has the least troublesome
history with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, under the late King Hussein, fought off an attempt by
Palestinians under Arafat to take control of the country. Syria,
under the late President Hafez al-Assad, sheltered and financed the
radical Palestinian opposition to Arafat. Lebanon's civil war grew
out of its battles with Palestinians. The Gulf countries expelled
most Palestinian residents in 1990 to punish Arafat for support he
offered to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who invaded Kuwait
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Arafat and for most Palestinians, Egypt is the only Arab
country which supported the Palestinians in their cause without
interfering in their internal affairs and without committing any
crimes against them,'' said Abdel Maguid. ``The Palestinians know
Syria, Jordan, even forces within Lebanon, are responsible for many
crimes. So there is a great confidence that Arafat can feel with
Egypt that he cannot feel with any other Arab leader.''

LOYAL CONCORDE PASSENGERS WON'T BE SCARED AWAY BY CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AIRFRANCE-CRASH) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The flight may not be as comfortable as business
class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies _
or any movies, for that matter _ but crossing the Atlantic in just
over three hours on the supersonic Concorde, versus seven to nine
hours on standard jets, is well worth the cost and relative
discomfort, Concorde passengers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash of a chartered Air France
Concorde outside Paris, killing all 109 people on the airplane and
four people on the ground, most members of the elite club that is
the Concorde's clientele had few qualms about flying the jet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about the crash, obviously I was horrified,''
said John Demsey, president of Mac Cosmetics, who flies on the
Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris
Wednesday on his way to the island of Capri. His trip was delayed
after Air France suspended all its Concorde flights until the
airline is convinced the planes are safe. But Demsey said that he
was ready to take his flight even after he heard about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point the plane has had a safety record as good or
better than any other plane,'' he said. ``I would definitely fly it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, the only other airline that flies the Concorde,
resumed its New York to London service Wednesday after having
canceled some flights Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might
smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a
full-fare roundtrip ticket, described as a business tool. But that
is how many of its denizens refer to it. Air France says two-thirds
of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business, while the
rest are celebrities, the superrich or vacationers like members of
the German tour group who died in Tuesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   For business executives, the advantage of the Concorde, which
cruises twice as high as conventional jets and, at 1,350 mph, twice
as fast, is not just the time saved in the air. It is also the time
saved on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde
services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of
modern jet travel. Concorde passengers can arrive a half hour
before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and
immigration. Their luggage is delivered to them within minutes of
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities like the Concorde's exclusivity because it separates
them from the common folk on commercial flights. Executives like it
because they can socialize with celebrities. They can also network,
though that is not always a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde's 100-seat cabin is so small it is hard to work
without your neighbors peeking over your shoulder. Wall Street
executives have been known to pick up the whiff of a deal after
bumping into a competitor with a client.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde's speed allows executives to put in a full day of
work in London, hop on the 7 p.m. Concorde and arrive back in New
York the same day at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of cross-border mergers on the rise in
industries like entertainment, finance, telecommunications and
energy, many executives are finding that they are having to travel
back and forth to Europe on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't take it for the luxury,'' said Emmanuel A.
Kampouris, former chairman of American Standard Companies, who had
just arrived on the 7 p.m. British Airways Concorde from London
Wednesday. ``It's not comfortable. Sometimes it is really cold, or
sometimes it is really hot but it is unbelievably convenient. You
arrive before you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason he flew the Concorde Wednesday was because he
had a meeting in London Wednesday and another in New York Thursday.
His wife, Camille, who accompanied him, was pleased because they
now had time to go out for dinner in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde also allows travelers to Europe to arrive early
enough to connect to other destinations the same day. Indeed, the
Concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the Continent
in the afternoon. The alternative for many travelers is to take an
overnight flight and try to sleep on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sleep well on planes,'' Demsey said. ``To me it buys
back two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, one of the Concorde's dirty secrets is that few of its
regulars pay the top fare of more than $10,000 roundtrip. Most fly
so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the
airlines for discounts of as much as 30 percent, or the price of a
business-class ticket, which on Air France is $7,050.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the
Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to
swim,'' Richard Nigosian, president of Bond Street Travel in
Manhattan, said of the customers he books on the Concorde. If they
did not fly supersonic, they would fly first class, which is only a
few thousand dollars cheaper. Most of his customers believe that
the added cost is well worth it since it means they can do more
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who earn millions of dollars a year, it really does
pay for itself,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: WHY IS ARAFAT SMILING? 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three pictures on the front page of The Times told
the Camp David story: Ehud Barak stunned and dismayed, Bill Clinton
shattered _ and Yasser Arafat grinning broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Arafat gave up nothing. But Israel's leader,
prodded by a U.S. president, made concessions that broke pledges
Barak made in his election campaign a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He offered Arafat virtually all the West Bank, including the
vital Jordan Valley, requiring the uprooting of 40,000 Israeli
settlers. He offered what amounts to right of return of thousands
of Palestinians to Israel, backed up by a reported huge commitment
by Clinton to pay Palestinians around the world to not return. And
most unthinkable only a year ago, he offered to share sovereignty
with a new Palestinian state in portions of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough, smiled Arafat. He went home to the cheers of
intransigent Palestinians in Gaza and the praise of Egypt's
unyielding Hosni Mubarak (whose regime we have propped up with $50
billion in aid since Jimmy Carter's Camp David). Arabs are
delighted at the one-way flow of concessions because they now see
Jerusalem ``in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton absolves Barak and himself from the failure of
these negotiations, his desperation for a deal in time for our
November election was at the root of the fiasco. Because Barak,
under pressure, gave away too much too soon, nothing was left as a
deal-closer.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian statehood ceased to be an Israeli bargaining chip
two years ago when Hillary Clinton, on global TV, nine times
embraced a Palestinian state. The salami-slice turnover of West
Bank land before final-status talks was supposed to engender trust,
but it only whetted Palestinian appetites; by the time Barak
reached Camp David it was common knowledge that he intended to
yield nearly all the land Arafat claimed.
</P>
<P>
   With statehood and all the land already in his pocket; with
heavy money from America promised for himself and for Palestinians
abroad; and with the Israelis and Americans tacitly winking at his
40,000 armed troops as a ``police force,'' what incentive did
Arafat have to drop his demands for Jerusalem as his capital?
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, no incentive at all. On the contrary, he had every
reason to hang tough and await more concessions. What many of us
long thought to be in the cards _ a Palestinian capital in a
village that was a Jerusalem suburb, which Palestinians were free
to call Jerusalem _ was now a compromise the supremely confident
Arafat could dismiss. Mubarak, the Saudis and his own militant
followers could sense the momentum going his way.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Barak realized he was conceding too much for
Israeli voters to bear. Certainly he would lose a referendum that
called for Israel's loss of control of its capital. So as the
summit broke up he labeled all his concessions ``invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Arafat, they are valid forever. Once laid on the table,
they cannot so easily be snatched back. Just as Syria's Hafez
al-Assad demanded that tentative Israeli concessions be the
starting point of renewed negotiations, Arafat will insist on the
same. Thus has Clinton's unwise summit gamble raised unreasonable
Arab expectations, and has moved the center of gravity of an
ultimate settlement away from Israel's security interests.
</P>
<P>
   You have to sympathize with Barak, a good man learning diplomacy
the hardest way. Through Clinton, he offered Assad all the Golan
Heights, only to be rebuffed. He offered Arafat virtually all the
West Bank, and was scorned again. Land for peace? The land Arab
leaders want is the land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak returned home as Arik Sharon, leader of the opposition
Likud, called for early elections. ``I do not foresee a possibility
for a unity government,'' Sharon tells me, ``because we will never
accept the partition of Jerusalem. I'm running.'' If a trumped-up
case against Bibi Netanyahu is dropped, that Comeback Kid will
compete for the nomination. Natan Sharansky will be an election
factor.
</P>
<P>
   A nonpolitical old friend in Israel's still-undivided capital
(where the U.S. Embassy ought to be relocated now) says: ``The
summit's only benefit to Israel was that it made clear to the world
who wants peace and who does not.'' In time, an Israeli unburdened
with Barak's concessions will find a Palestinian interlocutor who
wants peace too.

 &HT;    Progress rapid on water lifeline for North Texas town
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Scooping up parched earth with donated
equipment, residents, out-of-town volunteers and inmates from
nearby prisons have, in just 10 days, nearly finished a 14-mile
trench that will bring an emergency water line to the small North
Texas town of Throckmorton.
</P>
<P>
   Throckmorton's 1,036 residents have less than two months before
Lake Throckmorton, their sole water source, runs dry. Their plight
has brought hundreds of volunteers to the town and given local
leaders new confidence that the pipeline connecting the town to a
water supply company's lines in Elbert will be finished before the
lake runs out of usable water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be ready before we run out of water,'' said
Throckmorton public works director Steve Bowlin, who organized the
project. ``I feel pretty confident saying we're going to have all
our pipe in the ground by this weekend. So we're way ahead of
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin said they expect to have the pipeline ready to transport
water by Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Much work remains. Workers must fill the ditch with a layer of
sand, assemble the pipe segments and bury the pipeline. And
Throckmorton must still install storage tanks and a pump station to
get the water flowing.
</P>
<P>
   The town, located between Wichita Falls and Abilene, is paying
for much of the project with an $800,000 grant from the Texas
Department of Housing and Community Affairs. But the grant didn't
cover the cost of equipment or labor, so Throckmorton is building
its own lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Since digging began July 17, residents have been joined by as
many as 115 volunteers a day from other parts of Texas, Oklahoma
and as far away as Chicago and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had quite a few folks from the Austin area come up,''
said Mayor John Kunkel. ``It just kind of exploded on us, and it's
been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Donated digging equipment has come from Grapevine, Dallas,
Arlington and nearby communities. A family from Mesquite that runs
a construction company showed up with two dump trucks and an
excavator and worked for 30 hours straight, Bowlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water for the workers has poured into Throckmorton by
the truckload. Nearby towns, an H-E-B grocery and country music
star Billy Ray Cyrus have all sent shipments of water, which are
passed out to work crews by local teen-agers , Kunkel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Baptist Men have been preparing two meals a day for
the workers. The Red Cross is on site to deliver the meals. In
return, Throckmorton residents with spare beds have opened their
homes to the volunteers.

PRIVACY CAN BE ELUSIVE IN THE WORLD OF E-MAIL 
(CIRCUITS) 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How safe and private is e-mail? I keep seeing advertisements
for e-mail security programs and wonder if this type of software is
really necessary for the average user.
</P>
<P>
   A: You would probably do well to abide by an old rule of thumb
when it comes to the privacy of e-mail: Never put anything in an
e-mail message that you wouldn't write on a postcard.
</P>
<P>
   Between the time you click the Send button and it arrives in the
In box of the recipient, a typical e-mail message travels through
at least a couple of mail servers and other computers. Hackers
usually have bigger targets than mail servers in mind, but it is
possible for the security of the electronic mail to be compromised.
Web-based e-mail accounts like Hotmail have also proved themselves
in the past to be vulnerable to skilled hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of hackers poking around in e-mail servers is
probably fairly insignificant compared with more commonplace
security risks: the people around you. If you share a family
computer or e-mail account, there are obvious privacy issues that
could arise. Anyone who knows your e-mail password can read and
send e-mail from your account.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to be careful when sending personal mail from your
work e-mail account. Some corporations save and archive copies of
all incoming and outgoing messages for legal and in-house security
reasons. Employers generally have the legal right to read any
employee mail that passes through the corporate mail servers, so
you may want to keep that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it is wise to avoid sending personal information
like your credit card or Social Security number by e-mail, and you
might want to keep deeply private messages out of the office mail
servers.
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to shield your personal mail from most potential
prying eyes is to encrypt it before you send it. Most encryption
programs will translate your message into gibberish and require the
same program and a password to decipher the text on the other end.
You can purchase commercial encryption software to work with your
e-mail program or download a copy of the freeware version of the
Pretty Good Privacy program from the link at www.pgp.com. There are
PGP versions available for the Windows, DOS, Macintosh and Linux
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What makes my e-mail program decide to start displaying the
messages in my In box out of chronological order?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are at least a few things in your e-mail program of
choice that you might want to look at that might reveal why your
messages are out of order. Many e-mail programs give you the option
to display the incoming messages according to your time zone or
that of the sender. If the setting is selected for the sender's
time zone and you have a lot of international correspondents in
addition to your local ones, the messages may sort out of order
because of the mixture of time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Some e-mail programs will let you sort your messages by
different criteria besides the time they were sent, like Priority
settings, size, subject or sender. In many e-mail programs, like
Eudora Pro, simply clicking at the top of each column in the In box
window will re-sort the mail according to the designation of that
column. For example, if you have accidentally clicked in the
Subject column of the In box, you may find your mail is sorting
alphabetically according to the subject lines. Clicking on the Date
column should restore your chronological sorting. If only one or
two of your correspondents aren't sorting properly, their messages
might simply be coming from a computer with the incorrect system
date and time.

COMMENTARY: RETIREMENT RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their brief joint appearance on Tuesday, George W. Bush and
Dick Cheney both mentioned Social Security first when they referred
to some of the big issues facing the country. Both said that
strengthening the Social Security system was a priority.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a rigorous analysis by the nonpartisan Century
Foundation of Bush's proposal to allow workers to invest part of
their Social Security payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts
has determined that the plan would either worsen the system's
long-term deficit or lead to substantial cuts in Social Security
benefits, or both.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of Bush's plan was conducted by Henry J. Aaron, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Alan Blinder, an
economics professor at Princeton University and a former vice
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Alicia Munnell of Boston
College; and Peter Orszag, president of Sebago Associates, an
economics and public policy consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   It is understood that diverting revenue from the Social Security
system to individual accounts, by itself, increases the system's
projected deficit. The study said: ``Compensating for this lost
revenue and addressing Social Security's long-term deficit will
require some combination of: higher payroll taxes; investing part
of the Social Security trust funds in higher-yielding assets (such
as stocks); general revenue transfers to Social Security; and/or
reductions in Social Security benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors went on: ``Governor Bush has promised not to raise
payroll taxes or invest the trust fund in stocks. He also has
proposed tax cuts that would consume virtually the entire projected
non-Social Security surplus, leaving no room for transfers to
Social Security without causing a non-Social Security deficit.
Governor Bush's plan would therefore have to rely on cutting Social
Security benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The study attempted to determine whether the proceeds from the
individual retirement accounts would be enough to offset the
benefit cuts. They came to conclusions that were frightening.
</P>
<P>
   The authors based their analysis on a diversion of two
percentage points of the current Social Security payroll tax into
individual retirement accounts. And they assumed an
inflation-adjusted rate of return on the accounts of 5.9 percent
annually, which matched the assumption of Martin Feldstein, an
advocate of retirement accounts and a top adviser to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive analysis, they concluded that substantial cuts
in guaranteed benefits for workers 55 and under were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security benefits for 30-year-olds would have to be
reduced by 54 percent to extend the solvency of the Social Security
system for the next 75 years,'' the study said. ``Even if the stock
market performs as well as it has historically, the combined income
from the individual account and the scaled-back Social Security
system would be 20 percent below current-law Social Security
benefits for the average 30-year-old single earner.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what would happen if the stocks purchased by this
hypothetical 30-year-old did well. But, of course, they might not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion,'' the authors wrote, ``is that Governor Bush's
proposal could cut Social Security benefits by more than 50 percent
for young workers, and the proceeds from the individual accounts
would (on average) make up only a portion of that cut while
exposing individuals to significant risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, that's the rosier scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The study said: ``These estimates are based on assumptions we
believe understate the likely reductions in Social Security
benefits. Even with these favorable assumptions, the results are
dramatic: Governor Bush's plan requires substantial reductions in
Social Security benefits and increased exposure to market risks for
future retirees. Indeed, the implied reductions in Social Security
benefits for future retirees are so substantial, they raise
questions about the viability of protecting benefits for current
retirees, older workers, disabled workers, and survivors while
diverting payroll taxes into individual accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney will be rigorously cross-examined on this matter
between now and November.

ECONOMIC SCENE: RECORDING INDUSTRY SHAKEN BY NEW TECHNOLOGY AND
ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HAL R. VARIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly any kind of information _ print, images, sounds or videos
_ can be turned into a stream of bits and transmitted over the
Internet. This fact has profound implications for the economics of
industries that provide such information. The most recent example
is Napster, the music directory service available over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is being sued by the Recording Industry Association of
America on the ground that it enables people to copy and share
music illegally. This is an important case, but it is only a
skirmish in a larger battle over the technological and economic
forces that are shaking up the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Napster uses a centralized directory, so it can be forced to
shut down. But other systems, like Gnutella and Freenet, have
directories distributed over thousands of computers, making them
much more difficult to control. Some systems use strong
cryptography, so it is impossible to determine what, exactly, is
being shared. Even if Napster is forced to shut down, such
technologies will ensure that widespread Internet distribution of
copyrighted material will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry argues that it cannot survive in its present
form without additional intellectual property protection. There is
some justification for this view. During the French Revolution, one
of the first acts of the new National Assembly was to eliminate
copyrights. Within a few years, only pornography and seditious
material was being published. Though such material can apparently
survive any intellectual property regime, the French had to
reinstate copyrights to provide incentives to produce more
substantive works.
</P>
<P>
   The current turmoil in the music industry is a result not of a
political revolution but of a technological one. The question
should not be whether the current business model for music
distribution can survive, but whether there is any business model
that can support the creation and dissemination of high-quality
music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry has pinned its hopes on the Secure Music
Digital Initiative, a copy protection standard. There are two
difficulties with this approach. The first is technological: there
is no way to protect the music once it has been translated into
audible sound. A user can capture the music in analog form using a
microphone or alligator clips on the speaker wires, then redigitize
it and distribute it to others over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The second, more critical, difficulty is economic: If you are
given the choice between paying $2 for a copy-protected song by a
well-known band that can be played only on certain devices, and a
free, unprotected song by a garage band that can be played on any
device, you may well find the latter choice more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Today, tens of thousands of musicians, amateur and professional,
freely distribute heir music over the Internet. Fee-to-listen music
will have to compete with this free-to-listen music, making it
difficult to charge a high price for copy-protected content.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s much personal computer software was copy protected.
Programs to copy such software were widely available, so copy
protection was not very effective in dealing with piracy. But the
real problem was that copy protection was inconvenient, and
inconvenience offers a major opportunity for competitors. In a
two-year period, Lotus, the leading producer of spreadsheet
software, was forced both to cut its price sharply and to eliminate
copy protection, not because of software pirates but because it was
losing sales to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   These factors suggest that the current business model for music
distribution is unlikely to survive. But this doesn't mean there
will be no music; it just means the business will have to change.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s there was heated debate about the right business
model for broadcast radio. How can you support production of
something that must be given away? A hobbyist magazine even
sponsored a contest in which the winner advocated a tax on vacuum
tubes. In the United States, of course, advertiser support won out.
</P>
<P>
   What made this work was the rise of nationwide networks. You
don't have to make much per listener if you have millions of
listeners. Today, the Internet means that musicians have access to
a global market. The question is how to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Many possible business approaches could be explored. Stephen
King is trying a ``ransom'' model. He has released two chapters of
a book and will release the rest if fans send in enough money.
Metallica, which has sued Napster, could experiment with variations
on the same theme: release 10 seconds of a new song, pledging to
deliver the rest only if listeners send in the required ransom. For
extra motivation, fans who contribute could receive special
treatment _ autographs, coupons for T-shirts, a lottery ticket to
meet the performers, or some other benefit that would encourage
them to contribute rather than get a free ride.
</P>
<P>
   This particular business model sounds unusual, but it isn't all
that different from a subscription. Most readers of this column pay
in advance for a physical copy of a newspaper, even though they
don't know what will be in it. Moreover, much newspaper content is
freely available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry makes money because it controls the
distribution channels and the marketing channels of popular music.
The Internet offers a superior method of distribution, so control
of conventional channels is becoming less valuable. But at the same
time, expertise in marketing music is becoming more valuable. The
more content becomes available, the more important it becomes to
distinguish your content from that of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Today, music companies contract with bands for content that they
then distribute and promote. Perhaps in the future, bands will
distribute their own content, making money from subscriptions, live
performances, and T-shirts, while paying the music companies to
handle marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   From the viewpoint of economic policy, the critical thing is to
set up a legal environment that provides sufficient incentives to
the various parties to create and distribute creative work. There
is no requirement that the law should try to preserve current ways
of conducting business. Indeed, the rewards should go to those
companies, incumbents or entrepreneurs, that take the risk of
experimentation to find the models that fully realize the potential
of new communications technologies. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ When Leonard de Paur became Lincoln Center's director
of community relations in 1970, two things concerned him: the lack
of community participation in the center's activities and the vast,
empty plazas.
</P>
<P>
   As a black conductor who had broken down racial barriers in
music throughout his distinguished career, he was not about to
accept the status quo. In short order, he created a program that
solved both problems and now entertains New Yorkers every summer _
Lincoln Center Out of Doors. The extravagant festival of free
dance, music and theater, this year titled Celebrate Good Times,
starts on Saturday and runs through Aug. 29. The public quickly
responded to de Paur's revolutionary idea, flocking to Lincoln
Center in August to watch both the famous and the unknown local
artists perform under an open sky; attendance now reaches 200,000
every summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festival started as community outreach,'' said Jane Moss,
vice president for programming at Lincoln Center, ``and it's still
strongly connected with New York's communities. Artistic director
Jenneth Webster's achievement is having given it a distinctive
artistic identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster, who has been in charge for nearly 20 years, believes a
chief benefit of the festival is that so many artists are exposed
to one another's work. ``I don't know where else you get so much
variety,'' she said, citing some of the highlights among this
year's more than 100 performances: the celebrated Indian singer Ali
Akbar Khan, a Taiwanese dance performance accompanied by a tea
ceremony and Pauline Oliveros' musical tour of seven ancient
cities, complete with rock bands, soothsayers and Tibetan lamas.
</P>
<P>
   Established choreographers like it for their own reasons. Paul
Taylor compares it to a joyous street fair. David Parsons, whose
troupe performs at the festival for the first time this year, said,
``I'm always after the largest possible public.''
</P>
<P>
   As the city's residents left on their annual vacations early
this month, participants in the festival's dance concerts worked up
a sweat in studios all over town while artistic directors mulled
over repertory and dealt with costumes and music.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they would have it any other way. For many of them,
it's the rare chance to show off their talents to sizable audiences
in a series that boasts both big-name artists like the Paul Taylor
Dance Company and relatively unknown troupes representative of New
York's diverse population.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there is the 25-member Harambee Dance Company
established by Frank W. Molloy III, 35, and his wife, Sandella
Molloy, 33, the artistic director and choreographer, in their
native Charleston, S.C., in 1993. They hoped to share their vision
of African dance with a wide public _ harambee means ``let's pull
together'' in Swahili _ and moved to New York four years ago for
more opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a big, airy studio in Harlem, waiting to begin
rehearsal, the Molloys report that things weren't that simple.
``People expected authentic re-creations,'' Molloy says, ``although
that was never our intention.''
</P>
<P>
   While they both studied dance in Ghana when Molloy was in the
Peace Corps in 1988 and regularly revisit Africa, they're much more
interested in capturing its spirit than in copying specific
movements. ``I add moves from hip-hop and Southern hand clapping
and foot stomping,'' Molloy says. ``We want to show how our way of
life connects with the African.'' Their son, Frank, 8, who drums
along with his father and five others, insists vigorously, ``Well,
it  &UR; does. &LR; '' Purists may wish the Harambee Dance Company duplicated
African dances, but audiences at the city's public schools and
libraries and at the Bronx Zoo are definitely happy with the troupe
as it is. In the last two years, it has put on 51 shows just at the
Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   When the dancers show up, the women in long skirts with vibrant
African patterns, Molloy takes them through exercises that combine
stretching, strengthening _ sit-ups and push-ups _ and a series of
bravura jumps, calling on their backgrounds in a variety of
disciplines. The lead dancer, Vanessa Faye, whose 3-year-old son,
Babacar, races around the studio in time to the drums, specializes
in Senegalese dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use their individual strengths,'' says Molloy, as her group
forms two diagonals, hands on hips, and struts across the floor.
``Don't look like chickens,'' she cautions, joining them in the
dance called ``Harmony,'' swaying to the floor, her arms flowing
around her like water. Then the dancers make a circle, each one
taking a turn in the center. When it comes his time, the only male
dancer, Yahi-I Tafari, dreadlocks flying, jumps in like a lion
attacking prey, the beat driving him on. Soon the floor is shaking
with the pounding of drums and feet. Two hours later they're still
going strong, and promise to do so until their festival appearance
on Aug. 25. (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   In a nondescript office building in midtown, headquarters of
another troupe, the 10-year-old Korean Traditional Performing Arts
Association, dancers and musicians prepare for their festival
appearances on Saturday and Aug. 20 without their director, the
folk musician and dancer Sue Yeon Park, 46, who is in Korea buying
instruments and costume material. The room is small but cheerful,
with gleaming wood floors, and a whole array of elaborate,
hand-painted drums lining one wall. A dancer goes through a bag
full of fierce masks, trying them on for effect. Four of his female
colleagues, in long flowing skirts, diaphanous scarves attached to
their wrists, assemble in the center of the room to begin a section
of a gentle harvest dance, led by the teacher Chang Soo Kim and
accompanied by musicians playing drums, a large gong and a zither.
</P>
<P>
   Following Kim, the dancers curve their arms in arcs as if
gathering rice _ the repertory consists almost solely of works
celebrating agricultural life and ritual Buddhist dances. This
dance is quite unlike the thunderous processional that opens their
outdoor performances. ``Much too loud to practice for a long time
inside,'' says Kim, who explains that it's especially popular with
``the little kids who play the drums,'' many of them Korean
adoptees from Camp Friendship in New Jersey, regular performers
with the 30-member group.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Harambee Dance Company, the Korean association wants
to preserve traditional dances and has found receptive audiences at
schools and at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully and Avery Fisher halls.
``We're not as explicit as Westerners in our expression of feelings
in our music and dance,'' says the dancer Jennifer Yim. ``But if
you take time, you see the beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether seeking to invent a new style or to keep an old one
alive, the overriding mission of these companies is to gain bigger
audiences, not easy in a city as culturally competitive as New
York. What Lincoln Center Out of Doors offers them is the
opportunity to build a following outside their own communities,
which was the goal of de Paur, who died in 1998. Anthony Rodriguez,
25, artistic director of the three-year-old, 20-member La Santa Luz
(Holy Light) Dance Company, dreams especially big. ``I want to do
for Hispanics,'' he says, ``what Alvin Ailey did for
African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   He's rehearsing for his troupe's Aug. 16 performance in a studio
at LaGuardia High School on the West Side, where he teaches, rather
than at the troupe's base at the Police Athletic League in the
Bronx, because his studio there is flooded. He grew up in the Bronx
and studied at the Performing Arts High School and Ballet Hispanico
and, as he got older, danced until dawn in clubs for fun, the
origin of his penchant for house music. Inspired by a deaf sister,
he incorporates sign language into much of his work, calling his
dance style ``todasi,'' a word he coined to mean to dance and to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's outfit _ red headscarf, white T-shirt and mid-calf
black sweat pants _ starts the dancers giggling. ``You look like a
pirate,'' says Marlyn Ortiz, who first danced with him when she was
6 and, like the other members of the company, is familiar with
ballet, tap, flamenco, hip-hop and Latin, modern and African dance.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, he switches on the tape, the hypnotic ``Hyperballad''
sung by the Icelandic pop star Bjork, for the first section of his
``Hyperballet,'' a sensation when the company performed it last
year at the Kit Kat Club, the original venue of ``Cabaret.'' More
recently, the troupe took part in the New York Hip-Hop Theater
Festival at P.S. 122 last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz and the dancer Shane Mercado walk forward, hips swinging,
arms akimbo, only to spring apart suddenly and do back flips in
opposite directions, all to an electric, jazzy rhythm. Then moments
later, the pace slows as Mercado takes Ortiz's hand and pulls her
into a tender embrace. ``Make it sweet,'' Rodriguez requests, not
about to let them leave for at least another hour.
</P>
<P>
   Do they mind spending hot July days holed up in a studio? ``Not
at all,'' Ortiz says. ``Rehearsal feels like coming home.''

   ATLANTA - Transfer records continue to fall. And the staggering
amounts of money being spent on some of the world's most valued
players could play into efforts to abandon the current fee
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Barcelona and Portugal midfielder Luis Figo's
world-record $56.1 million move to Real Madrid on Monday came at a
good time for European Union officials who want to eliminate
transfer-fee regulations for players under contract.
</P>
<P>
   The EU granted unrestricted free-agency to out-of-contract
players in its member nations less than five years ago. Now its aim
is FIFA and UEFA provisions on buyout clauses and other incentives
for players to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But the move by Figo and new Real Madrid president Florentino
Perez prove that money is no object for the world's richest teams.
Figo leaves Barca for its hated soccer and cultural enemy, the
reigning European Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   If the EU has its way, clubs could not impose any buyout clause,
an unsettling prospect, because the European bureaucrats have not
set any formulas for providing compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has plunged the club into even deeper debt than usual, an
estimated $250 million in the hole. Even the sale of French striker
Nicolas Anelka to Paris-St Germain for $31.6 million can't cut into
the deficit. Figo has pledged to play for six years, for
approximately $5.6 million a season, but he signed an extension
with Barcelona only last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona's new president, Joan Gaspart, campaigned to bring
Arsenal midfield tandem Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars. The club
sold Dutch midfielder Boudewijn Zenden to Lazio for $12 million
before Figo's departure.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian Serie A champions from Lazio had set a
world-transfer record two weeks ago when they purchased Argentine
striker Hernan Crespo from Parma for $54 million. Then they bought
his countryman Claudio Lopez from Valencia for another $33 million.
Lazio is loading up for a title defense and for the European
Champions League with more than $100 million in new spending and
isn't finished yet. Lazio also has picked up Inter Milan goalkeeper
Angelo Peruzzi and will get new Italian midfield sensation Stefano
Fiore from Udinese next year.
</P>
<P>
   Their crosstown rivals at AS Roma have spent a bundle as well,
luring Gabriel Batistuta from Fiorentina for $33.8 million. On
Tuesday, they made the long-awaited move of Brazilian midfielder
Emerson from Bayer Leverkusen for a German club-record of $19
million.
</P>
<P>
   France: Paris in spotlight
</P>
<P>
   France might be the World Cup and now the European champions,
but the domestic game has languished. Its top stars ply their trade
in England, Italy and Spain. Le Championnat, which begins anew on
Friday, was won easily by AS Monaco last season. But the club has
unloaded unhappy keeper Fabien Barthez to Manchester United and
sent striker David Trezeguet, to Juventus. Trezeguet scored the
thrilling goal in overtime to beat Italy in the Euro finals. The
center of attention has shifted to the capital, where unheralded
Paris St-Germain is poised to earn only its second crown. The
signing of Anelka, France's only national team regular playing at
home, could push PSG over the top, as long as he doesn't go into
one of his long brooding fits. The midfield of Ali Benarbia and
Jay-Jay Okocha was strengthened by the transfer of Stephane Dalmat
of Marseille.... Monaco added strikers Shaboni Nonda of Rennes and
Xavier Gravelaine and could be among the top four, along with Lyon,
which picked up Cameroonian forward Marc-Vivien Foe from West
Ham.... Marseille, once the dominant French club, barely avoided
relegation after finishing a humiliating 15th. New coach Abel
Braga, late of Vasco da Gama, has been charged with picking up the
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland: Rangers roll unstoppable?
</P>
<P>
   For the 11th time in the last 12 years, the Glasgow Rangers won
the top flight in Scotland. And that trend doesn't appear to be
changing anytime soon. Celtic, their bitter enemies, are reeling
from an inept run last year. American midfielder Claudio Reyna is
back for his second full season, and the addition of Dutch defender
Bert Konterman means that Reyna can go back to his more natural
position. Striker Kenny Miller has arrived from Hibernian, another
indication that it will be virtually impossible to catch the
Rangers. Celtic's fifth boss in the last seven seasons is Martin
O'Neill, formerly of Leicester City. Henrik Larsson of Sweden has
recovered from a broken leg and might team up front with Chris
Sutton, a bust at Chelsea last year. Hibernian and Hearts,
Edinburgh's equivalent to the Rangers-Celtic feud, are the only
other clubs with a chance to be nominally competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Toluca, America favored
</P>
<P>
   Toluca left no doubt about its dominance during the Verano
(summer) championship that ended in June. But Mexico's revolving
door of player transfers could provide more competition when the
Invierno (winter) season starts Saturday. The Red Devils lost
striker Jose Abundis to Atlante but still have lethal Jose Cardozo
up front. Atlante was the worst team in the league last year, but
has gained Carlos Hermosillo and goalkeeper Jorge Campos, in
addition to Abundis.... Club America could not hold on to Mexican
national team striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco any longer, selling him to
Valladolid of the Spanish Primera Liga, but it still has plenty of
firepower. Colombian striker Frankie Oviedo is on board to help
America, the most popular team in Mexico, try to end an 11-year
title drought.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina: River on a rolll
</P>
<P>
   After winning both season titles last year, River Plate has been
able to stave off interest by European clubs in some of its
high-profile players. It is favored to win the Apertura tournament
that begins on Sunday. Strikers Javier Saviola and Juan Pablo Angel
figure to increase their value, especially if midfielder Pablo
Aimar, being targeted by Barcelona, sticks around.... Boca Juniors,
River's Buenos Aires big rival, won the Copa Libertadores but sold
valuable defender Walter Samuel to AS Roma. Striker Martin Palermo
should invigorate the club after a disappointing Clausura
campaign.... Independiente was second to River in the Clausura, but
auctioned off five top players to French, Spanish and Italian
clubs.

   PINEVILLE, Ky. _ Statisticians call Marsha Hendrickson, the
mother of four and a coal miner's daughter, functionally
illiterate. With the national economy bubbling along, soaking up
workers and spreading wealth, she and much of Appalachia live not
only with poverty and unemployment but with the humiliation of
being taken for ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson dropped out of school in the eighth grade, at 15.
Now 28, she reads. On shelves by her television set, she has a set
of dictionaries, two romance novels and a Bible. At the Pic Pac
grocery store, she tallies her purchases as she pushes her cart
through the aisles. But she stumbles on long words, subtraction and
division, and says the lack of skills make her feel inadequate. So
far, they have also contributed to making her unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   At a time that industry is scouring America for workers to keep
it and the economy rolling, children in Kentucky's Appalachian
hills as well as many in urban centers and impoverished stretches
of the South are still dropping out of school at high rates, only
to find themselves unequipped for any but the most menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding the alarm, politicians and advocates for the poor have
begun putting entrenched illiteracy at the root of privation in
places like Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, which economic
growth has largely bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   In his presidential campaign, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
declared illiteracy a ``national emergency,'' a view that his
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has said he shares. To tackle it
under a federal-state program called Even Start, Congress and the
Clinton administration have increased aid to state literacy
projects by nearly 50 percent, to $150 million, in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat, who observes that his
state has the nation's lowest percentage of high school graduates,
is doubling expenditures on literacy programs, like Even Start, to
$34 million over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Across Eastern Kentucky's rural, time-worn cities and towns,
government agencies, foundations and charities have opened
storefront learning centers to coax people to study for the general
education development test, the GED, the equivalent of a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is also tightening enforcement of the law requiring
students to stay in school until at 16, supporting counseling to
discourage dropping out and discouraging social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the functionally illiterate often struggle with all
but the simplest arithmetic, reading a recipe, a map or the words
on the keys of a McDonald's cash register. Often they cannot fill
out a job application, type data into a computer, punctuate a
paragraph, balance a checkbook or take a written test for a
driver's license. (Kentucky lets people take the test orally.) In
time, such difficulties can shred their self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson, a GED student at the Sister Marjorie Learning
Center in Pineville, is one of the people the literacy programs are
trying to reach. Cheerful, well-groomed and a fastidious
housekeeper, she said she had long wanted a job, and she is now
under pressure to find work before she loses her welfare benefits
under the 1996 welfare law.
</P>
<P>
   On her kitchen wall, Hendrickson has hung a certificate
testifying to her completion of a job-readiness program that states
have urged welfare recipients to take as they move off the rolls.
But she remains stymied and stigmatized by the schooling she
missed. ``What hurts me,'' she said, ``is I got no job history.''
</P>
<P>
   In applying for work at McDonald's, she was allowed seven wrong
answers on the restaurant's food-handling test. ``I got eight,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She applied for a telemarketing job, soliciting sales on the
telephone. ``I stayed for one day of training'' and gave up,'' she
said. ``I felt those people watching me. I felt people laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, people trying to earn the high school equivalency
diploma in Kentucky are few. Janet Hoover, a spokeswoman in the
state's Workforce Development Cabinet in Frankfort, Ky., says that
each year the literacy programs are reaching only 5 percent of the
state's 1 million functionally illiterate population.
</P>
<P>
   That illiteracy is linked to poverty, unemployment and
Appalachia's weak economy is hardly a secret. But for decades
politicians attributed the region's poverty to its topography,
isolation and the demise of coal mining. So they cut hundreds of
miles of highways through the hollows and hills to bring in
prosperity and well-paying jobs. But few jobs came, and the most
employable workers used the highways to flee.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey published seven years ago for the Department of
Education, the Educational Testing Service found that more than one
in five adults 16 and older, 40 million people across the United
States, could read and calculate at no better than the lowest of
five levels of literacy, called Level 1.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of those 40 million people are non-English
speaking immigrants. The rest grew up speaking English. Many are
blacks who live in large cities and rural Southern communities.
Several million others live in Appalachia, which is almost entirely
white. The national survey, and one three years ago by the state of
Kentucky, found that about 30 percent of the adults in Appalachian
counties were functionally illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   With the new attention to literacy, groups that serve the poor
are casting doubt on the social programs born in in the 1960s. The
programs fed, clothed, nursed and sheltered a destitute population.
But with the checks continuing until a family's children were
grown, the advocates say, welfare institutionalized illiteracy and
a low standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average job here pays a little over $6'' an hour, said
Richard L. Witherlite, executive director of Interfaith of Bell
County Inc., a church-sponsored agency in Pineville that serves the
poor. ``There's been no boom because there are no jobs. There're no
jobs because people are illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   Witherlite said welfare supplanted coal mines that began closing
and automating in the 1960s. Before that, Witherlite said: ``A boy
could quit school at a young age and make a good living. Then
through the generations kids thought, `Dad made it without an
education, so I can make it.' That was OK as long as the coal mines
were here.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At the Salvation Army in Middlesboro, Capt. Edward Binnix, the
commander, said he no longer helps the poor until they first go
next door to the learning center of the Bell County Council on
Illiteracy for testing. The illiterate need to start thinking about
working on a GED, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people in here who can't fill out a job application,''
Binnix said. ``We get people who don't have a first-grade
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, catching up after years out of school is no easy chore.
``I finished the eighth grade,'' said Darrell Brock, 42, of
Middlesboro. ``Fifteen I was. I thought I knew everything about
everything. I started working, mowing lawns.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock married and went to work for the highway department. He
had two sons, now 11 and 14. But the 11-year-old is handicapped and
uses a wheelchair, he said, and ``my wife died of cancer.'' She was
33. ``I quit my job,'' he said. ``I couldn't find anyone to take
care of my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brock's children will keep their welfare benefits, but with the
changes in the system, he could soon lose his. He said he would
like to get a janitorial job at his boys' school so he could be
around when they needed him. For that, he most likely needs a GED,
and he has not yet been able to pass the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can read,'' Brock said. ``I read the newspaper, the Bible,
magazines, newspapers.'' But math and writing are tough. ``My
weakest area is writing essays. I have to add in all that
punctuation, capitalization.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Bell County, 52 percent of the 24,000 residents 16 and older
have not finished high school or earned an equivalency diploma.
Just 9 percent have a bachelor's or master's degree. Twenty-eight
percent fall into the first level of literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bell County's unemployment rate seems low, at about 5 percent.
But more than half the adults are neither working nor looking for
work, compared with a third of the nation's adults. Some are
disabled, some are in school, some are homemakers, and some are too
illiterate to consider a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployment rate in Kentucky is artificially low,'' said
Ron Couch, director of the state data center at the University of
Louisville. One result, Couch said, is that about a third of Bell
County's households live in poverty, about three times the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're not stupid,'' Wylene Payne said of the county's
residents. Payne is assistant manager of Bell County's Middlesboro
office of the Kentucky Department for Employment Services, where
clients go to great lengths to deny their illiteracy or compensate
for it. A sign at the clerk's window says job applications ``must
be filled out in this office.'' The forms are not allowed to be
taken out because someone other than the applicant could fill them
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, `I don't have my glasses today,''' Payne said.
``I have people drawing their names.''
</P>
<P>
   They memorize the lines of cursive script without learning the
letters.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sitting in the kitchen of her rented, two-bedroom ranch house in
a Middlesboro hollow, Evelyn Muncy, 54, said: ``My mother went to
the fourth grade. My dad was in and out of school and went to the
coal mines when he was 13. But nobody could cheat him with his
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Muncy is doing as her mother did in her 40s and getting a
GED. She keeps a journal, written in pencil, in perfectly legible
script. On the math pages of her GED workbook, she has progressed
from subtracting 0 from 1 to subtracting 648 from 6949.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Zimmerman, 64, has built an arsenal of coping skills. He
was born in Maine and became an orphan at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed up in the mountains,'' sleeping in a cave, he said.
``When I needed clothes, I'd come down and take them off
clotheslines.'' He stole milk and eggs that had been delivered on
back porches. He took to the road. He could not read a map, but he
did not need one. He reads the sun. He settled for a while in
Indio, Calif., and washed windows. He never married or had
children.
</P>
<P>
   Now in Middlesboro, he has earned a GED and is studying at the
learning center so he can go to college. But the years of
illiteracy took a toll. On a job application, he said, ``I could
read the words, but I couldn't comprehend what they meant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love to paint,'' he said. But unable to read labels,
he said: ``I thought I was buying oil paint and bought a whole set

BARAK AND ARAFAT PLEDGE TO CONTINUE TALKS DESPITE BREAKUP AT CAMP
DAVID 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MIDEAST-ASSESS) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat each pledged on
Wednesday to keep working at their halting quest for peace despite
the breakup of the Camp David summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli prime minister and the Palestinian leader both
received homecomings that, while orchestrated events, still
illustrated the difficulties they will continue to face as they try
to forge a compromise on the highly emotional issue of Jerusalem,
which proved to be the sticking point in the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Barak returned to a somber, subdued ceremony at the
airport near Tel Aviv, greeted by his close political allies. As he
was driven up the hilly road to Jerusalem, it was lined with
protesters, many in the knitted skull cap favored by settlers,
holding signs saying: ``Barak You Are Weak,'' in reference to his
willingness to make concessions on Jerusalem to the Palestinians.
But later, he was visibly moved by the throngs of supporters he
found waiting to welcome him at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, by contrast, received a hero's welcome from start to
finish as he arrived in the Gaza Strip _ precisely because he had
refused to compromise on Jerusalem. Looking tired, he was hoisted
up on the shoulders of his supporters, cheered by a crowd of some
5,000 and hailed, according to one of the slogans, as a modern-day
Saladin _ the Moslem warrior who recaptured Jerusalem from the
Crusaders in 1187.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome you home with honor, heroic leader of the
Palestinians,'' read a banner painted on a bedsheet. ``We hail your
heroic stand in not surrendering a single centimeter of Palestinian
land, and in not giving up Jerusalem. You are a great leader of the
Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the initial gloom and finger-pointing over the breakdown
of the summit meeting, there was a sense among both Israelis and
Palestinians that even by attempting to grapple with the previously
taboo subject of Jerusalem, the leaders had moved the peace process
to a new level of seriousness. That they would press on was
implicit in the remarks by both leaders as they returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the small crowd at the airport, ``In your names, in
the names of the millions of eyes still looking, hoping and
praying, I promise not to despair, not to tire, not to stop
pursuing peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in both Alexandria, Egypt, where he stopped en route
home to confer with President Hosni Mubarak, and in Gaza, he told
reporters that ``the American side said they would continue with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an agreement between us and the Israeli government
made in Sharm el-Sheikh that we continue negotiations until Sept.
13, the date for declaring our independent state with Jerusalem as
its capital whether people like it or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the senior Palestinian negotiator, Saab Erekat, said he
hoped to resume negotiations with his Israeli counterpart as early
as Sunday. Erekat has been consistently upbeat following the summit
breakup, declaring that ``prospects for agreement on all permanent
status issues are stronger then at any time in the past nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread Israeli jitters that the breakdown of the
Camp David talks might touch off a new round of violence by
Palestinians, Wednesday passed quietly. The Israeli newspapers have
been carrying reports, citing intelligences sources, that
Palestinians were stocking up food, water, medicine and ammunition
in anticipation of renewed confrontations, and after the Camp David
talks broke up, the Israeli army was put on extra alert.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian officials appeared determined on Wednesday to
avoid clashes. Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian leader in
Jerusalem, urged calm here before traveling to Gaza to greet
Arafat, and a planned march from his headquarters at Orient House
through Saladin Street, the main Arab business district of the
city, was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no violence from us,'' said Nabil Shaath, a
ranking Palestinian official in Gaza. ``Not unless the Israelis
make violence, unless the settlers turn to it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barak arrived at the airport on Wednesday, he appeared
close to tears as he stood stiffly at attention while an army
played the national anthem, ``Hatikva.'' He hugged a line of
waiting supporters, including bereaved parents from the Four
Mothers movement, the first group to urge unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon, and spoke of the journey to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went knowing there is no peace at any price, but that there
is also no peace without a price,'' he said. ``A painful, difficult
and heart-wrenching price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I return from Camp David and look into millions of eyes
in whose name I went and say with a pained heart: we have not
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not succeed because we did not find a partner prepared
to make decisions on all issues,'' he continued. ``We did not
succeed because our Palestinian neighbors have yet to internalize
that in order to obtain true peace, some of one's dreams must be
conceded; one has to give, not only request.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I look today into the eyes of millions in whose name I was
sent and say that we did everything we could,'' Barak said. ``We
turned over every stone, we exhausted every possibility to bring
about an end of the conflict and a safer future for Israel. And we
still hope.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barak arrived at his residence, he was met by a welcoming
rally organized by Peace Now _ across the street from a settler's
protest. In the background, songs were played, including the ``Song
for Peace,'' which Israel's former prime minister, Yitzak Rabin,
sang just before he was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you all for coming here to strengthen us on our way to
peace,'' he said getting out of his car and lingering with the
crowd despite the protests of his bodyguards. He appeared
overwhelmed by the throngs who waved banners praising him, and
joined them in singing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are long distance runners,'' he told the crowd. ``We know
what difficulties lie along the way, we know what it is to run
uphill, we know there are moments when you lose your strength and
you want to toss everything away. But we will not give up.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the Israeli army chief of staff said that he,
too, ``assessed the issue of negotiations has not stopped
entirely.'' While keeping close watch on the Palestinians, he urged
his troops to keep open channels to the Palestinian security forces
that could have ``an important effect on calming the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given guidelines to the forces in the field,'' said
Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, ``to conduct themselves in a responsible and
and restrained manner, with the presence of high-ranking officers
in the field, to prevent mistakes that could cause friction that
could lead to one kind of outburst or another. I hope that this is
also what is happening on the Palestinian side.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the army has distributed additional
weapons, including machine guns and sniper rifles to increase the
arsenals already maintained by the sometimes volatile settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for the settlements themselves to gird their
loins and mobilize as one in carrying out security,'' the commander
of the Samaria Brigade, Col. Yehuda Shaked, wrote in a letter to
the 32 settlements in his district. They would be called for
additional training as communications operators, medics and machine
gunners he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaked also said in his letter that the tiny number of settlers
who had been banned from carrying weapons because of extremist or
criminal behavior shoud now reapply for permits because the
criteria for distributing arms had been eased.
</P>
<P>
   A group of rabbis in the settlements is preparing to issue a
religious ruling on when it is permissible to open fire if
Palestinians march on their homes. Another group of rabbis has
already issued a ruling saying it is permissible to desecrate the
Sabath by shooting at people approaching a settlement, even if one
is not sure of their intentions, because they might cause the death
of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Barak is home, his immediate problem is assembling a
new governing coalition. He now has only a minority of 42 seats in
the 120-member parliament, or Knesset, after the walkout by Shas,
the party of Sephardic Jews , the orthodox National Religious Party
and Natan Sharansky's party of recent Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Knesset is to debate two motions of no
confidence in the prime minister on Monday. One was introduced,
predictably enough, by the opposition Likud party saying his
negotiating position has endangered Israeli interests, including
Jerusalem. The other motion was submitted by the United Arab List
saying he had estranged himself from Palestinian rights.

<P>
   NEW YORK ] Not so long ago the nonprofit Roundabout Theater
Company was performing plays for 150 people in a supermarket
basement on West 26th Street where a scene from Ibsen or Shaw might
well be accompanied by the sound of rolling meat carts rumbling
through the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the company will open its first show _ a revival of
``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' _ in its elegant new 750-seat
theater, the once-crumbling Selwyn on West 42nd Street, transformed
at a cost of $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The showplace was named the American Airlines Theater in
exchange for an $8.5 million payment from American. Patrons who
contribute $1,500 or more to the Roundabout each year can relax
befkre the show over cocktails and Oreo cookies in the Nabisco
lounge (so named in exchange for $500,000). The rest of the
theater's subscribers can catch the sunset from the balcony of the
new penthouse lobby (name still for sale at $1.5 million).
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout, which produces seven shows each season, has
built its subscriber base to 46,000 from 17,000 in 1983 through
customer-friendly programs like wine tastijgs and early-bird
curtain times, and a sophisticated fund-raising operation in which
20 to 30 people work the phones to generate new subscriptions,
renewals and outright contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The theater spent $60,000 last year on lobbying the city and the
state, more than the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which spent
$49,000. When the Selwyn was not finished in time for ``Uncle
Vanya'' to go in as planned last spring, the Roundabout placed the
play in Broadway's Brooks Atkinson Theater at a cost of about $1.5
million, a figure that by itself is more than the annual budget of
most nonprofit theaters. The artistic director, Todd Haimes, earns
an annual salary of $275,000.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the journey of this one nonprofit theater _ from
basement to Broadway, from bankruptcy to becoming the country's
second-largest nonprofit theater with an annual budget of $20
million _ stands as a powerful example of how much the world of
nonprofit theater has changed.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``almost a metaphor for the progress of the not-for-profit
theater,'' said Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln
Center Theater, the largest nonprofit, with a budget of about $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time that the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1971
took its first play to Broadway _ for the past 29 years _ there has
been an evolution that's been marked by the invasion of the
for-profit theater by the not-for-profit theater,'' Gersten
continued. ``I view it as irrevocable, irresistible, inevitable and
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is as enthusiastic about some of the qualities of
the Roundabout's success, epitomized by its new theater in the
heart of the new Times Square. Several commercial producgrs resent
that the theater's productions are eligible for Tony Awards (tley
have won 13) without having the financial burdeos of repaying
investors or paying the labor costs required under Broadway union
contracts. And some nonprofit stalwarts cuggest that, by peddling
naming rights in its theater to corporations and 0erforming
palatable Broadway fare, the Roundabout has sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be an unpredictable, dangerous energy in the
air,'' said Jim Niesen, who worked for the Zoundabout as a stage
manager 20 years ago and left to start his own experimental theater
company, the Irondale Ensemble Project. ``Now it's so
cookie-cutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes, who has led the Roundabout since 1983, makes(no
apologies for his theater's growth. ``As you get bigger, perhaps
you have to leave the highly experimental prkductions behind for
smaller companies to do, and that, I guess, is an institutional
loss,'' he said. ``But I think it's a loss that's far outweighed by
having the resources to do first-class productions of classics and
musicals on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it seems that most of the Roundabout's nonprofit peers
_ and a few commercial ones as well _ appnaud the Roundabout's
success as good for the city and the theater overall. ``The demand
is large enough that they need a Broadway theater,'' said Neil
Pepe, artistic director of the Atlantic Theater Company. ``It's
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Where nonprofit theaters like the Wooster Group and LaMaMa ETC
have emphasized experimental work, the Roundabout has always
defined its mission as staging revivals, often of the classics.
Over |he years, that repertoire has expanded from the works of
Ibsen, Shaw and Strindberg to contemporary work by Arthur Miller,
Brian Friel and Harold Pinter as well as musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have been particularly successful ones for
the company, with the theater winning Tony Awards for ``Anna
Christie'' in 1993, ``She Loves Me'' in 1994, ``A View From the
Bridge'' and ``Cabaret'' in 1998, and ``Little Me'' and ``Side
Man'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's show _ a revival of the Kaufman and Hart comedy
that stars Nathan Lane and Jean Smart under the direction of Jerry
Zaks _ is consistent with the Roundabout's history. And while it
may seem like a safe choice, Haimes said it was actually risky to
do a play with 29 actors (musicals with large casts appeal to more
people and are therefore considered less of a gamble).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Roundabout's defenders say, the company does the
kinds of classics and musicals that Broadway would shy away from,
like Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' and ``Little Me,'' which starred
Martin Short in the role originated by Sid Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the plays they're producing won't be produced in the
commercial theater anymore _ can't be produced according to
producers,'' said Roche Schulfer, executive director of the
nonprofit Goodman Theater, which is about to build a $44 million
theater complex in downtown Chicago. ``When Broadway starts doing
what the Roundabout is doing, then they can say the Roundabout is
becoming crassly commercial. But at this point, I don't see that
happening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While some commercial producers criticize the Roundabout for
becoming too much like Broadway _ Rocco Landesman, president of
Jujamcyn Theaters, recently wrote that Haimes ``has had a more
pernicious influence on English-speaking theater than anyone since
Oliver Cromwell'' _ other producers say they need nonprofits to
take the chances they cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two worlds are irrevocably interconnected and
interdependent and I think for the good,'' said David Richenthal, a
Broadway producer who brought the hit revival of ``Death of a
Salesman'' to Broadway last season from the Goodman. ``I haven't
done a commercial production that doesn't have some nexis with one
or more not-for-profits. I don't see anything noxious about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout has accepted increasingly popular ``enhancement''
money, which is controversial within the nonprofit world.
Enhancement money is contributed to nonprofit productions by
commercial producers who want to test their potential for future
commercial runs. For its production of ``Cabaret,'' Haimes said,
the Roundabout received enhancement money from SFX Theatrical in
exchange for the right to own the tour. ``We wanted that because
the costs were so huge,'' said Haimes, who added that SFX had no
creative role in the show. ``Cabaret'' has cost the Roundabout a
total of $4 million to stage.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer figures that the Roundabout deals in these days could
hardly have been imagined earlier in its troubled life. ``If you
had placed money on the next theater that might fold in the 1980s,
it would have been the Roundabout,'' said Ben Cameron, executive
director of the Theater Communications Group, a support
organization for nonprofit theaters. Founded by Gene Feist in 1965,
the theater declared bankruptcy in 1978 and voted to close down in
1983. It moved from the supermarket, now a Food Emporium, to what
became a movie theater in Chelsea to a former union hall in Union
Square to the Criterion Center on Broadway and 45th Street, where
it first became Tony eligible because of location. It was served
with an eviction notice at the Criterion just as Haimes decided on
the Selwyn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haimes is clearly proud of the progress, he is also
anxious about sustaining the high expectations, he said. ``I think
about how much money this theater has to generate on a weekly basis
to break even,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be about $400,000 per week, according to Ellen
Richard, the Roundabout's managing director since 1984. When Haimes
first came on board in 1983, the break-even figure was $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout raises 25 percent of its budget in contributions.
To build its new theater, Haimes said the Roundabout received $9
million from the city and more than $1 million from the state
</P>
<P>
   ``If our subscriptions went down from 45,000 to 30,000, it would
be devastating,'' Haimes said. His next goal is to build up the
endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said corporate arrangements like his with American
Airlines, which is spread out over 10 years, helped ward off
financial insecurity. ``As long as the corporation is not
interested in affecting the artistic decisions,'' he said, ``I'm
happy to have their name on the lounge or on the building.''
</P>
<P>
   With government money far harder to come by than it was a few
years ago and costs continually rising, arts institutions like the
Roundabout have no choice but to tap new resources, some nonprofit
executives say. ``It's the next logical step,'' Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are those who are troubled by corporate
labeling in nonprofit cultural venues in particular, saying it
creates the appearance that a theater is presenting shows in some
substantial part to serve the commercial purpose of a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many nonprofit and commercial theater
professionals who attribute criticism of the Roundabout to envy.
``It's too easy to point the finger at them; it's motivated by
jealousy,'' said David Herskovits, the artistic director of Target
Margin, an off-Broadway theater company with an annual budget of
$300,000. ``We are all engaged in commerce all the time. We're all
concerned about getting bucks into the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nonprofit executives say, their nonprofit roots have
been romanticized, as if they must continually struggle financially
to remain true to their origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the process of life _ you leave your little one-bedroom
and you buy a house and people say you betrayed the fact that you
were once a hippie,'' said Gordon Edelstein, the artistic director
of A Contemporary Theater (ACT), which recently built a $32 million
complex in Seattle. ``Just as it's our children's job to keep us
honest and to be rebellious, it's the job of smaller, funky
theaters to carry on.''

REMEASURING BERNSTEIN, A MAESTRO FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 30) 
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even those unmoved by Leonard Bernstein's exuberant musicianship
find it impossible to deny his magnetism. As conductor and pianist,
Bernstein energized audiences. His exciting podium presence was the
stuff of legend, and caricature. Yet his enthusiasm for music was
real _ innate, even _ and not merely generated for public
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   With Bernstein's death in 1990, audiences lost a maestro who
could be many things but never boring. A decade on, no one has come
close to replacing him, either on the podium or in the public
imagination. So it is easy to understand why Sony Classical has
opted to ring out the old millennium with a gargantuan series of
midprice CD reissues titled Bernstein Century.
</P>
<P>
   The appellation is too grand on several counts. Although Sony's
vaults (formerly Columbia's, then CBS's) contain a trove of
Bernstein's best recordings, most of his early ones were made for
RCA and his later ones for Deutsche Grammophon. Still, his Columbia
discs represent a signal achievement. Here is America's first
native-born conducting superstar at the very summit of his powers,
driven but not yet mannered, ebullient but not yet self-indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein recorded around 500 works for Columbia from 1950
through the '70s. His only competition in terms of output and
breadth of repertory came from Herbert von Karajan, an Austrian,
and Neville Marriner, an Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Karajan was tied to the Berlin Philharmonic and Marriner
to the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Bernstein was
inextricably linked during this period with the New York
Philharmonic. The orchestra's music director from 1958 through
1969, he made the vast majority of his Columbia albums with the
Philharmonic, which had a relationship with the label dating from
1917.
</P>
<P>
   Sony says that all of Bernstein's Columbia recordings, including
a few items not previously issued, will be released in this series.
To date, 80 Bernstein Century CD's are available: roughly half of
the conductor's Columbia output, according to the label.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bernstein has ever been neglected by Sony. His
recordings appear in various lines, including the large Royal
Edition, with watercolors by the Prince of Wales pointlessly
decorating the albums. Many of the fine 20-bit transfers from that
series have been recycled for this one, which variously employs 20-
and 24-bit technology.
</P>
<P>
   Since much of the Royal Edition remains available, consumers
with an interest in Bernstein face some confusion. Not every title
in Bernstein Century was part of the earlier series, and many items
in the Royal Edition are not yet available in the new format.
Buyers should therefore double- check their collections before
purchasing these CD's.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Bernstein Century gives pride of place to the twin
pillars of the conductor's collaboration with Columbia, Mahler and
American music. Bernstein brought to Mahler lasting public
recognition and to American music the wider audiences sought by his
mentor Serge Koussevitzky. But many of the happiest discoveries in
this collection lie somewhat off the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brahms was hardly unknown territory for Bernstein, the
composer's scores never occupied the Olympian ground he reserved
for Beethoven, there favoring speed and lean textures but also
majesty. In Brahms, Bernstein confounds expectations, upending the
warm approach maestros like Bruno Walter made standard. Bernstein's
recordings from the early to mid-'60s lack that lambency,
substituting pure power instead. If precision is sacrificed in the
process, passion certainly is not: Bernstein's account of the
``Academic Festival Overture'' (SMK 61846), for instance, charges
ahead on more than just celebratory vim. Yet he was never
interested in brute force alone, as the Andante from the Third
Symphony (SMK 61829), filled with aching romance, proves.
</P>
<P>
   A similar melding of muscularity and ardency characterizes
Bernstein's approach to Baroque music, not an area normally
associated with him. In unorthodox, big-boned approaches to Bach's
``St. Matthew Passion'' and Handel's ``Messiah,'' Bernstein's
abundant verve and idiosyncratic spirituality go far toward
mitigating the violence he inflicts on the scores.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Messiah'' (SM2K 60205; two CDs), though grandly conceived
and bursting with ardor, is mercilessly rearranged by Bernstein.
Yet his inclusion of the countertenor Russell Oberlin among the
soloists is inspired and forward-looking. The ``St. Matthew
Passion'' (SM2K 60727; two CDs), rendered in English and severely
cut, proves more problematic. Still, the sextet of committed
soloists, including the soprano Adele Addison (also featured in
``Messiah'') and the mezzo-soprano Betty Allen, is worth hearing. A
16-minute lecture by Bernstein, somewhat perversely tucked in as
filler, offers an intelligent introduction, delivered in the
conductor's inimitably accessible style.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's astonishing ability to convey the meaning of music
through speech was among his main strengths. In a series of public
talks, often televised or filmed, he eloquently and plainly
elucidated for countless Americans, especially the young, the power
of music to enrich. Bernstein Century reveals this talent on a disc
coupling Beethoven's ``Eroica'' Symphony with ``How a Great
Symphony Was Written,'' a 15-minute lecture recorded in 1965 (SMK
60692). In his characteristic nasal, gravelly voice, the conductor
explains Beethoven's genius and the creation of a masterwork in
terms that challenge without alienating the untrained ear.
</P>
<P>
   Getting audiences to feel as he did about music was perhaps at
the core of Bernstein's being, and one senses that generous and
enthusiastic spirit particularly in performances of the bighearted
19th- and 20th-century orchestral works that were central to his
repertory. A 1959 recording of Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Scheherazade''
(SMK 60737), for example, though less supple and refined than
celebrated versions by Thomas Beecham and Fritz Reiner, brims with
tension and color.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a 1960 recording of Tchaikovsky's ``Capriccio
Italien'' (SMK 61556), included as a fillip on a CD dominated by an
indifferent account of the composer's Fourth Symphony, shows
Bernstein at his grandiose best in a piece that benefits from the
theatrics. Though his expansive account of Sibelius' Second
Symphony (SMK 61848) will not be to all tastes, some listeners may
delight in its sanguine embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners of all stripes will be drawn to the recordings of
Mahler and American music that Bernstein Century has so
attractively repackaged. In these scores, the conductor's
interpretive powers reached their summit, and although much has
been written about his extraordinary sympathy for this repertory,
the greatest tribute to his powers as a world-class Mahlerian and
American-music advocate may lie less in praising these outstanding
recordings than in noting what followed in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler was hardly unknown when Bernstein began championing his
music on record in 1960. (Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Dimitri
Mitropoulos and Hermann Scherchen, among others, had recorded
individual symphonies well before then.) But Bernstein was the
first to record all of Mahler's symphonies and a good deal of his
vocal music as well. Since then, most major conductors have
committed Mahler cycles to disc. If anything, we have a surfeit of
Mahler records today.
</P>
<P>
   The situation may be less clear with regard to American music,
which many insist still suffers from neglect. But if Koussevitzky
cleared the path, in concert and on record, then Bernstein paved
the road. Certainly, the conductors Michael Tilson Thomas, Leonard
Slatkin and Gerard Schwarz, the best-known current advocates of
American music, benefited from Bernstein's resoluteness.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Bernstein Century offers a dozen solidly packed CDs
of American music, not counting the eight featuring Bernstein's own
scores. For some, Bernstein's accounts of Copland, Ives, Gershwin,
Barber and William Schuman are not so much benchmark recordings as
holy writ, for the conductor enjoyed deep associations with these
composers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those less familiar with this music should relish two potpourri
discs. In ``American Masters'' (SMK 60594), Bernstein leads three
symphonies feelingly: Roy Harris' searing Third, David Diamond's
glinting Fourth and Randall Thompson's propulsive Third. In
``American Masters,'' Volume 2 (SMK 61849), he indulges in the
raucous pleasures of Walter Piston's ``Incredible Flutist'' and,
with Orson Welles as narrator, he blunts the political cant of Marc
Blitzstein's ``Airborne Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, no discussion of Bernstein is complete without
mentioning his own compositions, works that place the conductor in
a singular category. Like his hero Mahler, Bernstein excelled at
both conducting and composing, but Mahler, who died in 1911, left
no real recorded legacy. Yes, other esteemed conductors also
composed, but how many music lovers today clamor for the symphonies
of Wilhelm Furtwaengler or Jean Martinon?
</P>
<P>
   For all the prejudicial comments leveled at Bernstein's concert
works _ derivative, slight, turgid _ no one disputes the
seriousness with which he approached their composition. That he
left recordings of his own works only enhances our appreciation of
them, for who better than this gifted maestro to interpret the work
of a major American composer, especially if the composer is
himself?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the conductors who were famous in life but left only
faint footprints, Bernstein seems assured of his place in the
collective memory. With this series, Sony has finally done an
indisputably great artist proud. Like the man himself, Bernstein
Century is grandly ambitious, abundantly intelligent and often
intensely moving.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years after helping to win the Persian Gulf
war and liberating the oil fields of Kuwait, former Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney went from fighting for oil to running a
Dallas-based firm that he has helped transform into the world's
largest oil field services company.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive of Halliburton Co. since 1995, Cheney has
been able to rely heavily on the high-level contacts in the Middle
East he made as defense secretary to win business in the roughneck
world of international oil.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as he re-emerges from the business world to become the
running mate of likely Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush, Cheney's corporate experience has made clear the Republican
ticket's roots in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the firm in 1995, Cheney's background as a leader
in the gulf war has seemed tailor made for Halliburton, since much
of its business is done with Arab governments. Almost 70 percent of
Halliburton's nearly $15 billion in annual sales come from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney quickly established himself as Halliburton's outside man,
a globetrotting rainmaker, while his deputy and now successor,
David Lesar, handled internal operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney could go to the Middle East, he had a reputation there,
and most CEO's don't have that,'' said David Gribbin, a longtime
friend of Cheney who now serves as Halliburton's vice president of
government affairs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Adelman, a former Reagan administration official and
longtime Cheney friend, agreed that ``Halliburton played to his
strengths, which were contacts in the Arab world and dealing with
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the value of the company's stock has
fluctuated dramatically. In August 1995, when he arrived, it was
trading at around $21 a share. Within two years, the value had
nearly tripled but more recently has fallen back, closing Wednesday
at 43 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was a surprise choice when he was named chief executive
of Halliburton, since he had virtually no experience in the
business world and had not held a full-time job since leaving the
Pentagon. In 1993 and 1994, Cheney had spent his time giving
speeches, joining corporate boards, and campaigning for Republican
candidates while he decided whether to run for president himself.
</P>
<P>
   But by early 1995, Cheney had decided against a presidential
bid, and began considering his next move. The business world,
largely unknown to Cheney, became ``a more attractive option after
he gave up on running for president,'' recalled Sean O'Keefe, who
served as secretary of the Navy during the Bush administration and
remains close to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity came in the kind of power-networking event that
is so typical in corporate America today: a fly-fishing trip with
Halliburton chairman Thomas Cruikshank, who came away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Cruikshank decided to retire and was disenchanted
with the list of his possible successors drawn up by a Halliburton
search committee, he began pushing Cheney for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was instant backing for Dick when his name was brought
to our attention,'' said Anne Armstrong, former ambassador to
England in the Ford administration and then a member of the
Halliburton board. ``We all wondered why we hadn't thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several friends and business associates said they do not know of
any role former President Bush played in helping Cheney obtain the
post at Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback who was a
member of Halliburton's board at the time of the selection, said
that Cheney's history of heart problems were ``not an issue anyone
worried about,'' although it was ``brought up in passing'' by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed chief executive of Halliburton in August 1995, Cheney
took over a company that analysts said was trying to adapt to big
changes in the oil industry, including a collapse in oil prices in
the late 1990s that dampened exploration.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 employees, Halliburton's main business is
to provide oil producers with the technology and equipment to find,
drill for, and pump oil out of the ground, including everything
from sophisticated computer software that helps locate underground
oil fields to drill bits and pressure pumping systems.
</P>
<P>
   Its customers include the world's largest oil producers as well
as oil-producing nations. It also has large engineering and
construction businesses, and has pursued other lines of business,
such as construction work for the U.S. military abroad, including
logistical support to U.S. forces in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at Halliburton, Cheney has sprinkled the company
with a few longtime, loyal aides.
</P>
<P>
   Gribbin, a high school friend from Wyoming who had worked for
Cheney in Congress and at the Pentagon, is now vice president of
government affairs in Halliburton's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Adm. Joe Lopez, who was Cheney's military aide while he
was secretary of defense, is now chief operating officer of Brown
and Root Services, a Halliburton subsidiary that has government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's most important move at Halliburton was to orchestrate
the 1998 acquisition of one of its largest competitors, Dresser
Industries. Overnight, the merger made Halliburton the largest oil
services firm in the world, moving past France's Schlumberger.
</P>
<P>
   According to Staubach, the company had kicked around the idea of
buying Dresser before Cheney's arrival, but ``he definitely
reignited it. He brought it back as a real opportunity when he was
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dresser deal has received mixed reviews from industry
analysts. The merger took place at time when oil producers,
Halliburton's main customers, were facing declining oil prices and
were trimming their spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had what then seemed to be a brilliant deal with the
merger of Dresser, which made a lot of sense in a lot of ways,''
said Arvind S. Sanger, an industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. But ``the cycle turned down viciously for the oil
services group.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like other big oil companies, Halliburton does business in some
of the roughest parts of the Third World, providing oil services in
the Caspian region in Central Asia, the North Sea, offshore fields
in West Africa, the Middle East, Venezuela, and now Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over the firm, Cheney has sharply increased its
reliance on international operations. Since 1994, the year before
Cheney became chief executive, the percentage of Halliburton's
revenues from domestic operations fell from about 59 percent to
just 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most recent annual report said that it did
business in more than 120 companies; the report did not list all of
the nations, although it noted that Halliburton operated in such
politically unstable nations as Algeria, Angola, Nigeria and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's role as the chief executive of a multinational oil firm
has given him the chance over the past few years to weigh in on
controversial foreign policy issues. At the top of his list has
been ending the use of trade sanctions as a tool of American
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an oil industry conference in Canada last month,
Cheney called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Iran,
</P>
<P>
   He called relations between Iran and the United States a
``tragedy,'' adding that one of the best ways to improve ties with
Iran would be ``to allow American firms to do the same thing that
most other firms around the world are able to do now, and that is
to be active in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kept out of there primarily by our own government, which
has made a decision that U.S. firms should not be allowed to invest
significantly in Iran, and I think that's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Cheney, Halliburton has become one of the leading
corporate members of USA Engage, a lobbying group that seeks to
lift sanctions. Halliburton is also member of the board of the
National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that recently won
a victory in the Supreme Court, which struck down a Massachusetts
state law imposing state-level sanctions on companies doing
business in Myanmar, the former Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's company has already done business in countries still
facing American sanctions, including Libya and Iraq, the enemy
Cheney helped vanquish during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump Co., joint ventures that
Halliburton has sold within the past year, have done work in Iraq
on contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, under
the United Nation's ``oil for food'' program. That program exempts
some Iraqi oil sales from U.N. sanctions as long as the proceeds
are used to pay for food and medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Halliburton's Brown and Root construction services
subsidiary has been the project manager for a massive irrigation
pipeline project in Libya for the government of Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   The work is done through European subsidiaries that were already
operating in Libya when U.S. sanctions were established, and so
were grandfathered in.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Cheney arrived at Halliburton, the firm also settled
a longstanding investigation by the Commerce Department concerning
exports of U.S.-produced oil field equipment to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 1995 consent agreement, Halliburton agreed to pay a
$2.6 million fine for selling oil field equipment through Italy or
Kuwait to Libya without required export licenses, and for selling
U.S. spare parts for logging equipment through Italy to Libya
without proper licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton and other oil service firms have faced consistent
criticism from environmental groups and a wide range of domestic
regulatory issues as well. One environmental issue it is fighting
now is a move to prevent ``hydraulic fracturing,'' a procedure that
opens underground chambers to make it easier to get to oil or
natural gas. An environmental group has been fighting the oil
industry on the matter in Alabama, where it is now tied up in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said that he will take a financial ``bath'' by giving
up his lucrative post at Halliburton to run for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he earned nearly $1.3 million in salary, and
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show
that Cheney owns nearly 1.1 million shares of Halliburton,
including 860,000 options to purchase Halliburton shares at a
reduced price.
</P>
<P>
   The market value of this package is around $43 million, based on
today's stock price of Halliburton shares.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney would get somewhat less than that depending on the
financial terms of the options he holds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 alone, he was granted 300,000 options, which the company
estimated in an SEC filing would be worth between $7.5 million and
$18.9 million, depending on how Halliburton's stock does over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when Halliburton's stock was trading near a 52-week
high, Cheney dipped into his Halliburton holdings and sold 100,000
shares at $50.97 a share, netting him nearly $5.1 million. He sold
the shares just before Halliburton's stock began to tumble to its
current trading range of around $40 a share.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Cheney would earn $181,400 a year.

MARKET PLACE: EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS GAINING GROUND WITH INVESTORS 

</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exchange-traded funds are gaining favor among investors and may
soon evolve into a viable alternative to a broad range of
traditional mutual funds, two new reports predict.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are investment pools that are
similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks, and have been around
since 1993. Perhaps the best known is called the Spider, which
represents the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. But this year
their ranks have swelled to 59 offerings from 30, all of which
trade on the American Stock Exchange. While the stock market
treaded water in the first six months, the assets of the ETF. group
nearly doubled, to $52.6 billion from $35.8 billion, according to
Strategic Insight, a New York fund consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   While that is a speck compared with the $7 trillion mutual fund
industry, Strategic Insight's report and a report from the
Financial Research Corp., a Boston consulting firm, see much growth
from the expected introduction of actively managed versions of the
funds. So far, investors buy a set pool of stocks, either based on
an index or some predetermined industry list.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports see the funds shaping up as a logical area of
expansion for mutual fund companies but less likely to drain money
out of mutual funds than out of individual stock portfolios. ``This
is a real product with distinctive advantages,'' said Avi Nachmany,
president of Strategic Insight. ``Everyone is trying to figure out
how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the only major mutual fund company to enter the
business is the Vanguard Group, of Malvern, Pa. Vanguard, the
nation's largest manager of index mutual funds, recently filed with
regulators to add exchange-traded versions of five of its index
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the actively managed ones, as opposed to the index
products, are going to a more significant degree cannibalize
traditional mutual funds,'' said Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund
industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you can get them at attractive prices,'' he
said, ``trade them and avoid built-in tax liabilities of
traditional funds will cause a significant number of shareholders
to opt out of traditional funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Nachmany predicts that actively managed versions of the funds
will be available in one or two years. A survey of industry experts
by Financial Research sees 2002 as a more likely target, and
forecasts that ETF assets will hit $500 billion to $1 trillion by
2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are actively pursuing the research and development of
actively managed ETF products,'' said Lee T. Kranefuss, an
executive who oversees the funds for Barclays Global Investors, the
Barclays PLC unit that manages index funds for institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange also is ``exploring rather
aggressively'' an actively managed version of the funds, according
to Robert Pendine, a spokesman. ``We're looking at the near term,
the next 18 to 24 months.''
</P>
<P>
   What difference would this make to the average investor? The
Strategic Insight report points out that fees on the traded funds
tend to be lower than on mutual funds, and that they can be traded
throughout the day. The traded funds also forgo much of the taxable
capital gains distributed to investors in mutual funds, though
Nachmany cautions that these tax advantages might come under
scrutiny from the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are three varieties of exchange-traded funds.
Spiders, or Standard &AMP; Poors Depository Receipts, were created by
Amex, a unit of Nasdaq, and State Street Global Advisors. Spiders
are unit investment trusts, which do not have a board and are
prohibited from using futures and options.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays iShares are mutual funds, have boards and can reinvest
dividends more frequently than investment trusts. The third type is
Merrill Lynch's HOLDRs, baskets of stocks that are not tied to a
changing index, but which can be exchanged for the underlying
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the varieties will get more confusing. Barclays has
46 traded funds that track indexes as basic as the S&AMP;P 500 and as
esoteric as a Malaysian index, and it is adding 10 iShare varieties
on Friday.

ROSES WITHOUT BLOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Texas)   By LESLIE LAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have two Queen Elizabeth climbing roses on a west-facing
wall that gets sun all afternoon. The bushes are about five years
old. They have lush foliage but have produced only one flower
between them in all these years. I have cut them back severely. I
have also let them grow. The canes get 12 to 14 feet long, but do
not bloom. I give them rose food in the early spring, hoping that
if I'm good to them they will produce, but no luck.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try a little benign neglect. Climbing Queen Elizabeth blooms
only on old wood, so no matter how long they get, those canes have
to winter over before they will produce their medium pink flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring, as soon as new growth appears, remove any wood
that's obviously dead. A couple of weeks later, go back and cut off
anything that looks sickly, cutting back beyond the point of
weakness and dipping the pruners in alcohol between cuts. Don't cut
anything else. Apply the eats, and stand back.
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLE WITH POPPIES
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live in Houston. For four years I have been trying to grow
annual lettuce-leaf poppies, using seeds from plants that grow on
abandoned lots here and elsewhere around the state. I plant them in
March or April, in wooden containers that provide good drainage.
The soil is rich but light. Each year, the plants sprout rapidly,
grow to about four or five inches, then develop spots on the
leaves, turn pale and die. I have never thinned them out,
preferring to let the process happen naturally. Am I doing
something wrong or is Houston's hellish humidity to blame?
</P>
<P>
   A. Since the wild ones are doing all right in Hades, it's likely
your problem is a combination of rich soil and late planting. Most
poppies, including the P. somniferum you've been collecting, are
adversity fans, they like it lean and cold. They also like a bit of
breathing room. Think of your urge to thin them as a natural one
and indulge it.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that the soil has become heavily infected
with fungus spores. To be on the safe side, empty the containers
and, wearing rubber gloves, wash them with a bleach solution
(one-quarter cup household bleach to each gallon of water). Replace
the soil with a new batch, cutting its richness by adding one part
sand to every three parts soil.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch the soil surface and scatter the seed in November or
December. Press it in firmly but don't cover with extra soil. Baby
plants will be one of your first signs of spring, with flowers
following about 14 weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   OVERWINTERING STRAWBERRIES
</P>
<P>
   Q. My large terra-cotta strawberry jar is flourishing, with
plants producing both berries and runners. Can I winter it over (in
Providence, R.I.) instead of starting fresh next spring? Do I take
the jar indoors, leave it outside, mulch it or what?
</P>
<P>
   A. Freezing won't bother the strawberries, but it could crack
the jar, and mulch won't help unless you bury said jar in a pile
the size of a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   The best storage place is an unheated basement or garage where
it's dark, slightly damp, and cold (35 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit).
The goal is to let the plants go dormant and then keep them that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off all the runners before storing the jar. Over the winter,
water sparingly if at all; the soil should be just moist enough to
prevent total desiccation.
</P>
<P>
   Feed with soluble fertilizer when you set the jar out next
spring, and feed again when blossoms appear. Expect to start over
after the next cycle. By then, the soil will be tired and so will
the plants, which bear most heavily when they are young.

SCIENTISTS UNEARTH ANASAZI ARTIFACTS A STEP AHEAD OF FIREFIGHTERS

<P>
   CORTEZ, Colo. _ Even the darkest clouds have a silver lining,
and Mesa Verde National Park officials are clinging to such
optimism as firefighters struggle to contain a wildfire that has
burned 23,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be redefining what Mesa Verde means,'' the
park's public affairs officer, Will Morris, said. ``We will have to
reconsider the way we approach natural and cultural resources.
There may be a silver lining in archaeological finds to this really
dark cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fire has raced through the park, archaeologists have
scrambled ahead of it, working to identify previously undiscovered
ancient native American sites. By Wednesday, at least a dozen new
ones had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the archaeologists are working just ahead of crews
building fire lines, trying to prevent a false step or stray swing
of a pickax from crushing a bit of antiquity. The scientists fear
that both the flames and the firefighters may destroy vital
artifacts before the fire is tamed. Usually, they have had time
only to mark the sites on a map or in the field. Sometimes, they
help dig fire breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to be doing any kind of extensive
study,'' Linda Towle, Mesa Verde's chief archaeologist, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said they will try to return and study the sites,
hoping they uncover more insight into the lives of early
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde is best known for being home to the largest preserved
Anasazi cliff dwellings in the country, and is the only national
park devoted solely to protecting cultural remains. About 800 years
ago, ancestors of the Apache, Navajo, Hopi and Pueblo tribes,
farmed the land and built their homes in what is now southwestern
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire, which has burned about a third of the park, was 25
percent contained by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and winds the night before helped extinguish some hot
spots, but also made some areas flare up.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the fire, the value of the park and its proximity to
the communities around it have made it a priority, said Justin
Dombrowski, information officer with the Rocky Mountain Incident
Command Team, which is overseeing the operation. Wildfires have
consumed more than 100,000 acres west of the Rocky Mountains this
year, and the season is shaping up to be one of the worst in five
years. Crews, equipment and other resources were stretched so thin
that fire managers will organize and train military crews to help.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the cost of fighting the large fires burning in
the West was $26.3 million, according to the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the 52,000-acre park is surrounded by private land,
Bureau of Land Management areas and the Ute Mountain Ute
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The fire is believed to have started last Thursday after a
lightning strike on private land.
</P>
<P>
   As they work, archaeologists at Mesa Verde are aware that they
have been through this at least once before. After a 5,000-acre
fire in 1996, archaeologists discovered 400 previously unknown
archaeological sites to add to 4,000 known sites.
</P>
<P>
   Those sites provide more insight into the lives of the early
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned they were controlling water more than we thought,
and that they were here for a lot longer time than we thought,''
said Julie Bell, an archaeologist at the park.
</P>
<P>
   They also have discovered that the area might have been more
populated than previously thought. For example, Battleship Rock, a
significant petroglyph (rock drawings) site was largely burned in
1996. But with the surrounding brush and trees gone, archaeologists
found evidence of a larger community around the rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mesa Verde is famous for its cliff dwellings _ Cliff Palace,
Balcony House _ and that's only one small part of it,'' Bell said.
``Those were built in the last 100 years of 800 years of
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Four more cliff dwellings were found after the 1996 fires, but
they were small storage units, not as impressive as the large
apartment structures. Archaeologists also found earlier homes _
pithouses that were built in holes, remnants of stonewalls and one
wall that was about four-feet tall, and ancient trash piles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' Bell said of the post-fire
discoveries. ``The fire will uncover a lot of more sites, but the
after effects of the fire are going to threaten all of the sites
because if we don't have the vegetation to stop the water, runoff
erosion is going to be a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was one of 18 archaeologists who worked ahead of fire crews
this week, trying to avoid potentially important sites as they dug
fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   As thunderstorms rolled in Wednesday afternoon, again providing
a chance for cooler temperatures and more humidity, talk turned to
when the park might reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next process and goal is to open the park,'' said Larry
Wiese, the park superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   And although it appeared by late Wednesday that the park's crown
jewel cliff dwellings would not be touched by the fire, experts
said the resources were invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our living legacy for many, many generations to
come,'' a park archaeologist, Faith Duncan, said with a backdrop of
a ceremonial kiva and charred hills beyond. ``I look at it as an
American thing so we can show the rest of the world about
preservation and caring for a finite resource.''

CAMP DAVID: FRESH FOCUS ON THE PRICE OF PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the inconclusive conclusion of the Camp David
summit meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may
not have won a peace agreement, but he did win the presidential
award for best camper. President Clinton concluded the meeting by
asserting that Barak was more creative, flexible and determined to
reach a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in the event that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, is compelled to fulfill his pledge to declare a state in
September, he may find himself with less international sympathy and
financial aid than he may have hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   If that creates new pressure on Arafat, then this would be a
canny achievement for Barak, who pushed for the meeting, which
Arafat considered premature.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Arafat has been the peripatetic Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman, traveling from capital to capital in pursuit
of legitimacy and backing. During the rightist Israeli
administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he found
particular success, especially in nurturing a relationship with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During those three years, Israel developed the taint of a
somewhat outlaw state for not climbing aboard the peace platform,
or at least not with proper enthusiasm and good intentions. While
Palestinians perceived that the Americans were always on Israel's
side first, Arafat made considerable headway in tugging the gorilla
superpower closer to his viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak took office a year ago, he immediately took to the
skies himself, assiduously working to tilt world opinion back
toward Israel. He courted the English, the Germans, the French, but
especially the Americans. It was last July that he spent his first
late night chatting at Camp David with Clinton, scouting out the
retreat to which he fully intended to return as a peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, his advisers say, he believes that he capped his
mission to make Israel seem the more reasonable party in the peace
effort, perhaps even bolstering Israel's strategic ties with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting consciously mimicked the Israeli-Egyptian one
that took place 22 years ago at Camp David. Then, the Israelis and
the Egyptians defied all expectations by emerging with the first
Israeli-Arab peace agreement. With that perspective, some thought
that the unthinkable could happen this time, too, that the Israelis
and the Palestinians could really sort it all out.
</P>
<P>
   But everything in this seven-year incremental process has taken
time, inching forward and slipping back. And maybe, in the best of
lights, however long it takes to get back to the negotiating table,
Camp David will have served well the cause of peace. Maybe both
sides needed to walk away empty-handed in order to set the stage
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   During this Camp David meeting, for the first time, ordinary
Israelis and Palestinians focused on what might be the price of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the previously taboo idea of reconstituting _ that
is, dividing _ Jerusalem got a full airing. Barak, who as Clinton
noted is the most decorated soldier in Israeli history, gave his
``Mr. Security'' persona a full workout.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of making peace to ensure Israel's security, he
entertained a sizable transfer of West Bank territory (from 88 to
95 percent), the evacuation of settlements, a land swap, a small
resettlement plan for Palestinian refugees and the ceding of some
Jerusalem neighborhoods to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   This was a rapid-fire, neck-swiveling adjustment in the Israeli
boundaries of acceptable compromise. It was not enough for the
Palestinians, but it probably went to the absolute limits of what
Israeli public opinion could stomach. And judging by the polls
during the summit meeting, they were stomaching it, and maybe
months down the road their capacity for absorbing compromises could
expand further.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what Barak was willing to do, Arafat probably lost
ground in the eyes of the Americans and his relative standing in
the eyes of the European nations that have been bankrolling the
development of a Palestinian infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But with his domestic support at a low, Arafat needed a big win
at home and in the Arab world, and he secured one. ``Arafat was
depicted perhaps as the bad boy of the talks, but his people will
increase their backing for him,'' Zohir Andreas, editor of an
Israeli Arabic weekly, wrote Wednesday. ``Arafat was not ready for
there to be a Palestinian uprising against himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Having never prepared public opinion for any concessions on
refugee rights or East Jerusalem, Arafat would not have been on
solid ground in making sudden shifts.
</P>
<P>
   But it would have been a real shock for the Palestinians if,
after all his unyielding statements, he succumbed in one sitting to
American and Israeli pressure to abandon his demands for the
Palestinian refugees' right of return and to accept less than full
sovereignty over East Jerusalem. As far as most Palestinians are
concerned, having conceded the land that is now Israel, they have
no wiggle room left. East Jerusalem is part of their national soul,
and the refugees are family.
</P>
<P>
   Now Arafat has the time to try to alter this perception. It is
believed that despite what he tells his people, he may be willing
to make some concessions on the refugee issue, provided that
international compensation and resettlement relieve him of the
burden of absorbing most of the refugees into the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Would he be willing to acknowledge this, if it is true?
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult to imagine Arafat as accepting limited
sovereignty in East Jerusalem, even as better than nothing. But
perhaps he could change his mind to consider deferring resolution
of the contested city's status, and find a way to secure Arab
backing for that decision.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way to interpret hopefully the failure at Camp
David. It assumes that talks will eventually resume. But the
Israeli prime minister is politically weak, the American president
is retiring, and the Palestinian leader is not getting any younger.
</P>
<P>
   The failure not only heartens the anti-peace camps in both
Israeli and the Palestinian world, but raises a question that even
doves will ask themselves: Is the peace process all process? Is
peace itself attainable or just a goal post at the end of a path
that will keep getting longer?

ADVERTISING: BEHIND LEVI'S NEW CAMPAIGN, HOPEFUL HAND-WRINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems appropriate that an ambitious new campaign for Levi's
jeans carries the theme ``Make them your own'' because the ads are
most likely a make-or-break effort for the maker of the campaign,
if not also for the maker of the jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar campaign, which begins this week, is the
most recent in a series of multimedia blitzes for the jeans maker,
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., by the San Francisco office of TBWA/Chiat/Day,
the agency that was rocked last week by the loss of its large Taco
Bell creative assignment. The initial efforts can be seen in a
52-page supplement to the August issue of Vogue magazine and on the
Web site www.levi.com.
</P>
<P>
   The previous campaigns for Levi's jeans from TBWA/Chiat/Day have
generally been dismissed as lacking in appeal to consumers 18 to
24, the core audience being courted so desperately by Levi Strauss
to return as customers. The weakness of the campaigns to date _
does anyone remember ``Opt. For the original,'' ``Calvin wore
them'' or ``Our models can beat up your models''? _ has been
exacerbated by the failure of Levi Strauss to produce apparel in
styles popular with younger shoppers. For example, so-called hard
jeans languished unsold on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a serious slump in Levi Strauss sales, down
6.4 percent in the quarter ended on May 28 compared with sales in
the period a year earlier. In 1999, sales tumbled to $5.1 billion,
down 28.2 percent from a peak of $7.1 billion as recently as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the caliber of the work will be a heck of a lot higher
than where it has been,'' said Chuck McBride, executive creative
director at TWBA/Chiat/Day San Francisco, part of the TBWA
Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. He was interviewed on Tuesday
by telephone from London, where he was working on additional
commercials for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the relationship between Levi
Strauss and the agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day San Francisco was on the
verge of being dismissed until McBride, using the agency's own
money, produced on his own a batch of commercials to demonstrate
how the ``Make them your own'' theme would work.
</P>
<P>
   McBride demurred at a suggestion that his unconventional tactic
had saved the account for TBWA/Chiat/Day. He offered two words with
a laugh, ``The beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this brand needed was to hold still and do some great
work that would be consistent over time, so kids could sit down and
say: `Oh, so that's what it means to wear Levi's jeans,''' McBride
said, ``which I don't think a lot of young people necessarily
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposition has really lit a fire under the
organization,'' he added, referring to the new theme.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was echoed by Sean Dee, brand marketing director
for Levi's at Levi Strauss in San Francisco, who joined McBride for
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now got our chance to leverage the brand over time,''
Dee said. ``It's not about the company, but the people who wear the
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not about everybody being the same,'' he added,
taking a veiled dig at recent campaigns carrying the theme
``Everybody in . . .'' from a major competitor, Gap Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to be associated with brands that let them be
themselves,'' Dee said, ``so they can say `I can embrace them and
make them my own.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference is that we actually can now back up any
brand claims with the right products,'' he added. ``If you don't
hit that, it's just advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial television commercial in the campaign, titled
``Dressing Room,'' was shot on videotape, for a more realistic
look, by Spike Jonze, the hot young director of music videos and
movies. The spot resembles a voyeur's dream come to life:
Attractive young male and female models try on Levi's in front of a
dressing room mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big challenge is to have things resonate with young people
but not alienate the 25-plus crowd,'' the traditional buyers of
Levi's jeans, Dee said. Tests showed that ``the work we've done
with Spike is unbelievably appealing to older consumers,'' he
added, as well as their younger counterparts. At least two other
commercials are planned, one for Levi's corduroys and the other for
Levi's 569 jeans.
</P>
<P>
   McBride's unusual save-the-account initiative also included the
production of offbeat commercials for a new product, known as
Levi's Engineered Jeans. The four spots manipulate still
photographs to produce an effect similar to strobe lights,
borrowing a technique used in performances by the Icelandic
musicians known as GusGus.
</P>
<P>
   Can the venerable Levi's brand be reinvigorated by the campaign?
Dee was sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy job,'' he said, ``but yes, we think we can do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, kids don't like Levi's,'' he added. ``They were more like
`Levi's are pretty cool but haven't done much for me lately.' This
is a great opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he and McBride might join the Taco Bell Chihuahua in
wearing signs that proclaim ``Will Work for Food.''

<P>
   GONESSE, France _ The Concorde that crashed into a hotel near
Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris on Tuesday, setting off a
fireball and killing 113 people, had been delayed from taking off
by last-minute repairs to the engine that burst into flames,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials investigating the crash said they had not yet linked
the repairs to the crash. But on Tuesday they said that the engine
that caught fire as the supersonic jet began its takeoff, more than
an hour behind schedule, was the No. 2 engine.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday Air France officials said in a statement that
ground crews had unsuccessfully searched for spare parts for the
No. 2 engine and eventually repaired it with parts taken from
another Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   According to Elisabeth Senot, who is in charge of the judicial
investigation into the crash, it was the control tower that first
warned the captain that one of his engines was on fire, 56 seconds
after takeoff. In this scenario, the cockpit alarm system had not
given the pilot any warning.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot
refused to confirm Senot's account that the control tower was the
first to alert the pilot of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   According to Senot, the pilot tried to direct the jet to the
smaller Le Bourget Airport nearby for an emergency landing. But the
airliner, unable to gain altitude, banked heavily to the left and
then slammed into a small wooden hotel here surrounded by fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can say that we are looking at a technical problem
here and can put aside notions of sabotage of any kind,'' Senot
said. She said she based her account on a preliminary review of the
information in the plane's ``black boxes,'' which record details of
the flight and have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, roads leading to the crash site, about nine miles
northeast of Paris, were cordoned off by the police as workers
combed the singed fields, trying to identify bodies and locate
debris from the plane that could provide clues to the cause of the
crash. Everyone on board, mostly German tourists heading to New
York to board a luxury cruise, was killed. Four people in the hotel
also were killed and 12 others on the ground were injured, one
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Wreathes of flowers, placed by mourners, were laid around the
area. Bits of wreckage were scattered far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Christianne Turpin, the owner of a Shell station 500 yards down
the road, had one blackened chunk tucked behind her cash register.
She said she had found it by her diesel pump. Turpin said she had
owned the gas station for 23 years and had never worried before
about being near an airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you I'm thinking about it now,'' she said. ``It
will be on my mind every day from now on. I don't think it will
ever go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France continued the indefinite grounding of its elegant,
needle-nosed jets, planes often used by celebrities willing to pay
about $11,000 to cross the Atlantic in 3 1/2 hours, half the time
of other commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, however, British Airways _ the only other airline to
fly Concordes _ resumed its normal service Wednesday after getting
preliminary information from crash investigators in France and
conducting extensive technical checks of the fleet's engines,
hydraulic systems and airframes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is no technical, safety or operational
evidence to suggest that Concorde should not operate safely in the
future,'' said Mike Fleet, a spokesman for British Air.
</P>
<P>
   But not all passengers were eager to get on the planes. Bill
Boster, a CNBC executive, told The Associated Press that he had
exchanged his ticket for a ride on a slower plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have total confidence in the engineers and the pilot of this
Concorde, but I just can't face it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air France, in its statement, described a series of events
before the crash that led to the delay of flight AF4590. The
statement said that the pilot who landed the plane in Paris on
Monday reported that the jet's reverse thrusters, used to brake the
plane, were not functioning.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that according to ``technical tolerance
authorized by the manufacturers'' the plane could have taken off
without being repaired. Under Federal Aviation Administration
regulations, which applied since the plane's intended destination
on Tuesday was New York, the Concorde had to be capable of landing
without thrust reversers in order to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But when the situation was reported to the plane's captain,
Christian Marty, he decided that he wanted the repairs made. At
that point, a replacement part for the plane was obtained from a
spare Concorde and installed within about 30 minutes. The plane was
also delayed by baggage handling problems, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not say whether the repairs could have been connected
to the crash, which occurred within minutes of the jet's 4:31 p.m.
takeoff.

</P>
<P>
   The crash was a particular blow to French pride. The Concorde,
developed by the French and British in the 1960s, was the world's
first supersonic passenger jet in regular service. In more than 20
years of commercial flying, however uneconomical and however noisy,
a Concorde had never crashed.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac joined grieving victims for an
emotional memorial service in Gonesse late in the day. Families and
friends of the passengers, many of whom were retirees, wept and
held hands during the 30-minute service. Scores of townspeople also
gathered outside the service to show their support.
</P>
<P>
   At Charles de Gaulle Airport, Air France closed off a passenger
terminal usually used for charter flights to make bereavement
counseling available to the victim's friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also attended a service
and said his nation was in shock over the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape televised on France's LCI news station, apparently
shot by a Spanish truck driver, showed that the left side of the
plane was engulfed in flames long before it even hit the ground.
But witnesses said they heard a series of explosions after the
crash and a huge plume of black smoke rose into the air.
</P>
<P>
   One of guests in the 40-room hotel, the Hotelissimo, managed to
escape with minor injuries by jumping from her first floor window.
</P>
<P>
   The guest, Alice Brookings, 21, a British student, said she
heard a noise growing louder and louder and then felt the whole
building shake as the plane hit the back side of the hotel. When
she opened her door, flames leapt into the room. The only way out
was the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very lucky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, inspectors had found tiny cracks in more than
half of the 13 Concordes in service in both the French and the
British fleets. But the airline has already ruled out any link
between the crash and those cracks.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said they had opened at least two
investigations into the crash _ one the equivalent of a criminal
investigation, another the official accident investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At a late afternoon news conference, Gayssot said that officials
had not finished examining the plane's black boxes and would not
release any details until Thursday. But like Senot, he said the
investigation was focusing on the engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the news conference, Pierre Graff, the director general
of civil aviation, warned that the conclusions of the technical
investigation might not bear out the account given by Senot.
</P>
<P>
   Gayssot also said he wanted a series of meetings and technical
consultations before he would put the French Concordes back in
service. But he said the planes were far from ready for the scrap
heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Concorde represents the technology of the future and of
modernity,'' he said. ``Supersonic technology is still the
technology of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six of the passengers on board the Concorde were from
Germany _ 13 from the town of Moenchengladbach, on the border with
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The flight had been chartered by a German tour operator to take
the passengers to New York to join a 15-day cruise to the
Caribbean, through the Panama Canal and on to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   There were also two Danes, one Austrian and one American. The
American was a retired Air France employee, but the company has not
yet released a name. The victims on the ground included two Polish
employees of the hotel, a British tourist and a French woman.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, authorities said they had recovered 105 bodies
from the site. But they said identifying them would be a long and
difficult process.

 &HT;    Cheney known as take charge typeBy Gary Susswein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ During Dick Cheney's four years as Secretary of
Defense, the lifelong civilian made it clear to his military
subordinates that he was in charge of the armed forces and his word
would rule.
</P>
<P>
   When he wanted it to.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the Wyoming Republican running for vice
president with Gov. George W. Bush left military matters up to the
military and allowed generals and admirals under his command to
work out policies.
</P>
<P>
   As public attention focuses on Cheney's record as Secretary of
Defense from 1989 to 1993, colleagues and Pentagon observers paint
a picture of a even-keeled and detail-oriented manager who helped
guide the American success in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture becomes less clear and sometimes-contradictory
when it comes to how much control Cheney exerted in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The same man who fired the Air Force chief of staff as one of
his first moves and told General Colin Powell to butt out of policy
decisions also visited military bases and met with soldiers far
less than other defense secretaries and left some decisions about
military downsizing to politicians and generals.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, voters are likely to judge Cheney on the
United States' overwhelming victory in the Gulf War, rather than
his management style. ``The most important measure for any
secretary of defense is whether he succeeds in the ultimate test,''
said Edwin Dorn, dean of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public
Affairs and an Undersecretary of Defense under President Clinton.
``The war that Cheney had to preside over was the Gulf War and the
U.S. forces were wonderfully successful at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were obviously prepared and you have to credit the
civilian and military leaders for that,'' Dorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees on the amount of credit Cheney deserves. For
example, Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense
under President Reagan, suggests that the Gulf War success came as
much from the Reagan-era military buildup as from Cheney's skills.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is widely credited for convincing Saudi Arabia to allow
American ground troops and war planes in their country, vital
elements to the U.S victory. He also lobbied within the Bush
Administration for a large military operation.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney took over at the Pentagon after former President Bush's
first choice for the job, former Texas Sen. John Tower, failed to
receive Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, Cheney fired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch for
privately negotiating with Congress to update the Air Forces'
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly did that merely to show he was in charge,'' Dorn
said. ``Larry was doing what every service chief does. Cheney knew
that, but he, I believe, wanted to send a message to the
services.''
</P>
<P>
   That message was understood by the time the United States
mobilized for the Gulf War. When Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, questioned the policy of going to war, Cheney
privately told him to ``stick to military matters,'' according to
Powell's 1995 memoir.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Cheney was showing that he could be a
team-player and reach consensus with other foreign policy leaders _
including Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a respect for each other that allowed them and us,
their assistants, to accomplish a lot,'' said Texas A&AMP;M chancellor
and retired-three star general Howard D. Graves, who was Powell's
assistant from 1989 to 1991. ``In times of conflict like the Gulf
War . . . there are immediate issues at hand so there's a sense of
immediate urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Gulf War, Cheney deferred to Congress on efforts to
increase the role of women in the armed forces and deferred to
military leaders, who opposed gays in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   With the Soviet threat gone, American officials also were
figuring out how to downsize the military. Cheney personally
cancelled a $57 million naval weapons program and oversaw 25
percent cuts in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-time backer of a large military took the lead from
Congress in developing incentives for soldiers to retire early. And
he let Powell decide how much each branch of the military should be
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let the military control how the downsizing went,'' said
Korb, the Reagan-era assistant secretary of defense, who now works
at the New York-based Center for Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   At least one old soldier interviewed Wednesday said that was a
wise move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deferred to the military in their judgement,'' said Paul
Braim, a retired army colonel and professor emeritus of military
history at Embry-Riddle University in Florida, ``but he was the man
in charge.''

CHENEY RECORD &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    Democrats tried to strip Republican vice presidential contender
<TEXT>
Dick Cheney of his moderate image Wednesday by launching an assault
on his congressional voting record _ a record Cheney defended as
one of which he is ``generally proud.''
<P>
   But Cheney also admitted there were votes he would ``tweak'' if
he had them to do over again.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush dismissed the
criticism of Cheney: ``I'm not surprised. To try to belittle the
pick _ typical.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic presidential contender Al Gore avoided
personally attacking Cheney's record, he stood beside the Rev.
Jesse Jackson in Chicago as Jackson warned that Cheney's moderate
image is undercut by the votes he cast while representing Wyoming
in the U.S. House from 1979 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney has an image that is palatable,'' Jackson said.
``Jesus warned us to be aware of wolves in sheep's clothing.''.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before members of his Rainbow/Push Coalition, Jackson
specifically cited Cheney's opposition to a resolution backing the
release of South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela from
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also noted that Cheney had voted to cut funding for the
Head Start children's nutrition program, against the Equal Rights
Amendment and against economic sanctions against South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's criticism was clearly encouraged by the Gore campaign
and underscored their belief that Bush's choice of Cheney will
accomplish something that the Democratic candidate has been unable
to do so far: energize his base voters of women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that Cheney's conservative record will convince
these voters that Bush is not as moderate as his rhetoric has led
some voters to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a brief reference to Bush's vice presidential pick,
suggesting that his rival was still relying on advice from his
father's generation. Cheney served as Defense secretary under
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be absolutely no doubt that when the American people
go to the polls this November they will be choosing between two
very different visions for our people,'' Gore said. ``It is a
choice between the Old Guard that gave us deficits, divisions and
social injustice and a new vision of prosperity and progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also warned the mostly minority crowd that Republicans will
be attempting to show that they are an inclusive party at their
national convention that convenes July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have concocted a strategy of phrases and photo
opportunities to convey the impression of inclusion and
moderation,'' Gore said. ``I expect even more of it when the
Republicans gather in Philadelphia next week. I bet it's going to
be quite a show.''
</P>
<P>
   For their first joint appearance since Cheney was named as
Bush's running mate, the pair returned to Cheney's hometown of
Casper, Wyo., for a rally at his alma mater, Natrona County High
School.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief news conference on the tarmac at the local
airport, Bush and Cheney defended the running mate's voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously thought about the record,'' Bush said. ``This is a
conservative man. So am I. The thing that distinguishes Dick Cheney
is he can get along with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who served in the administration of Bush's father and
also served as President Ford's chief of staff, has considerably
more government experience than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks volumes that I'm willing to pick somebody who is as
strong a man as he is, that I am comfortable having excellence by
my side,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he was ``generally proud'' of his voting record. But
he declined to answer questions on specific votes, saying he would
have to review the circumstances of each vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if I were to go back and look at individual votes I
could probably find something I might tweak and do a bit
differently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes voted against bills because they increased federal
spending in a time of budget deficits, he said. He also voted
against economic sanctions against South Africa, he said, because
he opposes the concept of unilateral economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   To questions about whether the Bush-Cheney ticket is a ``big
oil'' ticket, Cheney said he is proud of his work with the
Halliburton Co., an international oil-field services firm based in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any need to apologize for the way I've spent my
time over the last five years as the CEO and chairman of a major
American corporation,`` Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Texas governor and a former oil man, said the attack is an
attempt to ``divert attention away from the fact they have no
energy policy'' in the administration of President Clinton and Vice
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As to questions about his health, Cheney said he has released
information from his cardiologist that says he is in good health
despite three heart attacks and bypass surgery more than a decade
ago. He said he has no plans to release any more medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer referenced Cheney's heart while
introducing him to a crowd of 1,200 in the high school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have Vice President Cheney with his heart than
President Gore with no backbone,'' said Geringer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the crowd that he and Cheney were westerners. And then
he poked at Clinton's denial that he had a sexual relationship with
an intern named Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is a place where people understand what the meaning
of the word is is,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, this campaign is not just about campaigning,''
Bush said. ``It's about leading America.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was the class president in 1959 and his wife, Lynne, was
the homecoming queen. Cheney, who lives in Dallas, reclaimed his
Wyoming heritage last Friday by switching his voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   Calling their campaign a ``crusade,'' Cheney said victory is
essential to restoring pride in government to the American people.

 &HT;    Georgia's GOP's Senate pick uncertain
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Republican struggle to settle on a U.S. Senate
candidate continued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And while the field narrowed among possible candidates from
Congress, other Georgia Republicans appeared to be interested,
including state school Superintendent Linda Schrenko.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's eight congressional Republicans met for the second day
Wednesday afternoon without publicly announcing a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of the three most prominent choices, Rep. Saxby
Chambliss of Moultrie, said Wednesday he will not run for the
unexpired term of Sen. Paul Coverdell, who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss announced his decision not to run on a tape-recorded
telephone answering machine message for all who called his Georgia
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can do more for my state and country working for
the 8th District,'' he said. ``And I'm not about to walk away from
the district I cherish and the job I love.''
</P>
<P>
   A special election to fill the remaining four years of
Coverdell's term is scheduled for Nov. 7. Former Gov. Zell Miller
will be sworn in at 11 a.m. today to temporarily fill the seat to
which he was appointed Monday by Gov. Roy Barnes. Miller plans to
seek election to the remainder of the term. Reps. Bob Barr and Jack
Kingston were said to be considering a challenge to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders had feared House seats held by Chambliss and other
Georgia Republicans could become vulnerable to Democrats if they
stepped down to run for the Senate, thus jeopardizing the
Republicans' slim five-seat House majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgians also must weigh leaving reasonably safe House
seats to run against a heavily favored Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Schrenko said Wednesday she is seriously
considering a run. National Republican leaders have encouraged her,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Zell Miller, and he's always been good to me,''
Schrenko said. ``But I believe Paul Coverdell would have wanted
that seat to stay Republican. I think Paul would literally roll
over in his grave'' if his seat changes party without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenko's stature increased last week as her vocal opposition
to Barnes' education reform plan, and her work against those who
supported it, helped unseat three legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Others discussed if the congressmen opt out are former Sen. Mack
Mattingly, state Sen. Sonny Perdue, former state Sens. David
Ralston and Clay Land, House Minority Leader Bob Irvin and state
party Chairman Chuck Clay.
</P>
<P>
   A decision must come within days, state GOP leaders acknowledge.
Candidate qualifying for the race will open Wednesday, but
Republicans leave at the end of this week for their national
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly like to go to Philadelphia with a pretty
good candidate in tow,'' said Clay. ``We need to get that person up
there and showcase'' him to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans continue to assess their options today, Miller
will take his seat in the Senate, fulfilling a boyhood dream. But
as he departed Atlanta on Wednesday, Miller said he did so with no
great anticipation. ``I just wish that it were Paul Coverdell
getting on this plane instead of me,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will take the oath of office from Senate President Pro
Tem Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) in a ceremony shown live on C-SPAN 2.
Miller is expected to address the Senate briefly.
</P>

   CORTEZ, Colo. _ Even the darkest clouds have a silver lining,
and Mesa Verde National Park officials are clinging to such
optimism as firefighters struggle to contain a wildfire that has
burned 23,000 acres in and near the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be redefining what Mesa Verde means,'' the
park's public affairs officer, Will Morris, said. ``We will have to
reconsider the way we approach natural and cultural resources.
There may be a silver lining in archaeological finds to this really
dark cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fire has raced through the park, archaeologists have
scrambled ahead of it, working to identify previously undiscovered
ancient native American sites. By Wednesday, at least a dozen new
ones had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the archaeologists are working just ahead of crews
building fire lines, trying to prevent a false step or stray swing
of a pickax from crushing a bit of antiquity. The scientists fear
that both the flames and the firefighters may destroy artifacts
before the fire is tamed. Usually, they have had time only to mark
the sites on a map or in the field. Sometimes, they help dig fire
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to be doing any kind of extensive
study,'' Linda Towle, Mesa Verde's chief archaeologist, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said they will try to return and study the sites,
hoping they uncover more insight into the lives of early
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde is best known for being home to the largest preserved
Anasazi cliff dwellings in the country, and is the only national
park devoted solely to protecting cultural remains. About 800 years
ago, ancestors of the Apache, Navajo, Hopi and Pueblo tribes,
farmed the land and built their homes in what is now southwestern
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire, which has burned about a third of the park, was 25
percent contained by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and winds the night before helped extinguish some hot
spots, but also made some areas flare up.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the fire, the value of the park and its proximity to
the communities around it have made it a priority, said Justin
Dombrowski, information officer with the Rocky Mountain Incident
Command Team, which is overseeing the operation. Wildfires have
consumed more than 100,000 acres west of the Rocky Mountains this
year, and the season is shaping up to be one of the worst in five
years. Crews, equipment and other resources were stretched so thin
that fire managers will organize and train military crews to help.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the cost of fighting the large fires burning in
the West was $26.3 million, according to the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the 52,000-acre park is surrounded by private land,
Bureau of Land Management areas and the Ute Mountain Ute
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The fire is believed to have started last Thursday after a
lightning strike on private land.
</P>
<P>
   As they work, archaeologists at Mesa Verde are aware that they
have been through this at least once before. After a 5,000-acre
fire in 1996, archaeologists discovered 400 previously unknown
archaeological sites to add to 4,000 known sites.
</P>
<P>
   Those sites provide more insight into the lives of the early
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned they were controlling water more than we thought,
and that they were here for a lot longer time than we thought,''
said Julie Bell, an archaeologist at the park.
</P>
<P>
   They also have discovered that the area might have been more
populated than previously thought. For example, Battleship Rock, a
significant petroglyph (rock drawings) site was largely burned in
1996. But with the surrounding brush and trees gone, archaeologists
found evidence of a larger community around the rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mesa Verde is famous for its cliff dwellings _ Cliff Palace,
Balcony House _ and that's only one small part of it,'' Bell said.
``Those were built in the last 100 years of 800 years of
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Four more cliff dwellings were found after the 1996 fires, but
they were small storage units, not as impressive as the large
apartment structures. Archaeologists also found earlier homes _
pithouses that were built in holes, remnants of stonewalls and one
wall that was about four-feet tall, and ancient trash piles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' Bell said of the post-fire
discoveries. ``The fire will uncover a lot of more sites, but the
after effects of the fire are going to threaten all of the sites
because if we don't have the vegetation to stop the water, runoff
erosion is going to be a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was one of 18 archaeologists who worked ahead of fire crews
this week, trying to avoid potentially important sites as they dug
fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   As thunderstorms rolled in Wednesday afternoon, again providing
a chance for cooler temperatures and more humidity, talk turned to
when the park might reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next process and goal is to open the park,'' said Larry
Wiese, the park superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   And although it appeared by late Wednesday that the park's crown
jewel cliff dwellings would not be touched by the fire, experts
said the resources were invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our living legacy for many, many generations to
come,'' a park archaeologist, Faith Duncan, said with a backdrop of
a ceremonial kiva and charred hills beyond. ``I look at it as an
American thing so we can show the rest of the world about
preservation and caring for a finite resource.''

OVER THE YEARS, CHENEY OPPOSED U.S. SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his early years as a White House official
and member of the House, Dick Cheney, the expected Republican vice
presidential candidate, consistently opposed unilateral U.S.
sanctions against nations including Iran, Cuba and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, as the chief executive of the Halliburton Co., an
energy services company that is in the top 100 U.S. concerns in
revenues, Cheney became a lobbyist for lifting most sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to ``my favorite hobbyhorse, the question of
unilateral sanctions,'' Cheney argued in a 1998 speech that ``they
almost never work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to find specific examples where they actually
achieve a policy objective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a new official in the Ford White House in 1974, Cheney saw
the U.S. government, under pressure from Congress, impose sanctions
against Turkey over Cyprus. The action came not because it made
sense from a policy standpoint, Cheney said, but ``because the
Greek-American lobby was significantly bigger and more effective''
than its Turkish-American counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, while serving in the House, Cheney twice voted
to oppose sanctions against the apartheid government of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, as Congress moved twice to increase sanctions
against Cuba, Cheney said, he would have preferred setting up a
West Berlin-type enclave of democracy and free enterprise at the
U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney did back the multilateral sanctions against Iraq
after the Persian Gulf war, which were aimed at curbing Iraq's
production of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   After he became chief executive of Halliburton, Cheney joined
other members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and pro-trade groups
under the rubric of USA Engage. The lobby led a failing effort to
block the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, which bars American
investment in those oil-rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government has become sanctions-happy,'' Cheney said in
his 1998 speech.

SHOWDOWN LIKELY AS VETO LOOMS OVER GOP MARRIAGE TAX BILL &HT;

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton pledged Wednesday to veto a
Republican tax cut for married couples, fueling an election year
showdown over projected surpluses in the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused Republicans of playing political games with a
bill to eliminate the so-called ``marriage penalty'' in the tax
code that requires dual-income couples filing jointly to pay more
than they would if they filed singly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Congress approved a measure that would provide $90
billion in tax relief to married couples over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the plan as too costly and tilted to the wealthy,
Clinton demanded that Republican leaders send the bill, and any
other tax cut proposals, to the White House immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Congress adjourns for an August recess at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the bill and other Republican tax cut proposals
``too big, too reckless, too irresponsible'' and suggested that the
money would be better spent on prescription drug benefits for
Medicare patients and investments in education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the congressional Republicans truly think these tax cuts
are good policy, instead of just good politics, they should put
them together and send them down to me right now.'' he said. ``Then
the American people can add up the costs and draw their own
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said Clinton would get the marriage tax bill
within the next two days, in time to veto it by the beginning of
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to hold onto another already-approved measure, a
bill to repeal the federal estate tax over the next decade, until
Congress returns at the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Facing an all-but-guaranteed presidential veto, GOP leaders
warned that a quick rejection will only give them more time to drum
up support to override the veto and vote the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that between now and when we come back in September
many of those who voted against this bill will be convinced to come
back and vote for a veto override,'' said House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   With government analysts estimating surpluses of more than $2
trillion in the next 10 years, the fight over the marriage tax cut
foreshadows an all-out battle over projected federal budget
surpluses as both parties gear up for the fall general election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want to spend the extra cash on government programs,
while Republicans argue that the savings should go toward tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has really run out of excuses. He can't make the
argument with a straight face that marriage penalty relief for
couples making $35,000 each is a tax break for the rich,'' said
Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who pushed for the bill's passage
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a $2 trillion non-Social Security surplus, how can he be
thinking of vetoing marriage penalty relief for hard-working
American families?'' Hutchison asked.

<SLUG> BC-MUSIC-BLUEGRASS-MONROE-$ADV30-NYT </SLUG>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By TONY SCHERMAN    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   So closely is
the late Bill Monroe identified with his musical creation,
bluegrass, that it's almost as if man and music called each other
into being. The notion of a pre-Monroe bluegrass obviously makes no
sense, yet it's almost as hard to imagine a pre-bluegrass Monroe.
What? Without his big white Stetson? Without the Blue Grass Boys,
deployed in their immutable formula of guitar, banjo, fiddle and
bass?
<TEXT>
<P>
   So to bluegrass fans who haven't probed country-music history _
indeed, to anyone aware of Monroe's stature as one of America's few
founders of a musical genre _ the newly issued CD ``What Would You
Give in Exchange for Your Soul?'' (Rounder 1073) packs a powerful
surprise. The first in an eventual four-CD series, it contains 15
of the 60 songs Bill Monroe recorded as the mandolinist, harmony
vocalist and junior partner in the Monroe Brothers, a red-hot duo
that scorched the Carolinas in the mid-'30s. In 1936, Bill, 25, and
his lead-singing, guitar-picking brother Charlie, 33, released
their first record, the song that gives this CD its name. ``What
Would You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?'' became one of the
biggest country-music hits of the '30s, popular throughout the
South. A decade before he presided over the birth of bluegrass,
Bill Monroe was already a star.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a few anthologies have offered tantalizing
glimpses of the Monroe Brothers, and a two-LP set, long extinct,
came out in 1975. For the most part, the Monroes' music has
remained a rumor, unavailable in the United States. When Rounder's
collection is fully released _ the remaining CDs will appear this
fall and next year _ one of the high points of early country music
will no longer be a secret.
</P>
<P>
   The '30s ushered in a new kind of hillbilly recording artist
(until about 1950, country music was known by the disparaging
near-epithet ``hillbilly.'' Unlike their forebears _ casual pickers
for whom record-making had been a lark _ the new breed were
full-time, self-proclaimed entertainers, young, polished and
ambitious. Steeped in tradition, they were also impatient with it.
Members of the first generation to grow up on radio and records,
they were eager to incorporate the sounds of modernity, of jazz
bands and smooth pop crooners, into their music.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie and Bill Monroe's sound matched their beautifully
tailored suits; a streamlined whoosh, it brought intimations of
big-city speed and excitement to their rural audiences. The
Monroes' relationship to country music parallels that of Bill's
exact contemporary Robert Johnson, with his self-aware
professionalism, supercharged technique and nervous intensity, to
the blues of the Mississippi Delta. Like Johnson, the Monroe
Brothers prodded a rural idiom out of a sleepy past into a
hardboiled, hopped-up present.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bill and Charlie came to record, they had kicked
around plenty. Native Kentuckians, they had busted their backs in
an oil refinery outside Chicago and barnstormed the Midwest with
their brother Birch, who left the group in 1934. Heading south in
1935, Bill and Charlie worked the North Carolina-South Carolina
line; radio performers by day, by night they rode the bad roads to
schoolhouses, churches, town halls: any place big enough to hold a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Big Charlie was the frontman, a gregarious crowd pleaser, but it
was the sounds Bill wrenched from his mandolin _ an absurdly
unlikely vehicle for heroics _ that distinguished the Monroes from
every other hillbilly act. Before Bill Monroe, the mandolin was an
inessential instrument in country music, a prop you gave the singer
so he could do something with his hands. Out of sheer stubbornness
and, as it happened, something like genius, Monroe invented
something like a language for it, made it a blistering solo
instrument. Moving his pick rapidly up and down across the strings,
he was able to play double- and quadruple-time runs, and when the
tempo was as fast to begin with as it was on ``Watermelon Hangin'
on That Vine'' or ``New River Train,'' Bill's 16th-note runs drove
people half-wild, made them jump out of their seats, throw their
hats in the air, stamp their shoes, holler like crazy fools.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie used the pick-strum style he'd no doubt learned from
Carter Family records, but Maybelle Carter never played this fast.
Charlie Monroe must have been a powerful man, to whip his right
wrist up and down on the strings as speedily and relentlessly as he
did yet with enough finesse to pick out lickety-split little bass
runs. The first Monroe Brothers song I ever heard (the title
escapes me) was one of the fast ones. As the guitar-mandolin intro
came on, I grumbled to myself: somebody had sped up the turntable
(yes, this was back in the LP days). But in came the voices,
relaxed and resonant. Nobody had fooled with the turntable; this
was merely a case of next-to-impossible musicianship. To this day,
whenever I feel like laughing out loud with the giddy pleasure of
hearing something ridiculously difficult pulled off with nonchalant
aplomb, I listen to the Monroe Brothers playing fast.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill and Charlie weren't merely speedsters. When the Monroe
Brothers played religious songs, which they considered their stock
in trade, they slowed the tempo way down, shifting the emphasis to
their closely harmonizing voices. ``What Would You Give in Exchange
for Your Soul?'' was slow and bone-sparse; unflashily played, it
sails aloft on the brothers' voices _ Bill's especially, an eerie
falsetto moan.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Monroe's voice and the Monroe Brothers' music in general
have a bluesiness, a kinship with Southern black musical feeling,
that's plainly audible in most early country music. While the
Monroes are at their bluesiest in religious tunes _ a song like
``Do You Call That Religion?'' wouldn't have been out of place in a
black prayer meeting _ their entire sound has a strong blues
component. If I had to characterize the Monroes' music, I'd call it
hillbilly soul: Southern white music deeply in touch with the black
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Charlie went their separate professional ways in 1938,
but during their four short years together, they must have been
something to see. ``The Monroe Brothers blow away anything Bill
ever did on his own,'' said the guitarist and musicologist John
Fahey recently. That's hyperbole, although it shows just how
excited people still get over this music. Here's how I'd put it.
Bill Monroe died in 1996, world-famous and full of honors. If,
perish the thought, he'd died in 1938, he would still have affected
the course of country music.

ARAFAT ARRIVES HOME TO HERO'S WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ As Yasser Arafat returned to this
hardscrabble territory, he was given a hero's welcome on Wednesday
for holding fast at Camp David to Palestinian demands that Israel
surrender sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was hoisted onto supporters' shoulders and hailed by
thousands waving flags and banners and carrying his portrait. It
was a rare moment of adulation for Arafat, whose popularity has
been eroded by the hardships and corruption that have been
hallmarks of life under the rule of his Palestinian Authority in
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   At Gaza airport and again outside his headquarters in Gaza City,
the 70-year-old Palestinian leader responded, despite evident
fatigue, by clambering atop the roof of his armored Mercedes
limousine and raising his fingers in a victory salute.
</P>
<P>
   One of many banners outside El Montada, the handsome stone
building overlooking the Mediterranean in Gaza City where Arafat
has his headquarters, put the matter squarely. ``We welcome you
home with honor,'' it said. ``We hail your heroic stand in not
surrendering a single centimeter of Palestinian land, and in not
giving up Jerusalem. You are a great leader of the Palestinian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As frenzied as it was, the welcome appeared to involve only a
tiny fraction of the one million Palestinians living in Gaza. It
also appeared to have been carefully orchestrated by the Fatah
movement, Arafat's faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   A similar story unfolded on the West Bank, where a rally in
support of Arafat in the town of Ramallah attracted only 200
people. One reason for the small crowd was that Arafat's plane
landed at the height of the working day. But many Palestinians
appear deeply disillusioned with their leader for failing to
deliver better living conditions in the six years since the
Palestinian Authority assumed responsibility for most of Gaza from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But from the voices among the 5,000 people at the airport, and
amid the tumult of a similarly-sized gathering at the Gaza
headquarters, it seemed that Arafat had done the only thing he
could in holding out for all of the Old City of Jerusalem, which
contains ancient sites sacred to Arabs, Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age boys, Muslim clerics, middle-aged shopkeepers,
policewomen, small children scampering cheerfully through police
security lines of comic-opera efficiency, all were of a single
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never give up any part of Jerusalem, never'' said
Eyad Daoud, a 17-year-old high school student.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-year-old official working in Arafat's religious affairs
ministry, Abdul Fattah, stood back serenely from the hubbub in the
city, a model of clerical propriety in a gold-trimmed robe and a
loose white hood. ``All Arabs, and all Muslims, need Jerusalem, and
acknowledge it as the Palestinians' rightful capital,'' he said.
``If the world wants peace, Eest Jerusalem must return to the
Palestinians. There is no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the welcome appeared to endorse Arafat's rejection
of the compromise urged by President Clinton, involving limited
Israeli concessions to Palestinian autonomy in the eastern parts of
the city as part of an overall peace settlement. It would also have
allowed the return to Israel of a few thousand of the more than
three million Palestinian refugees dispersed around the region.
</P>
<P>
   But things on this sun-scorched day were not necessarily quite
as appearances suggested.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Arafat emphasized during a brief stop at
Alexandria for talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak,
and again in remarks at Gaza airport, that he was still hopeful of
resuming negotiations with Israel before the Sept. 13 deadline he
has set for unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The date, a possible trigger for renewed violence between
Israelis and Palestinians, is the anniversary of the signing of the
Oslo accords in 1993 on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the unlikelihood of Barak or any other Israeli
leader coming forward within the next seven weeks with sweeping
concessions on Jerusalem, Arafat's eagerness for negotiations
suggested that he, at least, has not ruled out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility would be the one raised at Camp David, under
which the thorny issue of Jerusalem's status would be deferred
while other issues, including the West Bank and Palestinian
statehood, are settled.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, Arafat is sticking to the position he
took at the peace talks: there can be no final peace, nor even an
interim settlement, without Israel conceding sovereignty over East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is not only for the Palestinians, it is for the Arab
nation, for Muslims everywhere, for Christians,'' he told reporters
at the airport. He added, ``Jerusalem is the capital of the
Palestinian state, like it or not. Whoever does not like it, let
him go and drink from the sea.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Part of Israel's calculation in negotiating with Arafat has been
that Palestinians might be willing to trade their historic links
with Jerusalem for a quick transition to full statehood,
international aid and more relaxed ties with Israel. American
officials have said Clinton dangled the prospect of generous
Western aid in the closing hours of the Camp David summit, only for
the Palestinian leader to remain immovable on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hubbub on Wednesday, there may be a sizable
proportion of Palestinians who are not willing to wait another
generation or more for the benefits of peace, even if a compromise
on Jerusalem is part of the price.
</P>
<P>
   One long-term Gaza resident said that, at age 35, he could wait
no longer for the benefits of a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this posturing brings us nothing, or less than nothing,''
he said. ``What do we have to show for six years of Palestinian
autonomy here? No jobs, terrible shortages of electricity and
water, bad schools, bad hospitals, bad everything _ worse even than
when the Israelis were here. And now we say, 'Jerusalem or
nothing.' It's a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one point of agreement among the Palestinians, it
was that the events in Camp David should not be the signal for
renewed violence, and especially not of a ``second intifada'', or
uprising, like the one that caused widespread mayhem in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat implied as much by speaking of the hope of resuming
negotiations, and one of his chief lieutenants, Nabeel Shath, who
accompanied the Palestinian leader to Camp David, made it explicit.
``There will be no violence from the Palestinians, not unless
Israel makes violence, or the settlers turn to it,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some young Palestinians have spoken menacingly of a resumption
of attacks by Hamas, the radical Islamic group that engaged in a
terror campaign in the mid-1990s. But Palestinian analysts say
Arafat's Fatah group has largely emasculated Hamas by arresting or
exiling many of its leading figures. In any case, Israeli military
officials have said that they have alerted army and police units to
be especially vigilant in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   In the circumstances, Arafat and his associates in the
Palestinian leadership seem set on making the best of what, after
years of working toward unchallenged Palestinian statehood, has
unarguably been a setback. Shath, the senior Arafat aide who
participated in the Camp David talks, said that despite the
appearance of failure, the Palestinians had left Camp David
convinced that they had achieved a major breakthrough simply by
getting the Israelis and the Americans to concentrate on Jerusalem
as the main obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not disappointed,'' he said. ``The talks were very
useful, very important, because all the issues that have been taboo
all these years _ above all, Jerusalem _ are now on the table.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Ford Motor Co. has decided to increase the average
fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the
next five years, people involved in the company's plans said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, amounting to roughly five miles per gallon, would
be the first significant change in the fuel economy of any class of
passenger vehicle in almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is convinced that Americans want to buy more fuel-efficient
vehicles and will steer their purchases to companies they perceive
as environmentally responsible, the people said. The company's new
stance is also a response to environmental concerns about the
automobile's role in global warming.
</P>
<P>
   At least at first, the company does not intend to pass the extra
cost of producing more fuel-efficient vehicles directly to American
customers, two people familiar with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker is betting instead that improved fuel economy will
increase sales more than enough to offset lower profits on each
vehicle. Better gas mileage and lower operating costs for Ford
sport utilities could eventually increase demand enough to allow
the company to sell them with fewer rebates, and possibly even
raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives hope that the more fuel-efficient sport
utilities will give all of their brands an image of environmental
responsibility, people familiar with the company's plans said. That
could help sales of the company's cars, minivans and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Ford _ which sells 800,000 sport utilities a year,
representing about a fifth of its total domestic sales _ is a sharp
reversal. The company started and led the decade-long trend toward
sport utility vehicles, the biggest of which consume more than
twice as much gasoline a mile as the average car. The Ford
Excursion is the world's largest sport utility, getting 10 miles to
the gallon in the city and 13 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to improve mileage comes even as recent efforts in
Congress to mandate an increase in fuel economy have failed, partly
because of lobbying by Ford and other automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mileage improvement will be achieved through changes
to Ford's larger sport utilities: the Ford Explorer, Expedition and
Excursion, the Mercury Mountaineer, the Lincoln Navigator and the
Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Ford engineers say that there are many small steps that they can
take to improve fuel economy, from making auto parts lighter to
adjusting engines. But lighter auto parts are usually more
expensive, because they need to be made from aluminum instead of
steel, while engine design alterations must be made with great care
to avoid reducing vehicles' towing capacity. Ford executives
declined to estimate the cost of these changes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the improvement in Ford's average fuel economy will come
from the introduction in September of the Ford Escape, which is
slightly smaller than the Ford Explorer and uses a lightweight car
underbody instead of a heavy, pickup-truck underbody. With a
four-cylinder engine, the Escape gets up to 28 miles a gallon on
the highway
</P>
<P>
   Ford will not achieve its fuel-economy improvement by taking
advantage of either of the loopholes that it and others have used
in recent years: building vehicles like the Excursion to be so
large that they are excluded from the federal averages, and
building vehicles that qualify for alternative-fuel mileage
credits. The Excursion will be counted as Ford pursues its 25
percent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are building huge
numbers of minivans, pickup trucks and midsize cars that can burn
either gasoline or nearly pure ethanol. These vehicles are counted
in the averages as though they have triple their actual milage,
even though only 100 of the nation's 170,000 service stations sell
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, is scheduled to fly to
Washington on Thursday to announce the company's decision at the
National Press Club, people involved in the company's plans said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler and GM, Ford's main rivals in the sport utility
market, declined to comment on Ford's move, saying only that some
of their models were already fuel-efficient. Detroit automakers,
including Ford, have said in the past that improved mileage for
sport utilities will require sacrifices in engine power and vehicle
size that American consumers will not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler have a quarter each of the sport
utility market. Foreign automakers divide up the remaining share.
</P>
<P>
   GM has just finished improving the gas mileage of its full-size
sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks by 5 percent over the last
three years by completely redesigning them for the first time in a
decade. But GM and other automakers have not improved their
fuel-economy averages, increasing the power, size, and gas
consumption of some models even as others have become more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Ford voluntarily cleaned up its sport utility vehicles' tailpipe
emissions two years ago to make them as clean as cars' emissions.
While the cost has approached $100 a vehicle, and while many rivals
have not yet followed suit, Ford officials say that decision has
been a selling point.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman since the start of last
year and a great-grandson of Henry Ford, is an outspoken
environmentalist who has called for the auto industry to address
global warming. At the company's annual meeting two months ago in
Atlanta, he acknowledged the environmental and safety drawbacks of
sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few small signs in Washington that federal
fuel-economy standards, little changed since the mid-1980s, might
be reconsidered next year. But there is no indication that the
government will require nearly as big an improvement as Ford is
planning. Nasser intends to present the plan as an example of how
the auto industry can improve fuel economy voluntarily and will not
call for tighter federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are required to sell cars with an average fuel
economy of 27.5 miles a gallon and so-called light trucks with an
average fuel economy of 20.7 miles a gallon. Sport utilities, vans
and pickup trucks are all counted as light trucks and now represent
half of the American auto market, partly because manufacturers have
switched production away from cars as low gasoline prices and a
strong economy in the 1990s produced a soaring demand for large but
gas-guzzling vehicles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Ford has barely met the regulatory averages, and its
sport utilities have done especially badly _ balanced by more
efficient minivans and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton raised the fuel-economy standard for sport
utilities, minivans and pickup trucks by two-tenths of a mile per
gallon in 1993 and 1994, to 20.7 miles per gallon. When Republicans
took control of the House and Senate in 1995, they began amending
the federal budget each year to prevent the Transportation
Department from spending any money to study the issue or tighten
standards. Each annual budget since then has included the same
prohibition, but support for the provision has dwindled as light
trucks have increased as a share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   High gasoline prices prompted an effort this spring by Western
senators, whose constituents drive long distances, and by
environmentalists, to overturn the ban. Under a recent Senate
compromise, the freeze on fuel-economy standards will remain for
another year while the National Academy of Sciences reviews federal
fuel-economy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., a member of the House
Appropriations Committee, has blocked fuel-economy changes on the
House side. His chief of staff, Paul Welday, said that Ford's
latest move was a good one if it helped sell sport utility
vehicles, but would strengthen those who wanted tighter standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the Beltway, it will only fuel the fires of those who
believe that if Ford can do that, everybody else should be forced
to do that,'' Welday said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Becker, the energy policy director at the Sierra Club,
said environmentalists would use Ford's decision in their lobbying.
``This shows that the people who say you can't make cars cleaner
and more fuel-efficient are wrong,'' he said. ``This shows that a
company that wants to improve fuel economy can do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials believe that they can improve mileage while
maintaining the safety of their vehicles' occupants. Occupants of
lightweight, subcompact cars tend to fare poorly in collisions. But
a variety of recent studies have found that vehicles weighing 3,000
to 3,500 pounds _ the weight of a midsized or large car _ tend to
be very safe; further weight provides only a little additional
safety for the occupants, while tremendously increasing the risk to
other motorists during collisions. Ford's current sport utilities
weigh from 3,700 pounds for a two-wheel-drive Explorer to 7,200
pounds for an Excursion with four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser's plans have provoked some nervousness within Ford that
the automaker may be limiting its ability to respond if gas prices
fall or if consumers begin demanding even more powerful vehicles.
``There is a lot of struggle within the company over whether this
is the right number and the right time frame,'' a person involved
in the plan said. &QL;

 &HT;    Concorde crash victim looked to retire in Florida
 &HT;    By Michael Coren
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The lone American aboard the Concorde that
crashed Tuesday was on his last flight to the United States before
he planned to retire in Vero Beach, Fla., his sister said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic jet that had carried Chris Behrens, 64, an
employee of Air France, around the world four times also carried
him to his death when the Air France jet he was on crashed in
Gonesse, France, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was coming to New York,'' said his sister Therese
Fredericks, 75, who has lived with her husband, John, in Vero Beach
for four years, when she found out about the crash while watching
TV. ``And I knew there was only one American on board. It had to be
him,'' she said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks anticipated Behrens returning to the Vero Beach area
and settling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved Vero,'' she said. Fredericks' daughter, Joy, who also
recently died, was a real estate agent in Vero Beach and had
arranged for him to buy a house in the area, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the deal fell through,'' she said. ``I think he was still
dreaming of living in Vero.''
</P>
<P>
   He vacationed on the Treasure Coast frequently, making trips to
the beach to go swimming and touring the mall, she said. Behrens'
most recent visit to Vero Beach was less than a month ago when he
attended the funeral of his niece, who died of a brain aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to comfort me,'' Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, who was fluent in both French and German, lived in
Frankfurt and had worked for Air France ``for many years,'' said
his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always liked flying,'' Fredericks said. She described her
brother as a young boy in love with planes while growing up in
Annandale, N.J. His fascination with jets eventually drew him to
the fastest one of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He completely loved the Concorde,'' she said about his
favorite jet. The 185-ton aircraft cruises faster than the speed of
sound at 1,350 mph, by the far the fastest commercial airliner in
existence. The 12 Concordes still operating are used by British
Airways and Air France almost exclusively to carry passengers
between New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had many friends,'' she said pointing to one of the photos
of him adorning her wall. ``And as you can see, very good looking.
He was very kind, very generous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks said she was close to her brother who always came to
``visit his favorite sister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born on my birthday.''

AN ACCIDENTAL ICON OF AMERICAN POP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio)   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By PHILIP NOBEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Of all the things that roll down
American highways, few are as strange and perfect as the Airstream,
the RV for the Atomic Age. Produced since 1952 at a factory in
Jackson Center, Ohio, the cylindrical, self-contained Airstream
``land yacht'' has become a middle-American answer to luxury on the
high seas. By the 1960s, the distinctive trailers were available in
a range of models, from the little bubble of the 18-foot Bambi to
the 30-foot Sovereign Double, an airship for the road. At one time
or another, every corner of the country, much of the world, and
countless envious gawkers have been reflected in the Airstream's
shining aluminum skin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The popular interest in Airstreams is such that Airstreamers, as
the owners call themselves, have cooked up a term _ ``trailer
tappers'' _ to describe those who buttonhole them on their travels.
But what do the curious ask when they knock on the door? Does it
get hot in there? What happens when it hails? Maybe they want to
poke around inside to see the nautical details, the berths, the
ship's galley, the marine toilet, the portholes. Do they ask who
designed it? Probably not; that would be like asking who designed
the Interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Airstream has led a quiet life, loved by the
cult of its owners who gather by the thousands to park in radiating
``wagon wheels'' at annual rallies or who caravan in comfort to
hardscrabble destinations. The caravan tradition began with the the
inventor of the Airstream and the company's founder, Wally Byam,
who led Airstreams on dozens of goodwill missions overseas,
including a 34,000-mile trip through Asia and Europe in 1964.
Following Byam's lead, Airstream owners _ weekenders, retirees and
a core of ``full-timers'' _ have continued this quirky community,
carrying on as a kind of folk tradition well outside the public
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   At the most recent rally, near Bismarck, N.D., this month, 2,000
Airstreams gathered under the auspices of the Wally Byam Caravan
Club International. Since the 1980s, Airstream has only produced
what purists call ``squarestreams,'' blunt but still shiny
approximations of the old models. At the Bismarck rally, most of
the trailers were these clunkier, post-streamlined designs, but the
presence of a devoted minority of classic Airstream enthusiasts,
members of the rival Vintage Airstream Club, attests to the growing
popularity of the older models.
</P>
<P>
   The splinter club formed in 1994, around the time that designers
and consumers began to rush in numbers to all things mid-century.
As curiosity became a full-blown design revival, Airstream's happy
obscurity eroded. The revival announced itself, as so many do, in
an embrace by Hollywood. On the screen, Tim Burton (owner of three
vintage trailers) pitted alien flying saucers against earthling
Airstreams in his 1996 comedy ``Mars Attacks!'' And on the ground,
just as free-form modern homes by John Lautner are being snapped up
by young stars, an Airstream in the driveway has become another
kitschy status symbol: a few Eames chairs scattered around, some
period Formica, a 1963 Airstream Bambi parked out back for the
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter and lifestyle magazines picked up on the trend,
paving the way for Airstream chic. An issue of Flaunt included a
pop-up Airstream, presumably as a kind of tiki for the
road-deprived urbanite. Even Manhattan has its token Airstream, a
vintage 20-footer used as a projection booth for summer movies in
Bryant Park. In May, Wilsonart, the laminate company, parked a
trailer at the Javits Center to show off an updated interior
concept they hope to sell to Airstream Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at last, there is a book for the armchair Airstreamer,
``Airstream: The History of the Land Yacht'' ($19.95), written by
Bryan Burkhart, a graphic designer and owner of a vintage
Airstream, and David Hunt, a New York-based art critic. It was
published this year by Chronicle Books of San Francisco, a house
known as a leader in repackaging retro styles for contemporary
consumption; the book takes its place on the backlist not far from
``Patio Daddy-O: '50s Recipes With a '90s twist.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens to a design when it goes from popular to Pop? The
Airstream can survive a gloss of nostalgia, but it may not fare so
well with that late, late 90's twist: seeing it as a fashion
statement, an accessory, not a tool. There is something unfortunate
about glamorizing this thing, which was meant to be used, to be
bashed about, hitched to the family truck and towed to Lake
Victoria. For Byam, function ruled; he once said of the Airstream,
``Let's not make any changes _ let's make only improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   That aversion to styling is what made the Airstream so good. If
you parse the design, as the authors of ``Airstream'' did, you'll
find Pan Am seaplanes, old Chryslers and fast trains, a hint of the
Dymaxion House, maybe a touch of Roswell, certainly a big dose of
the American passion for ameliorative gadgetry that achieved such
unusual elegance in the functional designs of the fetishized 1950s.
But, as Burkhart said recently: ``It's all accidental. There was no
way Wally knew Buckminster Fuller.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not fashion or its opposite, naivete: dedicated
problem-solving made the Airstream that rare and wonderful and
fragile thing, a genuine American design icon: purpose-built,
frankly eccentric, infectiously optimistic; branded, but stubbornly
anonymous. &QR;

GORE CALLS FOR DEFEAT OF REPUBLICAN `OLD GUARD'
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Warning against apathy within the Democratic ranks,
Vice President Al Gore Wednesday urged members of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's organization, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, to set aside
doubts about him and work to defeat the Republican ``old guard''
embodied in the ticket of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a mostly black audience of more than 100 people
in a hotel ballroom here, Gore said the dismaying imperfections of
politicians had turned off many people.
</P>
<P>
   But he implored his listeners to avoid cynicism, cautioning that
their indifference could help elect Bush, and thus allow the
Republicans to undermine civil rights, workers' rights, the
economy, the environment and health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be absolutely no doubt that voters will go to the
polls choosing between two very different visions for our future,''
Gore said. ``It is the choice between the old guard that gave us
deficits, division and social injustices, and a new vision for
prosperity and progress, investment, inclusion and growth to lift
up all of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Do not look at the imperfections and use that as an
excuse for closing your heart and turning away. You have to
overcome the cynicism, overcome the reluctance, overcome the
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not explain what he meant by ``imperfections.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech capped several days of campaigning in which he has
sought to reach out to the party's core liberal wing, which
includes environmentalists, unions and black and Hispanic voters.
Many polls have shown relatively little enthusiasm among those
constituencies for Gore. And as if to hammer home that point, his
audience Wednesday applauded only occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers say they are counting on Jackson _ who closed his
remarks Wednesday with a chant of ``More with Gore'' _ to energize
black voters by raising questions about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Gore Wednesday, Jackson _ once a bitter rival who
has become his close ally _ asserted that the Clinton
administration's policies had improved the lives of black families.
But he also warned that ``prosperity fatigue'' might be creating
apathy among black voters. And then he opened a slashing attack on
Cheney, a former five-term congressman from Wyoming and secretary
of defense under President George Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney voted against Head Start,'' Jackson said. ``He
voted against equal rights for women. He voted against sanctions
against South Africa, not once but six times. He voted against
freeing Nelson Mandela from jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying Cheney's record rivaled that of Sen. Jesse Helms, the
Republican conservative from North Carolina, Jackson added,
``Beneath the veneer lies an individual of extreme views.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that image is a big part of high-tech politics,''
he said. ``How somebody looks on TV can hide flaws. Dick Cheney has
an image that is palatable. But Jesus warned us to beware wolves in
sheep's clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in Jackson's remarks was the concern, shared by many
Democrats, that the Republicans are winning the public relations
battle, successfully wooing centrist independent and swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that concern, saying, ``I do give our
opponents some credit'' for their tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have concocted a strategy of phrases and photo
opportunities to convey the impression of inclusion and
moderation,'' he said. ``But you and I know this is not about show
business. It is about the lives and livelihoods of hard-working
families. You know from a hard history and long struggle that talk
is cheap. Deeds are what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also raised questions about Bush's commitment to civil
rights, recalling that the governor had supported South Carolina's
right to fly the Confederate battle flag over its statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a look up there at the flag pole,'' the vice president
said of Bush. ``He saw the American flag; he saw the dome. But he
did not see a symbol of injustice and oppression. Something was
wrong with his vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Wednesday, Gore avoided the raspy, high-energy
Southern-preacher speaking style he sometimes assumes when
addressing black audiences. Instead, he spoke in a calm, almost
easy-going voice as he delved into his confessional themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to turn away from any who say that politics is not
worth your hearts,'' he said. ``Many hearts have been broken. Many
have been disillusioned, disappointed; many have turned away. And
some of the best and most effective men and women in America now
keep politics at an arms length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let you down,'' he said.

LONG BEACH, IN LOS ANGELES' SHADOW, YEARNS FOR THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ To hear municipal officials here tell it,
there is no more enduring, supportive relationship than the bond
between this industrious, muscular port and that livable but tough,
even troubled, city just north, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch that happy surface, however, and Long Beach will concede
somewhat more complex feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Taboada, Long Beach's city manager, summarized the
prevailing view when he recalled going to Washington with Los
Angeles officials last year to seek financing for a major rail link
to the cities' adjacent, sometimes bitterly competitive ports.
</P>
<P>
   As they entered a congressional hearing room, the huge Los
Angeles delegation took literally every seat at the table, Taboada
said, forcing him to almost physically remove one of the aides so
there would be a seat for the only other person in the Long Beach
delegation, the mayor, Beverly O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that or get no seat at the table,'' Taboada said.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Long Beach is a substantial city. With roughly
450,000 residents, it is larger than St. Louis, Atlanta, Pittsburgh
or Minneapolis. It has the largest container port in the country, a
huge Boeing manufacturing center and a university. It has more than
five miles of beaches. And, perhaps most important, it has clawed
its way back from a series of economic calamities, including the
loss of more than 50,000 aerospace job and military base closings
that made the last recession all the more fierce here.
</P>
<P>
   But Long Beach also has a complex, a product of its sense of
always resting uncomfortably in the shadow of the flashier, more
prosperous and, truth be told, infinitely more effervescent
neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   It is a struggle Long Beach officials know they cannot win, and
so they put the best face on things. Los Angeles will be thrust
into the spotlight as host to the Democratic National Convention
from Aug. 14 to Aug. 17. And Long Beach? From Aug. 9 to Aug. 13, it
will play host to the Reform Party convention, a role that some
city officials admit reinforces their poor-stepchild image, at
least in the eyes of the media, but does put their town on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some officials make a virtue of the city's second-tier
status. Los Angeles is preparing nervously not just for tens of
thousands of delegates, politicians and journalists, but also for
well-organized and aggressive demonstrators. The embattled Los
Angeles police have already been criticized for a crowd-control
plan yet to be put in effect.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dale L. Brown, deputy police chief in Long Beach,
said his city was anticipating exactly zero demonstrators at what
is expected to be a sedate Reform Party gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, there are times we feel we don't get the
recognition we deserve,'' Brown said. ``But sometimes it's nice to
be in the shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Taboada added: ``We won't get the attention Los Angeles will. On
the other hand, there are only three presidential conventions, and
we have one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said that in her view, the problem was a matter of
perception and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want,'' she said, ``is to help people realize that
when you say Los Angeles County, you don't just mean Los Angeles. I
don't grumble about it, maybe because I've gotten used to dealing
with this my whole life. But we're not an appendage, and we just
want people to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she did an uncanny impression of Ross Perot, who led the
Reform Party when it held its last convention here four years ago
and who, she said, offered this compliment: ``Your city is very
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach is no stranger to ups, downs and identity crises. It
was founded in 1882 as Willmore City, named for an English
developer who put up about a dozen houses and then failed. A few
dozen more buildings were thrown up, and the settlement was reborn
in 1888 as Long Beach. Today it covers about 50 square miles that
comprise one of the most heavily industrialized areas in the
region. On the drive south from Los Angeles on the freeway, the
first sign that one has arrived is a huge oil refinery; indeed, the
city still produces substantial amounts of oil.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Long Beach became home to a Navy base, a
naval shipyard and a big Navy hospital. These, along with big
airplane factories, became the mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Long Beach was hit with a triple whammy during the 1990's:
the recession, base closings and military procurement cutbacks sent
the unemployment rate soaring to 9.2 percent in 1993. An ugly
racial incident, in which the police were filmed putting the head
of a black suspect, himself a former police officer, through a
plate glass window, almost led the city to dissolve its police
force and bring in the county sheriff's department to keep the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have just a death knell,'' Taboada said. ``It was
one death knell after another.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill became mayor in the bleak days of 1994 and has worked
not just to revive the city but to transform it. In addition to
technology, she has pushed tourism along the waterfront, where the
most notable symbol is the Queen Mary, docked there and used as an
entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   The success has been mixed, but unquestionably the city is back
on its feet; today the unemployment rate is 5 percent, compared
with 4 percent nationally. ``We've been celebrating everything,''
O'Neill said. ``We celebrated the first store opening. We
celebrated the beginning of new construction. We celebrated
anything that said hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy hospital has been transformed into a gigantic
mall, although it does not have a major department store. (Indeed,
there is none anywhere in Long Beach.) The city obtained government
financing to build the Aquarium of the Pacific, a big tourist
attraction on the refurbished waterfront, but it lost about $7.5
million from late 1998 through this March.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the investment continues. Several acres of unsightly
blacktop just behind city hall are to be torn up soon for apartment
complexes, the first such residential construction in the area
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and other officials say their concern now is not so much
to ensure that the Reform delegates see the transformation as to
get the media to take note of the successes as Long Beach's own,
not Los Angeles'.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Beach in the middle of the Mojave Desert would be a great
media story,'' Taboada said. ``But because we're on the underbelly
of Los Angeles, when we get attention it's negative _ or it has
been. We feel like we can't get our message out, but maybe this
will help.''

WAITING FOR WIM WENDERS' FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his short documentary ``Chambre 666,'' the German director
Wim Wenders posed a single question to fellow directors during the
1982 Cannes International Film Festival, asking each of them about
the future of cinema. It's a lively, brittle and memorable piece of
work _ filmmakers pop in and out of a hotel room, sit in front of a
camera and reveal their feelings on life and filmmaking _ a work
that now provokes a question itself. What is the future of Wim
Wenders? He has one of the most peculiar careers in film, and by
all rights, he should have had a much bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   When his name comes up in conversation, the buzz over his
puzzling lack of success and the anticipation of his next movie can
bring people from all corners of a party to voice their affection.
I've seen it happen, and in those conversations, people get
embarrassed, as if they take his misses personally, and somehow
feel as if they know him. The schisms between his documentaries _
``Buena Vista Social Club,'' with its elegant airiness; the
incredible ``Chambre 666,'' and ``Notebook on Cities and Clothes''
(1989), in which he compares sensibilities with the designer Yohji
Yamamoto _ and his feature films may offer some explanation.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Buena Vista,'' his 1998 documentary on the aging Cuban
musicians retired by a short-sighted government that had rendered
them obsolete, he created a movie that radiated a sense of
pleasure, a picture that made him seem a voluptuary who shared the
vibe with an audience. But Wenders has been plagued by fits and
starts over the last decade, and this lack of consistency has
resulted in his last few movies' getting spotty releases at best.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because there aren't many other filmmakers whose
efforts are so filled with decency and a need to understand what
makes his characters so screwy, why they don't fit in; there's
never any risk that Wenders will humiliate a character in one of
his movies. There's a single image that haunts all of his films _
you'll see a single figure, alone and lonely, standing in an
oversized topcoat, shouldering all the misery of the world.
</P>
<P>
   His essential generosity and compassion are exemplified for many
filmgoers by Peter Falk and Bruno Ganz in the 1988 displaced-angels
story ``Wings of Desire'' (which was coated with powdered sugar and
remade 10 years later as ``City of Angels'' with Nicolas Cage and
Meg Ryan). These qualities often figure in stories of people who
have their noses against the glass, pressing so hard that they
leave big smudges. For those who've seen more of his movies,
Rudiger Vogler, the sound recordist in the luscious and meandering
``Lisbon Story,'' and Patrick Bachau, who has played the
inquisitive filmmaker Monroe on a number of occasions for Wenders,
are those representations of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders has a startling talent for allowing his characters to
wear their hearts on their sleeves, and then measuring the degree
of the hang in centimeters. The movies can be shiny and brooding
simultaneously. The titles themselves spell out restive yearning _
``Wings of Desire,'' ``Faraway, So Close,'' ``Until the End of the
World,'' ``Notebook on Cities and Clothes,'' ``Paris, Texas,''
``Kings of the Road,'' ``Alice of the Cities'' _ and a search for a
home outside of where the protagonists are staying. Has any other
filmmaker brought to his work the compulsion to get away _ to flee
from somewhere? His characters seem to rest wherever they fall, and
wear out more shoe leather than Harrison Ford in ``The Fugitive,''
on the run from an unhappiness dogging them so thoroughly they'd
have to be flayed to shed it.
</P>
<P>
   In his fictional films, his characters wander mournfully through
a world in which they don't belong, and manage to turn even heaven
into a melancholy dystopia. His most recent film, ``Million Dollar
Hotel,'' which played out of competition at Cannes, is full of such
unfulfilled people _ mental patients and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The film is creeping around the world at festivals, looking for
a way, it seems, to slip into the United States unnoticed. Produced
by Mel Gibson's company, Icon, and featuring Gibson in a supporting
role, ``Hotel'' may be the only film to feature Mel Gibson in the
last 20 years that has gone unreleased in the actor's biggest
market, America. It also stars Milla Jovovich and Jeremy Davies,
and has a score composed by Bono, yet it's likely that the movie _
a more-or-less suspense story set in a crummy Los Angeles hotel,
and more specifically another examination of the lower class to
which Wenders is so attracted _ will never see a commercial release
here.
</P>
<P>
   In his documentaries, as opposed to his feature films, he's
drawn to people who are completely at home in their skins; perhaps
because he tends to be attracted to artists. In ``Chambre 666'' and
``Buena Vista Social Club,'' these filmmakers and musicians know
who they are and have an intuitive comfort with their skills and
their places in the world. In ``Buena Vista,'' the performers are
natural stars biding their time for the spotlight to find them
again _ and seem fully assured that it will.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to track Wenders' career is to sift through the
soundtrack sections of music stores. Wenders shows none of the
foggy anxiety _ a depressing compulsion towards philosophizing that
often derails his narratives _ in putting together the scores for
his films. The ``Lisbon Story'' score, performed by the Portuguese
group Madredeus, has a joyous and harmonious lilt; the band appears
in the movie, and is an integral part of the plot. The rapturous
music lifts the film off the ground, and the same could be said for
the meticulous good taste that makes up all of Wenders' song
scores. He hand picks most of the music himself, and his interest
in music is so keen that he should be running a record label or a
radio station. I've heard tales from record store employees in New
York and Los Angeles of Wenders' poking through their places of
employment and dropping a pile of money on CDs and vinyl. When he
returns, it's clear that he's really listened to what he'd
previously bought. In the documentaries and in his exquisite music
selection, Wenders finds a clarity he can't always bring to his
fiction films. I'm not ready to give up on him just yet.

FORD APPEARS SET TO RAISE MILEAGE FOR ITS SPORT UTILITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Ford Motor Co. has decided to increase the average
fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the
next five years, people involved in the company's plans said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, amounting to roughly five miles per gallon, would
be the first significant change in the fuel economy of any class of
passenger vehicle in almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is convinced that Americans want to buy more fuel-efficient
vehicles and will steer their purchases to companies they perceive
as environmentally responsible, the people said. The company's new
stance is also a response to environmental concerns about the
automobile's role in global warming.
</P>
<P>
   At least at first, the company does not intend to pass the extra
cost of producing more fuel-efficient vehicles directly to American
customers, two people familiar with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker is betting instead that improved fuel economy will
increase sales more than enough to offset lower profits on each
vehicle. Better gas mileage and lower operating costs for Ford
sport utilities could eventually increase demand enough to allow
the company to sell them with fewer rebates, and possibly even
raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives hope that the more fuel-efficient sport
utilities will give all of their brands an image of environmental
responsibility, people familiar with the company's plans said. That
could help sales of the company's cars, minivans and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Ford _ which sells 800,000 sport utilities a year,
representing about a fifth of its total domestic sales _ is a sharp
reversal. The company started and led the decade-long trend toward
sport utility vehicles, the biggest of which consume more than
twice as much gasoline a mile as the average car. The Ford
Excursion is the world's largest sport utility, getting 10 miles to
the gallon in the city and 13 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to improve mileage comes even as recent efforts in
Congress to mandate an increase in fuel economy have failed, partly
because of lobbying by Ford and other automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mileage improvement will be achieved through changes
to Ford's larger sport utilities: the Ford Explorer, Expedition and
Excursion, the Mercury Mountaineer, the Lincoln Navigator and the
Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Ford engineers say that there are many small steps that they can
take to improve fuel economy, from making auto parts lighter to
adjusting engines. But lighter auto parts are usually more
expensive, because they need to be made from aluminum instead of
steel, while engine design alterations must be made with great care
to avoid reducing vehicles' towing capacity. Ford executives
declined to estimate the cost of these changes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the improvement in Ford's average fuel economy will come
from the introduction in September of the Ford Escape, which is
slightly smaller than the Ford Explorer and uses a lightweight car
underbody instead of a heavy, pickup-truck underbody. With a
four-cylinder engine, the Escape gets up to 28 miles a gallon on
the highway
</P>
<P>
   Ford will not achieve its fuel-economy improvement by taking
advantage of either of the loopholes that it and others have used
in recent years: building vehicles like the Excursion to be so
large that they are excluded from the federal averages, and
building vehicles that qualify for alternative-fuel mileage
credits. The Excursion will be counted as Ford pursues its 25
percent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are building huge
numbers of minivans, pickup trucks and midsize cars that can burn
either gasoline or nearly pure ethanol. These vehicles are counted
in the averages as though they have triple their actual milage,
even though only 100 of the nation's 170,000 service stations sell
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, is scheduled to fly to
Washington on Thursday to announce the company's decision at the
National Press Club, people involved in the company's plans said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler and GM, Ford's main rivals in the sport utility
market, declined to comment on Ford's move, saying only that some
of their models were already fuel-efficient. Detroit automakers,
including Ford, have said in the past that improved mileage for
sport utilities will require sacrifices in engine power and vehicle
size that American consumers will not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler have a quarter each of the sport
utility market. Foreign automakers divide up the remaining share.
</P>
<P>
   GM has just finished improving the gas mileage of its full-size
sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks by 5 percent over the last
three years by completely redesigning them for the first time in a
decade. But GM and other automakers have not improved their
fuel-economy averages, increasing the power, size, and gas
consumption of some models even as others have become more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Ford voluntarily cleaned up its sport utility vehicles' tailpipe
emissions two years ago to make them as clean as cars' emissions.
While the cost has approached $100 a vehicle, and while many rivals
have not yet followed suit, Ford officials say that decision has
been a selling point.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman since the start of last
year and a great-grandson of Henry Ford, is an outspoken
environmentalist who has called for the auto industry to address
global warming. At the company's annual meeting two months ago in
Atlanta, he acknowledged the environmental and safety drawbacks of
sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few small signs in Washington that federal
fuel-economy standards, little changed since the mid-1980s, might
be reconsidered next year. But there is no indication that the
government will require nearly as big an improvement as Ford is
planning. Nasser intends to present the plan as an example of how
the auto industry can improve fuel economy voluntarily and will not
call for tighter federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are required to sell cars with an average fuel
economy of 27.5 miles a gallon and so-called light trucks with an
average fuel economy of 20.7 miles a gallon. Sport utilities, vans
and pickup trucks are all counted as light trucks and now represent
half of the American auto market, partly because manufacturers have
switched production away from cars as low gasoline prices and a
strong economy in the 1990s produced a soaring demand for large but
gas-guzzling vehicles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Ford has barely met the regulatory averages, and its
sport utilities have done especially badly _ balanced by more
efficient minivans and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton raised the fuel-economy standard for sport
utilities, minivans and pickup trucks by two-tenths of a mile per
gallon in 1993 and 1994, to 20.7 miles per gallon. When Republicans
took control of the House and Senate in 1995, they began amending
the federal budget each year to prevent the Transportation
Department from spending any money to study the issue or tighten
standards. Each annual budget since then has included the same
prohibition, but support for the provision has dwindled as light
trucks have increased as a share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   High gasoline prices prompted an effort this spring by Western
senators, whose constituents drive long distances, and by
environmentalists, to overturn the ban. Under a recent Senate
compromise, the freeze on fuel-economy standards will remain for
another year while the National Academy of Sciences reviews federal
fuel-economy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., a member of the House
Appropriations Committee, has blocked fuel-economy changes on the
House side. His chief of staff, Paul Welday, said that Ford's
latest move was a good one if it helped sell sport utility
vehicles, but would strengthen those who wanted tighter standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the Beltway, it will only fuel the fires of those who
believe that if Ford can do that, everybody else should be forced
to do that,'' Welday said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Becker, the energy policy director at the Sierra Club,
said environmentalists would use Ford's decision in their lobbying.
``This shows that the people who say you can't make cars cleaner
and more fuel-efficient are wrong,'' he said. ``This shows that a
company that wants to improve fuel economy can do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials believe that they can improve mileage while
maintaining the safety of their vehicles' occupants. Occupants of
lightweight, subcompact cars tend to fare poorly in collisions. But
a variety of recent studies have found that vehicles weighing 3,000
to 3,500 pounds _ the weight of a midsized or large car _ tend to
be very safe; further weight provides only a little additional
safety for the occupants, while tremendously increasing the risk to
other motorists during collisions. Ford's current sport utilities
weigh from 3,700 pounds for a two-wheel-drive Explorer to 7,200
pounds for an Excursion with four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser's plans have provoked some nervousness within Ford that
the automaker may be limiting its ability to respond if gas prices
fall or if consumers begin demanding even more powerful vehicles.
``There is a lot of struggle within the company over whether this
is the right number and the right time frame,'' a person involved
in the plan said. &QL;

 &HT;    Officials: Intracoastal may run out of money
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Intracoastal Health Systems is draining
its cash reserves to operate Good Samaritan and St. Mary's medical
centers and will be out of money within a year unless it makes
drastic operating changes, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the company, which had been losing $2 million a month,
dropped $8.2 million in June, pushing its losses to about $41
million for the budget year just ended. Intracoastal lost $22.6
million in the previous budget year, which ended June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The main factor in last month's dive was a $6 million decline in
expected revenue, attributed to doctors diverting patients to other
hospitals because of low morale and uncertainty over the fate of
Good Sam and St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   Cash reserves are down to $43 million and are expected to shrink
to $21 million by January, according to Intracoastal's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very anxious,'' CFO Michael Loscalzo told members of a
community hospital rescue committee at their first meeting. ``If we
don't do significant restructuring, this business will be out of
cash by this time next year, and it will have begun to fail two to
three months before that.''
</P>
<P>
   What would happen to the West Palm Beach hospitals under such
conditions is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no answer that we can give at this point,''
Intracoastal board member Jon Moyle said in an interview. ``All
avenues would have to be explored, and I prefer not to waste time
focusing on that. If we get this turned around and start to make
money, then all the projections go out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambio Health Solutions, a Tennessee-based firm, has been
running the hospitals under contract since Intracoastal's board
gave up on its own managers in January. Cambio has proposed closing
St. Mary's, expanding Good Samaritan and consolidating services
there to turn the company around.
</P>
<P>
   That plan provoked an investigation by the state Attorney
General's Office and inspired community leaders to coalesce to
demand a voice in the hospitals' fate. Intracoastal agreed to hold
up consolidation plans until the state finishes its probe and to
cooperate with the community group's own review.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue committee, calling itself the Community Advisory
Board, elected as its chair Jeannette Corbett, chief executive of
Quantum Foundation and former chair of the JFK Medical Center
board.
</P>
<P>
   Corbett called the committee's goal of reaching a conclusion on
the hospital plan by Sept. 15 a ``monumental task.'' She set a
meeting for 3 p.m. today to select a national health care
consulting firm to review Cambio's data, study local health care
needs and determine whether both hospitals can continue to exist in
some fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The Quantum Foundation, created with the proceeds of the sale of
JFK Medical to the Columbia/HCA hospital chain, has offered
$500,000 to pay for such an independent study, but Corbett said the
foundation's board would find it ``more palatable'' if other groups
shared the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Grady, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Palm
Beaches, pledged to raise $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office said it supports the efforts of
the Community Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no downside to it,'' said Cecile L. Dykas, assistant
deputy attorney general heading the investigation into what happens
to charitable contributions made to St. Mary's if the hospital is
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Dykas said she sees some overlap, but no conflict between the
state's investigation and the community group's examination of
Intracoastal's records.
</P>
<P>
   Intracoastal board and management officials pleaded with the
advisory group Wednesday to find a solution quickly to alleviate
the growing losses of money, patients and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem is becoming more and more serious with each day
that passes,'' said Intracoastal board member Moyle. ``We need to
start rebuilding. ... It's really critical if we're going to have a
continuing not-for-profit community hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Catholic Health East, which holds a $150
million mortgage on the hospitals and is Intracoastal's most
powerful board presence, said the Pennsylvania-based health care
consortium is willing to consider alternatives to closing St.
Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be here if we weren't,'' Dan Russell said. ``I'm
just asking that you do it sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Franciscan Sisters of Allegany, who owned St. Mary's before
it joined with Good Sam to form Intracoastal in 1994, combined with
two other Catholic hospital networks to form Catholic Health East.
The nuns still are involved, and their commitment to serve the poor
still drives the firm, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been given my marching orders by the sisters,'' Russell
said. ``They own the company of which I'm the CEO. . . . We pledge
to cooperate in any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Intracoastal named Paul Bremer, recently retired managing
partner of accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young's local office, to be its
liaison with the committee. Bremer's firm did a study for
Intracoastal in 1995 that recommended Good Samprovide wellness,
ambulatory, and outpatient services and short-stay in-patient care,
and that St. Mary's focus on acute care and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer said Intracoastal offered to pay him for working with the
committee, but he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just do anything to make this work,'' he said.

   CORTEZ, Colo. _ Even the darkest clouds have a silver lining,
and Mesa Verde National Park officials are clinging to such
optimism as firefighters struggle to contain a wildfire that has
burned 23,000 acres in and near the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be redefining what Mesa Verde means,'' the
park's public affairs officer, Will Morris, said. ``We will have to
reconsider the way we approach natural and cultural resources.
There may be a silver lining in archaeological finds to this really
dark cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fire has raced through the park, archaeologists have
scrambled ahead of it, working to identify previously undiscovered
ancient native American sites. By Wednesday, at least a dozen new
ones had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the archaeologists are working just ahead of crews
building fire lines, trying to prevent a false step or stray swing
of a pickax from crushing a bit of antiquity. The scientists fear
that both the flames and the firefighters may destroy artifacts
before the fire is tamed. Usually, they have had time only to mark
the sites on a map or in the field. Sometimes, they help dig fire
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to be doing any kind of extensive
study,'' Linda Towle, Mesa Verde's chief archaeologist, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said they will try to return and study the sites,
hoping they uncover more insight into the lives of early
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde is best known for being home to the largest preserved
Anasazi cliff dwellings in the country, and is the only national
park devoted solely to protecting cultural remains. About 800 years
ago, ancestors of the Apache, Navajo, Hopi and Pueblo tribes,
farmed the land and built their homes in what is now southwestern
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire, which has burned about a third of the park, was 25
percent contained by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and winds the night before helped extinguish some hot
spots, but also made some areas flare up.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the fire, the value of the park and its proximity to
the communities around it have made it a priority, said Justin
Dombrowski, information officer with the Rocky Mountain Incident
Command Team, which is overseeing the operation. Wildfires have
consumed more than 100,000 acres west of the Rocky Mountains this
year, and the season is shaping up to be one of the worst in five
years. Crews, equipment and other resources were stretched so thin
that fire managers will organize and train military crews to help.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the cost of fighting the large fires burning in
the West was $26.3 million, according to the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the 52,000-acre park is surrounded by private land,
Bureau of Land Management areas and the Ute Mountain Ute
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The fire is believed to have started last Thursday after a
lightning strike on private land.
</P>
<P>
   As they work, archaeologists at Mesa Verde are aware that they
have been through this at least once before. After a 5,000-acre
fire in 1996, archaeologists discovered 400 previously unknown
archaeological sites to add to 4,000 known sites.
</P>
<P>
   Those sites provide more insight into the lives of the early
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned they were controlling water more than we thought,
and that they were here for a lot longer time than we thought,''
said Julie Bell, an archaeologist at the park.
</P>
<P>
   They also have discovered that the area might have been more
populated than previously thought. For example, Battleship Rock, a
significant petroglyph (rock drawings) site was largely burned in
1996. But with the surrounding brush and trees gone, archaeologists
found evidence of a larger community around the rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mesa Verde is famous for its cliff dwellings _ Cliff Palace,
Balcony House _ and that's only one small part of it,'' Bell said.
``Those were built in the last 100 years of 800 years of
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Four more cliff dwellings were found after the 1996 fires, but
they were small storage units, not as impressive as the large
apartment structures. Archaeologists also found earlier homes _
pithouses that were built in holes, remnants of stonewalls and one
wall that was about four-feet tall, and ancient trash piles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' Bell said of the post-fire
discoveries. ``The fire will uncover a lot of more sites, but the
after effects of the fire are going to threaten all of the sites
because if we don't have the vegetation to stop the water, runoff
erosion is going to be a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was one of 18 archaeologists who worked ahead of fire crews
this week, trying to avoid potentially important sites as they dug
fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   As thunderstorms rolled in Wednesday afternoon, again providing
a chance for cooler temperatures and more humidity, talk turned to
when the park might reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next process and goal is to open the park,'' said Larry
Wiese, the park superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   And although it appeared by late Wednesday that the park's crown
jewel cliff dwellings would not be touched by the fire, experts
said the resources were invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our living legacy for many, many generations to
come,'' a park archaeologist, Faith Duncan, said with a backdrop of
a ceremonial kiva and charred hills beyond. ``I look at it as an
American thing so we can show the rest of the world about
preservation and caring for a finite resource.''

 &HT;    Operator of women's clinic accused of bilking clients
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A controversial South Florida clinic
operator faces allegations it wrongly kept the deposits of more
than 80 poor pregnant women in St. Lucie County and that its chief
executive gutted its bank account to pay his own debts.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Trinity Medical Inc. chief executive Dr.
Kenneth Kassin said Wednesday his client had ``no knowledge'' of
the women's claims. Attorney Robert Harris also downplayed
allegations, made in court, by Trinity's former chief operating
officer that Kassin used the firm to pay his personal bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more than is being said there,'' said Harris, who
didn't elaborate. ``I don't want to litigate it in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, from Deerfield Beach, was hired last week after Kassin's
Fort Lauderdale lawyers resigned, citing ``irreconcilable
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the state Agency for Health Care Administration
ordered Trinity to ``promptly'' return the deposits of eight
Okeechobee County women, all migrant workers, who had their babies
delivered by Trinity doctors. The clinic had been reimbursed by
Medicaid for the deliveries but withheld the women's deposits _ a
form of double-dipping that violates state and federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   But so far only one of the women has received a refund, and she
got only $90 of the $200 she put down, said Miriam Harmatz, an
attorney with Florida Legal Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desperate situation,'' Harmatz said. ``Someone needs to
go in and freeze the guy's bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the women Trinity saw have moved to other states to
harvest crops, Harmatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Kramer, director of Healthy Start, which pays for
pre-natal care in St. Lucie County, said she supplied 80 to 100
more names of women with complaints to the AHCA earlier this month.
The poor women, all seen at Trinity's Fort Pierce clinic, gave
deposits ranging from $200 to $1,300, Kramer said. Kramer said her
case manager's records show that Medicaid paid Trinity for
delivering their babies _ some as far back as 1997 _ but the women
say they never got their deposits back.
</P>
<P>
   After a seven-year relationship, Healthy Start ended its
contract with Trinity on July 1 for pre-natal care because of the
women's complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``AHCA needs to do something here,'' Kramer said. Kim Reed, an
AHCA spokeswoman, said the agency is checking Kramer's list against
Trinity's records. She could not explain why the eight Okeechobee
County women have not received full refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity had told the agency those women were sent refunds, Reed
said. But the agency hasn't received copies of cashed checks. The
agency has it imposed any sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said Trinity has been ``extremely cooperative'' in
providing records and that the state could reach a compromise with
it over an unrelated dispute. In March, state officials notified
Trinity that Medicaid had overpaid it $188,000 for lab tests.
Trinity appealed to an administrative judge.
</P>
<P>
   AHCA was investigating the claims of the Okeechobee women when
Trinity's chief operating officer, Peter Feldman, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman filed suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court last month
against Trinity, Kassin and his private practice in Fort
Lauderdale. The suit seeks more than $106,548 in unpaid loans,
wages and other benefits. Feldman claims in court records that
Trinity has become bankrupt because Kassin transferred money,
sometimes deceptively, from the firm's bank accounts to pay his
practice's bills and ``personal expenses,'' including American
Express credit card charges, dental bills and family car expenses.
Even though Kassin's private practice and Trinity shared office
space, staff and other overhead, only Trinity paid these expenses,
the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Kassin, Trinity's sole shareholder, was the only one who could
sign the firm's checks, the lawsuit said, and he didn't reimburse
Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, Kassin's attorney, said his client will file a lawsuit
against Feldman for gross negligence. ``Kassin was practicing
medicine and this guy was responsible for running the business,''
Harris said. ``This is a case of the pot calling the kettle
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinity Medical Inc., based in Deerfield Beach, closed clinics
in Pahokee and Belle Glade in August of 1999 and told hundreds of
patients they would have to travel to Okeechobee or Fort Pierce.

A LANDSCAPE THAT CARRIES A LIFE'S WORTH OF EMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Maine _ Emily Nelligan charcoal drawings are almost
all the same size: 10 inches wide by 7 inches high. Some are dark
as a moonless night, some pale as fog. They all depict the same
landscape: Great Cranberry Island, southwest of Mount Desert Island
in Maine. Twenty-six of them, reticent and lyrical, ring a galley
at the Bowdoin College Museum of Art here. In their minimal steel
frames, they hang like sudden windows: instants of light and air
translated into black and white.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, they might be photographs, with their intricate
interplay of lights and darks. ``Untitled, Cranberry Island, 21
July, 1997'' catches the delicate gradations of gray in a sunset
sky, an array of clouds almost too subtle to be drawn. But these
drawings also read as abstractions, the landscape _ clouds, rocks
and ocean _ pared to emotion.
</P>
<P>
   This show, ``Littoral Abstractions,'' which continues until
Sept. 3, is one of the few times Nelligan, who has been making
drawings for more than 50 years, has permitted them to be shown
publicly. ``I remember the first time I saw one of her drawings,''
said Katy Kline, the director of the Bowdoin Museum. ``It was
during a studio visit with another artist, Lois Dodd, and I
remember looking up, and hung fairly high on the wall was a very
quiet, very soft, dark drawing. I kept looking at it; it was as if
I were hearing a solo cello, and I asked, `Whose is that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Nelligan's work has long been a well-kept secret. Meyer
Schapiro, Hilton Kramer, Wolf Kahn and Richard Pousette-Dart are
among those who have collected her drawings, but her last two solo
exhibitions took place in 1991 in out-of-the-way places, one
sponsored by the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, at the Legal
Offices Building Library in Hartford, and the other at Maine Coast
Artists, a nonprofit gallery in Rockport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think that exhibiting was wrong,'' Nelligan said
recently. ``That art was _ '' she hesitated ``_ sacred. The buying
and selling is heartbreaking. Art has become nothing but a
commodity.'' Nelligan, 76, is tall, with thick, cropped, graying
hair and dark gold-flecked eyes. She speaks softly and slowly; and,
like her drawings, she is reserved and private.
</P>
<P>
   Words are the province of her husband, the artist and
illustrator Marvin Bileck, whom people call Buddy. He is wiry and
energetic and wears a bold pink shirt; he has white hair and a
white beard and intense, eager eyes. ``The drawings are Emily, and
Emily is her drawings,'' he said. ``They are like Emily Dickinson's
poems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the gallery, surrounded by Nelligan's drawings, with their
sure hand, their brevity and their breathtaking revelations, this
comparison does not sound like hyperbole. It might, however,
displease his wife. ``I do not talk about my drawings,'' she stated
flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a marriage of understanding opposites. Bileck, whose
work is meticulous and detailed, almost Netherlandish in feeling
(he illustrated Alfred Kazin's ``Walker in the City'' and ``Rain
Makes Applesauce,'' a 1965 children's book still in print), prefers
the gentle hills and intricate ancient trees of southern New
England to Cranberry Island. Nelligan cannot draw in Connecticut.
``For her the woods are claustrophobic,'' her husband said. So they
divide the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nelligan agreed: ``In Connecticut I force myself to try, but
it's not worth it. I work out of doors, and the atmosphere becomes
part of what I do.'' Bileck has accommodated. ``He's gotten to love
the rocks,'' Nelligan said, ``and the twisted, gnarled, downed
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelligan and her husband travel from their house in northwestern
Connecticut to Cranberry Island in June and remain through October.
They have been going there since 1946, when, Nelligan said, ``A
friend wrote that it was a beautiful place, and you could find a
place to rent for not very much money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our first house cost $100 for the summer,'' she said.
``At first Buddy did not like it; it was too austere.''
</P>
<P>
   Austerity, though, is central to Nelligan's work. She was born
in New York in 1924. When she was 6 her father died, soon after he
had managed finally to land a job at the height of the Depression.
``My father did watercolors and worked with inlaid wood,'' Nelligan
said. ``I remember him steaming wood to bend it.''
</P>
<P>
   She always drew, and she took a course in art at Washington
Irving High School. Her teacher there told her about Cooper Union,
from which she graduated in 1944, and where she met her husband.
Although she studied painting, ``paint was expensive,'' she says,
so she began to use charcoal. ``At first it was a restriction.''
But she thrives on restriction: of size, of medium, of place, of
her time in that place.
</P>
<P>
   Bileck said his wife did most things slowly and deliberately,
but she drew extremely fast, working with a pencil in one hand and
an eraser in the other. On Cranberry Island, Nelligan and Bileck
work every day, in the morning and again at twilight. ``The clouds
are good today,'' Bileck said recently in a phone call from the
island. ``Emily's still out, but I got too cold. I came back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The island light captivates his wife, Bileck said. ``Cranberry
is out to sea. The place is flooded with light.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of her most beautiful drawings deal with the fading of that
light, when color leaves the day. ``I go until it gets dark,''
Nelligan said. ``Then I sleep.'' She works in charcoal on writing
paper and never seals her drawings with a fixative, as if that
would stifle them. She draws favorite places along the shore:
ledges, where an erased white halo of surf floods a rock abstracted
to a black circle; a spit of land embracing an inlet's still water,
its bands of whites and grays. Although the works in the show span
nearly two decades, a drawing made in 1990 compared to one made in
1999 betrays no sense of the passing of years, no reference to the
events of a lifetime. Each drawing is untitled, identified only by
the date on which she made it.
</P>
<P>
   Nelligan's work is a deeply private dialogue with a particular
setting; it is also, in its privacy, a response to the currents of
American art. Nelligan and Bileck lived in New York for years while
Bileck taught at Queens College; they were in the thick of things.
Cranberry Island has remained a constant far removed from the
marketplace of art in postwar America and its capricious fashions.
If Nelligan's subject is the moment in its infinite variability,
she also draws permanence: a summer place apart from chronology,
where time is measured by seasons, tides and changing light.

 &HT;    Window film slammed as `false sense of security'
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach County's chief building official
is asking the Florida attorney general to investigate whether
window film makers and distributors are exaggerating the strength
of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Holt sent the information to the attorney general's
office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to . . . let them decide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holt has been collecting newspaper advertisements, comments from
callers and literature from makers, distributors and code
organizations. He's turning his findings over to the attorney
general because he has virtually no clout over hurricane coverings
for existing structures; while new construction in the county must
meet building codes, no permit is needed to apply window film at
existing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's advice to homeowners: Demand literature and
specifications and run it past a county or city building department
before buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my concern, that people will get a false sense of
security, thinking they have full protection,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Window film _ usually made of types of plastic, metals, Mylar
(the silvery material used in party balloons) or combinations _ is
permanently applied to windows using a strong adhesive. Some film
is sold just for sun protection. The stronger film, usually sold as
a security tool, is designed to keep the panect. Costs for window
film on both sides of a 3-by-8-foot sliding glass door range from
$350 to $465.
</P>
<P>
   Most makers and distributors contacted last week said their
product is effective for some storms but isn't as good as plywood,
storm panels or shutters. Still, they argued the reduced
effectiveness may be worth the added aesthetics and convenience.
</P>
<P>
   One firm has claimed in a newspaper ad that its film is as
strong as window coverings, but the owner said this week the film
works only with a certain kind of window frame. And one distributor
acknowledged some of his literature may be misleading and is at
least confusing; he has promised to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Building officials, and the companies themselves, point out that
any window film or impact resistant window is only as strong as the
window frame, which could blow out in a storm and send the whole
window assembly flying. And, they say, some film doesn't cover the
whole pane, leaving exposed areas.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties follow the Southern
Building Code. All windows in new construction must withstand a
wind force of 100 to 110 mph. Everything above 30 feet also must
withstand a ``small missile test,'' which judges the impact of 30
2-gram steel balls traveling at 130 feet per second. The height
limit was based on the likelihood that large pieces of debris
wouldn't get as high into the air. But the first 30 feet of a
structure's height _ most single-family homes in South Florida are
one-story _ must withstand the ``large missile test,'' which
measures the impact of an 8-foot-long, 2-by-4 board fired at 50
feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in my 22 years have I heard of window film passing the
`large missile test,' '' said Rob Martin, president of Westar
Window Films in Largo and vice president of the Virginia-based
International Window Film Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the window film manufacturers take the position that the
product has limitations,'' Martin said. ``We constantly refer our
distributors to the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) advertising
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Panels &AMP; Shutters are !!Obsolete!!'' says an advertisement
that ran July 9 in The Palm Beach Post for Glass Sentinal of Palm
Beach. Literature provided by the maker of Glass Sentinal says it
``passed Florida hurricane tests for wind velocity, pressure and
missile impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kitchen, owner of Glass Sentinal, said last week his film
passed small and large missile tests, but only ``in certain
applications, depending on the thickness of the film and the
thickness of the glass as well.'' And, he said, those successful
tests were made using special frames designed to hold the shattered
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it pass 1/8-inch glass, like a normal bedroom window?
No,'' Kitchen said last week from the firm's offices in Altamonte
Springs, near Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen said he does not believe the ads are misleading and he
directs distributors to be clear to each potential customer about
what the film will and won't do for that particular home.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kitchen said he had told his Palm Beach County
distributor to change the ``panels and shutters are obsolete'' ad
``instead to reflect our product as a `glass protective system.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another firm Holt contacted, West Palm Beach-based Palm Beach
Security Film, provided him literature saying its film _ Glass
Gard, made in St. Petersburg _ met the small missile impact tests.
The sales literature also says, ``You'll never have to worry about
getting home in time to roll down the shutters or nail up the
plywood.''
</P>
<P>
   When the passages were read to Gary Shapiro, president of Palm
Beach Security Film, he said they'd been copied from literature
created by his partners on Florida's Gulf coast and he agreed they
may suggest window films are the equal of window coverings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll change that if that's the implication people are
getting,'' he said. ``We try not to intimate that it replaces
hurricane shutters. There's no film on the market that will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to give people affordable protection for an
average hurricane. I did not want to intimate that we were fooling
anybody. If people ask us, `Does this meet the code?' No, it
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lankford, senior building technician for the Martin County
Building Department, said: ``We can't accept film as a substitute
until the days when the film is attached to a window and we can
test it as a combined assembly.'' But, she said, ``It's better than
nothing.''

AMAZON SEES GAINS IN ITS LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com said Wednesday that it had lost $317 million in the
second quarter of the year, slightly less than analysts had
expected, and asserted that it had staunched the massive drain on
its cash reserves that raised doubts in the minds of many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the largest online retailer, posted sales of $578
million, up 84 percent from a year earlier. But that was less than
analysts had expected and below the company's own internal target
of 90 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, downplayed the shortfall,
noting that the company's operating profits exceeded its forecasts
because of lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a multibillion dollar business, growing sales by 84 percent
is rapid by any measure,'' Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company has shifted its primary objective from
expanding sales to cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two big buckets where we can invest: growth and
productivity,'' Bezos said. ``We instituted a strategy a year ago
to deploy more resources to improving operating efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has many initiatives, including reducing excess
inventory and putting multiple-item orders into a single box,
rather than shipping them from separate warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Amazon made a 10 percent profit on its shipping and
handling charges in the most recent quarter. In the first quarter,
its shipping costs exceeded shipping revenue by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bezos said that Amazon would not completely halt its
rapid expansion. He told investors in a conference call that it
planned to expand its international operations into a number of
additional countries over the next year and a half. Currently it
has operations in Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the $317 million loss determined by generally
accepted accounting principles, Amazon wants analysts to use its
own formula, which calculates its loss at only $116 million. This
figure excludes $110 million from its share of the losses in the
other Internet companies in which it owns major stakes, such as
Drugstore.Com. It also excludes $80 million in charges related to
acquisitions and $8 million in employee stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding those items, Amazon's loss comes to 33 cents a share.
Analysts had been expecting an operating loss of 35 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon took pains to counter the views of some analysts who have
said that if it continues to lose money at its current rate, it
could run out of cash as soon as the end of this year. The
company's cash did decline to $908 million at the end of the
quarter, from $1 billion at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Jenson, Amazon's chief financial officer, said that by
the end of the year, the company should be back to $1 billion in
cash. But, he acknowledged, that is largely because Amazon, like
all retailers, benefits from the cash from Christmas sales, but
does not have to pay its vendors for two months. Accordingly, its
cash balance will dip in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen declined to predict whether the company would add or lose
cash next year, or for that matter whether it would have a profit
or a loss. He did say, however, that he expects the company's
losses as a percent of sales to decline steadily.
</P>
<P>
   The company boasted that its loss, using its preferred formula,
was 15 percent of sales in the recent quarter down from 21 percent
of sales a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Becker, an analyst with Lehman brothers, praised the
company for the increased efficency, but said investors would
penalize it for the revenue shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors love predictable sales,'' Becker said. ``The fact
the revenues are hard to predict may have a long term effect on
their valuation.'' Becker downgraded Amazon's shares Wednesday
before the earnings were released.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Amazon shares fell by $1.56 to $36.06, on word of
Becker's downgrade and perhaps in continued reaction to the
resignation of Amazon's president Joseph Galli, who said Tuesday
that he would become chief executive of VerticalNet.

Amazon has grown so quickly, but its ambitions are so vast, that it
engenders strong opinions among investors both positive and
negative, although the later have predominated lately, with its
stock off 53 percent for the year.
<P>
   Amazon has become a huge business, with a total of 22.5 million
customers, up 2.5 million in the last quarter. Indeed the company
estimates it has done business with 8 percent of households in the
United States. And its first business, books, has become a major
force in the publishing industry. In July, it sold 410,000 copies
of ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' accounting for nearly
10 percent of the print run for the book
</P>
<P>
   The big debate among investors has been the wisdom of Amazon's
expansion strategy, now that it has moved to offer a broad range of
items.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the most recent quarter, Amazon's combined book,
music and video business in the United states made a a $10 million
profit based on sales of $385 million. A year earlier that business
lost 11 million on sales of $280 million.
</P>
<P>
   The German and British units, lost $35 million on sales of $73
million. A year ago they lost $16 million on sales of $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the new business together lost $65 million on sales of $119
million. A year ago, the company was just entering the toy and
electronics businesses, which lost $40 million on sales of 3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos said he was heartened that these new product lines posted
sales at an annual rate of $500 million a year, and he noted that
sales of consumer electronics were growing particularly briskly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was could we move beyond media products,'' Bezos
said. ``Now the question is how much of the $5 trillion retail
market can we address.''
</P>
<P>
   But Becker said she was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should expand into other categories, but it may take more
time and will be more expected than I had hoped,'' she said.

IN THE LAND OF SHAKESPEARE AND BRIGHAM YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR CITY, Utah _ Flags on Main Street here proclaim ``Tony
2000.'' At the town's Utah Shakespearean Festival, not far from the
majestic Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks, the organizers,
actors and volunteers are still a bit dazed about having won the
regional theater Tony Award last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began in 1962 with just about nothing, a budget of $1,000
and lots of volunteers,'' said Fred C. Adams, 69, the buoyant
founder and executive producer of the festival. ``This Tony Award
was a validation of what we've been striving for over the last four
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a validation of a resilient regional theater that
was virtually unknown in New York until the Tonys but well known
among a Shakespeare underground in the heartland. As many as
155,000 theatergoers, mostly young families and older people from
the Midwest and Far West, surge into this sedate mountain town in
the southwestern corner of Utah each summer for afternoons and
evenings of professional theatrical productions.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there is a substantial and adoring audience ``out
there'' for Shakespeare as well as other dramatists _ not in New
York or Chicago or Los Angeles but in Utah _ might surprise the
Broadway and Off Broadway crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is destination theater,'' said Anthony DeFonte, who is
performing three roles this summer, including Shylock in ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' and has appeared in a number of television
series. ``It's a place where people decide to take a vacation _ to
see six plays in a few days and visit the national parks nearby.
And they're a wonderfully attentive and responsive audience. They
love the ritual of theater and we frequently get standing ovations.
They are really moved by Shakespeare's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Another actor at the festival echoed DeFonte. ``Audiences gasp
openly, they laugh openly, they applaud, there's deep silence,''
said Kathleen McCall, who is playing Portia to DeFonte's Shylock.
``And they are willing to be challenged,'' she added, seated on the
theater's lawn in the pulsing heat before rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's daunting for me,'' McCall said, ``as for all of us,
because they know their Shakespeare so well. Some will come with
the plays, actually reading them as you perform. They'll look at
you strangely if you say a wrong word. They really know the text.
I'm sure at some point I'm going to have people from the audience
saying `the quality of mercy' speech with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some of the other 18 Equity actors who have the top roles
this season, McCall has worked on Broadway, Off Broadway and in
regional theaters. Auditions are held in January and February in
major cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Some roles are
cast with undergraduates; actor-interns are hired for nonspeaking
parts and musical choruses.
</P>
<P>
   The mood at the festival, with its two theaters _ outdoor and
indoor _ its behind-the-scenes tours, lectures and festivities on
the lawns of Southern Utah University (part of the festival grounds
are on the campus), seems ebullient _ almost innocent. The
afternoon that Adams and other executives of the theater returned
from New York after the Tony ceremony, the 350 members of the
festival's company and 400 volunteers lined up around the theaters
and passed the award from one person to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the hands that made it possible,'' Adams said. ``It
was a very moving hour.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, nearly 200 people were sitting on the lawn at dusk,
waiting to enter the 888-seat outdoor Adams Memorial Shakespearean
Theater. It is modeled after the Globe Theater in which
Shakespeare's plays were produced in London, and it is named after
a major benefactor of the festival, Grace Adams Tanner (a distant
cousin of Adams'), and her parents. The audience, which would see
``The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' was being entertained by ``The
Greenshow,'' half a dozen dancers and singers in Renaissance
costume.
</P>
<P>
   Watching them, Nancy Lindon, who grew up in suburban New York,
and her husband, Arthur, who retired in 1992 as director of public
works for the Village of Old Westbury, N.Y., said they had been
visiting the festival for three or four years and loved the plays _
at least most of them. The retired couple live in Pinehurst, N.C.,
but spend their summers in Park City, Utah, in the northern part of
the state, the home of the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caliber of acting is first-rate,'' Lindon said. ``We saw
`Peter Pan' today, and it was fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife nodded. ``We come here for two days and see four shows,
and I love it. I'm from New York. I've seen a lot of theater.
That's top-drawer theater. Well, so is this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lindons voiced one qualification. ``The musicals _
sometimes,'' Lindon said. ``Last year we saw `Damn Yankees' and it
was not good. Doing a musical is not easy. We did see `A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum' here. That was excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Heather Hill, an electronics teacher in Bountiful, Utah,
and her husband, Warren, a dean at Weaver State University in
Ogden, Utah, north of Salt Lake City, said they had been making the
five-hour drive from Ogden to the festival for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of people come here; you meet a lot of teachers and
people interested in the theater and Shakespeare,'' said Hill, who
with his wife used to live on the East Coast and in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These plays are utterly timeless,'' Hill said. ``I remember
going to Stratford, Ontario, to see `Henry V.' It was during the
Vietnam War. He made the speech to the soldiers going into battle
and they were asking, `What are we fighting for?' And I thought,
`My goodness, nothing has changed.' Last year we saw `King Lear'
here. The dynamics of the family is absolutely the same today as it
was back then.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A typical visitor can see all six productions in three days by
choosing matinee and evening performances in both theaters. The
roster this 39th season _ from June 26 to Sept. 2 _ is, in many
ways, typical of the selections each year. In addition to ``The
Merchant of Venice'' and ``The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' the third
Shakespearean production is ``The War of the Roses'' (an adaptation
of ``Henry VI: Parts 1, 2 and 3'' by Howard Jensen, a festival
director).
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare may dominate the calendar but other authors, of
usually mainstream dramas, comedies and musicals, are equally
popular. This year the festival is presenting Chekhov's ``Cherry
Orchard,'' Michael Frayn's farce ``Noises Off'' and an adaptation
of ``Peter Pan'' by Adams, who is also directing. A separate fall
season, held indoors in the Randall L. Jones Theater, runs from
Sept. 14 to Oct. 14. The productions there this season will be the
musical revue ``Always . . . Patsy Cline'' and ``Driving Daisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the festival takes place in a conservative state founded
by Mormons, the selection of non-Shakespeare plays has stirred some
delicate issues for the organizers, many of them Mormon themselves.
Dramas, comedies or musicals with sex, blunt language or edgy
themes can be unwelcome. In ``Noises Off'' this season, the
festival received permission from Frayn to alter the line ``Oh, my
God.'' Now it reads, ``Oh, my Lord.'' Tennessee Williams' ``Glass
Menagerie'' was a big hit several years ago, as was Arthur Miller's
``Death of a Salesman.'' But while ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' has
been done, Tony Kushner's ``Angels in America'' (in which a main
character is a gay Mormon) would very likely be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   A festival press representative put it this way: ``We don't
restrict ourselves because of the content of plays but rather
because of whether the audience would go. So we wouldn't do `Angels
in America' because we probably wouldn't get an audience to watch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be inaccurate to label the festival tradition-bound
and cloaked in the culture of conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Ina Marlowe, the director of ``The Merchant of Venice'' this
year and the managing director of the Organic Theater in Chicago,
said: ``I didn't know any of these people when I came here and it's
been an amazing experience. They have been totally open and
welcoming to me as a woman director. I don't often get that in
larger cities. I was not expecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen F. Conlin, who staged ``The Cherry Orchard'' this
summer and is the festival's casting director, put it another way:
``When you look at the history of Utah, right from the beginning
the church was pro art, music and drama. Brigham Young said drama
was the best way to teach moral values _ especially for those
people who couldn't read. One of the first major buildings
constructed in Salt Lake when the pioneers arrived was a theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Adams, the festival's founder, said that
Shakespeare's dramas struck a chord for audiences in general: ``We
haven't changed since Shakespeare's time. The same longings, the
same cravings, the same desires.'' Mormons, he said, were
especially stirred by Shakespeare: `` `The Merchant of Venice' is
one of the popular plays for Mormon audiences. They see the victim
in Shylock. Having been victimized themselves in their own history,
Mormons take great comfort in seeing this portrayal of humanity
victimized by people who profess to be Christians.'' (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   By every account, the festival owes its birth and growth to
Adams, a friendly and exuberant former actor. A Mormon, he grew up
in central Utah, yearning to be an actor. After a stint in the Army
he went to New York, where he worked in several Off Broadway shows
and was a ``swing'' dancer, an understudy, in the 1953 Cole Porter
musical ``Can-Can.'' By the late 1950s, though, he had moved back
to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York didn't need me and it was important to find a place
that did,'' he said. He took a job in Cedar City at the small
junior college that grew into the university. His task was to set
up a drama department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community was going through a real letdown,'' he recalled.
``The iron mines had closed. The economy was shattered. At that
point I said to the mayor and the city council that I wanted to
start a Shakespeare festival. They thought I was crazy. The idea of
Shakespeare didn't seem to impress any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a local Lions Club, Adams began the festival in
1962 with ``Hamlet,'' ``The Merchant of Venice'' and ``The Taming
of the Shrew.'' Students and local townspeople played the roles on
a makeshift stage. Most of them made their own costumes. They also
put on productions of ``On Borrowed Time'' by Paul Osborn and the
Jule Styne musical ``Bells Are Ringing.'' The festival made a
profit of $2,000 _ and Adams was home free.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the budget has climbed to more than $5 million, nearly 80
percent of it from the sale of tickets, which cost from $18 to $40.
The rest of the money comes from foundation support and private
donors, mostly in Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and
Phoenix. In 1989, the company opened its second space, the stylish
Randall L. Jones Theater (named after the father of tourism in the
region), at a cost of $5.5 million. And now there is a Web site:
www.bard.org.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's appeal has started to lure travelers from the
East Coast. ``I was dubious at first about Shakespeare in Utah _
and very reluctantly I went,'' said Kenneth Adelman, a director of
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency during the Reagan
administration, who has taught Shakespeare courses at Georgetown
and George Washington universities. ``And it blew me out of the
water. This place is in the middle of nowhere. And what you get is
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelman and his family began attending the festival a dozen
years ago. This year, he and about 35 friends from New York,
Chicago, Washington, Buffalo and other cities are attending.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Tony Award has given the festival a visibility it
never had, and Adams said he expected audiences as well as
fund-raising to surge.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he still seemed almost overwhelmed by the
award. At the festival's opening night this summer, Adams described
walking along the red carpet to enter Radio City Music Hall to
accept the Tony.
</P>
<P>
   For the man who didn't make it on Broadway nearly 50 years ago,
it was an especially sweet triumph. ``At long last,'' he said.
``We've been recognized!'' &QL;

 &HT;    Lack of immigration paperwork turns into nightmare
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As a reward for the way Pius Dawson managed
the four Giorgio's clothing stores here, his boss sent him and his
wife on a Caribbean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful trip,'' Dawson said Wednesday of the vacation
paid for by Giorgio's owner George Sharoubim. The trouble began
when the ship docked and he went through customs.
</P>
<P>
   During the two months since, Dawson has been handcuffed, spent
two nights in a orange jumpsuit in the Krome Detention Center in
Miami, been deported and been arrested in Germany. Now he sits in a
Milan hotel, trying to piece his life back together.
</P>
<P>
   All because the British-born Dawson didn't obtain a green
residency card after he married an American four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really got around to putting in the paperwork,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His visitor's visa had expired and he said customs agents told
him to bring $120 and some paperwork a month later to the
immigration office in Riviera Beach. When he arrived, he was
handcuffed, put in a van and driven to Krome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked out of my socks when he said I was being held
and deported,'' said Dawson, 43, who had told co-workers he would
be back in a hour. It's been more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson spent three days at the detention center for illegal
immigrants, calling Sharoubim's lawyer, Ron Kolins, with his single
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experience I wouldn't wish on anyone,'' Dawson said.
``It was dirty. Cockroaches ran all over. I didn't go to the
bathroom the whole time because everyone was watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolins said he made an agreement with INS officials that would
allow Dawson to leave the country voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Kolins bought the plane ticket, but Dawson, who was not allowed
to have anyone but INS agents accompany him to the airport, signed
a paper saying he was being voluntarily deported.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between voluntarily leaving and being
voluntarily deported is huge. It means Dawson cannot apply to come
back to the U.S. for five years, instead of beginning the process
immediately, said INS spokesman Maria Elena Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Sharoubim, who was in Milan at the time, brought Dawson there
and set him up as a liaison between Giorgio's and the factories he
buys from in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens for a reason,'' Dawson said. ``George had
been telling me that I need to get to Italy to understand the other
part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Then this month, Dawson flew to Frankfurt to obtain a copy of a
divorce decree from his first wife, so he could include it in his
U.S. immigration application. He was arrested by German customs,
who had a warrant, several years old, for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing was I'd been in Hamburg only two weeks
earlier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant charges Dawson and two other officers of the
now-defunct Multicultural Society with spending $20,000 in German
government grants on the wrong programs. The other two officers
have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson, who had lived in Germany for 21 years before coming to
the U.S. in 1995 to work for Saks, had helped start the now-defunct
Multicultural Society, which helped integrate rural former Eastern
Europeans into German society by finding them language classes, job
training and the like.
</P>
<P>
   He said he left the group before any of the misspending began.
Nevertheless, he paid the $20,000 after friends helped him raise
it, and a German judge let him leave the country. He said he has a
hearing next month to try to persuade a German judge he was not
responsible and to get his money back.
</P>
<P>
   Once that is cleared up, Dawson said a Miami immigration lawyer
will begin the process to try get him readmitted to the U.S.
</P>

 &HT;    Friends share it all
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Ray Buchanan wasn't kidding when he said he
rolled in the grass when he heard that the Falcons were going to
sign Ashley Ambrose. Buchanan's life was going to improve in two
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose is his best friend, dating back to their days together
as Indianapolis Colts, 1993-95. Their families take vacations
together, they have dabbled in rap music side by side, and they are
roommates in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   And on the football field, Ambrose figures to take a load off
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been Pro Bowl cornerbacks. So now, instead of Buchanan
chasing an opponent's best receiver, he can share the duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was difficult,'' said Buchanan, who followed his
1998 Pro Bowl season with a slow start in 1999. Other teams ``knew
what I was going to be doing in certain situations, and that made
it easy to pick on.''
</P>
<P>
   In offseason telephone conversations, Buchanan told Ambrose,
``Hey, if I don't get somebody in here quick, I ain't going to last
that long.'' Ambrose was about to become a free agent in his
hometown of New Orleans,
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Reeves met with each Falcon player after last season,
Buchanan had a message for the coach: ``I said. 'Sign Ashley
Ambrose.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who made a soft run at Ambrose when he was a free
agent in 1999, wasted little time going hard after him this year.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Feb. 11, the first day of free-agency, Ambrose and his
wife, Monica, were getting ready to leave for the airport when the
telephone rang. Ambrose's agent, Kennard McGuire, said the Falcons
not only were interested but also were waving around a lot of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose wife flew to Cincinnati for a wedding, but he flew to
Atlanta. By the time Ambrose's flight landed at Hartsfield, McGuire
had fielded calls from the Cowboys, Bears, Chargers and other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerback already had made up his mind, even if another
team beat the Falcon's offer. The five-year, $22.5 million contract
already had been worked out. It included a $7.5 million signing
bonus that tied the team high for running back Jamal Anderson a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy and content here,'' he said. ''I thought maybe
this could be a great team and we could do a lot of great things
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose did not show signs of greatness for a while in the NFL.
The Colts drafted him in the second round in 1992, but in four
seasons he started just 12 games and had five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   After signing as a free agent in Cincinnati in 1996, however, he
instantly worked well with secondary coach Ron Meeks, who later
coached in Atlanta 1997-99.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose had eight interceptions that season, defended 20 passes
and made All-Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, whom the Colts drafted in the third round in 1993,
became a full-time starter in 1994 and had 16 interceptions in four
seasons with Indianapolis. He joined the Falcons as a free agent in
1997, and has started all 48 games with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Ambrose, a free agent, could have made a lot of money
by returning to Cincinnati, but he wanted to get out.
</P>
<P>
   He signed in New Orleans for a two-year, $6.95 million deal so
heavily backloaded that $5.25 million of it was due this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints tried to re-work Ambrose' contract during the season
and offered a five-year, $25 million deal with a $6 million signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking about it'' said Ambrose, who has started 63
of his past 64 games, ``but then (Saints owner Tom) Benson pulled
it. I don't think he was comfortable, because he knew he was going
to let (coach Mike Ditka, his staff and the front office) go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose was released after the season because his contract would
not work with the salary cap. But the Saints made another run at
him before free-agency began.
</P>
<P>
   By then, his wife, a native of Indianapolis, had seen enough of
the Crescent City. ``She didn't like the crime,'' Ambrose said.
</P>
<P>
   The door was open for the Falcons, who quickly barged through.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, a Falcon for 14 years, thinks
Ambrose, 29, and Buchanan, 28, form the best corner combination he
has played with. They are better than Deion Sanders-Bobby Butler
and Sanders-Tim McKyer, according to Tuggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got two corners now who can cover,'' coach Dan Reeves
said. ``You can put them in isolated situations, something you have
to be careful of doing unless you have real good corners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons should be able to blitz more often this season,
because they won't have to worry as much about double-teaming on
the side away from Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is in the last year of his contract, wants to
return. Team officials have said they want to sign him to an
extension before he becomes a free agent. His agent, Atlanta's
Hadley Englehard, could meet with Falcons general manager Harold
Richardson next week to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ambrose's presence won't do anything to reduce
Buchanan's chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not like Beavis and Butthead, but we act silly,''
Buchanan said. ``It's kind of hard to find best friends, people you
can trust. But that's the way he is, and I'm glad he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are glad, too. And as long as they keep opposing
receivers from making a lot noise, Ambrose and Buchanan can act as
silly as they want to.

   MUSIC-CLIBURN (Fort Worth, Texas) _ It's 2 a.m. and Michael
Kimmelman is interviewing Van Cliburn at home, where Cliburn is
playing Chopin on an out-of-tune Steinway. Cliburn sings while he
plays and Kimmelman describes the room, the house, the sound,
Cliburn's hands, the picture of his mother, the view of the city.
``Want to hear the F major?'' Cliburn asks. Kimmelman invites

everything from a signed Christo photograph to a work identified as
``Artist Has Same Astrology Chart as Picasso $50.'' Ten days later,
she had placed 20 bids and finally received the victorious message:

<P>
   THEATER-SHAKESPEARE-UTAH (Cedar City, Utah) _ As many as 155,000
theatergoers surge into Cedar City, Utah, each summer for the Utah
Shakespeare Festival. The festival began in 1962 with $1,000. Now
it has a $5 million budget and this year won a Tony award for
regional theater. The afternoon that theater executives returned
from New York after the Tony ceremony, the 350 members of the
festival's company and 400 volunteers passed the award from one
person to another. It was a moving moment, especially for those who
years ago had tried to make it in New York and didn't. By Bernard
Weinraub. &QL;

<P>
   DANCE-LINCOLN-CENTER (New York) _ When Leonard de Paur became
Lincoln Center's director of community relations in 1970, two
things concerned him: the lack of community participation in the
center's activities and the vast, empty plazas. He created a
program that solved both problems _ Lincoln Center Out of Doors.
Now two years after his death, the festival, which starts Aug. 5

in the actor's biggest market, America. By Elvis Mitchell.

   TV-AMERICAN-HIGH (Los Angeles) _ Eschewing paid actors,
writer-producers and most of the crew used on such teen dramas as
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' R.J. Cutler set out to illuminate high
school life at about one-third the cost of those series. In 13
half-hour episodes, ``American High'' tells the stories of 14
students at Highland Park, a public high school near Chicago. The
material of ``American High'' came from 2,800 hours of digital
footage, about 70 percent of it shot by two crews and the balance
provided by ``video diaries'' kept by the subjects. In Los Angeles,
six ``loggers'' entered the characters' conflicts and dialogue into
a database. An eight-person story department selected footage to
become episodes. Now the question is, Will American teen-agers want
to watch real teens with less than perfect complexions? Fox will
find out Aug. 2 when the ``non-fiction drama'' premieres. By Andy

   ART-LONDON (London) _ All over London, the words ``make it new''
have been applied to museums. Through Sept. 17, the National
Gallery is presenting an exhibition in which 24 artists were
invited to choose a painting from the collection and take off from
it however they like. John Russell also recommends seeing the newly
renovated Wallace Collection in Manchester Square; ``The
Holocaust,'' at the Imperial War Museum; and amid the 20th century
masterpieces at the Tate Modern, an awesome video by Bill Viola. On

   ART-NELLIGAN (Brunswick, Maine) _ Emily Nelligan's charcoal
drawings are almost all 10 inches wide by 7 inches high and they
all depict the same landscape: Great Cranberry Island in Maine.
Twenty-six of them ring a galley at the Bowdoin College Museum of
Art here. It's one of the few times Nelligan, who has been making
drawings for more than 50 years, has permitted them to be shown
publicly. Nelligan's work has long been a well-kept secret, but no

</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-BLUEGRASS-MONROE (Undated) _ So closely is the late Bill
Monroe identified with his musical creation, bluegrass, that the
notion of a pre-bluegrass Monroe is almost unheard of. That's why
the new CD ``What Would You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?'' packs
a powerful surprise. It contains 15 of the 60 songs Bill Monroe
recorded as the mandolinist, vocalist and junior partner in the
Monroe Brothers, a red-hot duo that scorched the Carolinas in the
mid-'30s. The 1936 title-song was a hit and Bill was a huge
hillbilly star long before he presided over the birth of an entire
musical genre. The only thing more impressive than Bill Monroe was
Bill Monroe playing with his brother, Big Charlie. By Tony
Scherman.

   MUSIC-BERNSTEIN-CD (Undated) _ Sony Classical has opted to ring

known for golf since the 17th century, when an early form of the
game called kolfspel was played with a wood club on the frozen
canals. The terrain in most places is famously flat, but it has a
handful of world-class courses that offer challenges and beauty. By
Robert Sidorsky.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-NETHERLANDS-LEIDEN (Undated) _ With the exception of
Amsterdam, which has a population nearly seven times that of
Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad range of
museums and historic sites. Rembrandt was born there. In the 17th
century America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before
leaving for the New World. The first tulips in Holland (originally
from Turkey) were planted in the university's botanical garden and
imports from the New World _ tomato, potato, tobacco and corn _

   TRAVEL-INDIA-SPA (Undated) _ If ever there was an escape from
the heat, dust and noise of India's cities, Ananda is it. In a $50

air-conditioned spa and 75-room hotel onto a maharajah's palace.

   AMTRAK (Undated) _ Bookings are at a nine-year high on Amtrak,
which in recent years has reversed the ``Perils of Pauline'' saga
in which the onrushing train, not the damsel on the tracks, is in
danger. Amtrak has has begun to refer to passengers as ``guests''
and a few weeks ago announced a service guarantee backed up with
free tickets. In the first 15 days, 3 free tickets were given out
for every 1,000 passengers. The free tickets were worth $228,000,
but they paid off. Ticket sales in the same period were $57.6
million, up $8.3 million, or 17 percent, above the same period last
year. By Matthew L. Wald.

<P>
   TRAVEL-ESSAY (Undated) _ A vacation is a state of mind,
concludes Marialisa Calta, who lives in Vermont with her family.
That explains why as countless vacationers come to Vermont, she
packs up her family and drives 16-hours north to Prince Edward
Island. She goes to get away from laundry, shopping, cooking and
e-mail. They read books and play hearts and come home to stacks of
mail just like everyone who else who goes on vacation. If that's
not enough to convince her that a vacation is a state of mind, a

does. The friends are thinking of taking a vacation _ in Vermont.

MAYOR SAYS DNC WILL BENEFIT L.A. &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mayor Richard Riordan found himself on the
defensive over the upcoming Democratic National Convention yet
insisted its benefits outweigh any of the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Offering assurances the city is prepared to deal with any
violence from protesters, Riordan said the convention provides an
opportunity to showcase the city to the world -- although the city
has been lax in taking advantage of it so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done a good job in getting the message out to the
public,'' Riordan said in an interview Wednesday on his monthly
``Ask the Mayor'' show on radio station KFWB-AM (980). ``We have
let the opponents of the city -- those who want to make the city
look bad during and after the convention -- get the media
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting organized now. We will have 20,000 members of
the media here and we're going to be the focus of the world during
prime time. To get that kind of attention would cost us $1 billion.
We will show the world our mountains, our beaches and our people
and what a great city we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Riordan said the convention, to be held Aug. 14-17 at
Staples Center, is expected to generate $135 million to $150
million in economic benefit to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor acknowledged the fear of violence, as well as the
problem of having the city contribute up to $4 million after
officials had offered assurances it would be privately funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hard parts of (fund raising) is the big givers in
politics find that they can get more influence by giving directly
to candidates or parties rather than something like the
convention,'' said Riordan, who had to pay up on a $1 million
personal letter of credit to the convention's Host Committee before
the City Council would authorize the city's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money we got for the Host Committee is not political
money. It's from people who love L.A. and it's harder to get that
money than it is from people looking out for their own
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the potential violence, Riordan said he is hopeful it
will not occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to walk a fine line,'' he said. ``We want to defend
everyone's First Amendment rights, but we also are prepared to deal
with anyone who violates the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also criticized Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg for her
proposal -- later overturned -- to make Pershing Square a staging
area for demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people, including Jackie Goldberg, miss the point,''
Riordan said. ``We want the city to be successful (and) safe with
quality jobs. We want to succeed and not look bad during the
Democratic convention. We want to treat demonstrators with respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie Goldberg ought to step back and say what's in the best
interest of L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said she would not respond to any personal attacks but
said she agreed with the mayor on one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any violence,'' Goldberg said. ``The police must
enforce the laws if someone breaks a window or causes a problem.
But 98 percent of the demonstrators -- probably more than that --
agree. Any violence takes away from what they're trying to do.''

ROUX MAKES HIS MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Officially, Lionel Roux of France is the
Mercedes-Benz Cup's ``lucky loser'' because he lost late in
qualifing but he was a late replacement for Andre Agassi, who
withdrew because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Roux is playing like he belongs. After knocking off Taylor
Dent of Newport Beach in the first round, Roux eliminated Jan
Kroslak of Slovak Republic 6-3, 7-6 (7-2) Wednesday to advance to
the quarterfinals at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Roux, 27, has been ranked as high as 48th in the world and has
reached two ATP finals in his career, the last in 1997. But he was
ranked 255th in the world in 1998 and 190th last year.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently rejuvenated, Roux conquered Kroslak by taking
advantage of a huge first serve; he converted nine aces and won 83
percent of his first-serve points.
</P>
<P>
   He erased a 5-4 disadvantage in the second set, winning in 75
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Spadea drops out: Vince Spadea, a member of the United States
Davis Cup team, withdrew because overhydration.
</P>
<P>
   He was examined early Wednesday by tournament doctor George
Fareed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Spadea said. ``I was looking forward to
playing here. I really wanted to start the hard-court season off in
good fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   __ First time's a charm: Making his first Los Angeles appearance
as a professional, Paul Goldstein of Maryland beat Switzerland's
Lorenzo Manta in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, formerly of Stanford, overcame 10 aces. He hasn't
been spectacular on the ATP Tour, entering with a 13-15 career
singles record, but he's looking to parlay some momentum after
reaching Wimbledon's third round.
</P>
<P>
   __ In a rush: It hadn't even gotten hot yet, but Belgium's
Laurence Tieleman sure seemed in a rush to win his morning match
against Israel's Harel Levy. He needed just 51 minutes to triumph
6-4, 6-0, thanks to an overpowering first serve that helped him
record nine aces and win 27 of 32 first-serve points (84 percent).
</P>
<P>
   __ Neighborhood bully: Austalia's Mark Philippoussis, who
entered as the No. 2 seed but became the favorite when top-seeded
Agassi withdrew, defeated Colorado's Scott Humphries 7-5, 7-6 (7-2)
in a first-round matchup Wednesday. Philippoussis is seeking a rare
California trifecta after winning at Indian Wells and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   __ Add Philippoussis: Philippoussis almost was ``discovered'' by
actor Anthony Quinn, who saw Philippoussis at the U.S. Open two
years ago and wanted him to appear in a movie as Quinn's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony called my agent and said he liked my looks,''
Philippoussis said. ``I was going to do the movie but they changed
the scheduling.''

   DEMOCRATS DRILL FOR OIL: No sooner had Dick Cheney been selected
as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate than the Democratic National
Committee put up a Web site, www.bush-cheney.net, as a parody of
the team. With a graphic of an oil well gushing dollars, the Web
site says the two men are ``covered with money from Big Oil'' and
features statements that Cheney's congressional voting record is
more conservative than that of Jesse Helms. A committee spokesman
said the site went up minutes after Cheney's selection was
announced and, so far, it has received more than 15,000 hits. ``We
like to think of our site as like `Dragnet,''' the spokesman said.
``It's just the facts, ma'am.'' The Bush campaign, which has
acquired a large number of domain names to prevent parody sites,
had apparently never purchased the Bush-Cheney combination. A
previous parody Web site by the Democrats was called ``Millionaires
for Bush'' and mocked Bush's tax cut plan.

   THE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   THE NEWEST REPUBLICAN: Rep. Matthew G. Martinez of California
became the latest party-switcher in the House on Wednesday in a
year marked by two other defections, one to each side. Martinez,
who was trounced in his Democratic primary earlier this year,
announced he was becoming a Republican, saying he was disappointed
that Democratic leaders did not do more to help him win
re-election. With his defection, Republicans hold a 223-to-210
advantage over Democrats in the House, not including two
independents. After 18 years in the House, Martinez was defeated by
Hilda Solis, a state senator, who portrayed him as out of touch
with his district. Since his primary defeat, Martinez, 71, has been
siding with Republicans, even on close votes like a
Republican-sponsored prescription drug plan, which passed by three
votes. ``Voters in this country won't forget in November how the
Democratic leadership has treated them for the last two years,''
said House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois.

   KEYES BACKS BUSH TICKET: He did not win a single presidential
primary or caucus, but Alan Keyes, the hard-right radio talk show
host, stayed on the campaign trail long after it was certain that
Gov. George W. Bush was going to be the Republican nominee. Winning
or losing was not as important to him, he insisted, as spreading
his message that the nation must rededicate itself to moral
principles and especially to outlawing abortion. But late Tuesday
in Boston, Keyes, the only black candidate in the 2000 presidential
field, pulled out. Asked if he still considered himself a candidate
with just a week to go before Bush is formally nominated in
Philadelphia, he replied: ``I am not.'' He said he would back the
Bush-Cheney ticket, noting that Bush and his running mate, Dick
Cheney, were strong opponents of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY PLAN PASSES RULES COMMITTEE: The Republican Party moved
a step closer Wednesday to adopting a presidential nomination plan
in which small states would vote first and big states last. The
rules committee of the Republican National Committee, which adopted
the proposal in May, reaffirmed its support of the plan, which was
intended to forestall a drift to a national primary, encourage more
candidates to stay in the race longer and ensure that more votes

early March. The full national committee will vote on Thursday. The
most serious opposition is expected on Friday when the national

required to implement the plan, are joining to fight it there.

   THE MONEY RACE
</P>
<P>
   KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR LOOPHOLES: The sponsors of new
legislation requiring financial disclosure by secretive political
fund-raising committees are worried that politicians have already
found a way around the new law. Sens. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and
John McCain, R-Ariz., have written to the Treasury Department and
the Internal Revenue Service to make clear that they intended the
new law to cover the fund-raising activities of all political
action committees. The issue arose because some lawyers suggested
that the new law, intended to require financial disclosure from
so-called Section 527 groups, named for a provision in the tax
code, might not apply to committees that raised both hard and soft
money. Hard money can be used for any political purpose; soft money
cannot be used to advocate the election or defeat of a specific
candidate. The lawyers said the law might not cover so-called
leadership PACs, which are fund-raising vehicles formed by
congressional leaders. The letters were signed by 17 senators and
four House members.

   GORE AHEAD IN NEW JERSEY: In New Jersey, which both parties view
as a crucial electoral battleground, Vice President Al Gore
continues to hold a slight lead over Gov. George W. Bush, according
to the latest Quinnipiac University poll. The survey of 910
registered voters taken July 19-24, with a margin of sampling error
of 3 percentage points, shows Gore with a lead of 46 percent to 41
percent in a one-on-one race. When small-party candidates are
included, Gore's lead is 42-38 over Bush, with 7 percent for Ralph
Nader and 2 percent for Patrick J. Buchanan. The survey was taken
before Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, who opposes abortion rights,
as his running mate, but the poll suggested that choosing a vice
presidential candidate who favored abortion rights would have done
little to help Bush in New Jersey: 15 percent said they would have
been more likely to vote Republican, 15 percent less likely, and 66
percent said it would have made no difference.

<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   CHATSWORTH, Calif. _ Luminent Inc., a company spun off from MRV
Communications in April, filed for an initial public offering
Wednesday to raise up to $207 million.
</P>
<P>
   Luminent will join a batch of new Internet infrastructure
component makers gone public, including Moorpark's Accelerated
Networks, which went public in June. Luminent counts among its
competitors giants like IBM, Lucent and Agilent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   MRV, also based in Chatsworth, said Credit Suisse First Boston
would lead the underwriting group with CIBC World Markets,
Robertson Stephens, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and First Security
Van Kasper serving as co-managers.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of shares and their price range has not been
determined. MRV will own an undisclosed percentage of the company
when the IPO is finished but it plans to disperse its Luminent
holdings to MRV shareholders within six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   News of the filing was not enough to sustain investor enthusiasm
throughout a trading day that saw most technology stock prices
drop. MRV finished the day down 19 cents to $71 a share on volume
of 7.1 million shares after trading as high as $76.75.
</P>
<P>
   Luminent, with 650 employees, makes fiber-optic network
components for communications networks. Before the Luminent
spinoff, MRV launched companies including router makers Zuma
Networks and Charlotte's Networks, communications infrastructure
maker Zaffire Inc., optical components companies RedC Networks and
Optical Crossing Inc. and business-to-business service provider
Hyperchannel.

   Ford to Lift Fuel Economy Of Sport Utility Vehicles
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor has decided to increase the average fuel economy of
its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years,
people involved in the company's plans said. The increase would be
the first significant change in the fuel economy of any class of
passenger vehicle in almost two decades.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a glimpse of the telecommunications industry's
probable future, visit the 22nd floor of the cavernous networking
center at 60 Hudson St. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is a rack of equipment from Lucent Technologies
transmitting 10 billion bits of information a second over optical
fiber in one link and 2.5 billion in another for Deutsche Telekom.
That's impressive. But just a few feet away is a small purple box
made by Cyras Systems, a California start-up, transmitting 40
billion bits a second for the German company.
</P>
<P>
   Then go uptown to Rockefeller Center, to NBC headquarters.
There, on the ninth floor, are perhaps millions of dollars' worth
of Internet routers from Cisco Systems. And next to them, sitting
no more than 18 inches high, is a cobbled-together system using
gear from Lucent and others that cost no more than $100,000 and is
transmitting more than 750 million bits a second of television to
Nippon Television across the street and Court TV across town.
</P>
<P>
   These striking examples of next-generation technology are
brought to you by an unlikely sponsor, a small private
communications carrier run by a former executive of Qwest
Communications International and based in Hackensack, N.J. It is
called Enkido Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Who? That is just the reaction of many people who work in
communications. But without fanfare or high-profile venture
capital, Enkido, which makes no equipment itself but is audacious
in the technology it uses, may provide the best look at what
communications networks will look like in five years: cheaper,
simpler, more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Enkido itself may not survive that long. In its
embrace of the networking world's sharpest cutting edge, it could
easily begin to bleed. But the place that Enkido (pronounced
en-KEY-doh) and its chairman, Nayel Shafei, are trying to reach
today is just about where most communications companies expect to
end up.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Roeterink, chief technology officer for Deutsche Telekom's
North American operation, said Enkido had recently provided his
company ``an OC-768 connection'' in New York. ``The connection was
completed ahead of schedule and has been successfully in
operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OC-768 is telecommunications shorthand for 40 billion bits a
second. At a time when the quickest traffic flows supported by the
most advanced civilian networks are 10 billion bits a second, it
means Enkido may be running the fastest commercial network
connection anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire high-technology world, there is probably no more
fevered sector than optical communications. Each week, it seems,
brings the story of a small private optical equipment company,
unknown outside the industry, being acquired for billions of
dollars by Lucent, Cisco or Nortel Networks of Canada. Then there
are the public companies. Earlier this month, in what appeared to
be the biggest technology deal yet, JDS Uniphase agreed to spend
$41 billion to acquire the hitherto-obscure SDL Inc., which makes
lasers and other components for optical systems.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the optical arena is so hot is simple. The growth of
the Internet and other data communications has placed unparalleled
demands on the communications infrastructure. Not only must rafts
of additional capacity be built into networks, but those networks
must be reconfigured to carry communications traffic in different
ways. A network structure that works well for voice telephone
traffic may prove horribly inefficient at carrying data.
</P>
<P>
   So carriers ranging from grand dames like AT&AMP;T to debutantes
like Level 3 are spending billions on advanced optical gear and
other equipment often meant to make the best use of their networks
for data traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no company has been as aggressive in deploying
next-generation technology and embracing futuristic network designs
as Enkido. In fairness, Enkido has the luxury of serving only a
handful of customers, allowing it to use less proven systems.
Bigger carriers have to worry more about reliability and by
necessity are more conservative in their network design.
</P>
<P>
   But companies like Deutsche Telekom and NBC have turned to
Enkido for parts of their business because Enkido has delivered big
communications pipelines quickly and cheaply. The Naval Research
Laboratory in Washington, an agency of the Defense Department, is
working with Enkido as it tries to jump-start the next generation
of optical networks in connection with the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, or Darpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to pick winners; we're trying to deal with
anyone who can provide some sort of capability,'' said Hank Dardy,
the laboratory's chief scientist. ``I don't know where Nayel's
going totally, but he's helped to coordinate several things for us
in terms of getting us the right components and connections for the
bandwidth we need.''
</P>
<P>
   At a certain level of abstraction, it's fairly simple to
describe where Shafei wants to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big fat pipes for big fat customers, that's our business,''
said Shafei, who until the spring of 1999 was an executive vice
president at Qwest. ``When I left Qwest, I said, `I can put
together an end-to-end network, both long-haul and local loop, that
will be competing only with Fed-Ex, taking packets door-to-door.'''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds awfully similar to a lot of companies out there,
companies that have far more extensive networks. But it is the way
Enkido is pursuing its vision that makes it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   First, a bit of background. Most communications networks today
are a jumble of languages and systems. These different protocols
and technologies are generally layered upon one another, or within
one another. Imagine a shipment of vases from London to New York.
The vases may be packed into crates, the crates placed into a
shipping container and the container put on a ship. The vases are
all the customers in New York care about, but the crates, container
and ship are all required to get them there safely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now think of optical fiber cables and the equipment that lights
them as the ocean. In most traditional communications networks, the
role of the ship is played by a technology known as Sonet, for
synchronous optical network.
</P>
<P>
   Sonet is reliable, but it can also be inefficient, not only
because a significant amount of communications capacity must be set
aside for ``protection'' in case of a failure, but also because at
the most basic level Sonet packages information in envelopes of 52
million bits of information a second.
</P>
<P>
   On top of Sonet, many carriers deploy a technology known as ATM,
for asynchronous transfer mode. Think of ATM as the big containers.
Containerizing was a revolution for shipping because containers'
uniform size allows them to be shipped easily around the world, by
boat or train, without regard for what is inside. ATM performs a
similar function by packaging voice, video or data communications
into uniform ``cells'' of 53 bytes each.
</P>
<P>
   And then, within the shipping containers, within the ATM cells,
are the actual services that people use: telephone calls, Internet
services, or other data services. There are obviously many other
ways to configure a network, but many if not most of North
America's big carriers use or are moving to this structure of
services.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, what Enkido wants to do is eliminate the ATM and
Sonet layers, which seems perhaps like the equivalent of throwing
those crates of vases into the Thames and expecting them to wash up
in Manhattan in two days. If it works, huge costs and complications
have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds crazy, but that is just where many communications
experts expect the networking world to end up, with some of the
many communications languages becoming extinct or being radically
modified and Internet protocol eventually riding directly over
wavelengths of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were starting now I would go straight to IP,'' said
Pushpendra Mohta, a former AT&AMP;T vice president who is now an
entrepreneur-in-residence at Benchmark Capital, the prominent
venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., and who is just
starting a new wireless data company. ``If I were starting
something now I would make that bet, to get up straight onto
wavelengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Muayyad Al-Chalabi, director for core communications switching
analysis at RHK, a consulting firm in South San Francisco, Calif.,
said: ``The direction is higher and higher speed and elimination of
layers. There's no question about that. The question is who can
support millions and millions of users.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is there, in the question of what communications
executives call ``scalability,'' that Enkido may face its biggest
challenge. It is easy running what some might call a science
project of a network when you have only a handful of customers. But
when the number of customers takes on a fair number of zeroes, the
technology must often be robust enough to take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Enkido is aiming at the fattest of customers: financial
services firms, entertainment companies, other carriers and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Qwest last year, Shafei put a few million of his
own dollars into starting the company and then began approaching
prospective customers and companies that could sell him raw optical
cables across the nation and within the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   With the money he got up front from customers, led by NBC, he
was able to begin buying space for Enkido on optical cables owned
by a panoply of local utilities and by companies running cables
across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Shafei expects Enkido to generate more than $50
million in revenue. As advisers he has signed up Raj Reddy, a
professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and
co-chairman of the President's Information Technology Advisory
Committee, and Robert E. Kahn, who spent 13 years at Darpa before
becoming president of the Corporation for National Research
Initiatives, a nonprofit research group in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Enkido's equity, however, remains with
Shafei. And he does not intend to share any of it with venture
capitalists, whom he views derisively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why on earth do I need to go have a monkey sitting on my
shoulder, telling me `Do this, do that,' and they don't know
anything about the industry,'' Shafei said. ``I'm not a miser with
equity, but I don't like monkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shafei says he has arranged a line of credit from
commercial banks worth $100 million to $200 million and added that
he would consider offering high-yield debt financing, or junk
bonds, in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In his financial plans, as in his technical ones, Shafei is
taking the path untrodden.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have dinosaurs out there in this business, and then you
have dinosaurs with space helmets on, but they're still
dinosaurs,'' he said. ``We're a whole new breed in the evolution
ladder. We have five fingers and five toes.'' &QL;

   FARNBOROUGH, England _ Enough talk. It's time for Boeing and
Airbus to put on the heavy gloves and slug it out.
</P>
<P>
   A3XX vs. 747X Stretch. Twelve rounds. Heavyweight fight for
supremacy as the world's top commercial airplane maker.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it doesn't look like a fair fight. How can Boeing take
an airplane design that is 30 years old and step into the ring
against an Airbus giant that won't even fly for the first time
until at least 2004?
</P>
<P>
   Better stop the fight before it begins. Boeing's first 747-100
lifted off from Paine Field in Everett, Wash., in February 1969.
It's now an aging museum piece at Boeing Field in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Boeing's
leaders, the best and brightest of its engineers, even the father
of the 747 himself, all said a stretched version of the company's
flagship 747, with an improved wing, a new interior and other
modifications, will more than hold its own against the coming A3XX
super jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fifth generation (of the 747) is probably close to the
ultimate development of the airplane,'' said Joe Sutter, who was
chief engineer for the 747 program in the 1960s and is often called
the father of the jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Though he retired from Boeing some years ago, Sutter has been
actively helping the company with the new design and came with the
Boeing team to the air show here.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter also recently accompanied Boeing executives to Singapore
on a mission to help convince Asia's most influential airline that
the 747X Stretch is a better option than the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said again Tuesday at Farnborough
that Boeing could launch its new and improved 747 within six to
nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus says it will launch the A3XX by the end of the year. So
it could be only a matter of months before the battle is joined _
``the final showdown'' between Boeing and Airbus, as a leading
industry analyst has put it.
</P>
<P>
   To set the stage for the coming battle, Airbus and Boeing have
been running large ads touting their respective planes in European
newspapers and industry publications that are distributed daily to
the thousands of air show participants.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expensive advertising campaign, but the stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus does not have a plane that can fly more than 400
passengers. It needs the A3XX _ the baseline version of which will
seat about 555 passengers in three classes in a double deck
configuration _ to break Boeing's monopoly that it has enjoyed for
three decades with its 747.
</P>
<P>
   But the A3XX will cost $12 billion to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing says the market for planes bigger than the 747 _ the
latest version of which is the 747-400 that seats about 416
passengers in three classes _ is not big enough to justify the cost
of developing a new and bigger plane from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   So it has decided to go the derivative route and take the
current 747-400 and significantly improve the plane. This strategy
is far less costly.
</P>
<P>
   The project will likely cost $4 billion to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When Boeing decided to build the 747 in the 1960s, it was a
bet-the-company proposition. The $2 billion in development costs
was more than the entire company was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Boeing has revenues of more than $50 billion a year. So
spending $4 billion to $5 billion does not carry the same risks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Boeing is wrong about the size of the market for a plane
bigger than the 747, then its strategy is wrong and it could take
years to recover with an entirely new big airplane, while the A3XX
firmly establishes itself in the market place.
</P>
<P>
   Condit knows the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to believe very strongly that the way you are
successful is to put your money where your mouth is,'' he said in
an interview. ``Just doing what your competitor does is not the
road to success. ... What you do is make a decision that says, `I'm
going to put my product where I think the heart of the market is,'
and if your competitor doesn't think that's where the heart of the
market is, then one of you is going to be right and one of you is
going to be wrong. Just being equally wrong is not a good
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has made its decision. Much of the preliminary
engineering design work, in fact, is done.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stretching the body of the existing 747-400,
Boeing plans to utilize overhead space in the rear for such things
as storage of galley carts. This frees room for as many as 18
additional seats in the main cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important feature of this model,'' said John
Roundhill, vice president for product strategy and development who
is leading the 747X effort.
</P>
<P>
   When this extra room is combined with the additional seats from
stretching the fuselage, the 747X Stretch will be able to carry as
many as 520 passengers in three classes. That gets it close to the
seating capacity of the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch also will be fitted with the 777-style interior,
with its larger passenger baggage storage bins, and a more modern
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important changes will be in the longer wings.
</P>
<P>
   A root insert where the wing joins the body will improve the
aerodynamics. The wing also gets what is called a ``trailing edge
wedge,'' which was developed by McDonnell Douglas for its MD-11.
</P>
<P>
   It essentially ``tricks'' the air foil and improves drag
characteristics by as much as 1.5 percent, Roundhill said.
</P>
<P>
   The 747-400 is already the fastest commercial jetliner today,
with a cruising speed of Mach .85 (Mach 1 is the speed of sound).
</P>
<P>
   The wing improvements will make the 747X Stretch even faster,
Roundhill said.
</P>
<P>
   The 747X Stretch would enter service in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus claims its A3XX will be on the order of 15 to 20 percent
more efficient than the 747-400.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are showing an improvement in the A3XX that is beyond
anybody's imagination,'' said Seddik Belyamani, executive vice
president of sales and marketing for Boeing who got his engineering
degree in Toulouse, France, home of Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced it can't be done,'' he said of the claimed
A3XX operating efficiencies. ``They are dreaming ... any engineer
will tell you. Ask Joe Sutter. He would never design a double
decker. You are carrying around too much empty weight until you get
up to about 800 passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing looked at a double-decker design in the mid-1990s, when
it actually worked with rival Airbus on a study called the Very
Large Commercial Transport.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing eventually pulled out of the project. Airbus says
Boeing's real motivation for getting involved in the project was to
stall the A3XX project.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing says a double decker does not make sense as a 500- to
600-passenger plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were chief engineer (for Airbus), it would not be a
double decker,'' Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual operating improvements the A3XX will have
over the 747-400, Boeing says the 747X Stretch will be at least as
efficient as the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   And the freighter version of the 747X Stretch will be even
better than the freighter version of the A3XX, according to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The 747X Stretch freighter will be able to carry as much cargo
as the A3XX, but have less weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to be able to match the 747X Stretch freighter
for 25 or 30 years, Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Boeing has to sell the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Waggener, Boeing's deputy director of product marketing,
has spent much of his time on the road in recent months, educating
airlines on the changes that are in store for the 747.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus has been aggressive in trying to launch the A3XX,'' he
said. ``In our view, they are pushing the market. What we are
hearing is that a majority of customers would just as soon see
neither airplane happen for a while. But if something is going to
happen, they want the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The key airline for Boeing and Airbus is Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are clearly the standard, the trend setter,'' said one
industry analyst who did not want to be quoted by name. ``Singapore
has the admiration of other airlines. If Airbus can convert
Singapore to the A3XX, everyone on the Boeing program understands
the implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore is one of nine airlines that have expressed interest
in the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   After Singapore did so a couple of months ago, Boeing dispatched
a high-level team to talk to the airline about the 747X Stretch.
The team included Sutter and Larry Dickenson, Boeing's senior vice
president of sales.
</P>
<P>
   It was a productive trip, said Dickenson.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Singapore Airlines now has 53 747-400s in its
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is trying to access where it would need a plane
bigger than the 747-400, Dickenson said, and a good business case
can be made for a larger plane on the airline's twice-daily London
to Singapore route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the 747X Stretch would be a natural fit there,''
Dickenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ozimek, Boeing's director of product marketing, said the
company is not out to simply knock down the A3XX with customers
such as Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been laying in the bushes on this program (747X) for
sometime, waiting to make sure we know what Airbus is doing before
we declare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are serious. This is not some arm waving in front of a
whole bunch of people to convince them they should not buy the
Airbus plane. ... If the airlines are serious and they show
sufficient interest, that's where we are going next.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, according to Boeing's chairman, Airbus and Boeing
will both sell some planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are all done, they will have sold several hundred,''
Condit said. ``But I don't think they will have sold 1,000 or any
number like that. Their ability to say in the end that this (A3XX)
has been a good investment, a proper use of shareholder funds,
well, they are going to have a real challenge there. That's what
the market is telling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter has no doubt that his baby, the 747, will still be
standing in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could be chief engineer on either of these projects, I'd
pick the 747X Stretch because I would be with the winner,'' he
said.

VOTING RECORD DOGS CHENEY AS GOP TEAM CAMPAIGNS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ Gov. George W. Bush and his new running mate,
Dick Cheney, made a whirlwind visit to the vice-presidential
contender's home state Wednesday, defending Cheney's conservative
voting record and vowing that the ticket would ``renew America's
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first campaign trip, Bush struck more partisan tones
than usual, hammering away at the integrity and trustworthiness of
the Clinton administration. He presented the all-Western Republican
ticket as the antidote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick and I both have roots in the West,'' Bush of Texas told a
chanting crowd packed into the gymnasium of the high school that
Cheney, 59, attended. ``The West is a place full of straightforward
people who usually say what they mean and mean what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush reached back to one of President Clinton's well-known
evasions in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ``The West is full of
people who understand the meaning of what the word is is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Bush announced that he had selected his father's
former defense secretary as his running mate, the Texas governor
was quickly hit with questions about Cheney's voting record in his
decade in the House. He and the Gore campaign engaged in a fierce
cross-country competition to define what voters thought about
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously thought about the record,'' Bush said. ``And this
is a conservative man. So am I.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his aides said the selection of Cheney showed
that Bush was putting political considerations aside to make a
sober-minded decision on a running mate who could serve as
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings some strength to the administration,'' Bush said in
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks volumes that I'm willing to pick somebody who is as
strong a man as he is,'' Bush said, ``that I'm comfortable with
having excellence by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also said the choice spoke volumes, about whether
Bush really is a new kind of Republican or a throwback to the past.
They pointed to Cheney's conservative voting record as well as his
service in the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon,
Gerald R. Ford and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's record included votes against the Head Start education
program, against banning so-called cop-killer bullets, against
imposing economic sanctions on the government of South Africa and
against a nonbinding House resolution calling for the release of
the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm generally proud of my record in the House,'' Cheney told
reporters. He said that he could ``probably find some'' votes
``that I might tweak and do differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney defended his votes, largely cast in the Reagan
administration, as appropriate to the 1980s ``when we had huge
budget deficits, no money and when we really had to be concerned
about controlling federal spending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we're in a different era,'' he said. ``We've got a
surplus. We've got the opportunity now, I think, to go do some
things we could not have done 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters to explain his stance on Mandela, Cheney
said he had voted against sanctions on South Africa because he has
generally opposed unilateral sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also turned aside Democratic questions about
their links to the oil industry. Cheney is stepping down as the
chief executive of the Halliburton Co., a worldwide oil services
company based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of Halliburton,'' Cheney said. ``I have nothing
to apologize for.'' He described it as a company that had started
small as the brainchild of one man and become ``the quintessential
American success story.'' Bush said his opponents were trying to
``divert attention from the fact that the Democrats have no energy
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign presented the trip to Natrona High School as a
sentimental journey to the hometown where Cheney met his wife,
Lynne. He was the class president and a captain of the football
team. She was the prom queen, and as Bush added Wednesday, a
``nationally ranked champion baton twirler.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a long and lingering homecoming. The appearance in
the school, the lone rally of the day, lasted about 45 minutes.
Aides said Cheney had to return to Dallas for a business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A cheering crowd in the hundreds packed the gym and another
1,000 people waited in a spillover room.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Geringer warmed up the audience and dismissed the talk
of Cheney's voting record. ``I'd rather have Vice President Cheney
with his heart, than President Gore with no backbone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney gazed out at the crowd and said, ``They never treated me
this well when I was their congressman.'' And he joked that his
high school classmates would have been more likely to expect his
wife to return one day as a candidate on a national ticket. ``But
they never would have guessed it was going to be me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush, not his running mate, who seemed in a feisty mood.
As he brought Cheney down the aisle of his campaign plane,
reporters asked the governor what he thought of the Democrats'
reaction to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was it?'' he asked. ``Belittling? I'm not surprised that
they would try to belittle the pick. Typical.''

IN VICTORY FOR RECORDING INDUSTRY, JUDGE BARS ONLINE MUSIC SHARING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Wash., Pa.)  By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the recording industry, a
federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to
stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the
major music labels.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's lawyer said the decision could effectively shut down
the service.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction,
Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S. District Court in San Francisco
ruled that the explosively popular Napster service was used
primarily to trade copyrighted material, a behavior that Patel said
Napster knew about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of Napster users use the service to download and
upload copyrighted music,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday
and will continue pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become the rallying point for competing interests
in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet, with lawyers,
consumers, policy-makers and entrepreneurs watching closely. And
legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond
music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set a
tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the lead lawyer for Napster, said the company would
immediately appeal. He said that Napster did not have the ability
to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented
copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
</P>
<P>
   This injunction ``does not give us any fair ability to comply
and still operate,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Barry, interim chief executive of Napster, held an Internet
Webcast to address the ruling to Napster's users; the company says
20 million people have downloaded its software.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry declared the decision a major and
complete victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends the message to others who are building businesses
based on other people's copyrighted works without permission,''
said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the judge's language, this was not a close call,'' said
Howard King, who represents the rock group Metallica and the artist
Dr. Dre in separate lawsuits against Napster. King called the
decision a ``huge win.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording association said it would post a $5 million bond
requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could
suffer from being shut down pending the trial. Napster had asked
for a bond of at least $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a year-old company based in San Mateo, Calif., makes
software that allows computer users to download free software that
in turn lets them post the lists of music files they store on their
own computers. Other Napster users then can listen to or download
music kept on others' computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not alone; other services that permit file sharing, like
Gnutella, have grown, too. Last week, the recording industry and
the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour
Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users
download music and video files.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner
Inc., the Sony Corp., Bertelsmann and other record companies,
represented by the recording association, sued the service for
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents major record labels,
asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
The industry contends that Napster has built a business by
encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not
own.
</P>
<P>
   But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and
therefore it is doing nothing wrong. Rather, the company says, they
are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all
along _ the copying of music and other media for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in ``wholesale
infringing,'' and that the users were not engaged in ``typical
personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said the users reaped economic advantage from
making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they
might ordinarily pay for.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording
industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within
six months. The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded
14,000 songs a minute. ``This is the most egregious case of massive
copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Russell Frackman, a
record label lawyer, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case
against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted
because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's
uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works that do
not have copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Boies cited the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was
not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax
videocassette recorder, in part because the device was ``capable of
substantial noninfringing uses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patel did not accept the argument. ``While Napster may be
capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to
what Napster was created for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's
impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
</P>
<P>
   One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania, found that ``over 91 percent of
Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used
Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to a survey the recording association
commissioned from the Field Research Corp., a San Francisco-based
research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of
Napster, they did not buy CDs any more or they bought fewer CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Patel suggested that by the time of the trial, more work on the
effect of Napster would have to be done, noting that none of the
studies presented were ``without flaws.''

MICROSOFT ASKS SUPREME COURT TO SEND CASE TO APPEALS COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a legal document filed Wednesday, Microsoft argued that the
government's antitrust case is ``completely unsuitable for direct
appeal'' to the U.S. Supreme Court because it is complex and
because the trial judge made ``serious and substantive procedural
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants its appeal to go first to the federal appeals
court in Washington, which ruled in favor of the company in a
related case.
</P>
<P>
   The company's argument, filed with the Supreme Court, rests
heavily on a scathing attack on the work of Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who heard the lawsuit in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft document, citing interviews Jackson granted to new
organizations, including The New York Times, stated, ``The district
court's blunt comments to the press raise serious questions about
its impartiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also questioned the even-handedness of Jackson's
decisions in general. First, the company asserted, the judge
improperly allowed the Justice Department and 19 states suing the
company to broaden their case. Then, after allowing the additional
evidence, Jackson assured the company that his findings would be
based on the more limited, original complaint, according to the
Microsoft filing.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``assurances,'' the company stated, ``the district court
would later repudiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled earlier this year that Microsoft was a monopolist
that had repeatedly violated antitrust laws, and he ordered that
the company be split in two _ an order he later shelved pending
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes straight to the Supreme Court, it could be
resolved in a year. If it goes first to the appeals court, the
resolution might take up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   The government is seeking to have the Supreme Court hear the
appeal directly and sidestep a review by a federal appeals court.
Direct appeals to the court are permitted in major antitrust cases
brought by the government. Four of the nine justices must vote in
favor for the case to go directly from the district court.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, Microsoft is trying to persuade the court that
the appeal will involve a thicket of technical issues, procedural
challenges and disputed facts. Sorting out these matters, Microsoft
says, will involve poring over the voluminous written record of the
lengthy trial _ precisely the kind of winnowing usually left to an
appeals court. The Justice Department had no comment Wednesday,
other than a brief statement saying that the government ``will
respond in its filing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, there is little mystery about what the government's theme
will probably be when it files its brief with the court on Aug. 15.
First, according to legal experts, the government will say that the
factual findings are clear and that the issues for appeal are a
couple of big legal questions _ precisely the kind of major
judgments of law that the court so often reserves for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The big legal issues, they say, are whether Microsoft's bundling
of its Internet browser with its industry-standard Windows
operating system was an illegal tying of two products and whether
Microsoft's dealings with other companies was indeed ``monopolizing
conduct,'' in legal parlance. Jackson ruled that Microsoft's
bundling move and its behavior did violate antitrust laws, and
Microsoft is appealing his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also expected to make a forceful policy
argument for the expedited appeal, given the importance of computer
industry to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will say that Microsoft's monopoly is imposing
a significant social cost while this case is on appeal and no
remedies are in place,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the
University of Iowa law school. ``It will say that not taking the
case is a costly act, and that this is exactly the kind of case
that was meant to go directly to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 30-page filing, Microsoft stated that the case ``went
badly awry from the outset,'' referring to Jackson's decision to
permit the government to add additional evidence after the suit was
filed in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That move, Microsoft said, allowed the Justice Department and
states to ``transform their case beyond recognition.'' In doing so,
Microsoft declared that the judge ``committed an array of serious
and substantive procedural errors.''
</P>
<P>
   These errors, Microsoft said, included giving the company too
little time for discovery and preparation of its defense to the
expanding array of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evidence in the case, Microsoft contends, should
have been tossed aside as not being suitable for admission in
court. ``The district court,'' Microsoft stated, ``largely
suspended application of the federal rules of evidence, admitting
numerous newspaper and magazine articles and other rank hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, legal analysts say, did allow a wide range of written
evidence in the case. But he gave that leeway to both sides, they
said, noting that Microsoft submitted many newspaper articles, even
press releases, as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And the government maintained that the additional evidence
presented after the complaint was filed was part of the ``pattern''
of anti-competitive practices Microsoft used to stifle competition.
Thus, the government said, the additional evidence involving
companies like Intel and Apple was not an expansion of the original
complaint, but merely further examples that fit the same pattern of
behavior. Jackson agreed with the government.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, Microsoft suggested that in its appeal, the
company will seek to make sure that it no longer appears before
Jackson. It said his comments to the press should be considered
grounds for a reversal or, at least, the basis for having the case
sent to another district court judge if his remedy order is
remanded for hearings, which is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has explained that he spoke to the press because, given
the importance and prominence of the Microsoft case, he thought
that there was a public interest to be served by speaking to the
press about his reasoning. None of the press articles were
published until after he had issued his final order in June. But he
did give interviews beforehand with The New York Times, which
Microsoft cited in the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University law
school who specializes in legal ethics, noted that the code of
conduct for the federal judiciary states that ``a judge should
avoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's comments to the press, Gillers said, could well give
Microsoft a basis for avoiding Jackson's court in the future. He
termed Microsoft's assault on Jackson's work ``uncommon but
understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridges between Microsoft and Judge Jackson have been
burned,'' Gillers said. ``Microsoft has nothing to lose.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: RECORDING INDUSTRY SHAKEN BY NEW TECHNOLOGY AND
ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 2nd graf for updating; also see NAPSTER-SHUTDOWN) 
 By HAL R. VARIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly any kind of information _ print, images, sounds or videos
_ can be turned into a stream of bits and transmitted over the
Internet. This fact has profound implications for the economics of
industries that provide such information. The most recent example
is Napster, the music directory service available over the
Internet. Napster is being sued by the Recording Industry
Association of America on the ground that it enables people to copy
and share music illegally; Wednesday, a federal judge issued a
preliminary injunction blocking Napster from permitting the
exchanging of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
This is an important case, but it is only a skirmish in a larger
battle over the technological and economic forces that are shaking
up the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Napster uses a centralized directory, so it can be forced to
shut down. But other systems, like Gnutella and Freenet, have
directories distributed over thousands of computers, making them
much more difficult to control. Some systems use strong
cryptography, so it is impossible to determine what, exactly, is
being shared. Even if Napster is forced to shut down, such
technologies will ensure that widespread Internet distribution of
copyrighted material will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry argues that it cannot survive in its present
form without additional intellectual property protection. There is
some justification for this view. During the French Revolution, one
of the first acts of the new National Assembly was to eliminate
copyrights. Within a few years, only pornography and seditious
material was being published. Though such material can apparently
survive any intellectual property regime, the French had to
reinstate copyrights to provide incentives to produce more
substantive works.
</P>
<P>
   The current turmoil in the music industry is a result not of a
political revolution but of a technological one. The question
should not be whether the current business model for music
distribution can survive, but whether there is any business model
that can support the creation and dissemination of high-quality
music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry has pinned its hopes on the Secure Music
Digital Initiative, a copy protection standard. There are two
difficulties with this approach. The first is technological: there
is no way to protect the music once it has been translated into
audible sound. A user can capture the music in analog form using a
microphone or alligator clips on the speaker wires, then redigitize
it and distribute it to others over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The second, more critical, difficulty is economic: If you are
given the choice between paying $2 for a copy-protected song by a
well-known band that can be played only on certain devices, and a
free, unprotected song by a garage band that can be played on any
device, you may well find the latter choice more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Today, tens of thousands of musicians, amateur and professional,
freely distribute heir music over the Internet. Fee-to-listen music
will have to compete with this free-to-listen music, making it
difficult to charge a high price for copy-protected content.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s much personal computer software was copy protected.
Programs to copy such software were widely available, so copy
protection was not very effective in dealing with piracy. But the
real problem was that copy protection was inconvenient, and
inconvenience offers a major opportunity for competitors. In a
two-year period, Lotus, the leading producer of spreadsheet
software, was forced both to cut its price sharply and to eliminate
copy protection, not because of software pirates but because it was
losing sales to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   These factors suggest that the current business model for music
distribution is unlikely to survive. But this doesn't mean there
will be no music; it just means the business will have to change.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s there was heated debate about the right business
model for broadcast radio. How can you support production of
something that must be given away? A hobbyist magazine even
sponsored a contest in which the winner advocated a tax on vacuum
tubes. In the United States, of course, advertiser support won out.
</P>
<P>
   What made this work was the rise of nationwide networks. You
don't have to make much per listener if you have millions of
listeners. Today, the Internet means that musicians have access to
a global market. The question is how to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Many possible business approaches could be explored. Stephen
King is trying a ``ransom'' model. He has released two chapters of
a book and will release the rest if fans send in enough money.
Metallica, which has sued Napster, could experiment with variations
on the same theme: release 10 seconds of a new song, pledging to
deliver the rest only if listeners send in the required ransom. For
extra motivation, fans who contribute could receive special
treatment _ autographs, coupons for T-shirts, a lottery ticket to
meet the performers, or some other benefit that would encourage
them to contribute rather than get a free ride.
</P>
<P>
   This particular business model sounds unusual, but it isn't all
that different from a subscription. Most readers of this column pay
in advance for a physical copy of a newspaper, even though they
don't know what will be in it. Moreover, much newspaper content is
freely available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry makes money because it controls the
distribution channels and the marketing channels of popular music.
The Internet offers a superior method of distribution, so control
of conventional channels is becoming less valuable. But at the same
time, expertise in marketing music is becoming more valuable. The
more content becomes available, the more important it becomes to
distinguish your content from that of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Today, music companies contract with bands for content that they
then distribute and promote. Perhaps in the future, bands will
distribute their own content, making money from subscriptions, live
performances, and T-shirts, while paying the music companies to
handle marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   From the viewpoint of economic policy, the critical thing is to
set up a legal environment that provides sufficient incentives to
the various parties to create and distribute creative work. There
is no requirement that the law should try to preserve current ways
of conducting business. Indeed, the rewards should go to those
companies, incumbents or entrepreneurs, that take the risk of
experimentation to find the models that fully realize the potential
of new communications technologies. &QL;

WELCOME MAT IS OUT, BUT WILL JUAN SEE IT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good morning, Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up, sleepy head. Hope you slept well last night now that
you're back home in Texas. Here, let me open those curtains for you
and let some Lone Star sunshine back into your life.
</P>
<P>
   I brought up your newspaper _ the ``Star-Telegram'', of course _
some freshly squeezed orange juice and greetings from your old
friends, the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else you need? Wash your Mercedes? Mow the lawn (I can
get to it right after I finish Galloway's). I'd massage that sore
foot of yours, but it seems that Luis Mayoral has that job well
handled, as always.
</P>
<P>
   Just wanted to let you know, Juando, that nobody around here
thinks you burned any bridges after the trade last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in the Rangers' front office can't officially talk about
you and your impending free agency, because that would be tampering
you know, but I can assure you, as an outside source, that no one
bears you any ill will here.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, you had your occasional ``misunderstandings'' with the
manager, but you know Johnny Oates. He's as sweet a guy as you'd
ever hope to meet. He knows you have a good heart and mean well.
Besides, he has had guys 10 times worse than you pass through his
clubhouse, one or two since you've been gone.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you were never a major problem, except maybe when your
pants didn't fit right or you wanted to skip the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the club was a little embarrassed over that situation,
but, hey, let bygones be bygones. That's all in the past now, and
it just so happens that the Rangers will go into the off-season
looking for a power-hitting, run-producing outfielder-DH.
</P>
<P>
   Duuuhhhh. Doesn't that just fit your description to a tee?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it did anyway before you went to Detroit. You've had a,
shall we say, forgettable season there. Not sure how smart it was
for you to stand up in front of your locker in the Tigers'
clubhouse at Comerica Park this week and suggest that maybe you'd
stick around if they'd just consent to cutting that left-field
power alley down to Yellowstone Park dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   I know, it's ridiculous. It's like the architect took a look at
left field one day during construction and said, ``Hmmm, why don't
we biggie-size it?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, by now you should know that players, no matter how
good they are, can't dictate the dimensions of the playing field.
Just won't work and it doesn't sit well with the fans, especially
when you've spent a third of the season out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   I see where one of the Detroit papers ran a chart on your time
spent on the disabled list the other day. Looked pretty familiar,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   Your old buddies, Raffy and Pudge, have already suggested the
Rangers should get you back this off-season, and a Detroit
columnist irrationally said that the Tigers should send you back to
Texas before the trade deadline. I can assure you, that ain't going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers are going to be doing anything this week, it'll
be dumping salary, not taking it on.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be another story this winter. Interested in coming
back home?
</P>
<P>
   They tell me you've never really been a good fit in Detroit,
which comes as no surprise to those who know you. There was never
any real expectation here that you'd be staying on with the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got this big new clubhouse there, a real major-league
clubhouse, with a big-screen TV and some couches and chairs down at
one end,'' a Detroit sportswriter friend was telling me the other
day. ``There's always a group of players down there. Then way down
at the other end of the clubhouse, there's Juan, all by himself
except for that entourage of his.''
</P>
<P>
   I've read where you, or more likely Mayoral, insist that you're
``happy'' in Detroit. Sorry, I'm not buying that. I know you too
well. I know with the paltry numbers you've put up, you can't be
very happy.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's the deal, Juando. There ain't gonna be no $140
million contract this winter. You had your chance at it and let it
go. Good for you. Money's not everything. But you're dead wrong if
you believe someone else out there is going to pony up that kind of
bread after the season you've had.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't be the Rangers. They might like to have you
come home, but it'll have to be at a price they're comfortable with
paying. And it almost surely won't include a job for your trusted
adviser, the affable Mayoral.
</P>
<P>
   You might not have burned any bridges here, Juan, but Luis most
likely did when he was quoted in ``Sports Illustrated'' blaming
poor John Blake, the Rangers' vice president in charge of media
relations, for the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Let me let you in on something: John Blake is probably the best
PR director in the history of professional sports, but he doesn't
have that kind of power. If he didn't like you, he never let me
know it, and I was around him regularly throughout your career in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   LAJ _ Life After Juan _ hasn't been so good for the Rangers.
Their outfield production this year stinks. Even if they decide to
come back next year with the three starters they opened with in
April, they'll still need a productive DH, part-time outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   You might need a job. They're going to have an opening.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes life actually looks as if there's some sort of grand
plan at work, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Go out there tonight and wow them, Juando. Make 'em remember
what the good times were like.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the first day of the rest of your life.

FERREIRA INTO QUARTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We learned two things about Wayne Ferreira on
Wednesday: He's a slow starter, but more important he's a fast
finisher.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira, South Africa's No. 1 tennis player, lost five of the
first seven games in his second-round match against Thailand's
Paradorn Srichaphan but triumphed 7-6 (7-1), 4-6, 7-5 to make the
Mercedes-Benz Cup quarterfinals at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon match lasting two hours, 17 minutes in
100-degree heat, fifth-seeded Ferreira was at his best at the end,
winning eight of the last nine points to take the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it just took a while to get my rhythm,'' Ferreira
said. ``He came out hitting hard from the very beginning and I
started kind of slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's Srichaphan is a Bjorn Borg disciple, preferring to
plant himself near the baseline and wait for passing-shot
opportunities or for his opponent to make the mistake. But toward
the end of the third set he changed his strategy _ perhaps even
panicked _ and foiled an opportunity for the tournament's first
major upset. Srichaphan began charging the net, and Ferreira,
stroking more confidently than ever in the latter stages, took
advantage with some wicked passing shots that clinched the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I was leading, I felt nervous, like Wayne was gonna
get me,'' Srichaphan said. ``I try not to think that way, but I
just didn't think I'd win. I tried to go for it too much at the end
and finish the points a little too fast, but I couldn't get them. I
tried my best, but Wayne's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Srichaphan's collapse wasn't because he was fatigued. He pointed
out that practicing in sticky Bangkok is more grueling than any
conditions Los Angeles has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreria impressed with his stamina. With some of the ATP's
biggest names not competing in this tournament _ top-seeded Andre
Agassi is among several impact players who bowed out because of
injuries _ Ferreira's victory might be just the platform he needs
to steal his first singles title in more than two years. His best
Los Angeles finish was last year when he reached the quarterfinals.
Wednesday's victory upped his ATP record to 25-13 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a long tough match, but I actually feel pretty
good,'' Ferreira said. ``I'm feeling confident and more positive.
It was hot today, but I've been here for a few days and I'm used to
the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira, 28, said he hasn't done much of anything since losing
in the fourth round at Wimbledon a month ago. He took a break from
tennis, deciding hanging out with his infant son and giving him his
6 a.m. feedings was more important than brooding about the way he
lost at Wimbledon _ to 237th seed Vladimir Voltchkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to be a dad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did make a resolution before coming to Los Angeles, vowing to
forget about rankings and concentrate only on winning the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you haven't won in 2 years, winning starts becoming
extremely important,'' he said. ``For me, that's my focus now.
Plus, when guys like Andre Agassi and (Gustavo) Kuerton drop out,
it makes it a lot easier.''

DR. DOT BECOMES AMERICA'S FIRST NAME IN SOFTBALL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let's see ... Sports for $200, Alex.'' ``Answer: Dot
Richardson plays this sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is softball?'' ``Correct.''
</P>
<P>
   For most casual sports-trivia fans this is an automatic; many
people have heard of Dot Richardson. To the answer of this actual
``Jeopardy!'' question, it is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the answer in a crossword puzzle once, too,'' Richardson
said. ``It's really awkward and very humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity seems to grace the brow of anonymous athletes every
four years during the Olympic Games. For most Olympians, the ripple
of popularity hits the edge of the pond when the Games end. For a
few, the ripple turns into a wave.
</P>
<P>
   So it has for Richardson, 38, who will be in Fort Worth on
Saturday with the U.S. team for two exhibition games at Gateway
Park. The darling of the 1996 gold medal-winning U.S. softball team
has become the rarest of Olympians. While Richardson has made a
career from two weeks of Olympic fame, her fame also has reflected
on her teammates and her sport.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dot Richardson is synonymous with softball. Maybe it's
because of her Web site, drshortstop.com, or her book, ``Living the
Dream''. Or maybe it's because aspiring young players have watched
some of her instructional videos. Or heard her speak at clinics. Or
seen her on the Family Channel. Or used her official softball bat
or glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little girl asked me once, `Wow, how does it feel to have
your name on a bat?' '' Richardson said. ``What's more incredible
is to see a person use your bat or other countries use our bats. As
they are holding that bat they are truly holding the incredible
evolution of women in sport. They know now it's possible to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 Olympics, Richardson already was an accomplished
softball player. She was selected the NCAA player of the decade for
the 1980s, won countless gold medals in international competition,
was a four-time All-American at UCLA, and was a 15-time
all-American Softball Association selection. The Olympics made
Richardson and her teammates golden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dot is probably the greatest ambassador softball has ever
known,'' Nike U.S. sports marketing program director Eddie Brown
said. ``In the U.S. she is a legend. On top of that, she is now a
surgeon, which speaks volumes about the types of athletes who are
competing for the U.S. There are stories like this in other sports;
these are extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   They are ordinary people pursuing extraordinary feats, whereas
most glorified professional athletes lead lives few can comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time this is an athlete's once-in-a-lifetime shot
at glory. People recognize that dedication and sacrifice,'' NBC
spokesman Mike McCarley said. ``There always seems to be an athlete
the vast majority of the viewing audience doesn't know and because
of some remarkable feat or amazing story they become a household
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was because Richardson had the first hit, run and home
run in Olympic softball competition. Maybe it was because she hit a
home run in the United States' gold-medal victory against China.
Maybe it was because NBC host Bob Costas interviewed her on
national television. Or maybe it was because she had the
captivating name ``Dr. Dot.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a practicing orthopedic surgeon from Los Angeles,
who completed her medical training while playing softball, still
drives a car with more than 120,000 miles on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dented in the front,'' she said. ``There are some other
dings in it from softball.''
</P>
<P>
   The $26,000 stipend for medical school, however, has been
replaced by heftier checks for speaking engagements and
endorsements from companies such as Xerox, Louisville Slugger and
Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Olympics, I would lose money on softball almost
every year just on travel,'' Richardson said. ``It took me a while
to buy that car. I lived in a dorm room at med school. I lived with
my parents while I trained for Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days, however, are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have to worry about \Rmoney\S anymore,'' she
said. ``It's almost all attributable to those two weeks in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, softball was not intended to be covered live in
1996, but the team's success mandated coverage. For the 2000 Sydney
Olympics, every U.S. softball game will be carried by one of NBC's
three outlets (NBC, MSNBC and CNBC).
</P>
<P>
   Nike has its own signature shoe for pitcher Michele Smith. Major
League Baseball is considering getting involved with the four-team
Women's Professional Softball League.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, meanwhile, prepares for one more shot at a gold
medal, which likely will mean more exposure, another trip to the
White House, more interviews, more speaking at clinics and
motivational speeches to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in high school I had to get up in front of class
and speak in Spanish,'' Richardson said. ``I went back to my seat
and said to God, `I will speak in front of however many people you
want, just let it be in English.'''
</P>
<P>
   With her rise, Richardson is making good on that promise. nn

U.S. APPEALS PANEL SAYS NEW JERSEY CAN'T BAN ABORTION PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal appeals panel here struck down as
unconstitutional New Jersey's ban on so-called partial-birth
abortions. The decision Wednesday mirrored a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling in June.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous 40-page decision by a panel of the 3rd Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals was seen as a victory by abortion-rights
groups that had challenged the 1997 law. It was a vindication as
well for Gov. Christie Whitman, whose conditional veto of the
measure pointed to its constitutional flaws as well as to ways of
remedying them, but was overridden by the Legislature in an
emotionally charged debate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Legislature spent nearly $500,000 on private
lawyers to defend the law, which was not enforced while it moved
through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the three-judge appeals panel upheld a 1999 U.S.
District Court ruling, agreeing that the New Jersey law was
``unconstitutionally and incurably vague'' in its ban on a
late-term procedure that opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.''
And in that vagueness, the panel said, the act imposed an ``undue
burden'' on the constitutionally protected right of a woman to an
abortion and could be construed to ban all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, we, as was the District Court, are left to wonder
whether the drafters chose a path of deliberate ambiguity, coupled
with public outrage based largely on misinformation, in an attempt
to proscribe legitimate abortion practices,'' the ruling said.
``The Legislature could have passed a statute of more limited reach
and still achieve its supposed objective. Instead, it decided to go
farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, writing for the panel, noted that it
had reached and written its opinion in the case before the U.S.
Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Nebraska on June 28.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The high court said the Nebraska law was vague, that it put an
undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion and that it lacked
any exception for the life and health of the woman involved. But
because ``nothing in that opinion is at odds with this court's
opinion,'' Barry wrote, the panel issued its opinion without
revisions or changes.
</P>
<P>
   The other panelists were Judge Leonard I. Garth and Judge Samuel
A. Alito, who wrote a separate but concurring opinion. Alito said
he favored finding the New Jersey law unconstitutional, stressing
that any limits on abortion must have an exception for the
preservation of the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Currently about 30 states have similar bans on the procedure,
which opponents describe as any procedure in which the person
performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living
unborn child, then kills it and completes the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the state Legislature paid a private lawyer
$412,759 to defend the law, which they passed over the governor's
veto and which the state attorney general and their own legislative
counsel had warned them was flawed. Rae Hutton, a spokesman for
Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who along with the Assembly
speaker pressed the override of Whitman's veto, said Wednesday that
the ruling had come as no surprise in light of the Supreme Court's
ruling last month. But she added: ``We are looking at it to decide
how to proceed and whether to appeal it.''
</P>
<P>
   Talcott Camp, a lawyer with the Reproductive Freedom Unit of the
American Civil Liberties Union who represented Planned Parenthood
of New Jersey and the state's ACLU chapter in their challenge of
the law, called the ruling a vindication of women's constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now doctors can continue to provide New Jersey women with the
best care possible without this dangerous law that had a complete
disregard for women's health,'' Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Whitman, pointed out that she
had not simply vetoed the Legislature's measure, but had utilized
the state's conditional veto to highlight flaws and suggest changes
that would meet her approval. He noted that much of what the court
said in its ruling had been recommended by the governor in her
veto. Whitman's support of a woman's right to an abortion has put
her at odds with many in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was style over substance and a symbolic gesture,''
McDonough said. ``If they had done that we would have had a law
that was constitutional on the books for the last two years and
wouldn't have poured $400,000 down a rat hole.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's law, unlike those in Nebraska and some other
states, would have imposed civil rather than criminal penalties.
Doctors who violated it could have faced a loss of license and a
$25,000 fine.

SPORTS COLUMN: ARMSTRONG SEES BEYOND A HANDLEBAR
</HEADLINE>
  By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ See his picture on the front page of newspapers and
magazines, catch him on the network news, read about him in
newspaper editorials usually reserved for world-imposing figures
and events and shake out the contents of a cereal box with his
image on the front, and the theme is invariably the same: Lance
Armstrong is a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what a hero is,'' he said Wednesday, ``but I
don't call myself a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dealt an unfortunate situation,'' he said. ``I did what
came naturally, and try hard. Hero? Some people might think I'm a
jerk. I push myself, and I push others _ like my teammates. Maybe
that's part of the striving. Maybe that's a significant part of the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong showed up in New York Wednesday on his own two
feet, which is and is not a surprise. He did not arrive on two
wheels, which, for the winner of the Tour de France for the last
two years, he is accustomed to doing. And the mere fact that he is
around at all is a testament to those two good feet, and his heart,
and, surely, modern medical science.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, lean, short-cropped hair, yellow shirt symbolic
of the leader of the great bicycle race, younger-looking than his
28 years, appeared at the Niketown store in Manhattan for a news
conference, with fans packed in the atrium. It was part of a busy
day that included the morning talk shows and the banging of the
gavel to close trading at the New York Stock Exchange. And it came
three days after his victory, which ended with him whisking down
the Champs-Elysees in Paris, completing the grueling three-week,
2,774-mile outing.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a nearly commonplace story _ if a story endlessly
inspiring to many can be termed commonplace _ how Armstrong was
diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer, how it spread to his
lungs and brain, and how he was given a 50 percent chance of
surviving. He underwent brain surgery, then chemotherapy, lost his
hair, lost his strength, lost 20 pounds, but did not lose hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't going to be around people who thought I was
going to die,'' said Armstrong. ``And there were those in medicine
and out of it who thought I would. I switched to doctors who
believed I could make it. I had to be around positive-thinking
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get letters and comments, from cancer survivors and others,
with people saying they admire me,'' said Armstrong, ``and I
appreciate that. But I can truthfully say I've never admired anyone
I didn't really know well, know deep down. I mean, you read about
athletes, for example, who are great in their fields, but you don't
know how they act at home, how they are when the spotlight isn't on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been compared in recent times to some of the most
compelling athletes of our time: Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky,
Tiger Woods. ``It's for others to say,'' he says, when asked for a
comment on that.
</P>
<P>
   The view here is that in one significant aspect he transcends
Jordan, Gretzky and perhaps even Tiger Woods. The reason is, he is
actively promoting and representing something beyond his sport,
something above the sinking of a hoop or a putt. He has the Lance
Armstrong Foundation for cancer research _ to which Nike
contributed $25,000 Wednesday _ and he consistently talked about
the overcoming of obstacles, life-threatening and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   (One is reminded of his mother, Linda, who raised him as a
single mother, telling him when he was feeling insecure in a race:
``You're going to win this race. Don't let anybody intimidate you _
you put your head down, and you race.'') If there is an athlete in
recent memory that Armstrong most resembles in attitude and
stature, it is Muhammad Ali, who made his personal beliefs a
priority in the face of great obstacles and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know about Ali is what I've read,'' said Armstrong. ``I
was too young to have known what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not too young to appreciate Jordan's basketball skills
and approach to his profession. ``And while I said you can't admire
someone fully that you don't know, you can admire certain qualities
in them,'' Armstrong said. ``And hard workers are people I look up
to. Jordan was one of the hardest workers, as I understand it, and
he drove the other guys on his team to achieve. He was tough on
them. I try to do the same thing with my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Which has been plenty good not only for him, but for the winning
U.S. Postal Service team that he led.
</P>
<P>
   He may also lead in perspective. ``It's important for me to know
that something like the Lance Armstrong Foundation will be here in
20 years,'' he said, ``whereas the Tour de France will not be here
in 20 years _ at least it won't for Lance Armstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What next, though, for Lance Armstrong, cyclist? ``The
Olympics,'' he said. ``That's big stuff. I go back into training on
the weekend. I can't stop now.''

NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY TO ELICIT TESTIMONY IN AUCTION HOUSE CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., England)  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Discussions to win the cooperation of Sotheby's
former president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, in the
three-year-old federal antitrust investigation of Sotheby's and
Christie's have intensified, lawyers and others close to the case
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, they said, are aimed at getting Brooks to testify
that she colluded in anti-competitive deals with her counterpart at
Christie's at the direction of the former chairman at Sotheby's, A.
Alfred Taubman. Taubman, a shopping center magnate who bought the
controlling interest in Sotheby's in 1983, resigned in February,
along with Brooks. He has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department inquiry centers on accusations that the
world's most powerful auction houses conspired as far back as 1991
to fix the fees they charged buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Documents from Christopher M. Davidge, who abruptly resigned as
Christie's chief executive on Dec. 24, support accusations of
collusion between the two auction giants, Christie's has said in
court filings. Lawyers for Christie's turned the documents over to
the government as part of a conditional amnesty agreement in
December and last week they were distributed to a select group of
lawyers under court confidentiality orders.
</P>
<P>
   People who have seen the approximately 150 pages of documents
said they contained notes from Davidge to Anthony Tennant,
Christie's chairman, about discussions with Brooks along with memos
from Tennant to Davidge about talks with Taubman. Both Davidge and
Brooks say they were acting on orders from their chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant, who lives in London, also denies any wrongdoing and has
not cooperated in the investigation, people close to the inquiry
say. Tennant and his lawyer, Richard Taylor, reached by telephone,
refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Issues discussed in the documents, people who have seen them
say, center on the fees charged to buyers and sellers. They also
include notes about talks concerning interest rates that both
Sotheby's and Christie's charge sellers who receive financing in
the form of loans that are to be paid back to the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the Justice Department investigation said that
prosecutors interviewed Davidge about those interest rate
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   If the case should result in indictments and come to trial, the
documents could well be offered as evidence under rules allowing
the introduction of records maintained in the normal course of
business, some lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Davidge would presumably be a central witness under his and
Christie's amnesty agreements with the government. In addition,
people close to the investigation have said, the government is
seeking the cooperation of Brooks who, they say, has signaled
through one of her lawyers, Stephen E. Kaufman, that she might be
amenable to testifying for the prosecution in return for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, often stalled, have gone on for months, with
prosecutors taking a hard line on Brooks' possible exposure to
prison and Kaufman seeking guarantees that would spare her
incarceration. Several people close to the investigation said that
discussions had clearly intensified in recent weeks but that an
agreement was not yet in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman denied that any deal had been struck and declined to
comment further. John J. Greene, who is leading the antitrust
investigation in New York, did not return a call left with his
office.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said that prosecutors were
evidently trying to secure Brooks' testimony against Taubman.
Whether Taubman's lawyers have been approached for his possible
cooperation is not clear but he has consistently taken the position
that he knew of no wrongdoing and has nothing to contribute. His
lawyer, Scott W. Muller, was out of town and unreachable, his
office said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to facing the criminal investigation, Sotheby's and
Christie's are targets of a federal class action civil lawsuit by
more than a hundred former buyers and sellers who contend they were
defrauded by collusive practices.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years after helping to win the Persian Gulf
war and liberating the oil fields of Kuwait, former Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney went from fighting for oil to running a
Dallas-based firm that he has helped transform into the world's
largest oil field services company.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive of Halliburton Co. since 1995, Cheney has
been able to rely heavily on the high-level contacts in the Middle
East he made as defense secretary to win business in the roughneck
world of international oil.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as he re-emerges from the business world to become the
running mate of likely Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush, Cheney's corporate experience has made clear the Republican
ticket's roots in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the firm in 1995, Cheney's background as a leader
in the gulf war has seemed tailor made for Halliburton, since much
of its business is done with Arab governments. Almost 70 percent of
Halliburton's nearly $15 billion in annual sales come from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney quickly established himself as Halliburton's outside man,
a globetrotting rainmaker, while his deputy and now successor,
David Lesar, handled internal operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney could go to the Middle East, he had a reputation there,
and most CEO's don't have that,'' said David Gribbin, a longtime
friend of Cheney who now serves as Halliburton's vice president of
government affairs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Adelman, a former Reagan administration official and
longtime Cheney friend, agreed that ``Halliburton played to his
strengths, which were contacts in the Arab world and dealing with
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the value of the company's stock has
fluctuated dramatically. In August 1995, when he arrived, it was
trading at around $21 a share. Within two years, the value had
nearly tripled but more recently has fallen back, closing Wednesday
at 43 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was a surprise choice when he was named chief executive
of Halliburton, since he had virtually no experience in the
business world and had not held a full-time job since leaving the
Pentagon. In 1993 and 1994, Cheney had spent his time giving
speeches, joining corporate boards, and campaigning for Republican
candidates while he decided whether to run for president himself.
</P>
<P>
   But by early 1995, Cheney had decided against a presidential
bid, and began considering his next move. The business world,
largely unknown to Cheney, became ``a more attractive option after
he gave up on running for president,'' recalled Sean O'Keefe, who
served as secretary of the Navy during the Bush administration and
remains close to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity came in the kind of power-networking event that
is so typical in corporate America today: a fly-fishing trip with
Halliburton chairman Thomas Cruikshank, who came away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Cruikshank decided to retire and was disenchanted
with the list of his possible successors drawn up by a Halliburton
search committee, he began pushing Cheney for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was instant backing for Dick when his name was brought
to our attention,'' said Anne Armstrong, former ambassador to
England in the Ford administration and then a member of the
Halliburton board. ``We all wondered why we hadn't thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several friends and business associates said they do not know of
any role former President Bush played in helping Cheney obtain the
post at Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback who was a
member of Halliburton's board at the time of the selection, said
that Cheney's history of heart problems were ``not an issue anyone
worried about,'' although it was ``brought up in passing'' by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed chief executive of Halliburton in August 1995, Cheney
took over a company that analysts said was trying to adapt to big
changes in the oil industry, including a collapse in oil prices in
the late 1990s that dampened exploration.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 employees, Halliburton's main business is
to provide oil producers with the technology and equipment to find,
drill for, and pump oil out of the ground, including everything
from sophisticated computer software that helps locate underground
oil fields to drill bits and pressure pumping systems.
</P>
<P>
   Its customers include the world's largest oil producers as well
as oil-producing nations. It also has large engineering and
construction businesses, and has pursued other lines of business,
such as construction work for the U.S. military abroad, including
logistical support to U.S. forces in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at Halliburton, Cheney has sprinkled the company
with a few longtime, loyal aides.
</P>
<P>
   Gribbin, a high school friend from Wyoming who had worked for
Cheney in Congress and at the Pentagon, is now vice president of
government affairs in Halliburton's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Adm. Joe Lopez, who was Cheney's military aide while he
was secretary of defense, is now chief operating officer of Brown
and Root Services, a Halliburton subsidiary that has government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's most important move at Halliburton was to orchestrate
the 1998 acquisition of one of its largest competitors, Dresser
Industries. Overnight, the merger made Halliburton the largest oil
services firm in the world, moving past France's Schlumberger.
</P>
<P>
   According to Staubach, the company had kicked around the idea of
buying Dresser before Cheney's arrival, but ``he definitely
reignited it. He brought it back as a real opportunity when he was
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dresser deal has received mixed reviews from industry
analysts. The merger took place at time when oil producers,
Halliburton's main customers, were facing declining oil prices and
were trimming their spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had what then seemed to be a brilliant deal with the
merger of Dresser, which made a lot of sense in a lot of ways,''
said Arvind S. Sanger, an industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. But ``the cycle turned down viciously for the oil
services group.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like other big oil companies, Halliburton does business in some
of the roughest parts of the Third World, providing oil services in
the Caspian region in Central Asia, the North Sea, offshore fields
in West Africa, the Middle East, Venezuela, and now Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over the firm, Cheney has sharply increased its
reliance on international operations. Since 1994, the year before
Cheney became chief executive, the percentage of Halliburton's
revenues from domestic operations fell from about 59 percent to
just 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most recent annual report said that it did
business in more than 120 countries; the report did not list all of
the nations, although it noted that Halliburton operated in such
politically unstable nations as Algeria, Angola, Nigeria and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's role as the chief executive of a multinational oil firm
has given him the chance over the past few years to weigh in on
controversial foreign policy issues. At the top of his list has
been ending the use of trade sanctions as a tool of American
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an oil industry conference in Canada last month,
Cheney called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Iran,
</P>
<P>
   He called relations between Iran and the United States a
``tragedy,'' adding that one of the best ways to improve ties with
Iran would be ``to allow American firms to do the same thing that
most other firms around the world are able to do now, and that is
to be active in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kept out of there primarily by our own government, which
has made a decision that U.S. firms should not be allowed to invest
significantly in Iran, and I think that's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Cheney, Halliburton has become one of the leading
corporate members of USA Engage, a lobbying group that seeks to
lift sanctions. Halliburton is also member of the board of the
National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that recently won
a victory in the Supreme Court, which struck down a Massachusetts
state law imposing state-level sanctions on companies doing
business in Myanmar, the former Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's company has already done business in countries still
facing American sanctions, including Libya and Iraq, the enemy
Cheney helped vanquish during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump Co., joint ventures that
Halliburton has sold within the past year, have done work in Iraq
on contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, under
the United Nation's ``oil for food'' program. That program exempts
some Iraqi oil sales from U.N. sanctions as long as the proceeds
are used to pay for food and medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Halliburton's Brown and Root construction services
subsidiary has been the project manager for a massive irrigation
pipeline project in Libya for the government of Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   The work is done through European subsidiaries that were already
operating in Libya when U.S. sanctions were established, and so
were grandfathered in.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Cheney arrived at Halliburton, the firm also settled
a longstanding investigation by the Commerce Department concerning
exports of U.S.-produced oil field equipment to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 1995 consent agreement, Halliburton agreed to pay a
$2.6 million fine for selling oil field equipment through Italy or
Kuwait to Libya without required export licenses, and for selling
U.S. spare parts for logging equipment through Italy to Libya
without proper licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton and other oil service firms have faced consistent
criticism from environmental groups and a wide range of domestic
regulatory issues as well. One environmental issue it is fighting
now is a move to prevent ``hydraulic fracturing,'' a procedure that
opens underground chambers to make it easier to get to oil or
natural gas. An environmental group has been fighting the oil
industry on the matter in Alabama, where it is now tied up in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said that he will take a financial ``bath'' by giving
up his lucrative post at Halliburton to run for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he earned nearly $1.3 million in salary, and
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show
that Cheney owns nearly 1.1 million shares of Halliburton,
including 860,000 options to purchase Halliburton shares at a
reduced price.
</P>
<P>
   The market value of this package is around $43 million, based on
today's stock price of Halliburton shares.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney would get somewhat less than that depending on the
financial terms of the options he holds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 alone, he was granted 300,000 options, which the company
estimated in an SEC filing would be worth between $7.5 million and
$18.9 million, depending on how Halliburton's stock does over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when Halliburton's stock was trading near a 52-week
high, Cheney dipped into his Halliburton holdings and sold 100,000
shares at $50.97 a share, netting him nearly $5.1 million. He sold
the shares just before Halliburton's stock began to tumble to its
current trading range of around $40 a share.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Cheney would earn $181,400 a year.

REILLY IMPRESSES COWBOYS PLAYERS, COACHES WITH OFFENSIVE CALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ All eyes will be on Jack Reilly's
play-calling ability in Sunday night's exhibition game against the
Pittsburgh Steelers, but for now there have been nothing but rave
reviews for the Cowboys' first-year offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has impressed players and coaching peers alike with his
innovative thinking, expanded passing-game playbook ... even his
dry sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Question: How much of Reilly's fingerprints will be on an
offense that is actually a hybrid of what Norv Turner runs with the
NFC East favorite Washington Redskins and what Mike Martz runs with
the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``A lot,'' said quarterback Troy Aikman. ``To a certain
degree, Jack's fingerprints already are on those other offenses,
too. Mike Martz was Jack's receivers coach when \RReilly\S was
offensive coordinator for the Rams (1995-96).''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a Martz-Turner connection as well as an ongoing
Reilly-Ernie Zampese connection, which enters its fourth
consecutive season. Zampese is the Cowboys' offensive consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a \RReilly\S influence to where this offense has
evolved,'' Aikman said. ``Now he'll have his own version of what we
want to do with it, based on the personnel we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman sees the Cowboys' passing game more closely resembling
St. Louis because of the Cowboys' speed at wide receiver, but he
says the Emmitt Smith running game will be closer to the Redskins
(Stephen Davis) than to the Rams (Marshall Faulk).
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo also has borrowed from Reilly and Zampese a
practice technique that emulates a particular game situation. One,
it breaks up practice and grabs the players' interest. An example
the other day: ``Defense is down six points. Offense is up six
points. Four minutes left in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack and Ernie have done this situational \Rscripting\S in the
past,'' Campo said. ``It goes all the way back to Bill Walsh, and I
really like it for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo, a former defensive coordinator, also thinks that Reilly's
``unpredictability'' would give him a headache if he had to go up
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. That will begin to play itself out Sunday night at
Texas Stadium against the Steelers. \Nsubheds:Briefly Running back
Emmitt Smith was held out of practice because of a ``not serious''
toe injury that occurred when he stubbed his left big toe while
walking out of a building Tuesday night. X-rays showed no damage.
Said Dave Campo: ``It's nothing like Deion \RSanders' 1998-99 toe
injury\S. It's just the tip of the toe. It's day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Erik Williams' holdout enters Day 10 with no
end in sight. Owner Jerry Jones said yesterday that ``nothing is
new,'' plus that there has been no dialogue ``and we don't expect
there to be.'' Williams' agent has said his client wants to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sat in on a personnel meetings among coaches and
front-office staff last night to evaluate players.

TELEFONICA CHAIRMAN RESIGNS  
</HEADLINE>
  By BENJAMIN JONES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ The chairman of Telefonica, Juan Villalonga, resigned
on Wednesday, leaving the once-stodgy Spanish monopoly he
transformed into a telecommunications giant with fast-growing
holdings in the Internet and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had spread that Villalonga, 47, would resign after
Wednesday's board meeting in the wake of an abandoned $58 billion
merger with the Dutch phone company Royal KPN. The failure of the
deal in May, because of Spanish government opposition, humiliated
Villalonga, people close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Alierta, 55, chairman of the Spanish-based tobacco company
Altadis was named to succeed Villalonga. ``The appropriate time has
come for a change in the company's leadership,'' Telefonica said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica's $12 billion planned acquisition of Lycos, the
American Internet portal, will not be affected by the change,
executives said. Lycos' shares gained 10 percent Wednesday, to
$65.75.
</P>
<P>
   Alierta will be following a remarkable act on the European
business scene. Villalonga took the helm of Telefonica in 1996,
when the company was still state-owned. Under the direction of a
new center-right government, it was privatized a year later and
Villalonga quickly moved to transform Telefonica into a stellar
performer, outpacing other newly privatized European phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Villalonga's leadership, Telefonica made some $21 billion
in acquisitions, gaining a huge share of the Brazilian market, as
well as chunks in Argentina and Peru, and became the largest
supplier of telecommunications services in the Spanish- and
Portuguese-speaking world. Telefonica says it reaches a potential
market exceeding 550 million customers in 24 nations through
affiliates in Europe, the United States, Latin America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga also spun off cellular phone and multimedia
businesses, as well as the Internet arm, Terra Networks. The
spinoffs _ taking advantage of the market's voracious appetite for
such businesses _ and Villalonga's aggressive, flashy style won
over investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Telefonica have risen nearly sevenfold since
Villalonga took over, but declined somewhat in recent weeks. On
Wednesday, the company's American depository receipts rose $1.875
in New York, to $67.3125.
</P>
<P>
   The change of leadership seemed largely a relief to investors
and analysts, who said Telefonica was likely to maintain its
course. ``Over the medium term, there might be some volatility in
Telefonica shares,'' said Glen Spencer Chapman, an analyst with
Ibersecurities here. ``But it's a good company and cheap compared
to other telecoms in Europe. It would appear that Telefonica will
go ahead with the deals it has on the horizon.``
</P>
<P>
   ,
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In May, the government and two of the banks represented on
Telefonica's board, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and La Caixa,
helped scotch the KPN merger. While Villalonga had sought a deal to
create a pan-European network of fixed-line, data and wireless
services, Madrid officials opposed the linkup, arguing that the
Dutch government would be the biggest shareholder in the new
company. The government threatened to use its golden share in
Telefonica to torpedo the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga `` was maybe too independent for BBVA and La Caixa,''
Chapman of Ibersecurities said. ``Sometimes, Villalonga was
perceived as too aggressive.''

COWBOYS FULLBACK ROBERT THOMAS TRYING TO PICK UP MOOSE-LIKE
NUANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ With his linebacker pedigree, fullback
Robert Thomas' ability to level a defender with a devastating block
is not at issue on the Cowboys' practice field at Midwestern State
University.
</P>
<P>
   His daily goal is to hone that aggression, while picking up the
nuances of the position that made his predecessor, Daryl ``Moose''
Johnston, special.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want Thomas, who moved to fullback from linebacker
during the final days of camp last year, to work on chip blocking
and picking up defenders when the line breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 6-foot-1 and 270 pounds, who is generously listed at 252
pounds by the Cowboys, is proving to be a quick study in his first
full training camp as a fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with Robert,'' Cowboys running backs coach
Clarence Shelmon said. ``He is starting to pick up the nuances of
the game that Daryl had. A lot of times plays break down because a
lineman misses an assignment or misses a block. The fullback is
sort of like a bodyguard. He has to abort his assignment to do
what's necessary to help the play become successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times in practice this week, he did that. He is
starting to pick things up. We are not worried about Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys aren't concerned about Thomas because they know his
history. And if hard work and being a student of the game are the
necessary ingredients to become successful, they know Thomas has
what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made the team in 1998 as an undrafted free-agent
linebacker out of Henderson State (Ark.). Entering training camp
last year as a long shot, Thomas appeared set at linebacker again
before the Cowboys decided to move him to fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Nine games into the season, Thomas found himself in the starting
backfield with the team's biggest stars, running back Emmitt Smith
and quarterback Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Thomas is stunned by the events of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows how good God is,'' Thomas said. ``But I'm not
comfortable. I've still got a lot of work to do and a lot to learn.
I'll always be a linebacker at heart and play with a linebacker
attitude, but I'm focused only on being the best fullback I can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas didn't wait until training camp to further his fullback
education.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of last season listening to the words and
wisdom of Johnston _ who became Thomas' tutor after suffering a
season-ending injury _ Thomas spent the off-season studying
videotapes of Johnston's ``greatest hits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're going to the offense that complemented his
style, I was trying to learn what he did,'' Thomas said. ``He's
given me enough insight about what he was thinking that watching
the film helped me say, `OK, he saw this or that and that's why he
did what he did.' He was successful in this offense and I wanted to
see what worked for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as remarkable as Thomas' transition is the Cowboys'
confidence in him. The Cowboys came to training camp preaching the
benefits of competition, yet they brought no one in to challenge
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo said that is partly because the
fullback position does not play as large a role in the offense as
it once did. Campo said the Cowboys will use the one-back,
two-tight-end set as much as they use the two-back set.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, however, said that has more to do with the team wanting
to take advantage of tight end Jackie Harris and shouldn't be
looked upon as a negative for Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the combination of the two sets are fine for us,''
Campo said. ``But we are pleased with Robert. He's doing a
remarkable job. We knew he would when we moved him there last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnston, Thomas can catch the ball and will be used as a
pass receiver. In addition, Thomas hopes to do something that's
mostly foreign to fullbacks in this offense _ carry the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll give the old dog a bone a few times,'' said
Thomas, who had eight carries for 35 yards in the final three games
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he knows he will be measured by the same yardstick used for
Johnston: the ability to block for Emmitt Smith. Thomas said
helping Smith surpass the 1,397 yards he gained last year is his
primary focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Emmitt has a good year and goes to the Pro Bowl, then I had
a good year,'' Thomas said. ``Emmitt's job is to carry the ball. My
job is to create a roadway for him.'' nn

NYC TO TURN ITS WORST PUBLIC SCHOOLS OVER TO PRIVATE MANAGERS IN
2001 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City plans to hand over control of some of
its worst-performing public schools to private companies or
nonprofit agencies in the fall of 2001, the first such effort in
the city's history and one of the largest programs to privatize
education in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy issued a request Wednesday for
proposals to help the Board of Education convert the failing
institutions into charter schools, freeing them from many of the
state and local regulations that now govern them. If the schools'
conversions to charter status are approved by the State Board of
Regents, the school's new managers will be able to renegotiate some
union contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education officials said that the program was likely to
focus on five to seven schools in its first year and could include
as many as 20 schools depending on the number and quality of
applications the board received.
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 50 New York City schools _ 80 percent of them
elementary and middle schools and the rest high schools _ that are
eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The program is a victory for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has
pushed for the privatization of parts of the city's educational
services and who has feuded with two previous schools chancellors
over nontraditional approaches to education. This year, he set
aside $60.8 million of the Board of Education's $11 billion budget
to pay for private management of some of the worst-performing city
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Coles, deputy mayor for planning, education and
cultural affairs, said the plan ``should give the parents whose
children have been trapped in failing schools some real hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Far less happy was Randi Weingarten, president of the United
Federation of Teachers, which represents the city's 78,000 teachers
and which could lose influence in the schools run by outsiders. She
cautioned that the plan looked like ``a political diversion,'' and
said there was no evidence that privatization of education worked.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Levy said he was ``cautiously optimistic that this
effort will yield positive results for some of our
poorest-performing schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``many people have placed a great deal of hope'' in
privatization, he added, ``Under the right circumstances,
privatization can be a useful tool in improving performance, but it
is not a magic bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Such experiments have failed miserably in some cities,
particularly Baltimore and Hartford, Conn., which several years ago
each hired a for-profit company to run the public schools. The
efforts did not produce the desired results, and the two cities
retook control of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   More limited efforts, where private companies have managed a few
schools in a district, have proved workable. But studies of their
effectiveness have found mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Board of Education's announcement Wednesday
drew praise from business and political leaders and cautious
optimism from people within the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership, a
group of civic and business leaders that has pushed for education
reform, said the plan ``is a great door swung open that to this
point has pretty much been closed.''

GOODEN DOES IT AGAIN IN A VICTORY VS. ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Something was missing from the Yankees in the first
three months of this season, and maybe it was desperation. The
Yankees had been desperate to establish themselves in 1996,
desperate to make their mark on history in 1998 and desperate to
play through the horrible personal traumas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But they have added a few desperate souls in the last month,
like Dwight Gooden, and they are beginning to pull away from their
American League East rivals. Gooden garnered his third victory
since joining the Yankees, shackling Baltimore, 4-1, Wednesday
night with help from the relievers Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and
Mariano Rivera. Paul O'Neill and David Justice each drove in two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   That's four consecutive victories for the Yankees (54-42) and 16
in their last 22 games. They are three games ahead of the Toronto
Blue Jays and three and a half ahead of the Boston Red Sox, whose
game with the Minnesota Twins was rained out.
</P>
<P>
   Showers fell steadily here during the entire day, eased and then
ceased about an hour before the game. A misty shroud descended on
Camden Yards in the fifth inning, and the last few innings were
played in drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees drubbed the Orioles by 18 runs on Tuesday,
Baltimore's most one-sided defeat in Camden Yards, an embarrassment
that apparently made no impression on Albert Belle. He was hitting
in the first inning Wednesday night, in Baltimore's first
opportunity to rebound from that awful defeat, with Will Clark at
first base, and Belle pulled a hard grounder into the shortstop
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter lunged to intercept the ball, an astounding play,
and if you were watching the action as it happened, you were
thinking Jeter might be able to throw out Clark at second _ which
he did, with second baseman Jose Vizcaino stretching at the bag,
like a first baseman, to make the catch. If you were watching the
action as it happened, it would never have occurred to you that the
Yankees might turn the double play.
</P>
<P>
   But Vizcaino is a former teammate of Belle's, and it occurred to
Vizcaino that he had a chance. He turned and threw to first,
completing the double play easily. Scouts in attendance timed
Belle's saunter to first at 4.9 seconds _ eons, by baseball
standards, over the major league average for right-handed hitters
of 4.1 or 4.2 seconds. Old and aching catchers run to first base in
4.9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   While playing right field, Belle _ making $13 million as the
highest-paid member of the organization _ would bend over and place
his hands on his knees as Sidney Ponson pitched, and sometimes
would not move, even slightly, for several pitches at a time, as if
he were still catching his breath from his first-inning jog.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden is competing with more anxiety than that, having found a
beachhead for his career, now seven victories shy of 200.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Gooden was evident in how he maneuvered through
trouble, how he threw off-speed pitches in situations when his
instinct _ reinforced through years of blowing away hitters with
his fastball _ might have been to simply throw harder.
</P>
<P>
   After B.J. Surhoff doubled to lead off the second inning, Gooden
used either a split-fingered fastball or a changeup to strike out
Harold Baines _ the ball sank low and away _ and after walking
Charles Johnson, he retired Luis Matos on a fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led by 3-1 at the time, for Paul O'Neill had slammed
a two-run single through the middle with two outs in the top of the
second. David Justice drove in O'Neill in the first inning by
ripping a double into the gap in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden clung to his advantage, whiffing Baines again with a
runner at second in the fourth inning, with the same downward
breaking pitch, to stunt that Baltimore rally, and Gooden retired
the side in order in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   After Gooden struck out Clark to lead off the sixth, the last of
his five strikeouts, Belle doubled. Gooden fell behind Surhoff two
balls and no strikes and went with his off-speed pitch again,
getting Surhoff to line out softly to second.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden then worked carefully, walking Jeff Conine. Baines fouled
off several two-strike pitches _ the last going into and out of the
glove of Jorge Posada, for a foul ball _ and he walked. Gooden
jabbed both hands into the air in frustration as Manager Joe Torre
emerged from the dugout to call for relief.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson took over and retired Johnson to end that inning, but he
contributed to problems in the seventh, allowing a double and a
walk with one out. Stanton took over and Clark flied to left for
the second out. Belle hacked mightily at a fastball, and he lifted
a fly into short center, but his swing appeared to fool Bernie
Williams, who broke back for an instant before sprinting in,
sliding, reaching for the ball and then making the inning-ending
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams provided an insurance run in the top of the eighth,
leading off with a long drive to center field, over the wall,
beyond the reach of Matos, who slammed against the fence. The ball
caromed onto the field and umpires ruled the ball was in play _
wrongly, as replay showed clearly _ and despite an argument from
Torre, Williams ended up with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Justice lifted a drive off the top of the right-field
scoreboard, the ball clanging against the alloy facing, and
Williams trotted home with the Yankees' fourth run. Stanton pitched
the bottom of the eighth and Rivera, the Yankees' closer, came on
to throw the ninth inning for his 24th save.

TO SOW GOOD WILL, LAZIO DONATES TO LOCAL POLITICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio, a relative newcomer to statewide
politics, went on something of a philanthropic binge this month,
giving a total of $72,500 on the same day to all 62 Republican
county committees in New York state. And for good measure, he sent
an additional $4,000 to four Conservative Party county committees.
</P>
<P>
   In making the contributions, Lazio, a Suffolk County native, was
adopting a traditional strategy of candidates trying to expand
quickly beyond their local fortresses of support: sow good will
across the state by financing grass-roots party cadres. In Erie
County, which includes Buffalo, Lazio gave $4,000. In tiny Franklin
County, the gift was $500.
</P>
<P>
   The donations, though, did not put a dent in Lazio's U.S. Senate
campaign treasury. The money came from an obscure state political
action committee that effectively allows him to get around strict
federal fund-raising limits.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, shortly before his PAC made the donations, several
Lazio benefactors gave $2,000, the maximum allowed by law, to his
official Senate campaign and then wrote checks to the PAC for as
much as $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to campaign finance records, the PAC, which is called
Friends of Rick Lazio, then sent the money to the local party
committees, which are expected to receive it in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, it would be illegal for Lazio to use the PAC
to finance his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton
directly by, for example, paying for advertising. But the donations
to the party committees, which come under the rubric of so-called
party-building activities, fall under a vague area of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign, said he
expected that the donations would be used for voter drives, phone
banks and other expenses intended to help local candidates and the
Republican ticket in general. Lazio ``is eager to help with
party-building efforts, and help local candidates who share his
position on the issues,'' McLagan said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (In a curious oversight, the PAC listed Republican committees in
61 of the state's 62 counties as receiving money, excluding the one
that includes Plattsburgh _ Clinton County. Evidence of hostility
to anything that connotes the opposition? No, replied McLagan, that
donation was inadvertently left off the contribution report.
``There's a check,'' he said, ``even for Clinton.'')
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Giarrusso, the Republican chairman in Onondaga County,
which includes Syracuse, said the donations allowed Lazio to
demonstrate that his interests extended beyond Long Island. ``It's
showing that he is taking his money and he is sharing it with other
than downstate,'' said Giarrusso, whose committee is receiving
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Such dividends have led other politicians to take a similar
tack, most notably Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic U.S. Senate
nominee in New Jersey, a former investment banker who used his
personal fortune to disburse tens of thousands of dollars to local
committees and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio set up Friends of Rick Lazio in 1995, soon after the
Republicans gained control of Congress and he became chairman of a
housing subcommittee, which made him a more attractive recipient
for donations. The PAC has collected $127,320 this year. The Senate
campaign has taken in $5 million. While that is a sizable amount,
Clinton is far ahead in fund-raising, and Lazio is under
considerable pressure to fill his Senate treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in contribution limits is stark. An individual
can donate a maximum of $2,000 to a Congressional campaign, and a
maximum of $76,500 annually to a New York PAC. Corporations can
donate to PACs in New York but not on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Many other elected officials have also formed these so-called
leadership PACs, including New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Gov. George Pataki and members of Congress of both major parties.
Earlier this year, Clinton contended that Giuliani, at the time her
rival for the Senate, was illegally using PAC money to finance his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called that ludicrous, adding that Clinton was being a
hypocrite because she was allowing Democratic committees to spend
the largely unregulated contributions known as soft money on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, an advocacy group in
Washington that is seeking tougher campaign finance rules, said
these PACs were being used so often to circumvent contribution
limits that they should be prohibited. ``They simply become a way
of getting around the federal campaign finance limits,'' Wertheimer
said.
</P>
<P>
   McLagan, the Lazio campaign spokesman, disputed that criticism,
saying the two committees were distinct. Friends of Rick Lazio was
playing no role in the Senate campaign and was a vehicle for Lazio
to funnel support to people he believes in, McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are completely separate,'' he said. ``But I don't think
that it's unusual for people to support Rick so he can help
candidates and causes that he supports.''

COURT APPROVES NEW YORK CITY'S SPRAYING FOR WEST NILE VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Conn., Mass.)  By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge Wednesday cleared the way for New
York City to continue spraying pesticides to control the spread of
West Nile virus, but steady rain forced the city to postpone for a
day its plans to spray much of Manhattan and Roosevelt Island.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of environmental groups had sought an emergency
order to halt the spraying of Anvil, a pesticide that had already
been used in Central Park, across Staten Island and in parts of
Queens and Brooklyn, in areas where the virus was found in birds
and mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But after two hours of testimony by witnesses for the city and
the environmentalists, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. ruled
that the environmental groups had not presented enough evidence to
require a temporary restraining order to stop the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists, represented by the Pace Environmental
Litigation Clinic at the Pace University School of Law in White
Plains, filed a lawsuit last week, contending that the spraying
campaign violated environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani harshly criticized the environmentalists
Wednesday, saying their effort to stop the spraying was a
``mindless attempt to frighten people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``They are so far over on the other side in their
zealous advocacy that they are missing the importance of human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito-borne virus killed seven people in the New York
region last year and made 55 others seriously ill. No human cases
have been reported this year, but the virus has been found in 11
mosquito samples in the region, including three pools in New York
City and one in Connecticut. The virus has also been found in more
than 50 birds in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups argued in court Wednesday that the city
was not using the pesticide properly and that the minimal risk of
humans' contracting the virus did not justify spraying throughout
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, people are very confused,'' said Mitchel Cohen, a
leader of the No Spray Coalition, one of the plaintiffs in the
lawsuit. ``On the one hand, they are worried about spraying, but
there's an orchestrated hysteria around the West Nile virus, as if
it's a health emergency. Where's the health emergency around the
flu?''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, West Nile virus was discovered in Boston, the
first time the disease was found outside the New York metropolitan
region since it surfaced last year. The 1999 outbreak, which began
in northern Queens, was the first in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts health officials said the virus caused the death
of a crow found in a park in Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood in
southwest Boston. Dr. Ralph J. Timperi, director of the State
Laboratory Institute at the Massachusetts Department of Health,
said it was unclear whether the bird had come from another state or
was infected in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been testing sick birds for several months, and
after finding the virus in the crow, they said they would begin
spraying larvicide in the area to kill mosquito eggs and would
intensify their surveillance and monitor hospitals to check for
reports of symptoms of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, infection with West Nile virus in people leads to a
mild illness that feels like influenza. But the virus can also
cause encephalitis, a deadly swelling of the brain, with symptoms
including severe headache, high fever, stiff neck, confusion, loss
of consciousness and muscle weakness. Those most at risk are the
elderly, those with weak immune systems, and children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   New York City health officials said that, weather permitting,
they would conduct ground spraying in Manhattan and Roosevelt
Island from midnight Thursday to 5 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rain forced Suffolk County, where the West Nile virus was
confirmed late Tuesday in three mosquito samples, to cancel
spraying planned for Wednesday night in Ocean Park, Summer Club and
Davis Park. The spraying was rescheduled for later Thursday and was
expanded to include three areas in and around Babylon, where the
virus was detected in mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying was also scheduled in Westchester and Rockland counties
for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County, where the virus has been found in birds but not
in mosquitoes, has held off on spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Officials there said that while they had stepped up their
surveillance along the border of the two counties, they did not
think spraying was necessary because they had not found infected
mosquitoes.

MRS. CLINTON URGES END TO AID IF ARAFAT DECLARES STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that she may have gone beyond the White House
position on the charged issue of Middle East peace, Hillary Rodham
Clinton said Wednesday that she spoke out of her own conviction
when she called for cutting off U.S. aid if the Palestinians
unilaterally declared statehood.
</P>
<P>
   After the Middle East peace talks broke down on Tuesday at Camp
David, Clinton issued a statement urging both sides to continue
negotiations and called for a cutoff in assistance to the
Palestinian Authority should Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
move to declare a state on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be clear that any unilateral declaration of
Palestinian statehood would be entirely unacceptable and should be
met with a cutoff of United States assistance,'' she said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday if she was going beyond what the Clinton
administration had called for, she said flatly: ``I may be. It's
what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Rep. Rick Lazio, her opponent for the U.S. Senate, said
he had already signed on as a sponsor to a bill that would do the
same thing. A similar bill is being sponsored by Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., one of Clinton's strongest allies. Both bills were
scheduled to be introduced Wednesday evening. The Palestinian
Authority received $100 million in American aid in fiscal year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has suggested that he may declare Palestinian statehood
if no agreement is reached by September 13. The Clinton
administration has not called for the severing of aid, but has
instead pressed both sides to resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was lambasted last year for her embrace of Arafat's
wife, Suha, Wednesday explicitly distanced herself from the
Palestinian cause, singling out Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime
minister, for showing ``enormous courage and vision and an
extraordinary commitment to these peace talks.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Arafat, she was asked. ``He participated,'' Clinton
said simply. `And I hope he will continue to participate in the
ongoing discussions that were promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reflections on the peace talks came during a campaign stop
Wednesday afternoon at the Florence Nightingale Health Center, a
nursing home in East Harlem. Clinton introduced a $500 million
proposal to raise staffing levels and safety standards in nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a recent federal study that found perilous levels of
understaffing in nursing homes nationwide, Clinton's proposal would
use the money to reward nursing homes that met federal standards
and penalize those that did not. The proposal also calls for
publishing on the Internet the staff-to-patient ratios and the
safety records of all nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many places in our country are failing to honor our duty
to American seniors,'' she told an audience of frail, elderly
nursing home residents.
</P>
<P>
   She pointedly attacked Lazio for voting, along with his
Republican colleagues, for a 1995 bill that would have eliminated
national nursing home safety standards. Lazio's spokesman, Bryan
Flood, said the bill would have turned Medicaid into a block grant
program, leaving states responsible for creating their own nursing
home standards. The bill ultimately did not pass.

A FEW IDEAS FOR 2012 OLYMPIC MOTORSPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a week since officials of the committee seeking to
bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to Dallas announced that they would
like to stage an international auto race as a demonstration sport
at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I love motorsports, I don't believe race cars belong
in the Olympics, the ultimate proving ground for the human athlete.
</P>
<P>
   I fully believe that race-car drivers are athletes, who possess
extraordinary levels of hand-eye coordination, ability to
concentrate in a hostile environment and bravery. But their
performance goes hand-in-foot with a motor vehicle, which must take
into account all the variables inherent with motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, deciding on what genre of race car and what type
of race circuit would create a ``level playing field'' for the
world's greatest drivers in 2012 is foremost among the tasks facing
Eddie Gossage. The executive vice president and general manager of
TMS, Gossage is a charter member of Dallas 2012 and a proponent of
motorsports in the Olympics. He is preparing a questionnaire for
hundreds of movers-and-shakers in the motorsports industry
worldwide on these thorny subjects.
</P>
<P>
   I've told Gossage that I don't believe motorsports belong in the
Olympics. But if we must include them, here are some suggestions
that would give America its best opportunity to medal.
</P>
<P>
   My first choice as form of motorsports would be drag racing. And
my first choice of vehicle would be nitro-burning Funny Cars.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because to me, drag racing is even more inherently American
than oval-track racing. Americans invented drag racing, Americans
are forever raising the bar in drag racing and ``nobody will ever
beat America in drag racing''. In fact, if drag racing were
approved for Olympic competition, I would advise The Rest Of The
World to not even show up in Fort Worth. Americans would win the
gold medal, the silver medal and the bronze medal ... and Miss
Congeniality.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a quarter-mile drag strip does not exist at this time
at TMS, The Great ``American'' Speedway. But Gossage has until 2012
to build one, assuming that he and track owner Bruton Smith really
want to help America kick some butt in Olympic demonstration
motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say that Dallas 2012 decides it would rather see
motorsports demonstrated on either TMS' 1.5-mile quadoval or its
2.5-mile combination oval/road course _ just so The Rest Of The
World doesn't start whining.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas, stolen from America's traditional Saturday
night short tracks.
</P>
<P>
   First, I'd like to propose an Olympic Demolition Derby open to
all countries who manufacture full-sized, four-door sedans.
Naturally, each country's drivers would compete in models built in
their respective lands. The competition would be conducted using
Demo Derby rules that have been enforced at Cowtown Speedway in
Kennedale for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   What red-blooded American sitting in the frontstretch
grandstands at TMS wouldn't stand up and cheer as a Ford Crown
Victoria driven by some future NASCAR star from Darlington, S.C.,
backs squarely into the chrome radiator of a Mercedes-Benz or a
Volvo or a Lexus driven by some overpaid Formula One driver from
Monaco?
</P>
<P>
   If Dallas 2012 still doesn't approve, I'd like to propose an
Olympic Figure-8 demonstration race, again using full-sized sedans
from each participating nation. Gossage and Smith would need to
have an ``X'' pattern paved into the TMS infield, just like the one
that put Islip (N.Y.) Speedway on the motorsports map.
</P>
<P>
   What red-blooded American sitting in the frontstretch
grandstands at TMS wouldn't stand up and cheer as a Buick Regal
driven by some future IRL star from Muncie, Ind., T-boned the
right-side doors of a BMW or a Saab or a Honda driven by some
transplanted CART driver from Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   I can almost hear the chants of ``USA!-USA!'' already.
</P>
<P>
   That would be followed by something they don't see over in
Europe every day _ a 2,012-lap Legends Car feature race _ and a
Humpy Wheeler-inspired display of fireworks and blowin' stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   I can almost hear the Olympic theme song in the background, and
the dulcet voice of Al Michaels inquiring: ``Do you believe in
motorized miracles? Yesssss!''
SPOTLIGHT ON ...
TMS road course winds toward completion
</P>
<P>
   Work on the infield road course at Texas Motor Speedway is on
pace for a mid-August completion and the scheduled arrival of the
inaugural Grand Prix of Texas on Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete base is being poured this week on a layout that has
been carved into the east side of the infield. It will be allowed
to cure so that final paving can begin Tuesday on a course that
will play host to the American Le Mans Series on Sept. 2 and the
BFGoodrich Tires Trans-Am Series on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be done by mid-August, with no questions or
concerns on our part,'' said TMS general manager Eddie Gossage, who
has been watching the course take shape from his office window at
The Speedway Club. ``The course looks great from the sixth floor.
The cool thing is you can sit in Turn 1 and see every inch of this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said his primary concern is to get the paving completed,
so the curing process can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This heat doesn't help the curing, so as soon as they get the
asphalt down, they'll hit it with a water truck,'' Gossage said.
``We're using a granite compound asphalt, instead of limestone
base, to give it strength and durability. It's got a polymer in it
as well, so it should be very durable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said that while ALMS officials have been kept informed
of the progress, he is not sure when the first race car will turn a
wheel on the entire 2.5-mile layout. All but approximately 60 yards
of the 1.5-mile oval will be implemented into the course.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Bobby Archer, the reigning Speedvision World
Challenge GT champion, said lack of track time will not present a
major hurdle to his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of drivers in the series, at least in the front, can
adapt quite well,'' said Archer, who is seeking primary sponsorship
for the No. 32 Viper Speed Viper. ``We're going to a new street
course in Montreal that no one's ever seen and another in San
Diego. Since I live here, I might be able to go out to TMS and walk
around the course and get a little bit of a sneak preview. I don't
think that's an advantage you can carry into the race. But I'm
going to try to come up with an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The layout under construction differs from the one put on
display during TMS' Media Day in January, Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this design,'' Archer said after reviewing a faxed copy
of the course. ``With the space that they have, I think it's going
to be a real nifty track. Most infield road courses do not allow
for much passing. But you'll be able to do passing under braking,
and I think it's going to be quite exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dealt themselves a tough hand initially \Rbecause of
limited space\S, but it's going to be great. Using the rest of the
oval, you're going to see some high speeds, which people at Texas
Motor Speedway expect. This should be a good track for us, much to
my competition's dismay.''
PIT STOPS Motorplex lobbies NHRA Texas Motorplex general manager
Elon Werner says the drag strip in Ennis may still have a ``40 or
50 percent'' chance of retaining its spring National Hot Rod
Association national event in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the NHRA schedule hit a snag when officials of
Virginia Motorsports Park decided to switch to the rival
International Hot Rod Association beginning in 2001. Previously,
NHRA president Tom Compton had announced that the spring Castrol
Nationals in Ennis and the fall event at Houston Raceway Park in
Baytown would be trimmed from the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Werner said that as of Monday, the 2001 NHRA schedule had not
been finalized. Werner said he has been dealing with Jerry
Archambeault, the NHRA's vice president of public relations and
communications, on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been letting the NHRA know we're still interested and
have sponsors ready to go,'' Werner said. ``I didn't get the
impression I was wasting my time. Jerry said that \Rreturning to
Ennis\S was one of options they're looking at. I think they have
three or four options with the schedule. I also told them that no
matter what happens, we'll still be 100 percent supportive of the
NHRA.'' Juan's stock hot again Reigning CART FedEx Series champion
Juan Montoya's thrilling victory over Michael Andretti in the
Michigan 500 on Sunday has turned up the heat on Montoya's
impending move to Formula One in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya reportedly will leave Target/Chip Ganassi Racing for
Frank Williams' F1 operation as teammate to Ralf Schumacher. Jenson
Button, Williams' current No. 2 driver, is rumored to be a
candidate at Jaguar and Benetton.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya stirred suspicion Tuesday, when he skipped two scheduled
media obligations _ CART's weekly teleconference and an appearance
on ``RPM 2Night'' alongside Bobby Rahal, CART's interim president
and chief executive officer. The question of Montoya's contract
status certainly would have been broached during both interviews,
and apparently Montoya did not want to answer just yet. Dodson
disses aero-match Veteran NASCAR Winston Cup crew chief Barry
Dodson doesn't have the budget to run a full-scale wind tunnel
aerodynamics program for rookie driver Mike Bliss at Eel River
Racing. But Dodson still is not in favor of NASCAR introducing a
common template to ``aero-match'' the four body styles that will be
in use beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every manufacturer wants to identify their brand,''
said Dodson, crew chief for Rusty Wallace when he won the Cup
championship in a Pontiac Grand Prix in 1989. ``We're very close to
having an IROC race, where all the cars are equal. We might as well
send our money in to pay for our car, let them \RNASCAR\S unload
'em and we race 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has always found a way to find parity in the brands.
I'm not in favor of a common template being an answer to that. I
know the \R2001\S Dodge is being built off the Taurus, and that's
not good for Pontiac. That's not good for Chevrolet. I count eight
or nine Dodges coming on board; that's like eight or nine more
Fords coming on board.'' The last word
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the same zip code as the speedway, so I've got the
world's greatest racetrack in my back yard.''

DEFENSEMAN LUKOWICH HAPPY TO BE IN STARS' FOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A wild off-season for defenseman Brad Lukowich ended with a
measure of stability yesterday when he accepted the Stars'
qualifying offer and signed a one-year deal worth $385,000, plus an
incentive clause worth up to $82,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also signed backup goalie Marty Turco and defenseman
Jeff Tory, who played for Philadelphia of the American Hockey
League last season, to one-year deals.
</P>
<P>
   For a period in late June, Lukowich, 23, thought his days with
the Stars had ended. The club traded him, along with goalie Manny
Fernandez, to the expansion Minnesota Wild before the expansion
draft. However, once the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets selected
defenseman Jamie Pushor from the Stars' roster, Stars general
manager Bob Gainey completed a prearranged deal with the Wild to
reacquire Lukowich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all sounded like I was going \Rto Minnesota\S,'' Lukowich
said yesterday from his home in Canbrook, British Columbia.
``Getting traded back, I'm playing with the best organization in
the league and with the best players in the league. I'm looking
forward to a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich played 60 games last season. He scored three goals
among four points and had 50 penalty minutes _ all career highs. In
78 career NHL games, Lukowich has four goals and four assists with
71 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   An everyday player before the Stars traded for veteran defensive
help in Dave Manson and Sylvain Cote, Lukowich has the opportunity
to win a job as a third-pair defenseman behind Derian Hatcher and
Richard Matvichuk and Darryl Sydor and Sergei Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich's incentive clause will pay him $10,000 for every 10
games he plays. If he is sent to the minors, his salary drops to
$125,000. The one-year deal allows him to become a restricted free
agent eligible for arbitration after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good deal for everybody,'' Stars assistant general
manager Doug Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Turco, 24, a fifth-round selection by the Stars in 1994, played
55 games last season for the Michigan K-Wings, the Stars' former
minor-league affiliate. He posted a record of 21-24-7 with a 2.46
goals-against average and a .916 save percentage. He set an
International Hockey League record with four consecutive shutouts
last season. Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Tory, a defenseman with some offensive pop, will likely play for
the Stars' minor-league club in Salt Lake City. He will earn
$400,000 if he remains on the Stars roster or $100,000 if he's
optioned to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Tory, 27, posted 17 goals and 41 assists in 76
games. He played the two previous seasons with the Houston Aeros of
the IHL, scoring 30 goals among 93 points in 153 games.

BUFFALO LEAVE THEIR HOME BUT FIND NO PLACE TO ROAM 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were still a few buffaloes roaming around the woods
Wednesday, but the northern New York town of Malone was managing to
recover from four days in which 16 of the animals stampeded through
potato, corn and dairy farms.
</P>
<P>
   Seven buffaloes, which had escaped from a nearby farm where they
were kept as pets, were shot and killed Tuesday by U.S. Border
Patrol agents after attempts to herd them away from a busy state
highway failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't herd buffalo,'' said Mark R. Henry, assistant chief
of the Border Patrol in Swanton, Vt. ``You can't direct them like
cattle. These things go wherever they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16 buffaloes escaped Saturday from their home in Malone, a
down-at-the-heels town 17 miles from the Canadian border that is
home to three state prisons and miles of rolling farmland.
</P>
<P>
   When Maria Byrnes, the woman who raised the animals, realized
she could not coax them back home, she called a buffalo farmer from
nearby St. Lawrence County and offered to sell him her pets if he
would round them up, said Trooper Bernie Perry of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, the farmer, John A. Putnam, shot and killed
the herd's two bulls, thinking it would be easier to corral the
buffalo cows if the males were no longer leading them astray. He
managed to load another five into a truck, but then the remaining
nine took off, following a female, Agent Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   But 1,500-pound animals cannot hide for long. Later that
morning, half a dozen came charging across the fields of a dairy
farm, about two miles down the wooded road from where they had last
been seen. About a dozen of the farm's dairy cows were trotting
behind.
</P>
<P>
   A farmhand raking and baling hay was startled to see the
stampede heading toward his tractor. He ran into the farmhouse,
where the farmer, James Tavernier, 58, had just sat down for a cup
of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The farmhand ``come flying in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Said, `Buffalo!''' Tavernier told The Press-Republican, a
daily newspaper that covers the Plattsburgh area.
</P>
<P>
   Tavernier, afraid the buffaloes would charge through his fence
and lead his entire herd of dairy cows onto State Route 11, called
the police, then got into his truck, drove toward the animals and
tried to herd them into another field. Instead, he scared them back
into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to corral buffalo,'' Trooper Perry said. ``I've seen
them walk through three strands of barbed wire like it was
cobwebs.''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, six buffaloes had been shot as they came out
into the hay fields. Later that day, a seventh was killed. Their
carcasses were taken to a meat rendering plant to be used in dog
food.
</P>
<P>
   Two buffaloes are still at large, roaming around in the woods,
Agent Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sorry we had to shoot them,'' said the agent, whose
co-workers are more accustomed to patrolling the border with Canada
and keeping out contraband than riding herd on buffalo. ``We
discussed tranquilizing them, but we thought they'd go into the
woods. How do you get a 1,500-pound animal out of the woods into a
truck?''
</P>
<P>
   A buffalo stampede is unusual in these parts, but not unheard
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``In June '97, we had the same thing, some buffalo got loose,''
Agent Henry said. ``A tractor-trailer hit a buffalo, and it tore
that tractor-trailer right up.''

 MORTGAGE PLAN AIDS LOW-INCOME BUYERS  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an effort to encourage low-income families to
buy homes, a major mortgage company and a community group have
joined forces to offer cheaper loans in 10 cities nationwide,
including Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The program, announced Wednesday, will offer $360 million in
loans over the next three years to people with limited resources
and poor credit histories. The loans are available through an
agreement between Ameriquest Mortgage of Orange County, Calif., and
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a
national organization that tackles a wide range of issues for
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of predatory lending has been a huge one in the
neighborhoods where our members live,'' said Steve Kest, executive
director of ACORN. ``This pilot program is really going to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a loan, potential home buyers must first go through
counseling offered by the ACORN Housing Corp. Those who may qualify
for a loan will be referred to Ameriquest.
</P>
<P>
   The loans will be half a percentage point below the average
mortgage rate that other lenders charge low-income borrowers. The
loan agreements will include a set of new Ameriquest guidelines
that, among other things, give customers seven days to change their
mind instead of the three required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The loans, to be offered beginning in September, will be
available in six ZIP codes per city. The ZIP codes for Oakland have
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities in the program include Chicago, Los Angeles and
Philadelphia. Nearly 10,000 families are expected to benefit from
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ACORN has signed agreements with several lenders to
broaden their loan guidelines to include more low-income families.
However, ACORN's Kest said the pact with Ameriquest marks the first
agreement he knew of between a community group and lender that went
as far as the one announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The loan program follows several months of negotiations between
Ameriquest, one of the nation's largest retail lenders to
low-income home buyers, and ACORN, which has been very critical of
the home-loan industry. It and other consumer groups have
complained for more than a year about how lenders take advantage of
low-income people by charging high interest rates and unfair fees.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ACORN filed a complaint with the Federal Trade
Commission in March on behalf of 30 Ameriquest customers, charging
unfair business practices. Kest said that those customer problems
are now being fixed and that his group's complaint will be
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Supinski, a policy advocate with the California
Reinvestment Committee, a San Francisco umbrella organization for
groups that advocate increased credit in low-income communities,
called the agreement between ACORN and Ameriquest a good beginning.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said the program is too small to have much effect
considering Ameriquest provides $4.2 billion in loans a year. She
said she is also skeptical about the company's statement that it is
reforming its lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's nice, it doesn't solve the problem,'' Supinski
said. ``Maybe it's a see-it-to-believe-it program.''

E-TAILERS FINED FOR BROKEN PROMISES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Federal Trade Commission slapped Macys.com,
Toysrus.com and five other e-tailers with $1.5 million in fines
Wednesday for guaranteeing shipments to consumers last holiday
season and then failing to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers tens of thousands of consumers and $39
million worth of purchases that were not shipped by the promised
date or failed to arrive at all, said Jodie Bernstein, director of
the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a telephone interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics complained the settlement amount was low,
particularly because the FTC found that some e-tailers had no
``reasonable basis'' for believing they could meet the Christmas
deadlines they advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Many e-shoppers were outraged during the holidays when Web sites
reneged on promises to quickly deliver toys and other gifts,
leaving consumers empty-handed on Christmas Day. Some 30 percent of
holiday Web shoppers experienced late deliveries last year, while
15 percent said their orders never arrived, according to
BizRate.com, which tracks e-tailer performance.
</P>
<P>
   Macys.com, headquartered in San Francisco, was one of three
e-commerce companies hit with the highest fine, $350,000. The
company, a unit of Federated Department Stores of Cincinnati, must
also fund an online advertising campaign to educate consumers about
their e-shopping rights; it is the only e-tailer required to do so.
Macys.com did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   KBKids.com and Toysrus.com were also assessed $350,000. CDNow
was fined $300,000 but is only required to pay $100,000 because of
its financial problems. CDNow almost went under before agreeing to
be acquired by Bertelsman AG last week. Patriot Computers was
assessed $200,000 while the Original Honey Baked Ham Co. must pay
$45,000. The seventh Web site, Minidiscnow.com, was not fined but
agreed to reimburse customers who never received their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors were taken into account in determining
settlement terms, according to the FTC. KBKids, Toysrus and the
Honey Baked Ham Co., for example, were given credit for sending
coupons or taking other steps to make up for delivery problems,
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the e-tailers, Macys.com, KBKids, Minidiscnow and
Toysrus, were found to have made delivery guarantees with no
``reasonable basis'' for believing they could fill their orders on
time. For example, some of the e-tailers promised quick delivery of
goods they did not have in stock, Bernstein said. This counted
against them.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies except CDNow failed to send notices that
shipments would not arrive by the promised dates. FTC rules require
such notification to give shoppers a chance to cancel their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the level of the fines appears low. For
example, Federated Department Stores generated $795 million in
profits last year, which is 2,271 times the Macys.com fine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the settlement sends a signal that the FTC ``is keeping a
very close eye,'' said David Steer, a spokesman for TRUSTe, an
Internet watchdog. `Clearly, there were quite a few consumers
during the holiday season who had their trust betrayed online'' by
untrue shipping claims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   FTC rules allow the agency to assess as much as $11,000 for each
day that each consumer fails to receive his or her order, said
Bernstein. That would have added up to ``a huge, huge, huge
amount,'' she said. The FTC must consider a company's ability to
pay and any steps taken to redress problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a settlement, (the e-tailers) don't get
everything they want and we don't get everything we want,''
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Macys.com, the e-tailer is a separate legal
entity from its parent, and Federated was probably not privy to the
Web site's inner workings, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, FTC staff conducted initial investigations of 20
e-tailers they had received complaints about, either directly or
through the Better Business Bureau. The seven participants in
Wednesday's settlement were found to be in egregious violation of
the agency's Mail and Telephone Order Rule, which governs remote
selling.

SAMARANCH SAYS IOC `HAS A NEW PHILOSOPHY' 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only 50 days remaining before the opening ceremonies of the
Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, Juan Antonio Samaranch,
the president of the International Olympic Committee, was
interviewed Wednesday by Christopher Clarey of The New York Times.
The interview took place in Samaranch's office overlooking Lake
Geneva at the IOC's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, and it
covered a wide range of topics, from preparations for the Summer
Games to the continuing investigation into possible bribery and
fraud in Salt Lake City's bid to be host of the 2002 Winter
Olympics. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: How important do you think Sydney is for the future of the
Olympics and how important is the success of Sydney after the
problems of the last couple years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would not like to link what happened in Salt Lake City with
Sydney. Because what happened in Salt Lake City, the IOC really was
affected. It affected some of our members, the organization, myself
and so on. But I can assure you the Olympic Games was not affected
and I can tell you for example that now we are waiting for the
candidates for 2008. That decision will be made next year. We have
10 candidates, 10 very strong candidates, and that means that the
prestige of the Games are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with regards to Sydney, we want to have a great Games.
If it's possible, the best one. We don't know. The day before
yesterday I was in Athens. I had a lovely tea with the president of
the organizing committee of the Sydney Games, Michael Knight. And
he's very happy, and if he is very happy, I am very happy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the positive aspects of Sydney from your point of
view at this stage, and what are the aspects that concern you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The positive aspects is that they work very well. They work
on time. All the sports facilities were ready one year before. We
could have pre-Olympic events to test these events at all the
Olympic sites and Australia is a country which is crazy about
sport. They expect great results from their team, around 60 medals.
This is fantastic for a country of 19 million people and the bad
thing for me regarding the Games is that they are in the spring (in
the Southern Hemisphere). Spring is not very warm. It could be
cold. We could have rain, and that is, for me, the main problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been progress on the idea of having South Korea and
North Korea marching together in the opening and closing ceremonies
in Sydney?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wrote to the two presidents to have the possibility of a
joint team with the same uniform maybe and they discussed it during
the visit of the president of South Korea to North Korea, and we
got the official answer from South Korea: They agree. But as of
today we have not had an answer from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you expect you will have one soon?
</P>
<P>
   A: We need it soon. In two weeks it will be too late. Not to
parade together but to parade together in the same uniform, it will
be too late in two weeks. Because the IOC offered to present the
same uniform for both teams. It was a present of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will the IOC do in Sydney to attempt to project a more
open, accessible approach, to combat the image it has as a closed,
pampered club?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most important thing is that the IOC has a new philosophy
and that inside the IOC we must have many members coming from
international federations, many members coming from national
Olympic committees. And also we have a fourth partner now, a very
important partner, those are the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, we have 113 members and 30 of these members,
they took part in the Olympic Games and 16 of these 30 members,
they won medals in the Games. And that means that more than 25
percent are athletes or ex-athletes. In Sydney, during the Olympic
Games, we will elect eight new members of the IOC coming from
active athletes. They will be elected by 10,000 athletes in the
Olympic Village. And one of these eight will even sit on the
executive board of the IOC, which means the government of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will the IOC project itself in Sydney? Will you still be
in the finest hotels and driving around in chauffeured cars?
</P>
<P>
   A: We will be in a hotel, a normal hotel. I will have my bedroom
and a living room to meet with the people from the delegations who
want to see me. That is what I need.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And for transportation around town?
</P>
<P>
   A: We will have a van to have some people with me, and we'll
see. Listen, I need a car, don't I? But it will be a van.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any research that shows the effect of your
reforms on public opinion of the IOC?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the situation is much more quiet. This very big
scandal that you mentioned was a very big scandal in the United
States and some other countries but I can assure you that this was
not the case in all the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are very likely to be Aboriginal protests of some form
in Sydney. Are you concerned there will be any negative impact on
the Games?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think so. Because all the Aboriginal people are
Australians. Maybe they will demonstrate on the occasion of the
Games because they have a very important showcase, but also I think
they are very much interested in the success of the Games. I will
arrive in Sydney on the third or fourth of September. If I can meet
with them again, I am ready.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene are not going to be
running in the 200 meters in Sydney, because of what happened in
the American Olympic trials. Would the IOC ever consider giving a
wild-card berth to defending champions as the International Amateur
Athletic Federation has done with track and field world
championships, or do you believe the system is fine the way it is
now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The wild cards are not the responsibility of the
International Olympic Committee. It must be a request coming from
the IAAF. If the IAAF makes this request, I think the International
Olympic Committee is ready to study this request in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the IOC want to ensure the best athletes are at the
Games in their best events?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is an American problem, 100 percent. If Greene and Johnson
are not there, then two other Americans will be there, and as you
know, in your country, you have a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tom Welch and Dave Johnson have been at the center of the
Salt Lake City scandal and now they have been indicted. Is that a
sign of Salt Lake City's failings or the IOC's failings? And how do
you view their indictments on a personal level?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was not surprised, because all the people said that Welch
and Johnson would be indicted, but personally I can say that with
them I had a very good relationship. They were very friendly and
very cooperative always with me and the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But is it primarily a failure on the Salt Lake City end or
IOC end?
</P>
<P>
   A: What I have a right to say is that it was a mistake by some
members of the I.O.C. and also, it was a mistake on the other side.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Galaxy's soccer stadium project in
Carson, Calif., continues to evolve and grow, and if approved will
turn Cal State Dominguez Hills into a multisport venue and national
training center for four sports, team officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Leiweke, now president of the Los Angeles Kings, Staples
Center and Anschutz Sports Holdings, said in a conference call that
the cost of the project has nearly doubled. From the original
estimate of $50-60 million, the cost has grown to $100 million.
Leiweke said the entire project, if approved, will be privately
financed and built by Galaxy owner Philip F. Anschutz and his
Anschutz Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has played its home matches at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena since Major League Soccer's inaugural season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March, Leiweke said the Cal State Dominguez Hills site
would feature a soccer-specific stadium for the Galaxy, a tennis
stadium and would bid to become the training center for U.S.
national soccer teams. Wednesday, he said plans for the 80-acre
site, which would be leased from Cal State Dominguez Hills, have
been expanded to include a new cycling velodrome, as well as a
6,000-11,000-seat track and field stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious project isn't a done deal yet, however. In
contrast to Leiweke's enthusiasm, Cal State Dominguez Hills
president Dr. James E. Lyons Sr. appeared somewhat cautious in his
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our discussions with the Staples Center about their
construction of an athletic complex at our university, we have
reached a conceptual framework that allows us to move forward,''
Lyons said. ``This conceptual framework, which allows a stadium
soccer and a tennis stadium, a jogging course with exercise
stations and a new velodrome, is responsive to our community and
bolsters our financial foundation as a place of higher learning.''

 UNDATED: other side. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: You have been to Athens recently. How is the situation
evolving there since you expressed your concerns publicly about the
organization there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Much, much better. The day before yesterday I was with the
prime minister, Costas Simitis, and I also had a short talk with
the president of the country, and the appointment of the new
president of the organizing committee is Madame Gianna Angelopoulos
and I think it was the best decision. She was a great victor when
she brought the Games to Athens for 2004. Now she is there and she
is running the team she had during the bid and we are confident now
that things are going in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have been quoted as saying you wish you had stepped down
after the Barcelona Games. Is that true and if so, why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it is true. Because after the great success of Barcelona
in my city, I was at that moment 71 or 72. It was the right moment
maybe to leave. But on this occasion, I allowed myself to ask for
re-election for four more years, because in the four years to come
there would be the centennial of the IOC and a big congress in
Paris and to be the president of the IOC was a great honor on the
occasion of the centennial. But after, there came the last election
in 1997, and maybe yes, that was a mistake. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Six of the seven IOC presidents have been Europeans and there
has been one American, Avery Brundage. Do you think it is desirable
to have a greater geographical representation in the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe yes, but Europe is very important in the Olympic
movement. Speaking of the Summer Games, maybe 60 percent of the
medals and 60 to 65 percent of the participants are from Europe and
for the Winter Games, maybe 85 percent of the medals and
participants are coming from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What sort of qualities do you think your successor will need
to succeed in the role of president in the years ahead?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it serves no purpose to give advice or to recommend
certain types of qualities for the next president. After you're
gone, you're gone. But maybe one important thing is that the next
president must be a full-time president, like me, and living in
Lausanne, because if not, you are giving all the powers to the IOC
staff. And the staff of the IOC and also in all the other
organizations must be responding to the decisions of the elected
people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think that unlike you, he or she should draw a salary?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why not? If he does not have the economical means to not be
paid, he must be paid, like many international federation
presidents and international organization presidents are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people believe that the 2008 Games will be the last in
which the Internet does not play a major role in viewing and the
last before the sports program evolves. Do you agree and how do you
envision the IOC negotiating this transition?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe the next president can change many things in the
program. Maybe. I couldn't, because to accept new sports is very
easy, but to get rid of sports is quite impossible. But maybe the
next president can succeed where I did not. As for the Internet, we
don't know. That is something which is a mystery for us about the
future of television and the Internet and for this reason in
November we are organizing a big congress to have some light shed
on what the future of the Internet and television will be. What we
have to guard against is not to pit the Internet against
television. I'm speaking for today. I don't know what can happen
one or two years from now. At this moment, I believe we have to put
the Internet and television together.
</P>
<P>
   Q:There has been an increasing number of prominent athletes
switching nationalities. Eunice Barber, the heptathlon world
champion who was born in Sierra Leone, became a French citizen
shortly before winning. Lyudmila Engquist became a Swedish citizen
shortly before winning a gold medal in the hurdles in Atlanta. Does
it concern you that as nationality becomes a commodity, it might
dilute the impact of the Games?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the IOC we have a rule and the rule is that if you are to
change nationality, there must be an agreement between the two
Olympic committees and if there is no agreement, you must wait
three years. If a boy is marrying a German girl and gets German
nationality, normally he can compete for that new country. I think
in your country, you have a good example with your professional
leagues. They are full of foreign people. We have our rule that's
all, and we are respecting this rule.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You said last year that ``I used to be happy to open the door
of my office. Now, I am happy if I close it behind me.'' How do you
feel about your door now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I said this because last year was not an easy year for me, to
be the leader, to try to get through these reforms, because the
members of the IOC, when they were elected, they had a lot of
powers and prerogatives and to convince them it was time to change
and to give up many prerogatives, like the visits to the bidding
cities for the Olympic Games and so on, was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   So that means at that moment, it was not easy. Now, it's a
pleasure again, but I'm also thinking that this pleasure will not
last very long.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're referring to the end of your term next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: In 11 months, I will be an ex-president. &QL;

TELEFONICA CHAIRMAN RESIGNS  
</HEADLINE>
  By BENJAMIN JONES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ The chairman of Telefonica, Juan Villalonga, resigned
on Wednesday, leaving the once-stodgy Spanish monopoly he
transformed into a telecommunications giant with fast-growing
holdings in the Internet and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had spread that Villalonga, 47, would resign after
Wednesday's board meeting in the wake of an abandoned $58 billion
merger with the Dutch phone company Royal KPN. The failure of the
deal in May, because of Spanish government opposition, humiliated
Villalonga, people close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Alierta, 55, chairman of the Spanish-based tobacco company
Altadis was named to succeed Villalonga. ``The appropriate time has
come for a change in the company's leadership,'' Telefonica said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica's $12 billion planned acquisition of Lycos, the
American Internet portal, will not be affected by the change,
executives said. Lycos' shares gained 10 percent Wednesday, to
$65.75.
Villalonga took the helm of Telefonica in 1996, when the company
was still state-owned. It was privatized a year later and
Villalonga quickly moved to transform Telefonica into a stellar
performer, outpacing other newly privatized European phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Villalonga's leadership, Telefonica made some $21 billion
in acquisitions and became the largest supplier of
telecommunications services in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking
world.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga also spun off cellular phone and multimedia
businesses, as well as the Internet arm, Terra Networks. The
spinoffs, and Villalonga's aggressive, flashy style, won over
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Telefonica have risen nearly sevenfold since
Villalonga took over, but declined somewhat in recent weeks. On
Wednesday, the company's American depository receipts rose $1.875
in New York, to $67.3125.
</P>
<P>
   The change of leadership seemed largely a relief to investors
and analysts. ``Over the medium term, there might be some
volatility in Telefonica shares,'' said Glen Spencer Chapman, an
analyst with Ibersecurities here. ``But it's a good company and
cheap compared to other telecoms in Europe. It would appear that
Telefonica will go ahead with the deals it has on the horizon.``

MEDIA BYTES: SAM DONALDSON VIEWING POLITICAL CONVENTIONS
FROM  CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although his stentorian voice and pointy
eyebrows made him a political reporting legend, Sam Donaldson won't
be on television during the approaching party conventions. The
66-year-old newsman will be online.
</P>
<P>
   There's no more enthusiastic _ or more unlikely _ dot-commer
than Donaldson, who will Webcast two interviews a day from
Philadelphia and Los Angeles, where Republicans and Democrats
convene next week and next month, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pioneer,'' he said in an interview this week. ``Someday,
everyone will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign is one more event that allows sites
like Donaldson's ABCNews.com to demonstrate that online journalism
has come into its own _ and in many cases is even better suited for
political reporting than other media.
</P>
<P>
   Take the conventions. The candidates were chosen long ago.
Platform fights are tedious. Most of what appears in prime time is
so orchestrated that viewers tune it out or turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precious little happens; that's why we're not covering it
these days,'' said Donaldson, speaking with his network news hat
on.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Web, viewers who want all the nitty gritty can find
it, live and archived, all day and all night, with links that offer
incredible depth and e-mail that provides at least the potential
for true interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The political parties, to their credit, get it, too. They are
setting up ``Internet alleys'' at the convention halls, where
online media can set themselves apart.
</P>
<P>
   And the online media are different. It's not all political vets
like Donaldson. Among those credentialed for this year's
conventions are former Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten (working for
eYada.com), comedian Will Durst (doing commentary for Mother Jones
magazine's MoJo Wire), and Arianna Huffington, who will not only
contribute to Salon.com but will also have her own sites stirring
things up, like  &LR; www.shadowconventions.com &LR;  and
 &LR; www.overthrowthegov.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Even giants of the Web like Yahoo will be there. Although Yahoo
mostly aggregates the content of other companies, it has hired
journalists like former KNTV anchor Lorna Ho and former Wired News
reporter Lindsey Arent to cover the conventions from a Net-centric
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is frustrated that there is not enough video in online
political coverage. To solve the shortage, it is making its own, at
least for now. ``Our intention is not to get into the
news-gathering business,'' said Eric Scholl, a CNNfn veteran who is
now executive producer of Yahoo FinanceVision. ``Sometimes you need
people to bridge the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson is online because his star power draws people to the
Web site, even if they are mostly techies.
</P>
<P>
   He knows they are techies, because when he interviews former
British leader John Major or historian Stephen Ambrose, no one
watches, but when he talks to Silicon Valley whizzes Marc
Andreessen or Bill Joy, the hit count soars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I use the word `techies,' it's not demeaning,'' Donaldson
said. ``I love 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Salon.com uses some of the newfangled tools of
the Web, too, like streaming video.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's biggest edge, however, is immediacy. In fact, when I
talked to Washington bureau chief Kerry Lauerman, he was
frantically editing six stories on the breaking news of Dick
Cheney's selection as George W. Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Salon's greatest assets are more old-fashioned in
nature. ``It's really going to be the reporting that distinguishes
what we do,'' Lauerman said.
</P>
<P>
   NO FOOLING: It started with a press release disseminated on
April Fool's Day: MoJo Wire, the online arm of Mother Jones
magazine, was going to jump on the dot-com bandwagon by issuing
public stock. It was going to have a hip e-commerce component,
selling gas masks for protesters and gallon jugs of wheat paste.
</P>
<P>
   Well, satire is a dangerous business. Not only did a couple of
newspapers print the release as fact, but now MoJo Wire itself is
taking its prank seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site,  &LR; store.yahoo.com/mother-jones &LR; , Web explorers
can now actually buy Swedish army helmets and German-made, fully
functional gas masks, stenciled with the Mother Jones logo.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   GO GROTTO: When Ethan Watters and Noah Hawley start playing
handball on the roof of their new suite of offices near San
Francisco's Civic Center, it's not hard to imagine what it looks
like from the office towers above: more dot-com workers, frolicking
on one of their frequent breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But Watters, Hawley and other occupants of the former Dog and
Cat Hospital on Fell Street aren't raking in stock options.
Instead, they are free-lance writers who have built a community by
renting office space together.
</P>
<P>
   The office has what Watters laments as a misleadingly
pretentious name, the Writer's Grotto. ``It's a terrible name,''
Watters says. At the outset, when they adapted it from a small
cavelike space in writer Po Bronson's house, ``we thought it was
ironic enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, it still seems plenty ironic. The Grotto has grown
from six writers in a small Victorian flat on Duboce Triangle about
six years ago to a renovated two-story building with more than a
dozen writers and artists and a small film company today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the place is still too funky to really be pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   The tile floor and fluorescent light fixture in the office of
writer Lisa Margonelli speaks to its past use as a pet operating
room. Margonelli sees the bright side: ``If the writing doesn't
work out, I can spay cats in here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Oppenheimer, a regular contributor to the Atlantic Monthly,
took the grottiest office in the place. But by polishing a skylight
and painting the walls a peachy terra-cotta, he now has a bright,
upscale environment. ``At first, I said, who cares about painting
it, I'm here to write,'' Oppenheimer says. ``Now I feel so good
being in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters, Bronson and novelist Ethan Canin formed the first
Grotto, and even though all three were in the same room the other
day, they had trouble agreeing on who had the idea to rent a place.
They all concurred that the chief motivator was Canin's decision to
quit a medical residency and pursue writing full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was risky,'' Canin said. ``I thought, what the hell were we
doing? We had to sign a lease.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, they can see how risk-free the proposition was.
``In those days, you could take your pick of any warehouse south of
Market,'' Canin said. ``We should have bought one.''
</P>
<P>
   REST IN PEACE: There will be a memorial service for Aaron
Bunnell, the former head of UpsideToday who died last week at age
26 of an apparent overdose, at Glide Memorial Church at 1:30 p.m.
Sunday.

DIALLO CASE OFFICER NOT LIABLE IN EARLIER DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the four police officers who shot Amadou
Diallo has been cleared of wrongdoing in another fatal shooting,
prompting that man's father to denounce the judicial process
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the second victim, Patrick Bailey, a 22-year-old
black man from Brooklyn who was killed in 1997 by Officer Kenneth
Boss, had sued four police officers and the city for $2.5 million
for their roles in Bailey's death. The trial began in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn on July 17, and the jury cleared the defendants
of any wrongdoing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my son was murdered by Kenneth Boss,'' Lloyd Bailey,
the father of the slain man, said at a news conference Wednesday.
But, he said, after Boss and three others were acquitted in
Diallo's death, ``I figured it would be slim justice for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the jury to go out with five whites, one Latino and two
blacks and come back with a verdict in less than two hours was a
gross miscarriage of justice,'' he said. ``We are outraged, but
once again, justice does not work for black people in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gail Donaghue, a city lawyer, said she ``was pleased that a
jury was able to overcome a lot of public sentiment and feelings
and doubts about police officers that may be out there and sort out
the facts of a particular case in a very careful way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, a jury in Albany acquitted the four white officers
of criminal wrongdoing in the death of Diallo, a Guinean street
vendor who was shot at 41 times in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building last year. The officers said they mistook a
black wallet that Diallo was holding for a gun. Diallo was hit 19
times.
</P>
<P>
   In the killing of Bailey, Boss said he opened fire after the
young man raised a sawed-off shotgun in a hallway. The officer was
one of four who had gone into Bailey's apartment building in East
New York to investigate a complaint that Bailey had threatened a
neighbor with a shotgun. Last year, the Brooklyn district
attorney's office decided that Boss had acted properly and chose
not to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil trial, lawyers for Bailey's family tried to prove
through witnesses that the dead man had not been holding a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Bailey said he planned to appeal the verdict and would ask
the U.S. Justice Department to open a federal grand jury
investigation into what he called civil rights violations in the
shooting.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: SLICK WAY TO PRINT ADDRESSES  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Is there any way to print out my America Online address book?
I've tried everything I can think of.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You can't print the AOL address book, and you can't export it to
another program that would let you print it. AOL's just peachy,
isn't it? But where there's a will, there's a way, and here it is:
You can print out a ``picture'' of the AOL address book just as it
appears on screen. Open the address book and maximize it by
clicking the middle of the three icons at the right end of the
title bar. The maximized window should contain all the information
for each contact, including the name, e-mail address and any notes
you've written about them.
</P>
<P>
   Now hold down the ALT key and press the Print Scrn key (it's
near the right end of the top row of keys on your keyboard). This
will take a picture of the screen and copy it to the Windows
clipboard. Open up a program that can handle graphics _ Microsoft
Word is a good one _ and use the paste function to copy the image
into a blank document. Then just print the document. If your
address book takes up more than one maximized window, you will have
to repeat the process after scrolling down to display additional
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   If any readers have discovered easier ways to print out the AOL
address book, I'd be happy to pass them on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
E-Mail by Cell
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm going out of the country for six months, and I want to stay
in touch with my parents via e-mail. The problem is that they live
in a remote area along the Humboldt County coast, where they can
only be reached by cell phone. They also have satellite TV. What's
their best option for getting e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It sounds as if they have only one possibility: the cell phone.
If they had a regular telephone line, they could subscribe to the
DirecPC service and get the Internet, and e-mail, via satellite. It
won't work without a phone connection because you need the phone
line to send keyboard and mouse commands to the Internet service,
which beams Web pages back to you via the satellite. (You can get
satellite TV without a phone line, as your parents do, but you
can't use your remote control to order pay-per-view programming.)
</P>
<P>
   Have them check out which, if any, cellular carriers in their
area provide Internet capabilities such as e-mail. If it's
available, they may have to spring for a new phone that includes a
browser. And the Internet service will add to their monthly
cellular bill. But I guess that's a small price to pay to stay in
touch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sanity-Saving Printer
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My wife and I are going nuts trying to decide on a portable
printer priced below $300. We won't use it that often, and we're
not overly concerned with speed, but print quality could be an
issue. We are considering the Canon BJC-80 series or the
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 350C. Which one would you buy? Or is there
another printer out there that we haven't come across that might be
even better?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Canon and HP are the leading contenders in the market for
portable inkjet printers, which you can take anywhere and connect
to your laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The Canons offer slightly better resolution (720x360 dpi for
color versus HP's 600x300). But that's not enough to make a
noticeable difference when you are printing out things like Web
pages, and neither the Canon nor the HP portables comes close to
photo quality.
</P>
<P>
   For $300, your best bet may be the $299 HP 350 CBi, which
features a rechargeable battery and an infrared adapter for a
wireless hookup to a computer. But if you are willing to spend a
little more, the $349 Canon BJC-50 is pretty cool. It has
everything the HP has, but in a much smaller package. It's about
the size of a cigarette carton and weighs just 2 pounds, compared
with nearly 41/2 pounds for the HP.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Suppose you want to save a portion of a document for later use. You
can do it quickly by creating a ``scrap'' on the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: With the document open, use your mouse to select the
text you want to save. Then drag the block of highlighted text to
any empty area of your desktop. This will create a separate file on
the desktop containing the scrap. You can open and edit it just by
double-clicking the file's icon. Or, you can paste the scrap into
another document by dragging the icon into an open document window.

NYC PROSECUTORS SAY POLICE ARRESTED WRONG MAN IN BRICK ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan prosecutors said Wednesday that they were
virtually certain that police had arrested the wrong man in the
attack on a young woman with a chunk of concrete in Midtown,
despite his confession and two eyewitness identifications.
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of the day, police reluctantly agreed that their
case was unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Manhattan judge ordered the release of the man,
Bently Louis Grant, 35, from the Rikers Island Detention Complex at
the request of prosecutors, who said new evidence seemed to clear
him. Wednesday, they said security videotapes showed Grant inside
the Virgin Megastore in Union Square at the time of the assault on
July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, called the
evidence overwhelming. ``We definitely do not think Grant was the
perpetrator,'' he said. ``Do you think we would make that decision
on something other than the evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had looked for Grant on the videotapes after
learning that he had claimed to be in the store on the day of the
attack. With detectives, they reviewed 15 hours of tapes from 31
surveillance cameras inside the store, Morgenthau said. The attack
probably took place between 12:05 and 12:08 p.m., he said, and the
tapes clearly show that Grant was in the store at Broadway and 14th
Street from 11:41 a.m. to 12:22 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried this milk crate wherever he went, so it's not hard
to find him,'' Morgenthau added.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who carried all of his belongings in the crate, has been
homeless since last November, said friends, who described him as a
quiet and sweet-tempered man. He was arrested last week after a
10-day investigation, and charged with the attempted murder of
Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, the woman who was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:40 Wednesday morning, he was released on the judge's order
from the Rikers Island jail and sent to Elmhurst Hospital Center in
Queens for psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But for much of Wednesday, Police Department officials insisted
that their investigation continued to focus on Grant. Detectives,
who interviewed no new suspects, spent much of the day trying to
determine the value of the tapes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent disagreement was noted by Grant's lawyer, Natasha
Lapiner-Giresi. ``I think the Police Department might be in a
little bit of a conflict with the district attorney's office,'' she
said. ``I can understand that the police would say that he
continues as a principal suspect, because they don't have any other
suspects.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Early in the day, Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey, a department
spokesman, said: ``We have not eliminated Grant, that's for sure.
His charges have not been dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   But by nightfall, it was clear the police were beginning to
agree with prosecutors. ``There is evidence that has caused
concern, and we are continuing the investigation,'' Fahey said.
``We certainly do not want to convict the wrong person.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his release, Grant had little opportunity to relish his
freedom. While at Elmhurst on Wednesday, family members, including
a younger brother, civilly committed him for psychiatric evaluation
and treatment, and he will remain there for the foreseeable future,
Lapiner-Giresi said. He has the legal right to contest his
commitment, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, the family issued a statement saying that
the decision to commit Grant was a painful one. ``You tell them we
did it because we love him,'' the statement said. ``We want him to
get help.''

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: SLICK WAY TO PRINT ADDRESSES  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Is there any way to print out my America Online address book?
I've tried everything I can think of.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You can't print the AOL address book, and you can't export it to
another program that would let you print it. AOL's just peachy,
isn't it? But where there's a will, there's a way, and here it is:
You can print out a ``picture'' of the AOL address book just as it
appears on screen. Open the address book and maximize it by
clicking the middle of the three icons at the right end of the
title bar. The maximized window should contain all the information
for each contact, including the name, e-mail address and any notes
you've written about them.
</P>
<P>
   Now hold down the ALT key and press the Print Scrn key (it's
near the right end of the top row of keys on your keyboard). This
will take a picture of the screen and copy it to the Windows
clipboard. Open up a program that can handle graphics _ Microsoft
Word is a good one _ and use the paste function to copy the image
into a blank document. Then just print the document. If your
address book takes up more than one maximized window, you will have
to repeat the process after scrolling down to display additional
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   If any readers have discovered easier ways to print out the AOL
address book, I'd be happy to pass them on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
E-Mail by Cell
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm going out of the country for six months, and I want to stay
in touch with my parents via e-mail. The problem is that they live
in a remote area along the Humboldt County coast, where they can
only be reached by cell phone. They also have satellite TV. What's
their best option for getting e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It sounds as if they have only one possibility: the cell phone.
If they had a regular telephone line, they could subscribe to the
DirecPC service and get the Internet, and e-mail, via satellite. It
won't work without a phone connection because you need the phone
line to send keyboard and mouse commands to the Internet service,
which beams Web pages back to you via the satellite. (You can get
satellite TV without a phone line, as your parents do, but you
can't use your remote control to order pay-per-view programming.)
</P>
<P>
   Have them check out which, if any, cellular carriers in their
area provide Internet capabilities such as e-mail. If it's
available, they may have to spring for a new phone that includes a
browser. And the Internet service will add to their monthly
cellular bill. But I guess that's a small price to pay to stay in
touch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sanity-Saving Printer
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My wife and I are going nuts trying to decide on a portable
printer priced below $300. We won't use it that often, and we're
not overly concerned with speed, but print quality could be an
issue. We are considering the Canon BJC-80 series or the
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 350C. Which one would you buy? Or is there
another printer out there that we haven't come across that might be
even better?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Canon and HP are the leading contenders in the market for
portable inkjet printers, which you can take anywhere and connect
to your laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The Canons offer slightly better resolution (720x360 dpi for
color versus HP's 600x300). But that's not enough to make a
noticeable difference when you are printing out things like Web
pages, and neither the Canon nor the HP portables comes close to
photo quality.
</P>
<P>
   For $300, your best bet may be the $299 HP 350 CBi, which
features a rechargeable battery and an infrared adapter for a
wireless hookup to a computer. But if you are willing to spend a
little more, the $349 Canon BJC-50 is pretty cool. It has
everything the HP has, but in a much smaller package. It's about
the size of a cigarette carton and weighs just 2 pounds, compared
with nearly 41/2 pounds for the HP.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Suppose you want to save a portion of a document for later use. You
can do it quickly by creating a ``scrap'' on the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: With the document open, use your mouse to select the
text you want to save. Then drag the block of highlighted text to
any empty area of your desktop. This will create a separate file on
the desktop containing the scrap. You can open and edit it just by
double-clicking the file's icon. Or, you can paste the scrap into
another document by dragging the icon into an open document window.

GOLD MOVER PINCH-HITS AT SARATOGA OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Up until Tuesday afternoon, Mark Hennig
was going to scratch Gold Mover from the Schuylerville Stakes. His
filly had already won all three of her races, including a gritty
upset of colts at Churchill Downs, and he wondered if running a
2-year-old after just 18 days of rest was the right thing to do.
Besides, he had another undefeated filly, With Ability, ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   But his plans changed Wednesday when With Ability came down with
a cough on Tuesday. She was scratched, and Gold Mover was led to
the gate, turned loose in a field of five and romped home a winner
in the very first stakes race of the 132nd Saratoga meet. A meet
that, despite gray skies and intermittent sprinkles, got off to a
record-breaking start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to run those two against each other and
With Ability was a little fresher, but then she coughed and looked
a little flat so we changed up,'' said Hennig, who, with the
victory in the Grade II $108,200 race, now has four stakes
victories in the 2-year-old filly division this year. ``It's nice
to know that if one of them gets sick, there is another who can
come in and be a great backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennig's original plan was to run With Ability in the
Schuylerville, Gold Mover in Monmouth Park's Sorority on Aug. 12
and his stakes-winning filly Raging Fever in the Adirondack at six
and a half furlongs here on Aug. 14. Now it looks as if With
Ability will go to Monmouth, on the Jersey Shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Schuylerville was roughly run by everyone but Gold Mover,
the daughter of Gold Fever. She broke first from the No. 1 post
while behind her, Seeking It All and Miss Doolittle pinballed off
each other. Her rider, Craig Perrett, found himself alone on the
lead as he crested the turn in the six furlong sprint. But Robbie
Davis, aboard Miss Doolittle, settled his filly after the rough
start and then zoomed her up the rail to get eyeball to eyeball
with Gold Mover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of surprised when Robbie made that inside move. I
thought it was a bit premature,'' Perrett said. ``But I had so much
horse and I took the race right at him. We put her away quickly and
discouraged that other filly.''
</P>
<P>
   With Doolittle dispatched, Gold Mover withstood a late charge
from Aaron Gryder and Seeking It All, a New York-bred who was sent
off at long odds and came within a neck of the upset. ``She was
running the best of any of them,'' said Gryder. ``She was reaching
out to win at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold Mover won by a neck in 1:11.1, paid $3.20 for $2 to win and
earned $64,920 for her owner, Edward P. Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a glimpse of Hennig's accomplished stable of young
fillies, the crowd of 27,810 _ a record for a July opening day _
got a first look at the more than $8 million in renovations to the
grand old track, as well as a pretty good indication that those who
came into the meet hot will remain so.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, who won the Belmont spring riding title with 66
victories and an astounding 38.6 percent winning percentage, rode
two more winners yesterday. He was also named to replace Jorge
Chavez on the multiple stakes winner Behrens in next week's Whitney
by the trainer James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   And the trainer Joe Orseno, whose charges for the Frank Stronach
stable include the potential champions Golden Missile, Red Bullet
and Perfect Sting, unveiled another budding star with 2-year-old
Macho Uno. The son of Holy Bull demolished six other 2-year-olds in
his debut, which was some consolation after Orseno said he was not
running Red Bullet in the $1 million Haskell Invitational next week
at Monmouth because of a viral infection that has plagued the
Preakness winner.
</P>
<P>
   With 34 stakes remaining with purses totaling more than $8.6
million, the New York Racing Association is intent on bettering the
records it set last year. In 1999, on-track attendance rose 3.7
percent to 920,218 for a daily average of 25,562, and the on-track
handle increased by 5.4 percent to $111,969,548. The on-track
handle of $3,061,913 Wednesday was down slightly from last year's
opening day.

 MORTGAGE PLAN AIDS LOW-INCOME BUYERS  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an effort to encourage low-income families to
buy homes, a major mortgage company and a community group have
joined forces to offer cheaper loans in 10 cities nationwide,
including Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The program, announced Wednesday, will offer $360 million in
loans over the next three years to people with limited resources
and poor credit histories. The loans are available through an
agreement between Ameriquest Mortgage of Orange County, Calif., and
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a
national organization that tackles a wide range of issues for
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of predatory lending has been a huge one in the
neighborhoods where our members live,'' said Steve Kest, executive
director of ACORN. ``This pilot program is really going to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a loan, potential home buyers must first go through
counseling offered by the ACORN Housing Corp. Those who may qualify
for a loan will be referred to Ameriquest.
</P>
<P>
   The loans will be half a percentage point below the average
mortgage rate that other lenders charge low-income borrowers. The
loan agreements will include a set of new Ameriquest guidelines
that, among other things, give customers seven days to change their
mind instead of the three required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The loans, to be offered beginning in September, will be
available in six ZIP codes per city. The ZIP codes for Oakland have
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities in the program include Chicago, Los Angeles and
Philadelphia. Nearly 10,000 families are expected to benefit from
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ACORN has signed agreements with several lenders to
broaden their loan guidelines to include more low-income families.
However, ACORN's Kest said the pact with Ameriquest marks the first
agreement he knew of between a community group and lender that went
as far as the one announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The loan program follows several months of negotiations between
Ameriquest, one of the nation's largest retail lenders to
low-income home buyers, and ACORN, which has been very critical of
the home-loan industry. It and other consumer groups have
complained for more than a year about how lenders take advantage of
low-income people by charging high interest rates and unfair fees.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ACORN filed a complaint with the Federal Trade
Commission in March on behalf of 30 Ameriquest customers, charging
unfair business practices. Kest said that those customer problems
are now being fixed and that his group's complaint will be
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Supinski, a policy advocate with the California
Reinvestment Committee, a San Francisco umbrella organization for
groups that advocate increased credit in low-income communities,
called the agreement between ACORN and Ameriquest a good beginning.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said the program is too small to have much effect
considering Ameriquest provides $4.2 billion in loans a year. She
said she is also skeptical about the company's statement that it is
reforming its lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's nice, it doesn't solve the problem,'' Supinski
said. ``Maybe it's a see-it-to-believe-it program.''

E-TAILERS FINED FOR BROKEN PROMISES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Federal Trade Commission slapped Macys.com,
Toysrus.com and five other e-tailers with $1.5 million in fines
Wednesday for guaranteeing shipments to consumers last holiday
season and then failing to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers tens of thousands of consumers and $39
million worth of purchases that were not shipped by the promised
date or failed to arrive at all, said Jodie Bernstein, director of
the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a telephone interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics complained the settlement amount was low,
particularly because the FTC found that some e-tailers had no
``reasonable basis'' for believing they could meet the Christmas
deadlines they advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Many e-shoppers were outraged during the holidays when Web sites
reneged on promises to quickly deliver toys and other gifts,
leaving consumers empty-handed on Christmas Day. Some 30 percent of
holiday Web shoppers experienced late deliveries last year, while
15 percent said their orders never arrived, according to
BizRate.com, which tracks e-tailer performance.
</P>
<P>
   Macys.com, headquartered in San Francisco, was one of three
e-commerce companies hit with the highest fine, $350,000. The
company, a unit of Federated Department Stores of Cincinnati, must
also fund an online advertising campaign to educate consumers about
their e-shopping rights; it is the only e-tailer required to do so.
Macys.com did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   KBKids.com and Toysrus.com were also assessed $350,000. CDNow
was fined $300,000 but is only required to pay $100,000 because of
its financial problems. CDNow almost went under before agreeing to
be acquired by Bertelsman AG last week. Patriot Computers was
assessed $200,000 while the Original Honey Baked Ham Co. must pay
$45,000. The seventh Web site, Minidiscnow.com, was not fined but
agreed to reimburse customers who never received their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors were taken into account in determining
settlement terms, according to the FTC. KBKids, Toysrus and the
Honey Baked Ham Co., for example, were given credit for sending
coupons or taking other steps to make up for delivery problems,
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the e-tailers, Macys.com, KBKids, Minidiscnow and
Toysrus, were found to have made delivery guarantees with no
``reasonable basis'' for believing they could fill their orders on
time. For example, some of the e-tailers promised quick delivery of
goods they did not have in stock, Bernstein said. This counted
against them.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies except CDNow failed to send notices that
shipments would not arrive by the promised dates. FTC rules require
such notification to give shoppers a chance to cancel their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the level of the fines appears low. For
example, Federated Department Stores generated $795 million in
profits last year, which is 2,271 times the Macys.com fine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the settlement sends a signal that the FTC ``is keeping a
very close eye,'' said David Steer, a spokesman for TRUSTe, an
Internet watchdog. `Clearly, there were quite a few consumers
during the holiday season who had their trust betrayed online'' by
untrue shipping claims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   FTC rules allow the agency to assess as much as $11,000 for each
day that each consumer fails to receive his or her order, said
Bernstein. That would have added up to ``a huge, huge, huge
amount,'' she said. The FTC must consider a company's ability to
pay and any steps taken to redress problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a settlement, (the e-tailers) don't get
everything they want and we don't get everything we want,''
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Macys.com, the e-tailer is a separate legal
entity from its parent, and Federated was probably not privy to the
Web site's inner workings, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, FTC staff conducted initial investigations of 20
e-tailers they had received complaints about, either directly or
through the Better Business Bureau. The seven participants in
Wednesday's settlement were found to be in egregious violation of
the agency's Mail and Telephone Order Rule, which governs remote
selling.

RANGERS SECOND BASEMAN ALICEA LIKES HIS ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CARLOS MENDEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Luis Alicea's agent made a case for the
second baseman with Rangers general manager Doug Melvin yesterday
and said Melvin was receptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the trade deadline and so much that is going on at
this time in baseball, I just wanted to have a general conversation
with Doug and talk a little bit about Luis,'' said Barry Meister,
Alicea's agent.
</P>
<P>
   Meister said Alicea, who is in the final year of his contract,
likes his role with the Rangers as the No. 1 second baseman and
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I told Doug is what Luis has told everybody, that he'd
like to return to the Rangers and be a catalyst for this year and
beyond,'' Meister said. ``Doug said what he has said in public,
that the Rangers are pleased with what Luis has done this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicea went into last night's game hitting .310, best among
American League second baseman, with 45 runs batted in, one shy of
his career high. \Nsubheds:Oliver velocity Darren Oliver spent time
on the disabled list in part because of what he believed was a dead
arm. His velocity didn't appear to be improved Tuesday night in his
second start since being activated.
</P>
<P>
   The radar gun reading at The Ballpark in Arlington showed
Oliver's fastest pitches at about 84 mph during a 42/3-inning
outing.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Dick Bosman said that while some of the gun
readings reflected hard changeups, Oliver isn't throwing as hard as
he has in the past. Oliver said he felt strong, which led Bosman to
suspect mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy tells you his arm is fine, that's where you go,''
Bosman said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who struck out two while giving up five runs on eight
hits against the Angels, is scheduled to start Sunday against
Detroit. \Nsubheds:The Haselman plan Bill Haselman, the Rangers'
starting catcher in the wake of Ivan Rodriguez's thumb injury, said
he believes in basics when it comes to directing a pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get ahead of the hitters,'' he said. ``Nothing we haven't done
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Haselman, who has never started more than 62 games in a season,
is a 10-year veteran who caught Roger Clemens' 20-strikeout game
for Boston in 1996. But he doesn't have any exotic ideas for the
Rangers' pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the type of player that studied the game,
that knew the game. If I can bring some of that extra knowledge to
the pitchers, great,'' he said. ``Sometimes you're right, sometimes
you're wrong with suggestions. If you can find a little edge, maybe
it will help on one or two hitters, and that might be enough to
help win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Haselman had hit safely in four consecutive games before last
night. He said it's just a matter of timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a hitter, you see pitches and get a chance to get your
timing,'' he said. ``I wouldn't say mentally it's different, but
physically, being in there every day helps.'' \Nsubheds:Green feats
Scarborough Green provided another breathtaking display of his
speed in Tuesday night's game against Anaheim, scoring the go-ahead
run in the eighth inning by forcing an errant throw to third and
running around an umpire to score.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the game for that reason, and while he's glad to be a
pinch runner and defensive replacement, the Rangers' fifth
outfielder said he's waiting for the chance to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in my whole game,'' he said. ``It's something
people might think I can't do, play a whole game at this level. But
this is the way I'm being used right now. That's my role, and I
accept that. But through my whole career, I've been a player that
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, hitting .191, said he understands that the Rangers have
questions about his bat. His 47 at-bats are second-fewest on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   But few question his ability on the bases. Monday, he made it
back to first base safely after a pitch-out, and two months ago in
a game at Minnesota, he stole home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's God-given ability,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``He's
got pretty good instincts, too.'' \Nsubheds:Yeah, so? Johnny Oates
likes to talk about his team, but he rarely wastes a lot of words
talking about other players, even when it's Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The former Rangers slugger was activated by Detroit yesterday.
Asked if he had a reaction to the news, Oates offered only a polite
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah. He's on the other team,'' he said. \Nsubheds:Briefly
Rafael Palmeiro, who homered Monday and Tuesday, is two home runs
behind Johnny Bench for 37th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro moved past Ruben Sierra into third place on the
Rangers' career RBI list Tuesday night. He has 657 in a Texas
uniform. Juan Gonzalez is the club leader with 1,075.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea and Kenny Rogers will join some Detroit Tigers
players at 1 p.m. today at the Dallas Zoo, which houses two
Sumatran tigers originally from the Detroit Zoo. The players will
pose at the tiger exhibit to promote tonight's game. The first
20,000 fans at The Ballpark will receive a voucher for free
admission to the Dallas Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's game against Anaheim was the Rangers' last game
against an American League West opponent until Sept. 22, when
Anaheim returns for a three-game series at The Ballpark. The
Rangers have nine games remaining against AL West opponents, all to
close out the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Sierra homered for Oklahoma City on Tuesday night in a 7-3
victory against Colorado Springs, giving him two homers, a double
and seven RBI over two games. \Nsubheds:Good eye Rafael Palmeiro
had 13 more walks than strikeouts going into last night, the
fourth-best figure in the American League. The rundown: Name, team
AB W SO Diff. Jason Giambi, Oak. 337 88 59 29 Matt Lawton, Minn.

 P2P PAYMENTS TRANSFERRED QUICKLY, CHEAPLY  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The phrase ``please send money'' is taking on a
whole new meaning thanks to Web sites that specialize in
person-to-person (P2P) payments.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, sometime soon you'll get an e-mail requesting
money. And, no, it won't be a junk mail solicitation. It will be be
from your roommate requesting this month's rent; from a co-worker
asking for your share of yesterday's lunch date; from an eBay
seller requesting payment for an auction you won; or from your
college kid asking for book money.
</P>
<P>
   Six sites _ PayPal, eCount, PayMe, ProPay, eMoneyMail and
MoneyZap _ offer services that help you pay another individual on
the Web. No cash necessary, and no more writing checks or
addressing envelopes. The services are either free or low cost.
</P>
<P>
   One service, PayPal, even works on Palms and other handheld
devices; you can send money to another organizer just by entering
an e-mail address and amount, then beaming it. It also works on a
Web-enabled cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   While it's natural to be skeptical about trusting finances,
however small, to upstart Web sites, we tried most of the major
players without a serious hitch. The main complaint was occasional
processing delays, but the money always came through.
</P>
<P>
   Most P2P payments simply use your e-mail address and checking or
credit card number. When you send money, the funds are debited from
one of these accounts, and when you receive it, the money is
deposited into your checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hagen, an analyst with Forrester Research, expects these
systems to catch on quickly. The alternatives, such as sending a
check or using the Western Union wire, are too slow and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he points out the increasing importance of online
auctions. More than 35 percent of online shoppers purchased goods
through auctions in 1999..
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he cites the self-propagating aspect of P2P payment
services: To send or receive money from a user, you have to sign up
for an account.
</P>
<P>
   PayPal.com (part of the X.com family of online financial sites)
is by far the largest such service with millions of accounts. It
offers users $5 for referring new members.
</P>
<P>
   The other secret to PayPal's success is its concentration on
auction services. On July 14, almost 2 million eBay listings bore
the PayPal logo, versus 400,000 for BillPoint, eBay's own payment
service. BillPoint is handicapped in two big ways: It charges
transaction fees to the seller, and it only works for auction
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the six services stack up:
</P>
<P>
   PayPal -- Industry leader PayPal has the most flexible features.
There are special forms for auction payments, and you can bill
groups of people at once, such as for a special event.
</P>
<P>
   PayPal lets you use credit cards, bank transfers or paper checks
to deposit money in your account and withdraw funds via transfer or
paper check. . No other payment site accepts checks.
</P>
<P>
   While other P2P sites have per-day spending caps (typically
$500), PayPal offers higher limits after certain conditions are
met. And, of course, there are those $5 bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   eCount -- ECount is a newcomer that just premiered in April, but
is striving mightily to emulate and extend PayPal's robust feature
set. As with PayPal, you can send and request money via e-mail, and
the system keeps an online account for withdrawals and deposits
just like a bank account.
</P>
<P>
   But eCount adds other valuable features. First, you can use
money in your account to make purchases at any online vendor that
accepts MasterCard, a huge convenience. Also, eCount lets you tie
your account to up to five e-mail addresses, whereas PayPal only
allows one.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation is that you can only deposit money in your
account via credit card, not bank transfer or paper check. To take
money out, a mailed check is the only option, although the company
expects to add bank transfer soon.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, you must deposit money from your credit card before
spending it, whereas PayPal will automatically bill your credit
card when you spend more than you have.
</P>
<P>
   PayMe -- PayMe feels much like PayPal on the surface, except
that there is no online intermediary account. You can send and
request money, and there are special tools for auction payments. To
deposit money, you use a credit card; payments are deposited
directly to your bank account. There's no paper check option.
</P>
<P>
   Transaction limits are fairly standard: $500 per transaction,
$1,000 per day and $10,000 per six months.
</P>
<P>
   We liked the fact that with PayMe, money goes straight to our
checking accounts, rather than languishing online. This will be a
key point for many, especially auction sellers who don't want to
pay for PayPal's premium service (which includes automatic bank
deposit).
</P>
<P>
   PayMe.com was acquired in April by PayMyBills.com, a leading
online bill-paying service.
</P>
<P>
   ProPay --- While it also offers basic P2P payments for free,
ProPay is really oriented toward merchants who don't have credit
card processing capabilities, much like eBay's BillPoint service.
Transactions are 3.5 percent, plus 35 cents. Credit cards are
billed directly, with the proceeds deposited in your bank account.
The maximum per transaction is $250, although premium services are
available. One key point with ProPay is that from the buyer's point
of view, it looks like a regular credit card transaction. You don't
have to sign up as a member of ProPay, as with the other services.
</P>
<P>
   EMoneyMail -- EMoneyMail, sponsored by Bank One, definitely has
a banklike feel. There is a $1 fee per transaction, charged to the
sender. You can send and receive money via Visa or checking account
transfer; the recipient can opt for a paper check for $1 extra.
There's a $500 daily limit and no special support for group or
auction payments, as with some of the other sites. The $1 fee is a
stumbling block when most P2P sites are free, as is the fact that
Visa is the only credit card accepted.
</P>
<P>
   MoneyZap -- Western Union's MoneyZap is quick and easy, and a
good choice for occasional one-time payments when you don't want to
set up a running account with a site like PayPal or eCount. There
are no bells and whistles, just basic pay and go. You enter your
credit card or bank account info, send the money via e-mail, and
the recipient ``picks it up'' by entering a bank account number for
transfer. You can also request money from one person or a group.
Transactions are limited to $500 each, $900 a day and $2,000 per
month. The service is free for now.
</P>
<P>
   You can't pick up MoneyZap cash at a physical Western Union
office. Instant cash can be sent for a fee via Western Union's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Note that thus far, none of these sites lets you send and
receive payments internationally, but most hope to offer this
service in the future.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of heavy hitters are set to enter the fray later this
year. Yahoo will launch PayDirect, and AOL is teaming up with
Citigroup to offer P2P services. Assuming these Web giants match
the current services in features and ease of use, they should be
formidable competitors.
</P>
<P>
   While eMoneyMail and ProPay charge nominal fees, the others cost
nothing. How can they afford to offer such services for free? Some,
like PayPal and eCount, maintain intermediary accounts for you,
rather than depositing receipts directly to your checking account.
They expect to earn interest on the money in your account to help
recoup their costs. They also offer premium services to businesses,
filling a huge need for inexpensive credit card processing by small
online merchants and auction sellers.
</P>
<P>
   If you think all this is a little too good to be true, you're
not alone. Many analysts doubt that sites like PayPal can continue
to offer P2P services completely free of charge. But until the
industry shakeout happens, consumers should by all means take
advantage. Some form of P2P payment system is sure to hold on.

JDS UNIPHASE FOURTH-QUARTER PROFITS EXCEED ESTIMATES
</HEADLINE>
  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The JDS Uniphase Corp., a fast-growing maker of
components for fiber optic networks, reported fourth-quarter
earnings Wednesday that exceeded analysts' estimates when excluding
charges for the company's wave of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended June 30, JDS, based in San Jose, Calif.,
and Nepean, Ontario, posted a net loss of $419 million, or 54 cents
a share, compared with a loss of $194.3 million, or 60 cents a
share, in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding merger-related charges and other special items, JDS
Uniphase reported profit of $114 million, or 14 cents a share. In
the period a year earlier, the combined profit of JDS Fitel and the
Uniphase Corp. _ which merged in June 1999 _ was $41 million, or 6
cents a share. Sales grew 173 percent, to $524 million from $192
million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 12 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Although JDS Uniphase reported its results after the markets
closed, investors anticipated a strong quarter and drove the
company's shares up $5.75, to $135.9375, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase traded more shares in a single day than any other
U.S. stock _ just more than 200 million _ as money managers added
it to their holdings before it became part of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. The stock was added to the S&AMP;P 500 after exchanges
closed.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, executives of JDS Uniphase predicted that
revenue growth would accelerate and increased their estimates of
quarter-to-quarter growth to the high teens from 15 percent, not
including the effects of acquisitions. Revenue in the most recent
quarter grew 33 percent from the previous quarter, or 25 percent
excluding acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Although JDS Uniphase's explosive revenue growth was expected,
``it shows you how powerful this industry is,'' said Jim Kedersha,
an analyst with SG Cowen. The company also benefits from a market
where demand exceeds supply and the barriers to adding supply are
high, he said.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase's rapid growth and aggressive acquisition strategy
had already given it a high profile, but the spotlight has shown
more brightly on the company since reports that the Nortel Networks
Corp. might sell its optical components division to Corning Inc.
for about $100 billion. Nortel and Lucent Technologies, which has
said it will spinoff a similar components business, are large
customers of JDS Uniphase as well as competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Nortel and Lucent components businesses of Nortel
and Lucent adds an element of uncertainty, Kedersha said. ``I think
people are going to be concerned about how will the competitive
environment change if these two big captive suppliers get spun
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Strauss, the president and chief executive of JDS
Uniphase, said the market was sufficiently dynamic to support many
suppliers. ``I think there is enough to eat for a long time,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``The Internet is just getting
going. We need many, many suppliers to meet this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase's results included those of Epitaxx Inc., Sifam
Ltd., Optical Coating Laboratory Inc., Cronos Integrated
Microsystems Inc. and Fujian Casix Laser Inc., which were acquired
between Nov. 15, 1999, and May 8. Results for the quarter do not
include those of E-Tek Dynamics Inc., which was acquired on June
30.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting separately, E-Tek had sales of $123 million for the
quarter that ended June 30 and pro forma net income of $23 million,
or 32 cents a share. Pro forma sales combining JDS Uniphase and
E-Tek were $641 million, the company said. Pro forma net income was
$137 million, or 14 cents a share.

THIBODAUX, La. _ New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson knew something
had to be done. His team was suffering through a dreadful 3-13
season. His players seemed to invent new ways to lose. Fans were
outraged. The media was unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Trading eight draft choices for running back Ricky Williams was
turning into a disaster. Everyone but Archie Manning was taking a
turn as the starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   More embarrassing than the players' performance was the behavior
of coach Mike Ditka. Each time Ditka stepped on the field, there
was the threat of spontaneous combustion. He scolded reporters and
reacted to fans who ridiculed the Saints as they left the Superdome
field by grabbing his crotch and extending his middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleur-de-lis was wilting.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it wasn't the kind of positive environment conducive
to getting a more favorable lease. A change had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling a promise he made to fans and media in early December
``to take whatever steps necessary to reestablish the Saints as a
winning organization,'' Benson ended the Ditka error by firing the
coach and president/general manager Bill Kuharich, both of whom had
received contract extensions in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   When housecleaning at the Superdome had been done, it cost
Benson $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it cost a lot of money, but the Kuharich/Ditka thing
didn't work, so we stepped up and made the change,'' the
72-year-old Benson says in his office at the team's campus
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping changes in the front office brought in a new regime
of general manager of football operations Randy Mueller, head coach
Jim Haslett and director of administration Arnold D. Fielkow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a lot of feedback from fans,'' Benson says. ``They
say they like what they see, and they believe it's going to work.
But I know from experience that if we have another 3-13 record _
and I don't think we will _ those same fans will forget they ever
said that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we win, Jim and Randy will be kings of Mardi Gras.''
</P>
<P>
   In another move to convince fans of his sincerity, Benson moved
training camp from La Cross, Wis., to Nicholls State in Thibodaux.
It is the first time since 1987 the Saints have trained in
Louisiana. Attendance at practice has been phenomenal, and 10,000
attended a Saturday night scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the greatest fans, and they hurt when the Saints
lose,'' Benson says. ``I can understand that because they take
losing personally. They feel like they're part of the Saints.
That's a great thing. They live and die with us. Since the club's
been down so much, they're hungry to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After compiling a 15-33 record in Ditka's three seasons, they
Saints are starving to win. In 33 years, they have never won a
playoff game. The only time they even made the playoffs was in the
Jim Finks/Jim Mora era. Finks, the general manager, died after a
long illness. Mora quit, went into television and resurfaced in
Indianapolis in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Benson would like to recapture some of that playoff magic.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, 38, spent his entire life and NFL career in the Pacific
Northwest until he came to New Orleans in January. He spent all of
his 17-year NFL career with the Seahawks, advancing to vice
president of football operations. It was culture shock going from
Seattle to New Orleans. And humidity was something he had only
experienced on road trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, well, it is kind of hot, isn't it?'' Mueller says with a
smile from a covered golf cart. ``We've been here about six months,
and we love the area and the people. They've made us feel so
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson's support and the fans' enthusiasm have blown Mueller
away. After being in Seattle and competing with the Sonics and
Mariners for attendance and attention, Mueller loves being the only
game in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom's been so supportive,'' Mueller says. ``He said, ``You do
whatever it takes, and I'm going to back you. All I want is to
win.' He just said to not call him after 9 p.m. That's a lot of
rope for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saints fans are great. They're so passionate about football.
When it comes to pro sports, it's the Saints and only the Saints.
We're in the spotlight all the time. When we get it straightened
out, everybody will be on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, who interviewed Haslett before Mike Holmgren was hired
in Seattle, hired the Pittsburgh defensive coordinator as head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim and I are new, and we don't care about the past,'' Mueller
says in reference to the team's legacy of failure. ``I don't say
that with disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's committed. We've put in a lot of long hours and a
lot of hard work. There's been so much to do in a relative short
period of time. I don't know if we're there yet. I wish we had
another offseason. We know we can't solve it all right away, but we
will promise that our guys will play hard, and we'll be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get all our new people on the same page. If we
don't get off to a good start, people are going to say we're the
same old Saints, but we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Haslett, 44, was an outstanding linebacker for the Bills who
ended his playing career with the Jets. He was an assistant with
the Raiders and Saints before joining Bill Cowher's Steelers staff
as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience as a player and assistant coach has helped
prepare me to become a head coach,'' Haslett says. ``I've respected
Randy for a long time. Since I was a coach for the Saints, I think
I understand what everyone's gone through here. I think this is a
unique situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After a strenuous offseason program under Haslett, the players
were so excited to get to camp that two veterans _ quarterback Jeff
Blake and defensive tackle Le'Roi Glover _ tried to report with the
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to tell them they couldn't because league rules won't
allow it,'' Haslett says. ``But it's a good sign. Usually players
hate going to camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, whose younger brother, Rick Mueller, left Jacksonville
to become the Saints' director of player personnel, has made so
many changes on the roster that only 30 of the 87 players were in
training camp last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints signed such veteran free agents as Blake, receiver
Jake Reed, defensive tackle Jon Hand, linebacker Darrin Smith,
cornerback Steve Israel, free safety Darren Perry, linebacker
Charlie Clemons and receiver Joe Horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we had some cap room, and I knew if we used that
money wisely, we'd have a chance,'' Randy Mueller says about
bringing in so many new players. ``We haven't mortgaged any of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the draft's still the best way to build a
team. We targeted young players we thought were ascending, and we
consider them our draft choices. We're headed in the right
direction, but there's still a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who had been feeling the heat _ literally and
figuratively _ is happy now to sit under the shade tree and watch
his team practice. He can't get over the number of fans who are
attending practice.
</P>
<P>
   Benson is convinced that he has made the correct decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Randy I don't like surprises, to keep me informed so I
don't have to read about us getting rid of a player,'' Benson says.
``I told him I don't like bad news, but I'd rather hear it from
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy's intelligent and he has loads of energy. He'll stay at
the office all night if he has to. He and Jim work well together.
Jim coaches, and Randy handles personnel. They communicate well.
It's a great combination I'm very comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mueller and Haslett are future kings of Mardi Gras, what
would that make Benson?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Benson says, ``Tom's getting a little old for Mardi
Gras, so he'd be happy just to watch.''

ALEXANDER DALLIN, 76, PRECISE HISTORIAN OF SOVIET UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander Dallin, an American historian of the Soviet Union
whose family took part in the Russian Revolution but who was widely
respected for the scholarly detachment with which he viewed
communism, died of heart failure on July 22 in Stanford, Calif. He
was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He had a stroke the day before, Stanford University said in
announcing his death.
</P>
<P>
   Dallin was a former director of the Russian Institute at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He also directed the Center for Russian and East European
Studies at Stanford, and was the Raymond A. Spruance professor of
international history at Stanford from 1987 to 1994. Dallin
exercised wide influence on other students of Russian history, said
Timothy Colton, director of the Davis Center for Russian Studies at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall D. Shulman, another former director of the Russian
Institute, emphasized Dallin's objectivity, saying, ``In a field
riven by political controversy, he was universally respected as a
voice of common sense and scholarly detachment rooted in a solid
historical backing.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Berlin on May 21, 1924, Dallin was the son of David
Dallin, a Russian revolutionary leader who belonged to the moderate
Menshevik faction, which had broken away from Lenin's Bolsheviks in
1903. After the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917, the Mensheviks
sought to play the role of opposition party, but David Dallin was
forced into exile in Germany in 1921, the year before Lenin
formally banned the movement.
</P>
<P>
   As a Jewish revolutionary, David Dallin was then forced into
exile a second time, fleeing Hitler's Germany in 1940 for the
United States, where he wrote hostile books and articles about the
Soviet Union and its Stalinist rulers.
</P>
<P>
   His son completed graduate studies at Columbia University and
went on to build a reputation for exacting Soviet scholarship and a
deep understanding of the Communist Party. He became the Adlai
Stevenson professor of international relations at Columbia in 1965
and was director of its Russian Institute from 1962 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of the Soviet Union, Dallin devoted his energies
to reviving the social sciences in Russia, where they had had been
eclipsed by Marxism-Leninism as academic disciplines under
communism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he helped found the European University in St.
Petersburg, which specializes in political science, sociology and
economics, as well as the New Democracy Fellows Program at
Stanford, which brings over students from the post-Communist world
for graduate work in social sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallin had a profound and beneficial influence on the field of
Soviet and East European studies,'' said David Holloway, who now
holds the chair that Dallin held. ``For him the study of the Soviet
Union was not a question of confirming an already held point of
view but rather a matter of seeking to understand a complex and
changing reality.''
</P>
<P>
   As a scholar Dallin was something of a maverick, tending to
concentrate on aspects of Soviet history and policy-making that
were neglected or viewed as irrelevant by other academics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 he published ``German Rule in Russia, 1941-45,'' a study
of Hitler's occupation of parts of Russia during World War II,
which remains the definitive work on that subject and won the
Wolfson Prize for history.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later he produced ``The Soviet Union at the United
Nations: an Inquiry into Soviet Motives and Objectives,'' a
searching examination of Moscow's approach to the United Nations at
a time when the Soviet Union appeared to have turned its back on
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, long before the United States had embarked on the
strategic arms limitation talks, he published ``The Soviet Union
and Disarmament,'' which suggested a negotiated halt to the arms
race would be in America's national interest.
</P>
<P>
   He published many more books, including ``Women in Russia''
(1977); ``Black Box''(1985), a study of the Soviet shooting down of
Korean Air Lines Flight 007 concluding that the United States may
have engineered the plane's deviation into Soviet strategic
airspace; and ``The Gorbachev Era''(1986), written with Condoleezza
Rice, Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 he moved to Stanford, where he remained for the rest of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gail W. Lapidus, a political
scientist; by three children from a previous marriage, Linda,
Natasha and Andrew; and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A large shambling figure who spoke with a slight German accent,
Dallin was capable of pithy judgments. He once began a New York
Times review of a book blaming Stalin, rather than Hitler, for
World War II with the observation, ``This book does not deserve to
be taken seriously.'' And then went on to write a thousand words
explaining why.

OSCAR SHUMSKY, VIOLINIST IN THE ROMANTIC TRADITION, DIES AT 83
</HEADLINE>
  By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar Shumsky, a violinist and conductor who was renowned for
the beauty of his sound and the luminous musicality of his
performances of Bach, Mozart and Brahms, died on Monday at his home
in Rye, N.Y. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Shumsky was one of the last students of Leopold Auer, the
legendary Russian violinist who also taught Jascha Heifetz, Mischa
Elman and Efrem Zimbalist. When Auer died in 1930, Zimbalist took
over Shumsky's training and reinforced the grandly Romantic,
communicative interpretive style that was the principal hallmark of
the early 20th-century Russian violin school.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never became a household name on the order of
Heifetz, he commanded tremendous respect among musicians throughout
his career, not only for his solo performances but also for the
passion he brought to chamber music and orchestral playing. That
quality was something he passed on to many of his students, who
included Eugene Drucker and Philip Setzer of the Emerson String
Quartet; Ida Kavafian; Eliot Chapo, a former concertmaster with the
New York Philharmonic. and Guillermo Figueroa, the concertmaster of
the New York City Ballet Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Shumsky was born in Philadelphia on March 23, 1917, and began
studying the violin with Albert Meiff when he was 4. When he was 8,
he played a concerto at a Philadelphia Orchestra youth concert
conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and that same year he began his
studies with Auer, at first privately in New York and later at the
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Shumsky studied at Curtis until 1936, and he continued to work
privately with Zimbalist until 1938. By then, he was a seasoned
professional, having performed the Brahms and Elgar concertos with
the Philadelphia Orchestra on tour in 1932. In 1939 he joined
Arturo Toscanini's orchestra, the NBC Symphony, where he met the
violist William Primrose. Shumsky became the first violinist in the
Primrose Quartet, which made several classic recordings (among them
the Brahms Quartets) in the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he began playing the viola both in chamber
performances and in recitals, and he often included unaccompanied
works for both instruments on his programs. He also took up
conducting in the 1950s, and made his podium debut in Canada, with
the National Festival Orchestra in 1959. Other orchestras he
conducted over the years include the Westchester Symphony, the San
Francisco Symphony and the Mostly Mozart Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Shumsky's performing schedule had dwindled as a
taste for modern, streamlined interpretations eclipsed the Romantic
style in which he specialized. Nevertheless, he became a revered
teacher at the Juilliard School, the Curtis Institute and Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Eric, of Chicago, and Noel, of
Connecticut.

HENRY MAYER, 59, HISTORIAN KNOWN FOR BOOK ON ABOLITIONIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif., Mont., Pa.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Mayer, a historian and critic best known for his
award-winning revisionist book ``All on Fire: William Lloyd
Garrison and the Abolition of American Slavery,'' died on Monday
while on a bicycling trip with his wife in Glacier National Park in
northwestern Montana. He was 59 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Jim Reston, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All on Fire'' was applauded as ``Mayer's triumph'' by
Publisher's Weekly more than a month before it was published by St.
Martin's Press in 1998. ``Dead for almost 120 years, Garrison
(1805-1879) tends to be caricatured in U.S. history books, if he's
mentioned at all,'' the magazine said. ``That caricature shows a
single-issue fanatic who had right on his side but possibly did
more harm than good by agitating abolitionists and slavery
advocates alike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayer's triumph is to show Garrison as a complicated human
being, a fanatic to be sure, but one with a devoted family, a sense
of humor and a brilliance of mind unexpected of one with so little
formal education,'' Publisher's Weekly added, and Mayer ``has done
impressive research, especially in his use of Garrison's
Boston-based newspaper, the Liberator, to explain its editor. The
writing is first rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe said the book was ``superb biography'' and that
Garrison was ``an inspiring, extraordinary figure, as Mayer
brilliantly shows in this richly researched, passionately written
book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All on Fire'' was a New York Times Notable Book of 1998, and
The Times Book Review called it ``A copious, dramatic biography,
charged with place and situation, of the fiery abolitionist
newspaper editor.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was also a 1998 National Book Award finalist, and it
won the Ann M. Sperber Biography Award, the Boston Book Review REA
Prize for nonfiction, the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize and the
California Commonwealth Club Silver Medal for nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer's book ``A Son of Thunder: Patrick Henry and the American
Republic'' (1986, University Press of Virginia) was praised by Sean
Wilentz, a teacher of history at Princeton, in The Times Book
Review. He wrote that the book rescued ``Patrick Henry from the
sideshow of history and reminds us how controversial he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilentz said Mayer was ``a knowledgeable and insightful guide''
through Henry's complex career, and the book did ``a fine job of
placing Henry's ideas of republican rectitude in context without
ignoring the many ironies of his life as a mediator between the
yeomanry and the elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer's many other writings include the books ``The Culture of
the University: Education and Governance'' (1968), which he wrote
with Caleb Foote and others, and ``As It Happened: A History of the
United States'' (1975), which he wrote with Charles Sellers and
others. At his death, he was working on a biography of the
photographer Dorothea Lange.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer also wrote many book reviews for a variety of
publications, including The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the National Book Critics Circle and the Bay
Area Book Reviewers Association.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he moved with his family to North Carolina
while he was young and received a bachelor's degree with highest
honors in 1963 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
and a master's degree in United States History in 1965 from the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   After teaching history at Franklin and Marshall College, he
taught American history and literature at the Urban School of San
Francisco for some years, beginning in 1975, and was its acting
director in 1977 and 1978. He began writing full-time around 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Dr. Elizabeth T. Anderson, a physician,
he is survived by a daughter, Eleanor; a son, Thomas; his mother,
Ethel, who lives near San Francisco; and a brother, William, who
lives in California.

 THEA PORTER, 72; DRESSED THE ELITE OF 1960s IN HIPPIE CHIC  
 By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thea Porter, one of the earliest among British fashion designers
who rode hippie chic to high visibility, if not always to enduring
commercial success, died July 24 in London. She was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Well before globalization became a fashion cliche, Porter was
deploying the concept in her own canny rendition of it. Beginning
in 1967, from a series of shops located in unlikely quarters of
London and Paris, and later at I. Magnin in San Francisco and
Giorgio of Beverly Hills, she made and sold clothes whose
inspiration was drawn from her far-ranging travels and a childhood
spent as the half-French, half-English daughter of a missionary
posted to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Porter dressed Elizabeth Taylor for the souk, put the socialite
Dalitha Getty in caftans and created Symbolist-inspired costumes
for a perpetual party centered on the Rolling Stones and their
newly made friends from the British aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Her specialty was in finding exceptional fabrics _ Swiss
chiffons, Indian handprints, 1930s French voiles uncovered in
warehouses _ and deploying them voluminously for a clientele
undaunted by the extravagance of both her silhouettes and her fees.
A gypsy costume Porter made for Begum Aga Khan to wear to a fancy
dress ball given by Baron Alexis de Rede was lavish enough that her
fellow Briton, the designer Hardy Amies, described it as
``pre-guillotine.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Jerusalem on Dec. 24, 1927, Dorothea Noelle Naomi Porter
was raised in Damascus, Syria, and briefly attended the Royal
Holloway College in London, until she was expelled because, she
once explained, ``I wanted to study art.'' Although her art studies
were equally short-lived, a job as a librarian in Beirut eventually
resulted in her marriage, in 1953, to Robert Porter, an economist
attached to the British Embassy in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As a diplomat's wife in the early 1960s, Porter traveled to Iran
and Jordan, spent holidays in Italy and France and, as she once
said, ``went to nightclubs every night and had millions of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage dissolved in 1964, and Porter began a fashion
career with textiles collected during her travels. By good fortune,
the prevailing style of the moment was High Ethnic. Clients at her
Moroccan-inspired shop on Greek Street in London included not only
rock stars but also members of a nascent jet set whose style
reflected their newfound nomadism. She attired both Jayne
Wrightsman, the wife of the oil industrialist Charles Wrightsman,
and the actress Jane Fonda as if for a visit to a caravanserai in
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her real contribution was introducing ethnic clothes for that
late '60s, rich hippie period,'' said the fashion designer Zandra
Rhodes. It was a period, Rhodes said, ``of shawls and prints and
unusual textiles that you might have seen on the Beatles or the
Mamas and Papas,'' or the titled people who indulged their escapist
fantasies with what one critic referred to as Porter's
``peacockerie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Michael Butler, the producer of ``Hair'' on Broadway,
financed a shop for Porter in New York. When the enterprise failed,
Porter returned to England and turned her hand to decoration. Her
store, Thea Porter Decorations, eventually went into receivership;
she later formed a brief partnership in a smaller store with
Princess Dina of Jordan. ``Sadly, one didn't hear of her after
that,'' said Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   After a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, Porter moved
from her Mayfair apartment to a nursing home in Kensington, where
she died.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Venetia.

3 BIG ACCOUNTING FIRMS ASSAIL SEC'S PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representatives of three major accounting firms
strongly criticized a proposal Wednesday to restrict the types of
consulting work that the firms can provide for the companies whose
financial statements they audit.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing here by the Securities and Exchange Commission, its
first public hearing on an accounting issue in more than 20 years,
representatives of KPMG, Arthur Andersen and Deloitte &AMP; Touche
argued that there were no proven cases in which an audit had been
compromised because the auditing firm had other relationships with
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, said he hoped a decision
could be reached that would satisfy everyone involved. But he also
said he was convinced that action was needed in part because of a
perception that auditor independence had been limited by such
relationships. ``We cannot dismiss perception as being a terribly
important issue for the industry,'' Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   While accounting firms are already barred from providing many
consulting services to auditing clients, the SEC is proposing two
extensions of those prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   One would forbid internal audits of companies _ those normally
performed by company employees for the use of management _ when the
same accounting firm is to conduct the outside audit, an
independent examination in which the responsibility is to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that external auditors would be reluctant to
criticize their colleagues' work. And the comptroller of the
currency, John D. Hawke Jr., said bank regulators were worried
about the practice and that seven of the nation's 50 biggest banks
had retained their outside auditors for such work.
</P>
<P>
   The other area that would be barred is information services
consulting _ which has grown as consultants, many from auditing
firms, design and install large management information services. If
such systems provide incorrect information, critics say, the
auditors whose firms designed the systems may be less vigilant in
reviewing the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The two accounting firms that have indicated greater willingness
to accept such rules, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst &AMP; Young, did
not testify Wednesday. Both are divesting themselves of their
consulting practices, and KPMG is in the process of doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules drew some support Wednesday. John Biggs,
chairman of TIAA-CREF, the huge pension fund manager, called for
``adoption of one unalterable rule: independent public audit firms
should not be the auditors of any company for which they
simultaneously provide other services; it's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Auditors would not be prohibited from offering the disputed
services to people other than their own auditing clients. But the
auditing firms that oppose the proposed rules said they would be
forced to sell their consultancy arms because they could not
compete, for clients or for staff members, with consulting firms
that could serve any company.
</P>
<P>
   Robert R. Garland, national managing partner of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche's auditing service, said: ``Given what is at stake, and the
fact that there is no demonstrated problem, it would be
irresponsible to take on the considerable risks surrounding the
proposed rule. There is no evidence that broad scope of services
has an adverse effect on audit quality. My own personal experience
has caused me to conclude just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Terry Strange, global managing partner for auditing at KPMG,
said ``nonaudit services enhance audit effectiveness.'' And he
maintained that the SEC action was rushed, with only a 75-day
comment period.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt clearly wants to complete action before a new president
can replace him as chairman, and opponents want to delay a decision
in the hope that a new chairman will reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   While firms opposed to the rules repeated that there was no
evidence any audits had been compromised, some proponents insisted
that such evidence would be rare as no auditor was likely to write
a memo saying he had approved a bad audit because he feared losing
revenue for his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas R. Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch
College, who served as research director for an investigation into
the issue by a commission headed by Manuel Cohen, a former SEC
chairman, said there had been such cases. He cited a 1978 audit of
the Westec Corp., which the Cohen panel concluded had been
compromised because of consulting services. And he said a 1998
civil suit that raised suspicion of such conflicts had been settled
by the accounting firm involved, with the evidence sealed.

THE ESSENCE OF A TENNIS CHAMPION, CAST IN BRONZE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. Tennis Association is set to unveil a statue
commemorating the late tennis champion Arthur Ashe by the American
neo-expressionist artist Eric Fischl.
</P>
<P>
   The statue will be revealed on Aug. 28, the first day of the
U.S. Open. A 7-foot tall figure of a nude black man, it is cast in
the heroic tradition of ancient Greek statues of athletes. One arm
soars toward the sky as if tossing a ball to serve and the other
arm is behind the figure, as if weighted down by an imaginary
racket. It will stand outside the Arthur Ashe Stadium at the
National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The statue, made of roughly modeled bronze, is not intended to
be a likeness of Ashe, said Fischl, but rather a metaphor for his
bravery and spirit. Ashe, the only black man to win Wimbledon and
the U.S. and Australian Opens, died of complications of AIDS in
1993 at the age of 49. ``I was trying to find a way through the
language of tennis and the language of the body to express some of
what I thought were the attributes and values he represented,''
Fischl said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashe campaigned against discrimination and on behalf of those
suffering from AIDS. At the base of the statue are carved his
words: ``From what we get, we make a living; what we give, however,
makes a life.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when few major contemporary artists are creating
commemorative work, the commission of Fischl is unusual. He was
chosen from a group of about 12 artists by a panel led by Ashe's
widow and by Michael Ainslie, the former president and chief
executive of Sotheby's, and a tennis association board member.
``When I saw it, I thought it was just stunning,'' Jeanne
Moutoussamy-Ashe, Ashe's widow, said of the mock-up of the statue
that Fischl showed to the committee. ``It carried tremendous grace
and power and form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that people will respond that way and that they will
get a sense of immediacy and power that we as a committee received
ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The figure of the man in the statue seems to emerge from the
ground, and with the outstretched arm, the entire work reaches 14
feet. It is to be the centerpiece of the Arthur Ashe Commemorative
Garden, near the principal entrance to the Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fischl said that he drew inspiration from the Greek statues of
``The Discus Thrower'' and the ``Javelin Thrower,'' and
Michelangelo's ``David.'' When asked about the subject's nudity,
Fischl said that he originally considered creating a clothed figure
as a memorial, but decided against it. ``I wanted something that
was not time-specific, but of a more universal kind of time, a
historical time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, no, I'm not interested in that. If they want
clothes they should get another sculptor,'' he said. ``There's a
form that represents the genitals. It's incredibly modest. The body
is being formed as it moves up. That's the way I got around the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Levering, president of the tennis association, said that in
considering the statue's nudity, the committee ``felt that Eric
very tastefully handles that and we were not upset about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue is being paid for by friends and family of Ashe,
individual donors and the tennis association. The budget was about
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fischl, an enthusiastic tennis player who never met Ashe but saw
him play, came into prominence in the 1980s for his paintings
depicting the sexual tensions and neuroses of suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   One painting, ``Sleepwalker'' from 1979, showed a naked boy in a
shallow pool who is apparently masturbating. Another, ``Bad Boy,''
was of a naked woman lying on a bed while a young man reaches into
her purse. His painting ``First Sex'' suggested a woman
masturbating, and in ``Dog Days,'' he showed a boy and girl on a
balcony seemingly on the brink of having sex.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years Fischl's work has undergone a change. His
most recent show was of large-scale, Caravaggio-like portraits of
his celebrity friends, including the director Mike Nichols, and one
of his dealers, Mary Boone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years there has been much less sexual narrative,''
Fischl said of his work. ``I've always been a psychological
painter.''

IN VICTORY FOR RECORDING INDUSTRY, JUDGE BARS ONLINE MUSIC SHARING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Wash., Pa.)  (Subs 9th graf to add quote)   
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the recording industry, a
federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to
stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the
major music labels.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's lawyer said the decision could effectively shut down
the service.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction,
Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S. District Court in San Francisco
ruled that the explosively popular Napster service was used
primarily to trade copyrighted material, a behavior that Patel said
Napster knew about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of Napster users use the service to download and
upload copyrighted music,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday
and will continue pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become the rallying point for competing interests
in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet, with lawyers,
consumers, policy-makers and entrepreneurs watching closely. And
legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond
music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set a
tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the lead lawyer for Napster, said the company would
immediately appeal. He said that Napster did not have the ability
to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented
copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
</P>
<P>
   This injunction ``does not give us any fair ability to comply
and still operate,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Barry, the company's interim chief executive, held an
Internet Webcast Wednesday night to address the ruling. ``We'll
fight this in a variety of ways, to keep the Napster community
going and strong,'' he said. The company says 20 million people
have downloaded its software.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry declared the decision a major and
complete victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends the message to others who are building businesses
based on other people's copyrighted works without permission,''
said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the judge's language, this was not a close call,'' said
Howard King, who represents the rock group Metallica and the artist
Dr. Dre in separate lawsuits against Napster. King called the
decision a ``huge win.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording association said it would post a $5 million bond
requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could
suffer from being shut down pending the trial. Napster had asked
for a bond of at least $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a year-old company based in San Mateo, Calif., makes
software that allows computer users to download free software that
in turn lets them post the lists of music files they store on their
own computers. Other Napster users then can listen to or download
music kept on others' computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not alone; other services that permit file sharing, like
Gnutella, have grown, too. Last week, the recording industry and
the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour
Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users
download music and video files.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner
Inc., the Sony Corp., Bertelsmann and other record companies,
represented by the recording association, sued the service for
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents major record labels,
asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
The industry contends that Napster has built a business by
encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not
own.
</P>
<P>
   But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and
therefore it is doing nothing wrong. Rather, the company says, they
are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all
along _ the copying of music and other media for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in ``wholesale
infringing,'' and that the users were not engaged in ``typical
personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said the users reaped economic advantage from
making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they
might ordinarily pay for.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording
industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within
six months. The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded
14,000 songs a minute. ``This is the most egregious case of massive
copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Russell Frackman, a
record label lawyer, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case
against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted
because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's
uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works that do
not have copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Boies cited the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was
not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax
videocassette recorder, in part because the device was ``capable of
substantial noninfringing uses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patel did not accept the argument. ``While Napster may be
capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to
what Napster was created for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's
impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
</P>
<P>
   One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania, found that ``over 91 percent of
Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used
Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to a survey the recording association
commissioned from the Field Research Corp., a San Francisco-based
research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of
Napster, they did not buy CDs any more or they bought fewer CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Patel suggested that by the time of the trial, more work on the
effect of Napster would have to be done, noting that none of the
studies presented were ``without flaws.''

EDITORIAL: RELIGION AND ITS LANDMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner of religious liberty, Congress is nearing
approval of a law that could make it harder to use zoning laws to
save landmarked churches and church property from the wrecking
ball. Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have
rallied behind this bill _ known as the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act _ as a way to remedy abuses against
religious groups by zoning boards. But it tilts the balance in
favor of church administrators who may wish to use their properties
for development and against local communities that may wish to
preserve things as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers retain bitter memories of the battle over the
plan by St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church to build a 47-story
tower on its historic site _ a proposal rejected by the city and
eventually by the courts. As presently written, this new bill
raises fears among landmark experts and local governments around
the country that it will lead to renewed efforts to destroy
historic sites, as well as to the costly court battles that
inevitably follow. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wrote New York's senators
this week criticizing the bill and warning that it ``would
`federalize' an area which is inherently a matter of local
concern,'' normally a rallying point for conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The primary purpose of the bill is to limit the power of zoning
boards to interfere with the practice of religion. Some local
boards, for example, have tried to deny religious groups permits to
feed the homeless. One Mississippi zoning ordinance denied a permit
for an Islamic Center in an area where there were Christian
churches. Episodes like these warrant concern. But in seeking to
provide a remedy, the bill would allow churches to sidestep even
the most basic zoning requirements.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Sens. Charles Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan
have been desperately trying to provide balance by clarifying the
bill's vague language and attaching its legislative history. Such
modifications could help, but the first responsibility of Congress
is to slow things down and allow for hearings on a complicated
matter that has received not nearly enough public debate about its
potential consequences.  &QL;

Common goal helps Karolyi mesh new, old
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID BARRON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ As the hours tick away before today's USA Gymnastics
women's national championships, Kristen Maloney, the defending
all-around national champion, and Elise Ray, the top all-around
performer at last year's world championship team trials, sit alone
and relatively undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney and Ray are champions at the peak of their game in an
Olympic year, and yet they have been overshadowed by gymnastics'
equivalent of the senior tour.
</P>
<P>
   And, actually, they don't mind it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the likes of Maloney, Ray, Vanessa Atler and Alyssa
Beckerman are the more logical choices to make the 2000 Olympic
team, most of the attention during the selection process that
begins today will be on the comeback efforts of Shannon Miller,
Dominique Moceanu and three other veterans from the ``Magnificent
Seven,'' the 1996 Olympic gold medalists in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to be prime territory for generational strife,
jealousy and intrigue, and yet that doesn't seem to be the case.
And much of the credit, strangely enough, goes to the past master
of gymnastics intrigue, Bela Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
   It was Karolyi, appointed earlier this year as national team
coordinator, who arranged a series of monthly training camps at his
New Waverly ranch to mesh the old and new into what USA Gymnastics
hopes will be a medal contender for the Sydney Olympics. And he
seems to have bridged the generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're kind of melding together,'' said Ray, 18, from
Columbia, Md., the defending national champion on floor exercise.
``I know that the (1996 Olympians) have a lot of experience under
them and in that since we're a little different, but we're all
going for the same goal. And I think that their comeback has been
an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the monthly camps at Karolyi's ranch, ``I think I would
have felt a little more intimidated by them,'' Ray said. ``But now
that we've all worked together, it's a more personal feeling toward
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, 19, from Pen Argyl, Pa., is the first gymnast since Kim
Zmeskal of Houston in 1990-92 to win back-to-back national
all-around titles, and a victory this week would make her only the
third gymnast in history to win at least three in a row. But with
so much attention focused on the former Olympians, she has a chance
to sneak in under the radar screen that normally is trained on the
defending champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes the pressure off, especially when everything is
focused on a lot of other people and spread out,'' she said. ``I
think I like it better. I like going in as an underdog or whatever
to show them I can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition begins today at the Kiel Center with preliminary
rounds in the all-around competition, which concludes Saturday
night. Today's scores also will be used to determine the individual
champions on each apparatus _ vault, balance beam, uneven bars and
floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Event finals and all-around finals will make up 40 percent of
the score used to determine the top candidates for the Olympic
team, with the bulk of the scores coming from next month's Olympic
trials in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   However, the final word on selection of the six-member team will
fall to a committee headed by Karolyi in consultation with USA
gymnastics president Bob Colarossi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of the truth. There is nothing to hide,''
Karolyi said. ``There are nice surprises, very pleasant surprises,
coming around, and now they are coming even more strongly from the
former ones, the ones we are so proud of, the Olympic champions who
are filling the gap on the competitive side, getting into
competitive shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very interesting to see. Here is the younger
generation. Here is the older generation. How is it going to shape
up?''
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, the seven-time Olympic medalist who is the most
decorated women's gymnast in U.S. history, that may remain unclear
for awhile. Miller is recovering from a leg injury suffered in
early July and was a long shot to compete today. However, her
coach, Steve Nunno, said Miller had a good workout Wednesday and
could compete on uneven bars or vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of competition allows her one more competition under
her belt, so it's essential she be allowed to compete here,'' Nunno
said. ``She vaulted for the first time (Tuesday) night and was able
to do uneven bar dismounts, which was one of the missing links in
being able to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the spotlight also will fall on Moceanu, the 14-year-old
sprite of 1996 who has grown 10 inches in four years and went
through a protracted legal battle with her father, Dumitru, and
mother, Camelia. She later reconciled with her mother and moved to
Cincinnati, where she is training with coach Mary Lee Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, as with her 1996 teammates Amy Chow, Jaycie Phelps,
Miller and Dominique Dawes, struggled during the first weeks of her
comeback attempt but is confident of her chances for another
Olympic team berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm older, I know what to expect, and I want it and want it
bad for me and for my future,'' she said. ``I know so much more. I
was so young the last time around. Four years is a long time, and
it covers a lot of experience and knowledge, both mental and
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy said that maturity, coupled with the new code of points
that govern how the sport is judged, ensures that viewers will see
a much different Moceanu than the one they remember from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her style has changed. She's a mature and happy athlete,''
Tracy said. ``I think that the code that we are under now allows
for enough flexibility that you can be older and more mature and
can get your degree of difficulty without being 4-6 and 60
pounds.''

EDITORIAL: THE PENTAGON'S ANTI-GAY POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   No amount of anti-harassment training can correct the injustice
of the ban on openly gay service members in the U.S. military. Last
week Defense Secretary William Cohen released yet another set of
guidelines on how to stop anti-gay harassment. But this new action
plan, like previous guidelines, will most likely prove ineffective
because the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on which it is based
is unworkable. The way to curb harassment is to allow gays to serve
openly without fear of expulsion if they report harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The policy adopted in 1993 was supposed to provide more humane
treatment for gays by allowing them to serve if they did not
disclose their sexual orientation or engage in homosexual conduct.
It has instead forced gays to lie, and has resulted in more
harassment and a near doubling in the numbers of people being
discharged annually on the basis of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan calls for more anti-harassment training and
sanctions against those who engage in or tolerate harassment. But
victims of harassment could still be ousted if they happen to
disclose their sexual orientation in the course of making a
complaint. This absurd situation forces victims who want to keep
their jobs to suffer in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Homophobia in the military today is undeniable. Even Cohen has
said that anti-gay harassment seriously undermines discipline and
order. The only real solution is for Congress and the president to
repeal the ban that was written into law in 1993 and that continues
to fuel anti-gay bias.

EDITORIAL: WIRETAPPING IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans now log on to the Internet as naturally
and as frequently as they pick up a phone. Technology has created a
revolution in personal communications, but technology is also
making it possible for government and even employers to monitor
private conversations as never before. Telephone-era laws must be
updated to address these new challenges to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the White House proposed some limited changes to the
federal wiretap and electronic privacy laws that would raise legal
standards for government interception of e-mail. Separately,
several lawmakers introduced legislation to require employers to
notify employees about how e-mail, Internet use and phone calls are
monitored. Employees of The New York Times Co. are already notified
that the company reserves the right to review e-mail messages while
investigating a complaint. Last year the company dismissed 23
employees _ most based at a regional business office _ for sending
offensive e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of more stringent controls, law enforcement
agencies may be tempted to conduct wholesale monitoring of digital
written communications. It is probably not practical for agents to
listen in on all the phone calls, for example, that go through
AT&AMP;T. But new technology is making it possible for agencies like
the FBI to scan, read and record millions of pieces of e-mail on
the network of an Internet service provider. Until now, this kind
of power and its potential for abuse were not so readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Current wiretapping laws were not drafted with this technology
in mind and need to be updated. Various statutes now set different
legal standards for the secret interception of domestic
communications by law enforcement agencies, depending on whether
the communication is by telephone, e-mail or cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is proposing to eliminate these
inconsistencies. Its plan would bring the standards used for
intercepting e-mail messages up to the stricter, more protective
level now applied to telephone wiretaps. Illegal interception of
e-mail would result in suppression of the evidence, as is the case
now with illegal interception of phone calls. The proposal would
also enforce the same legal standards that apply to phone calls for
interception of e-mails sent by cable modems, which have a greater
degree of privacy protection under a law that governs cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also calling for greater authority for
courts to review law enforcement requests to use devices that
record the phone numbers of incoming and outgoing calls and to
track the origins and destinations of e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   These changes are clearly needed. But Congress also needs to
provide new safeguards against the government's wrongful use of
ever more powerful surveillance technology against law-abiding
citizens. Serious concerns have been raised about Carnivore, the
new online wiretap system used by the FBI to track the
communications of individuals suspected of criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says the technology can isolate the e-mail of the target
of an investigation. But the system, when hooked up to the network
of the Internet service provider, gives the FBI unlimited access to
the e-mail of all other subscribers on the network. While a court
order is still required to intercept the content of messages, the
secret technology controlled exclusively by law enforcement raises
fears of improper monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, routine government surveillance of private
conversations was limited as much by practicality as by legal
constraints. Now that it is feasible to eavesdrop electronically on
an unlimited scale, the laws have to be strengthened to prevent
monitoring of all online communications simply because technology
makes it easy.

EDITORIAL: A MISSILE MESSAGE FROM NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin of Russia came back from North Korea
recently reporting a tantalizing offer. The North, he said, would
give up its menacing long-range-missile program if other countries
would launch at least two North Korean space satellites a year. If,
as Putin believes, Pyongyang envisions sending its satellites
abroad for launching, the proposal merits serious consideration.
But if North Korea expects other countries to provide it with
advanced rockets it could learn to copy, the risks are
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea now appears to be in the early stages of a
transformation that Washington should actively encourage. After
decades of belligerence and self-imposed isolation, Pyongyang has
reached out in recent months with words and gestures of
reconciliation, most notably toward its former archenemy, South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too soon to conclude that North Korea has joined the
community of peaceful nations. Its nuclear weapons and missile
programs have been suspended, not abandoned. Reckless foreign
missile sales and human rights abuses continue, as do allegations
of international drug trafficking. America must use caution in
engaging North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's efforts to develop long-range missiles have
alarmed Japan and have driven U.S. efforts to build a limited
national missile defense. Washington's next step should be
clarifying what Pyongyang has in mind. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright can begin that exploration when she meets with North
Korea's foreign minister in Bangkok on Friday. Past experience with
North Korea suggests that its initial bargaining proposals can be
vague and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Besides confirming that North Korea is proposing satellite
launches from outside its territory, Washington needs to find out
whether the satellites would be used for military and intelligence
purposes and who would pay the launching costs. It should also seek
a North Korean commitment to stop exporting missile technology.  &QL;

Astros' three homers in sixth sink Reds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CINCINNATI _ The wins are back _ and so is the music.
</P>
<P>
   What has bordered on a funeral-like atmosphere in the Astros
clubhouse this season quickly turned into Party Central on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on top of the world, man,'' manager Larry Dierker said
after the Astros again came from behind to beat the Cincinnati Reds
3-2, completing their first three-game sweep at Cinergy Field in
nearly 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had barely put the finishing touches on their
season-high fifth consecutive victory when pitcher Jose Lima popped
a CD _ his own naturally _ into a boom box and the Astros began a
sing-along.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that has produced the worst record in baseball,
there were plenty of reasons for the Astros to celebrate. They rode
a three-homer barrage in the sixth inning, a solid seven-plus
innings from righthander Scott Elarton (10-4) and a clutch relief
performance from newly anointed closer Octavio Dotel to complete
their first three-game sweep of the season and first in Cincinnati
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep also was the first for the Astros since taking three
from the Cubs last Sept. 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning makes everybody happy,'' said Jeff Bagwell, who hit
his 28th home run as the Astros rallied from a 2-0 deficit. ``When
you're losing every single night the way we've lost, you're not
going to see this kind of atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds blew a lead for the third straight game as the Astros
hit three bases-empty home runs off Steve Parris (5-13) during a
span of eight pitches in the sixth inning. Rookie Julio Lugo led
off with a first-pitch homer, his second of the season, and Bagwell
followed two pitches later with a shot off the right-field foul
screen to tie the score at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who also hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the ninth
inning of Tuesday's 7-4 victory, has homered in five of his last
six games.
</P>
<P>
   After Daryle Ward struck out, Moises Alou hit his 16th home run
_ a towering blast that landed several rows into the upper deck at
Cinergy Field. It was only the 33rd red-seat homer in the stadium's
30-year history, and Alou was the first Astro to reach the upper
deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good. I knew it was gone when I hit it,'' said Alou,
who hit the only other upper-deck shot of his career in 1993 at New
York's Shea Stadium off Dwight Gooden while with the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who lasted only 3 innings in his last start July 21,
became the Astros' first 10-game winner. He allowed two runs and
five hits before exiting the game with two out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a solo home run to Michael Tucker in the second
inning and a run-scoring double to Ken Griffey Jr. in the third,
Elarton retired 14 of the next 15 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I pride myself on is getting stronger as the
game goes along,'' said Elarton, who has won six of his last seven
starts. ``I just feel so much better than I did earlier in the
season. Things are starting to fall in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton allowed consecutive two-out singles in the eighth before
Dierker decided to insert Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Elarton) told me he thought I was making the wrong
decision,'' Dierker said. ``Afterward, he told me it worked out,
but he still thought I made the wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Elarton: ``I didn't want to come out. Everything worked
out. Dotel did a great job in a tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and second, Dotel retired Griffey on a fly
to center field. He allowed a single in the ninth before striking
out the final two batters for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel hasn't allowed a run in eight relief appearances covering
9 innings since replacing injured lefthander Billy Wagner in the
closer role July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to help my career as a starter being in
these tough situations,'' Dotel said.
</P>
<P>
   During their five-game winning streak, the Astros are hitting a
collective .365 with 14 home runs. They have reached double-digits
hit totals in each game, including 11 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you some confidence,'' Dierker said of the club's
recent success. ``When you play as poorly as we have this year,
generally you don't have things go your way. You're expecting
things to go wrong. Now that we've had some things go right maybe
we'll start to believe they will go right.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, a 3-0 start to a 10-game road trip has put the
hop back into the Astros' dance step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in the clubhouse knows we can play and
should have played this way the whole year,'' Elarton said. ``Now
we feel more relaxed and are able to have fun.''

High school coach Seder battling for roster spot as Cowboys kicker
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WICHITA FALLS _ Cowboys kicking coach Steve Hoffman is constantly
soliciting videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Those he likes end up in a stack on his desk. Those he doesn't
like end up in his VCR for re-recording. He's particularly fond of
old John Wayne flicks.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, a tape leads him to a future Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Seder hopes to be that rare one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's still hard for him to believe he's here. He
expected to be on a football field this fall. That field, however,
wasn't at Valley Ranch or Texas Stadium, but at Lucas High School
in Ashland, Ohio, where Seder coached the offensive line and
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   He had dreamed of kicking in the NFL and had made the tape for
Hoffman three years before after his coach at Ashland University
had bent Hoffman's ear at the scouting combine. Three years later,
Seder didn't know the tape still existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was done,'' Seder said. ``I still kept working
out, doing things because I was coaching. But at that point, I
thought I was moving on in a different direction with my career,
teaching, coaching, that type of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Seder received a call from Hoffman, who hadn't seen him in
person. Up to that point, Hoffman was going off a recommendation
and a short video, made on a home camera, that featured Seder
kicking into a net at the high school gym.
</P>
<P>
   He'd kept in shape, but there was snow on the ground in Ohio, so
the indoor net was the only practice he'd had. And he had no shoes.
The closest thing he had was a pair of indoor soccer shoes, which
Seder had lent to a student. He got them back and made the trip to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Are you going to kick in those?''' Hoffman said. ``He
said, `They're all I've got.' He's a real humble guy. I'm sure he
wasn't making $100,000 a year in coaching to buy others. And I
said, `OK, do whatever you have to do to warm up,' and his first
kick wasn't so good and I thought, `Oh, boy, here we go,' then his
second kick was right down the middle and way up in the net. Then
he did it the whole workout.''
</P>
<P>
   He went home and eventually told his students about the
opportunity. They then helped him get into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that I pushed them to make them better and
they try to do the same thing for me,'' Seder said. ``Especially
when they heard I was going to be playing. They knew I needed to
get myself in shape and they pushed me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder still had to compete with several others to earn a spot on
the training camp roster. He did, and is now one of only two
kickers in camp. Rookie Rian Lindell out of Washington State is the
other candidate. Neither has pulled away as the favorite 10 days
into camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like humble guys,'' Hoffman said. ``I like guys who keep
their mouth shut and just do their job. You've got to find the guy
who is capable, the guy who has the proper technique to keep from
getting in a slump, and you have to find the guy who's strong
enough mentally to handle it. And ever since I've been around
(Seder), I get the feeling more and more he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's made improvements as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed the way he came out of his stance,'' Hoffman said.
``He had a little hop step, a little hop and a jab step. A lot of
kickers have these little quirks, but I always try to convince a
guy to get rid of that because it leads to inconsistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder's coaching experience is one of his biggest assets,
Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being a coach has probably helped him _ a lot,''
Hoffman said. ``You're preaching discipline and hard work to your
kids and now you're on the other side of it. His character is that
way. He's just that kind of guy. He won't go off track much.''
</P>
<P>
   At 25, with a few of years of coaching behind him, he's a
smarter player, Seder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach is a little bit different,'' he said. ``I think
it's important that you pay attention to detail. You learn as you
get a little bit older to pay attention to detail, do a lot of
little things (to get) yourself ready, the mental approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The two kickers would never be confused in a lineup. Seder looks
the part, at 5-9 and 180 pounds. Lindell fits in better with the
linebackers, standing 6-3 and weighing 235.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rian's biggest advantage is his strength,'' Hoffman said.
``You see a lot of kickers in the summertime who can kick 53-yard
field goals. But some make 53-yard field goals by a yard. Rian's
making it by 15 yards. The guy who's making them by a yard isn't
going to hold up in December in the Meadowlands, because now his
40-yarders are making it by a yard. Rian, when he gets a hold of
it, just clobbers it because he's so big and strong. When he
mishits a ball, he still has the strength to get it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder has good strength as well. He made a 60-yarder at Texas
Stadium before camp opened, then hit a 52-yarder Wednesday that
could have gone another 15. The job, therefore, isn't expected to
be won on strength, but consistency.
</P>
<P>
   And if neither is deemed the answer, there are plenty waiting in
the wings. Eddie Murray, who joined the Cowboys midway through last
season, is still out there, as is Richie Cunningham, who was cut to
create that vacancy for Murray. Chris Boniol, Jeff Jaeger, Michael
Husted and Chris Jacke are among a list of about 10 veterans who
could come in on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to get a young guy for (the rookie minimum)
$193,0000,'' Hoffman said. ``We're going to try to orchestrate
their success. But at the end of August, hopefully Tim or Rian has
convinced us and they're good enough and confident enough. I feel
pretty good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder admits the dream won't be complete unless he makes the
team. He does know, however, he has a really nice life to return to
even if the dream isn't realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that is what I do, but it's certainly not who I
am,'' Seder said.
