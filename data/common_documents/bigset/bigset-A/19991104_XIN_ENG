<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) has cut its aid to Mozambique for the period
1999-2000 by 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said in a statement
Wednesday that the UNDP had cut 3.2 million U.S. dollars from its
funds intended for Mozambique for 1999, and 1.92 million dollars
for the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Simao warned that the budgets of all Mozambican programs that
benefit from UNDP financial support must now be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Foreign Ministry is contacting other
cooperation partners in efforts "to find alternatives that will
allow implementation of the entire program currently under way".
</P>
<P>
The cut was decided upon by the UNDP's head office in New
York, and resulted from the considerable decline in voluntary
contributions to development programs from UN member countries,he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the UNDP's case, the funds at its disposal have fallen
from an annual average of about a billion dollars in the early
1990s, to between 700-750 million dollars in recent years.

<HEADLINE> S. African Correctional Services Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Correctional
Services commissioner Khulekani Sitole resigned on Wednesday after
being accused of abusing public funds and mismanaging his
department.
</P>
<P>
He will go on immediate special leave and his resignation will
be effective from January, Public Service and Administration
Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi told reporters after the
fortnightly Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was seen as a start in restoring public
confidence in clean government under President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Parliament's public accounts committee last week ruled that
sufficient evidence existed for Sitole not to hold high office in
the public service.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party spokesman Hendrik Schmidt said Sitole's
transgress regulations.
</P>
<P>
United Democratic Movement spokesman Gerhard Koornhof earlier
said Sitole should be fired immediately rather than resign.
</P>
<P>
Fraser-Moleketi said Correctional Services Minister Ben Skosana
would examine his department in view of what had emerged in
investigations into Sitole's conduct.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary committee found that Sitole had used state
money in a " wasteful and ill-advised manner".
</P>
<P>
It said he had given himself generous merit awards, and misled
Skosana about his involvement in a professional soccer team.
</P>
<P>
Sitole had been involved in situations where there had been a
conflict of interest between his public position and his private
interest, the committee found.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (xinhua) -- Since the current phase
of the United Nations oil-for-food program for Iraq started last
June, the country has exported over 330 million barrels for an
estimated revenue of 6 billion dollars, U.N. said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest update released at U.N. headquarters in New York,
the UN Office for the Iraq Program reported that during last week,
Iraq has exported over 15 million barrels of crude oil worth some
308 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile supplies, including oil industry equipment, continued
to arrive in Iraq, the Office said that over the past week, Iraq
had received 43 thousand tons of wheat, 14 thousand tons of rice,
920 tons of pulses and 2500 tons of detergents and soaps. Other
supplies included medicines, surgical gloves, welded pipes,
liquified chlorine gas, school desks and electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to an "oil-for-food" arrangement concluded between UN
and Iraq in 1996, Iraq is authorized to sell a limited amount of
oil to generate resources for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Iraq is responsible for implementation of the
program in the 15 governorates in the center and south. On behalf
of the Government, the United Nations implements the program in

<P>
NAIROBI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. agency recalled
Wednesday its staff who were deployed to repatriate 4,700 Kenyan
refugees in Ethiopia after receiving a request of the Kenyan
government.
</P>
<P>
The country office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) was informed by the government that the repatriation
operation, originally scheduled for Tuesday, should be suspended
due to security concerns and clan conflicts in the refugees' area
of return.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency will make new arrangements to assist the
refugees who had dismantled their shelters at refugee camps in
Ethiopia, according to a news release by the agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency will remain in close contact with the
Kenyan government for advice on the re-start of the repatriation
of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The refugees sought asylum in neighboring Ethiopia in May 1993
after Kenya's first multi-party elections in December 1992
provoked hostilities between the Somali Degodia and Ajuran clans
in northern Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slams U.N. Intention for Population  Registration in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Wednesday
launched "a strong protest" against the U.N. special
representative's intention to carry out a population registration
in Kosovo, a Serbian province, saying that Belgrade will never
accept such a plan.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter to the president of the
U.N. Security Council from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires
of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"I am writing to lodge a strong protest over the intention of
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United
Nations in Kosovo and Metohija, the autonomous province of the
Yugoslav constituent Republic of Serbia, to carry out a population
registration in that Serbian province," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only too obviously that the basic conditions for such an
important undertaking are non-existent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The terror of Albanian separatists continues unabated and the
violence against, and the ethnic cleansing of, Serbs,
Montenegrins, Roma and other non-Albanians has not been stopped in
a situation when over 250,000 of them have already been driven out
of Kosovo and Metohija," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Over 200,000 foreign nationals have entered the Serbian
province illegally due to inadequate border protection by the
international security force (KFOR) and the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many major cities and towns, such as Pristina and Pec, have
been almost completely ethnically cleansed," he said. "These
conditions do not warrant a fair registration and would amount to
a recognition of the fait accompli and further encouragement of
the separatism, violence and terrorism of Albanian extremists."
</P>
<P>
"The competent authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia are in possession of the
correct data prior to the arrival of UNMIK and are in a position
to carry out a regular registration once the conditions for it
have been created," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Also, it is within the exclusive competency of these
authorities to issue personal identification documents, as it is
the prerogative of sovereignty of every State," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The UNMIK plans to carry out a population registration in
Kosovo and Metohija are in direct contravention of Security
Council resolution 1244 (1999) and, as such, are rejected,
condemned and will never be accepted by the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution 1244 on June
10, demanding all countries to respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania stands for
strengthening military cooperation to maintain peace and stability
in the southern and eastern Africa, but refuses to establish a
defense pact.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Defense Minister Edgar Majogo told the National
Assembly (parliament) Wednesday that it is not yet appropriate for
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa
Cooperation (EAC) countries to establish a defense pact like NATO.
</P>
<P>
"There are provisions for political and defense cooperation in
the treaties establishing SADC and EAC which could be traced to
the liberation wars," he said. "At present such cooperation is
being carried out under a sector known as 'the organ for
political, defense and security."
</P>
<P>
Majogo added that a body known as Interstate Defense and
Security Committee has been formed to deal with defense
cooperation in joint military exercises and exchange of students
among member states in the southern and eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the East African treaty for cooperation, there
are provisions for defense cooperation and a defense agreement
which has already been discussed and is expected to be signed by
member states soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the House in the central town of Dodoma, the defense
minister said that Tanzanian, Kenyan and Ugandan armed forces have
been cooperating in training, games and disaster management.
</P>
<P>
"Such defense cooperation sufficed at the moment in accordance
with the existing degree of political and economic cooperation,"
he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Majogo made the statement in response to a question why the
SADC and EAC countries should not have a defense pact or treaty
like NATO to help quell any army mutiny or military invasion in
any member country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Peasants in Angola's
northeastern Lunda- norte Province are encouraged to cultivate
tuber crops such as maniocs, potatoes and sweet potatoes in the
current agricultural year, the National Union of Angolan Farmers
has said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, farmers living near Chitato City in northeast
Lunda-norte are making preparations for the cultivation of maniocs
and sweet potatoes in a piece of field of 20,000 hectares, said
Daniel Mutambuleno, provincial secretary of the farmers union.
</P>
<P>
In partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, the national farmers union is presently organizing
and materially supporting the farmers, aiming to improve the
living standard of the peasants and relieve the food crisis caused
by the prolonged civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Lunda-norte, famous for its abundant diamond reserves, has also
" considerable" arable field with great agricultural potential and
resources for cattle-breeding, particularly in the cities of
Chitato, Cambulo and Lucapa, said Mutambuleno.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the provincial production of tuber crops in
the current agricultural year is estimated to increase by 20
percent as compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
After a general offensive against the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (U NITA) rebels led by Jonas Savimbi in the
central plateau, the Angolan government has driven the rebels into
the forest areas.
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, peace has been temporarily restored in the
cities and some arable areas.
</P>
<P>
In the central Province of Bie, which suffered the most painful
loss during the war, agricultural organizations vowed to make
efforts to resume agricultural production, with an aim to plant
28,000 hectares of corn and 15,000 hectares of butter bean in the
1998/1999 agricultural year.
</P>
<P>
In western Benguela Province, the peasants are expected to
produce 832 tons of corn, 710 tons of peanuts and 150 tons of
sweet potatoes.

BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry on
Wednesday slammed the U.S. representative at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee of blocking another 10 contracts signed under the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry said the U.S. envoy
at the Sanctions Committee put those 10 contracts on hold
during the committee's sessions held on October 27 and October
29.
</P>

The spokesman said those contracts were signed in the fifth

oil spare parts, medical prerequisites and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase which
expires this month, Iraq is allowed to sell limited amount of oil
in every six months to pay for the imports of food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys in
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately hampering the endorsement
of its contracts signed with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq argues that the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate
the sng its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) - European stock markets ended

Leading shares had opened the session lower under pressure from
another late sell-off on Wall Street, a feature which has
characterised recent sessions and has led some to conclude the UK
is still on a vulnerable footing.

Paris' CAC 40 set another record close, finishing up 0.39
percent at 4917.84 on volume of 2.7 billion euros. During the

LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will impound motor
vehicles on the road bearing foreign and the out-lawed red
temporary registration number plates from next week.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of National Road Traffic Commission Martin
Mbangu said on Wednesday the crack down came after many people
maintained foreign plates beyond the stipulated period of one
month without reason.
</P>
<P>
Mbangu said that people had continued to use the out-lawed red
 plates despite the deadline of October 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the laws of Zambia, driving a car with a foreign plate is
 an offence unless you are a diplomat, and that the stipulated
period for a car using a foreign or temporary plate in Zambia was
30 days.
</P>

He said the commission had introduced a new black temporary
plate earlier this year and set October 1 deadline for the red

<HEADLINE> Armenia to Continue Reforms: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Armenian President Robert
Kocharian on Wednesday reaffirmed his resolve to continue the
policy of reforms despite the country's destabilized situation
caused by the recent appalling terrorist action.
</P>
<P>
"Armenia will be able to overcome its recent problems and to
continue its development constitutionally," Kocharian said to
around thirty bank executives.
</P>
<P>
Kocharian positively assessed the stability the country's
banking system demonstrated in the wake of the October 27 tragedy,
Interfax news agency quoted the presidential press service as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Armenia's banking system is capable, stable and manageable
even under such emergency situations," said the president. These
qualities will have a positive impact on the overall economic
development and investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The banks' actions under the emergency circumstances proved
that authorities and business are partners and allies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kocharian denied the reported preparation of amendments to the
law on banking confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
Tigran Sarkisian, chairman of Armenian Central Bank confirmed
that the program the government scheduled for this year remains in
effect. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have
committed to pursuing their programs further, and are prepared to
discuss additional assistance to Armenia under the current
difficult circumstances.

<HEADLINE> UN Sets Current Humanitarian Priority in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said
on Wednesday that its current humanitarian priority in Afghanistan
is to secure humanitarian access to 65,000 people who have been
displaced by the fighting on the Shomali Plain.
</P>
<P>
The perennial resumption of fighting between the Taliban and
the Northern Alliance has brought yet more misery to Afghan
civilians and ensured that the international assistance programs
in the country continue to be implemented in a volatile and
insecure environment, U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
The unrelenting cycle of seasonal offensives and frequent
natural disasters has led to significant internal displacement and
resulted in the departure of over two million Afghans for Iran and
Pakistan, and the three offensives of 1999 have displaced over
230,000 people, all of whom will require emergency food and
shelter assistance in the coming winter, according to U.N..
</P>
<P>
U.N. international staff returned to Afghanistan in March 1999
after an absence of eight months following the murder of three UN
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The return of international staff has been limited to the main
cities and is tempered by a strict security protocol.
</P>
<P>
Since the return, significant progress has been made with
principles that had been outlined in the Memorandum of
understanding signed with the Taliban in 1998, which outlined
fundamental conditions for UN Assistance, such as the access of
health care to women.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official on Wednesday
expressed hope that Russian's military actions in Chechnya would
not affect its relations with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Ramazan
Abdulatipov, who leads a delegation to the ongoing Arab-Russian
symposium, said Russia is keen on maintaining close relations with
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government appreciates Arab countries' stance on
the necessity of solving problems in Chechnya through peaceful
means, said Abdulatipov, head of the Russian-Egyptian Friendship
Society.
</P>
<P>
Russia began on September 5 to bomb the breakaway Muslim
republic in an effort to wipe out Islamic militants there. Arab
countries have expressed concern over the impact of the military
actions on the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries and Russia opened on Tuesday the symposium to
discuss ways of promoting bilateral and collective cooperation in
the economic and trade areas, and international and regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
Russia is keen on playing its role as a co-sponsor of the
Middle East peace process between Arab countries and Israel,
Abdulatipov said, adding that his country is also interested in
further promoting the economic relations with the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume has amounted to an annual 3.3 billion U.S.
dollars between Russia and the Arab world, he added.

<HEADLINE> Leading U.S. Economic Indicators Fall Slightly in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. leading economic
indicators fell slightly in September but the data showed a
continuation of the economic expansion through early 2000, said
the Conference Board, the U.S. prominent business research group,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a survey that the composite index
of leading economic indicators declined by 0.1 percent to 107.9 in
September after rising by a relatively strong 0.3 percent in May,
June and July and showing no change in August.
</P>
<P>
Six of the ten indicators that make up the leading index fell
in September, the Board said, adding that the most significant
decreases are building permits and manufacturer's new orders of
consumer goods and materials.
</P>
<P>
"Severe weather conditions and uncertainty over interest rates
may help explain why the rise in the indicators was cut short,"
said Ken Goldstein, the Conference Board economist. "without more
evidence of some underlying weakening in the economic
fundamentals, there remains little reason to expect that this
expansion will not set a record in February 2000, which would be
the 107th month of expansion."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Fall Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
manufactured goods dropped an unexpected 0.9 percent in September
as demand weakened for airplanes, cars and industrial equipment,
the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
September's performance, following a 1.3 percent rise the month
before, marks the first decline since a 1.4 decrease in April, the
Department said.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector reported the biggest decrease, down
4.2 percent in September, the first decline since April. The drop
was led by weaker demand for airplanes and aircraft parts and cars
and automobile parts. In August, transportation orders rose a
solid 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile transportation category, factory
orders would have fallen 0.4 percent in September, the largest
drop since a 1.9 percent decline in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that orders for industrial machinery and
equipment, including computers, down four of the last five months,
also fell in September, by 0.7 percent. But that was a better
showing than the 2.8 percent decline reported in August.
</P>
<P>
Orders for primary metals, which includes steel, also was down
for the second month in a row, falling 0.7 percent in September.
They were down 0.5 percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for electronic and other electrical equipment
were up for four months in a row, increased 1.3 percent in
September. That followed a 1.7 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders for durable goods dropped 1.3 percent in
September, while orders for nondurable goods, such as fuel,
declined by 0.4 percent. Both categories posted gains in August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. manufacturing sector continues to recover from the
world economic crisis, which dampened overseas demand for U.S.
goods. At the same time, manufacturers faced competition from a
flood of cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported
Monday that U.S. manufacturing grew at a slower rate in October,
while prices of raw materials soared to a four-year high. The
report suggests that the Federal Reserve's two interest-rate
increases last summer are restraining economic growth, analysts
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday said
that the Chinese Government "has always, in a serious and
responsible manner, fulfilled its obligations contained in the
human rights treaties it has ratified or acceded to."
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Sun Ang, the Chinese representative, took
the floor at the Third Committee of the 54th General Assembly. The
Third Committee is in charge of social, humanitarian and cultural
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Since the founding of the United Nations, the international
community has formulated a series of global human rights
treaties," he said. "Those treaties provide for States Parties'
rights and obligations with respect to the promotion and
protection of human rights in the relevant areas."
</P>
<P>
China has, to date, ratified or acceded to 17 human rights
treaties and signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
Since the ratification of the four treaties which require that
States Parties submit reports on implementation to relevant treaty
bodies for their consideration, "China has been earnestly honoring
its obligations as stipulated in those treaties in respect of
reporting," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Since the last session of the General Assembly, a Chinese
delegation participated in the consideration by the Committee on
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women of China's third
and fourth consolidated report on the implementation of the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women.
</P>
<P>
The report contains a special part concerning the
implementation of this Convention by China's Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR). HKSAR representatives also attended
the consideration and answered questions related to the special
administrative region posed by the Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the Chinese Government also submitted its
third report on the implementation of the Convention against
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment.
</P>
<P>
"This report also contains a part on the implementation of the
Convention by the HKSAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government is now getting ready for the
consideration of its report by the U.N. Committee against
Torture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Chinese Government has started preparing the
eighthe and ninth consolidated report on the implementation of the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Also initial preparatory work is being carried out for the
drafting of the third report on the implementation of the
Convention on the Rights of the Chile," he added.

<P>
GENEVA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were sentenced
Wednesday to prison terms from 21 months and five and a half years
for their role in the 1997 postal robbery involving up to 53
million Swiss francs (about 37 million U.S. dollars at that time).
</P>
<P>
A Zurich district court found all eight defendants in the case
guilty. The heaviest sentence was handed out to a former post
office employee who planned the September 1, 1997 holdup, one of
the world's biggest robberies, according to Swiss press reports.
</P>
<P>
The eighth, a 22-year-old Yugoslav, was charged with aiding and
abetting the robbery, and damage to property. He was sent to a
special correctional institution.
</P>
<P>
The "postal robbery of the century" trial in Switzerland began
last month under heavy security. Prosecutors have sought jail
sentences of between five and eight years. Time already spent in
custody will be deducted from the prison term.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 people in five countries were arrested in
connection with the case. Two of the alleged ringleaders were
extradited from the United States and Spain earlier this year.

JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Minister of
Home Affairs Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Wednesday that he has
spearheaded its fundamental transformation in a bid to attract
more investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite internal and external pressures, the department has
begun its change because the present legislative and regulatory
framework administered by it is unsatisfactory and problematic.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Buthelezi urged his department to focus on
dealing with illegal aliens rather than on making it difficult for
would-be investors to obtain residence in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the senior government officials become more
sensitive to foreign investments, brain gain and the expeditious
processing of applications.
</P>
<P>
Business Day newspaper Wednesday reported that Buthelezi had
met Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin in Pretoria Tuesday in
an attempt to resolve problems over the issuing of work permits to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held after an international company had
threatened to withdraw a 500-million-rand investment from South

<HEADLINE> Trial of Lebanese Renowned Singer Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese court Wednesday
postponed the trial of renowned composer and singer Marcel Khalife
who was accused of "defaming" Islam by citing a Koranic verse in
pop music.
</P>
<P>
Khalife, who faces a sentence between six months and three
years in prison if found guilty, will be tried on December 1,
after the judge accepted a plea from the singer's lawyer, who said
he had not enough time to prepare his defense.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Palace of Justice in downtown Beirut, hundreds of
university students expressed their support to the leftist
composer by chanting pro-Khalife slogans while an air-tight
security dragnet was clamped around the court.
</P>
<P>
Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Qabbani, Lebanon's highest Sunni
community leader, was behind the lawsuit that was first filed in
1996, a year after Khalife issued the song "Oh Father, It is I,
Youssef."
</P>
<P>
The lyric of the song, published by renowned Palestinian poet
Mahmoud Darwish in 1992, end with a quote from the Koranic
account of the plight of biblical figure Joseph.
</P>
<P>
The poem compares the oppression of Palestinians in some Arab
states to Joseph's suffering from maltreatment by his brothers as
was told in both the Koran and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
After triggering a wave of denunciations by intellectuals in
1996, the judicial proceedings against the singer were stopped,
reportedly on orders of then Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The case was revived by the new Chief Beirut Investigating
Magistrate Abdel Rahman Chehab on October 1, the first day of the
judicial year.
</P>
<P>
Local press said agreement had already been reached on a
compromise, under which Khalife would be exonerated in exchange
for removing the controversial song from circulation or deleting
the lines containing Koranic verse.

SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- With the Sydney Olympic Games
tickets in the pocket, Japan has nothing to lose and choose the
continental competition as the best arena to test their younger
generation players at the ongoing 7th Asian women's softball
championships.
</P>
<P>
National coach Yoshino Mineko included only one of their
national players in the squad for the quadrennial meet along with
members from college champion team.
</P>
<P>
School team of the Tokyo Women's College of Physical Education,
which averaged 20 years old only, won the All Japan tournament, a
national college league featuring 32 teams.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good chance to test our college players, who are the
future national players, at the international events," said
Yoshino Mineko. "The competitive games insure more improvements."
</P>
<P>
Japan kept an unbeaten run after edging off Chinese Taipei 2-1
on Wednesday thanks to Mitsuki Shiho's bingle at the last moment
of the seventh inning, in which Japan scored on two home runs.
</P>
<P>
"Softball is so popular in Japan that we set up separate
courses and tournaments for every age group from the primary
schools to colleges.
</P>
<P>
"We have systematic training programs for younger players,"
Mineko said, she herself used to play in college.
</P>
<P>
"Our college students are technically on the same level with
our international players. But they still are lack of experiences.
So that the Asian championship is the best arena to gain
experiences."

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Several countries and the
United Nations announced assistance of nearly 4 million U.S.
dollars here Wednesday to support relief and humanitarian
activities in India's state of Orissa which was heavily damaged
in a cyclone last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States has provided 2.35 million dollars including a
financial authorization of 1.08 million rupees (25,200 dollars) by
U.S. Ambassador Richard Celeste to the prime minister's relief
fund.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has rushed 120 metric tons of relief
material to the cyclone-hit area through the U.N. Children's fund
(UNICEF) and 50 tons of high protein biscuits through the World
Food Program.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the U.N. Information Center here said
Wednesday that total additional commitment so far from the U.N.
organizations was around 22 million rupees (513,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Britain and Germany have donated 23 million rupees (536,000
dollars) each while the Canadian International Development Agency
has decided to give 4.35 million rupees (100,000 dollars) to the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has intensified relief and rescue
operations in the state since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided Wednesday that
all BJP ministers at the center and states and members of
parliament and state assemblies donate one month's salary toward a
relief fund for victims of the super cyclone.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the east coastal area said rescue and relief teams
Wednesday accessed for the first time interior areas of the
worst-hit districts where the specter of epidemic loomed large
with water contaminated by floating bodies and carcasses.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India said that as the collapsed local
administration tried to recover from the ravages of the century's
worst cyclone, a clear estimate of deaths and destruction was
still not available.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were feared killed and some 15 million more
were affected as the cyclone, with a velocity of 240 kilometers
per hour, battered 10 coastal districts of the state for more than
eight hours last Friday.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Lighter Burdens for Developing Countries  in Human Rights Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called
for lightening burdens for the developing countries in reports on
the implementation of relevant Human Rights treaties, saying that
this would enable those countries to take advantage of their
limited resources in promoting and protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Sun Ang, the Chinese representative, took
the floor at the Third Committee of the 54th General Assembly
session, which is in charge of the social, humanitarian and
cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
"In the area of States Parties' submission of reports and
treaty bodies' consideration thereof, the situation are less
satisfactory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, what is covered in the reports as required by
the treaty bodies overlap, and technical requirements asked for
States Parties fail to take into consideration the particular
conditions of States Parties concerned, especially, those of
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What is more, the heavy burden placed on developing countries'
reporting work hamper the best use of those countries' limited
resources in promoting and protecting human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries have been calling for lightening States
Parties' burdens for years, but regrettably, no marked progress
has been achieved so far," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For treaty bodies, it is no easy job to comprehensively assess
a State Party's implementation of a human rights convention and
present conclusions and recommendations in a very short period of
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To do a good job of it, the cooperation between treaty bodies
and State Parties is of special importance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our sincere hope that State Parties and treaty bodies
will, on the basis of equality and mutual respect, enhance
communication and dialogue so as to enable the international
community to have a better understanding of the human rights
situations in State Party in areas concerned through the process
of submission and consideration of reports, which, in turn, will
ensure that this process play a constructive role in promoting and
protecting the human rights of that State," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the area of human rights instruments, as in other areas of
international affairs, the principle of sovereignty equality
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations is the basic
principle governing the relations between and among states," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Based upon this principle, China respects the choice by some
countries of abolition of death penalty by adherence to the Second
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Other countries, in exercising their sovereign rights, have
made different choices in the respect, based upon their respective
social, historical and cultural particularities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Choices as such should also be respected in the light of the
principle of sovereign equality," he said. "In this respect, we
should agree to disagree."

<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) - World Wheat Production is
forecast 4 million tons higher at 577 million tons, compared with
586 million tons in 1998, according to the latest Grain Market
Report by International Grains Council (IGC).
</P>
<P>
Increases have been made to estimates for several countries,
including China, Argentina, Russia, Canada, Kazakhstan, and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The only decrease was a small reduction for Algeria, the Grain
Market Report shows.
</P>
<P>
The figure for world wheat consumption is unchanged at 585
million tons, 4 million tons lower than in 1998/99. A decline in
projected feed use in the United States is offset by small
increases in total use in several other countries.
</P>
<P>
World wheat stocks are put 5 million tons higher at 120 million
tons or 8 million tons less than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Major wheat exporters are forecast at 56 million tons, about 10
million tons higher than the average for the 1990's, the Report
says.

<HEADLINE> Assasination of Prince Zulu Politically-motivated: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) has described the assassination of Prince Cyril
Cyrian Zulu, senior ANC official and member of the Zulu royal
house, as politically-motivated.
</P>
<P>
Prince Zulu, also chairman of the ANC-aligned KwaZulu-Natal
Hostel Residents Association, was gunned down by three men in
Lamontville, south of Durban, Tuesday morning while he was on his
way to catch a lift.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Mtholephi Mthimkhulu said later Tuesday that the
prince had apparently been threatened by elements aligned to the
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) prior to his assassination.
</P>
<P>
Zulu had informed the provincial leadership recently that he
had been receiving death threats from Inkatha-aligned elements,
the spokesman said. But he stopped short of blaming IFP outright.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it was imperative that both ANC and IFP
ensured elements bent on sabotaging this process be exposed. The
ANC called for calmness and restraint among its members.
</P>
<P>
IFP safety and security spokesman Velaphi Ndlovu said it was
irresponsible and premature to preempt the outcome of the police
investigation into the murder by blaming anyone.
</P>
<P>
"We totally condemn the insinuation and finger-pointing to us,
because by doing that we are misleading the investigation and we
do not give time to the police to investigate," Ndlovu said.
</P>
<P>
The IFP condemned the killing and expressed its condolences to
Prince Zulu's family and hoped the perpetrators would be brought
to book speedily, he added.
</P>
<P>
Prince Zulu was a prominent figure in promoting peace in
volatile KwaZulu-Natal hostels, especially during conflict
involving the ANC and IFP.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government and
junior doctors agreed on Wednesday to end the six-week strike.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a mutual agreement culminating in the signing
of a memorandum of understanding and the junior doctors have
agreed to resume work with immediate effect,"Public Service,
Labour and Social Welfare Acting Minister John Nkomo said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
President of the Hospital Doctors Association Nyasha Masuka
said that the junior doctors had resolved to return to work
because they had reached a consensus with the government over most
of their demands.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We also noticed that we were sacrificing patients for
our cause as we were using them as bargaining tools, and this is
not proper."
</P>
<P>
"The junior doctors will start returning to work on Thursday
although the situation is expected to normalize by Monday since
there are some logistics to be put in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, junior doctors' monthly salary
will reach 15,000 Zimbabwean dollars (395 U.S. dollars) from
January 2000.
</P>
<P>
The junior doctors went on strike six weeks ago demanding pay
rises and improvement in the conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
The strike paralyzed services at the state-run hospitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany's coalition cabinet
Wednesday in Berlin approved an investment program that would cast
some 67 billion marks in traffic projects in the following four
years, the ARD television reported.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt said the cabinet would
further negotiate for a "priority list" of the investment after
the Greens party, the junior partner in the cabinet, criticized
too many highway projects in the program.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members of the Greens party are worried about the
possible ecological impact of three highway projects in the
program and demanded more track transport measures.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, about 31.7 billion marks will be invested in
road traffic and 29.5 billion marks in track networks, with the
rest 3.6 billion marks being invested in water routes.
</P>
<P>
Projects in six federal states in east Germany account for 32.1
billion marks, as part of Berlin's long-term plan to improve the
infrastructure there.
</P>
<P>
Klimmt said the "projects for German reunification" should be
completed as soon as possible so that he could focus the financial
resources to improve the transport conditions in the west.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Considers Chechnya Issue Russia's Domestic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here on Wednesday that his government considered the
Chechnya issue a "domestic matter" of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remarks at the parliamentary group meeting of
his Democratic Left Party, one day before his three-day visit to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, Ecevit added that Turkey was worried that civilians
were being widely and heavily affected by the military operations
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Turkey was sensitive to the sufferings
of the Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, it is both sad and worrisome to see that civilians are
being harmed by the military operations taking place in the
region. We are sad because of humanitarian concerns and worried
because of the possibility that a great wave of migration could
result," said Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
He said that "a group of refugees comprising mostly women and
children have arrived in Turkey. It may not be possible for
Turkey, recently plagued by the hardships of the quake, to take
care of the matter if a significant flow of refugees were to take
place."
</P>
<P>
Turks of Caucasian origins in major cities around Turkey have
been holding protests against Russian military operations in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Moscow accused extremist Islamic militants of the rebel
Caucasian republic of carrying out several bomb attacks on
civilian buildings across Russia, killing hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Chechen civilians have been killed and tens of
thousands more have fled the republic since Russian troops
launched air and ground attacks on Chechnya weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Globalization Has Not Solved Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The executive secretary
of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific, Adrianus Mooy, Wednesday delivered a message in Bangkok
on the secretary-general's behalf at a ceremony marking 100 days
until the 10th U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, which
will be held in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that
globalization, for all its benefits, has not answered the problems
of mass unemployment or inequality.
</P>
<P>
He noted the violence and social tensions which afflict so many
developing countries are caused, at least in part, by deprivation
and inequality.
</P>
<P>
The conference, Annan said, can provide a framework for both
developed and developing countries to take key decisions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the developed countries must provide higher
levels of assistance and debt relief, while the developing
countries need to continue to reform their economies.

"South Africa has taken sides by supplying arms to some parties

"It is harboring elements close to the Burundi military junta

<HEADLINE> Finance Guard Arrested For Importing Ecstasy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A lance corporal in Italy's
Finance Guards, part of whose job is to stop drugs entering the
country, has been arrested Wednesday for bringing in 30,000
ecstasy pills to be sold in nightclubs around Rome.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that the 37-year-old Finance
Guard official Giuseppe Bonanno was believed to be part of a
criminal band which imports ecstasy from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
He apparently made use of his official position to move in and
out of Italy without undergoing border checks.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Guard was arrested along with his wife at their
home in Tricesimo, near the Italian northeast city of Udine.
</P>
<P>
Police, who found the haul of ecstasy on the premises, had been
investigating the drug operation for several months.
</P>
<P>
Their inquiries are continuing because the couple were believed
to be a small cog in a much wider network.
</P>
<P>
The arrests, which are embarrassing for the Finance Guards
corps, come on the crest of a wave of public concern over
so-called night-club drugs like ecstasy, which appear to be
increasingly popular among Italian youth.
</P>
<P>
Italian Social Affairs Minister Livia Turco Tuesday unveiled a
new scientific and police network to help counter the arrival in
Italy of new and potentially deadly discotheque drugs.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the network will be to identify the new
substances as they hit the market, ban them and alert potential
users to the dangers involved.

MAPUTO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has embarked on a
six- month consultations to make its Country Assistance Strategy

</P>
<P>
Observers believe that that such transparency should prevent

The World Bank asked Mozambique to liberalize its export of raw
cashew which would paralyze the Mozambican cashew processing
industry.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Rejects Extradition of Military Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENAS AIRES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem said Wednesday that his government would reject the eventual
request of Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon to extradite Argentine
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to a local radio station, Menem said that this
judge "is acting like the starlet of the whole world, it is
totally out of the question, out of place and with these type of
acts, is invading or damaging the sovereignty of various
countries."
</P>
<P>
Judge Baltazar Garzon behind the arrest of Pinochet issued
international arrest warrants Tuesday for Argentina's former
military rulers, charging them with "dirty war" atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the judge's previous acts, in the case of Augusto
Pinochet, Chile's former leader, Menem stressed that he was not
defending Pinochet, but Chile.
</P>
<P>
Menem added that he would refuse any request just before the
entry of the new government, which takes place on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Interior Minister Carlos Corach Wednesday described
as a "media show" the acts being carried out by a judge who wishes
to play at the politics of human rights at the expense of Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Corach said that the Argentine government had an absolutely
clear position with respect to the topic, insisting that
territoriality was a historical principle in international
relations.
</P>
<P>
Menem canceled his attendance of the Ninth Ibero-American
Summit, which will take place on Nov. 15-16 in Havana, in
solidarity with his Chilean counterpart, Eduardo Frei, who also
changed his plan to attend the meeting due to the Pinochet case.

<HEADLINE> Albright Utters Steps to Back Opposition in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday announced a series of steps to
interfere in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia by providing
support for the opposition force in the country.
</P>
<P>
"First, in cooperation with our allies, we will evaluate the
EU's pilot project.... This project will provide energy assistance
to the opposition-controlled cities of Nis and Pirot before
possible expansion to other municipalities," Albright said at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks with the presence of a few opposition
leaders in Yugoslavia including Zoran Djindjic, leader of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"We will be watching closely to see if the assistance actually
gets to the intended recipients in the manner proposed," Albright
added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration vowed to provide every support for
the opposition in Yugoslavia to topple the current government of
that country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has allocated some 11.8 million U.S. dollars to the
opposition since July, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also said that the United States will support
suspending the flight ban and oil embargo as soon as "free
elections" are held in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we will consult with Congress and discuss with our
European partners and other donors, the scope of external
assistance that could be made available after free elections have
been held and a new government is in place," Albright noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Syria's Version on Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday denied existence of an understanding that Late Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had pledged a full Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights in return for peace.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is agreed till everything is agreed, and there were
no agreements in this area (withdrawal from the Golan Heights),"
a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on remarks by Syrian Information Minister
Mohammed Salman, who said earlier on Wednesday that U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright did not dispute Syria's understanding
that Israel had pledged a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights in return for peace.
</P>
<P>
"Albright did not deny when she visited Damascus the existence
of the Rabin pledge in which he approved full withdrawal from the
Golan to the (pre-war) June 4, 1967 border in return for peace and
equal security arrangements," Salman said.
</P>
<P>
Albright visited Syria in September and discussed with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad on how to resume the Israeli-Syrian
talks, which suspended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Albright said after the visit that Syria wanted the United
States to act as intermediary to prepare for a meeting between
Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the State Department has been reticent about the
substance of the U.S. meditation effort.
</P>
<P>
"We don't talk about details of our discussions with the
parties on this," the State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The official also tried to reassure Israelis who might
suspect that the United States went too far in its meditation
work during the previous talks.
</P>
<P>
"We only convey from one party to another what we are
authorized to convey," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Salman urged the United States to "speed up its efforts
and meet its obligations to achieve a just and comprehensive
peace in the region."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Central Bank Doubts of Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- It is still too early to say
with certainty that the widely expected economic recovery is
under way in Israel, despite some indicators pointing in that
direction, the Bank of Israel said in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In the second and third quarters of 1999, there were some
positive developments in economic activity. Nevertheless, we have
to wait for data from the following months in order to determine
if these trends are firm and point to a recovery," the central
bank said.
</P>
<P>
Most Israeli economists are confidently indicating that there
will be a modest-to-strong economic recovery in Israel next year
after a three-year slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry officially forecast recently that the
gross domestic product will expand 3 percent in 2000 from this
year's 2 percent, while many private sector economists projected
that economic growth in 2000 will be 4 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
The inflationary barometers had moved lower in recent months
but they remained above the government's official annual targets
of 3 percent and 4 percent for 2000 and 2001, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The rising unemployment figures, which went up from first
quarter's 8.7 percent to 8.8 percent in the second quarter, did
not point to a continued slowdown, since unemployment is a
lagging indicator that follows behind wider trends in the
economy, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
In August, the bank said, the unemployment rate was 8.6
percent, meaning that more than 200,000 people were out of work
that month.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing weakness of the job market is mainly the
results of a low level of demand in the market, which shows that
the level of economic activity is not rising," the bank
added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sends Relief to Famine-Hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior government officials Wednesday told foreign donors and
aid groups that around 6,000 tons of food a month are being
distributed to the worst hit areas in northern and eastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
They said the situation could become even worse as the
Meteorological Department predicted that most parts of the country
would experience less than half of rainfall in the current rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
A large part of Kenya is arid or semi-arid with herdsmen and
small farmers relying on two rainy seasons, namely, the "long
rains"' from March to May and the "short rains'' running from
October to December.
</P>
<P>
However, the past two rainy seasons had failed in many
districts of northern and eastern Kenya ,and meteorologists warn
that the drought will last to the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Kenyans are already facing severe food
 shortages as experts fear the situation will get much worse
before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
Later last month, the government summoned all the provincial
commissioners to the capital for an emergency meeting to consult
the food relief program.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to allocate 300 million shillings
(about four million U.S. dollars) for food to the famine-stricken
areas and the National Cereals and Produce Board started Tuesday
buying maize from other districts as relief food.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that several foreign aid groups are already
involved in the relief effort although the Kenyan government has
not yet made a request for help from the World Food Program (WFP).
Some of them are distributing food to children in northern Turkana
District bordering Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Greece Dissatisfied With U.S. Newspaper's Terrorist Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Wednesday
voiced its dissatisfaction over the "Washington Post" article
concerning terrorism in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The positions of U.S. officials, who were included in the
report, were not only far from reality, but offered negative
services to the relations between the two countries, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that they did not reflect the stances of the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the particular concern and effort of
the Greek government and state services in combating terrorism
could not be questioned in the least bit.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Greece's ambassador Alexandros Filon Wednesday
delivered a demarche at the U.S. State Department over the
article.
</P>
<P>
The "Washington Post" reported Wednesday that the U.S. had
pressured Greece to take actions against terrorism in the country
and especially against the "November 17" terrorist group, which is
active since 1975 and responsible for the killing of 21 people,
including four Americans, and terrorist attacks against U.S.
diplomatic and military sites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. now offers a standing reward of 2 million U.S. dollars
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of "November
17" members.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the U.S. have since this year strengthened their
cooperation in combating terrorism, with more and more Greek
special police being sent to the U.S. for anti-terrorism training.
</P>
<P>
In October, Greece's Public Order Minister Michalis
Chrysohoidis visited Washington and discussed with his American
counterparts ways of dealing with terrorism, but he rejected the
U.S. request for a change in Greek laws covering terrorist
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Eliminating The Evil Right To The End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily will carry a
commentary tomorrow, titled "Eliminating The Evil Right To The End.
"
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the nationwide fight against the Falun
Gong sect has won a decisive victory, with the cult having been
banned and the majority of its practitioners waking up to their
errors.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should remain level-headed that a handful of
practitioners are still crazy about the sect, while a few key
members of the Falun Gong cult are still putting up a desperate
struggle. Some have even gone so far as to go on hunger strike to
pressure the government," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
All evidence indicates that the Falun Gong is thoroughly and
completely a cult organization that can cause great harm. "We
should not relax efforts, otherwise the dying cinders would glow
again." the article says.
</P>
<P>
The fight against Falun Gong is a long-term and arduous one.
The nature of the cult is heretical; its energy, stubbornness and
destructive power all lie in heresy.
</P>
<P>
Painstaking efforts must therefore be made to sway blind

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Launch Attacks on Sri Lankan Army Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels said
Thursday that they have launched a fresh assault on a strategic
military base in the north of the country following the capture of
two military complexes.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said in a statement
from its London office that heavy fighting was continuing for the
third day in the Wanni region, about 280 kilometers north of the
capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
"Having taken control of the military complexes at Oddusuddan
and Nedunkerni in quick succession during the last two days of
fighting, the LTTE fighting formations have now surrounded
Karupaddamurippu and pounding the strategic military base with
heavy artillery and mortar fire," it said.
</P>
<P>
The army has suffered more than 1,000 casualties in the battles
at Oddusuddan and Nedunkerni, according to the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The statement said government troops suffered further heavy
casualties when the LTTE fighting units launched a fresh offensive
thrust Wednesday night on the military base at Karupaddamurippu.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said Thursday that the military had begun
moving reinforcements into the northern Wanni region to stop the
rebel offensive codenamed "Unceasing Wave 3."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the LTTE rebels launched a massive
artillery attack on Wednesday on the Kanakarayankulam military
complex, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry admitted indirectly Thursday in
a statement that government troops lost the two towns of
Oddusuddan and Nedunkerni, the army's worst setback since
September 1998, when rebels overran an army camp at northern
Kilinochchi town in which nearly 1,000 soldiers and rebels were
killed.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry said the troops have fallen back tactically to
areas south of Oddusuddan and Nedunkerni after heavy
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a 16-year-old war against
the government for an independent homeland in Sri Lanka's north
and east for minority Tamils.

<HEADLINE> Leopard Injured Might Have To Have Leg Amputated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A wounded leopard receiving
medical treatment will probably have to have its right leg
amputated.
</P>
<P>
"If the blood circulation system does not recover in the next
two or three days, we'll have to amputate the injured leg," said
Li Tongyi, deputy head of the Animal Hospital of Zhengzhou Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The almost four year-old leopard was discovered roaring with
pain on a cliff by a villager near the National Mihou Nature
Reserve in Henan Province earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The leopard was then rescued and sent to the Animal Hospital of
Zhengzhou Zoo for medical treatment on Tuesday. There was a
cigarette-length cut on the front right leg of the female leopard.
</P>
<P>
The leopard has been given a transfusion of glucose, salt water
and antipyrotic. Doctors from Zhengzhou Orthopedics Hospital
yesterday checked the leopard's wound by moving an X-ray machine
into the zoo.
</P>
<P>
The leopard was believed to have stepped into a trap by
accident. It had been stranded on the cliff for at least four days
after it managed to free itself from the trap.
</P>
<P>
Exhausted, the leopard's leg also had an abnormal inflammation
of fluid.
</P>
<P>
Having returned to consciousness, the leopard lapped up some
water from a basin in front of her but showed no interest to a
chicken hanging over her head.
</P>
<P>
"If her leg is amputated, she will never be able to return to
the forest," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Leopards are the only mammals under intensive state protection
in Henan Province. They number less than 100 in the province.
</P>
<P>
Illegally hunting animals under state protection is currently
under investigation, according to local authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
approved the investment of 568 billion Vietnamese dong (40.86
million U.S. dollars) in 69 projects of the Vietnam Textiles and
Garments Corporation, Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the approved investment, 207 billion dong (14.9 million
dollars) has been contributed by the state, 54 billion dong (3.88
million dollars) has come from official development assistance
(ODA), 216 billion dong (11.19 million dollars) has been borrowed
and 91 billion dong (6.54 million dollars) has come from other
sources.
</P>
<P>
However, only 200.8 billion dong (15.8 million dollars) of the
credit and ODA capital has been disbursed so far, representing
46.5 percent of the 1999 plan. Of the disbursed capital, 130.7
billion dong (9.4 million dollars) was used in transitional
projects and 21 billion dong (1.51 million dollars) went to new
projects. Meanwhile, 3.16 billion dong (227,000 dollars) has been
disbursed from the state budget allotment for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Textiles and Garments Corporation in the coming
period will speed up the pace of disbursement for approved
projects, especially ODA projects to modernize textile enterprises
with adequate attention paid to environmental protection and
treatment of waste water.
</P>
<P>
The corporation will also focus efforts on the implementation
of key projects and the ODA projects which use capital from Italy,
Holland and China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Scientists Find What May Be The Oldest Known Vertebrates (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and British scientists
have unearthed fossils of two fish-like creatures roughly 530
million years old that could be the earliest known vertebrates.
The findings of the discovery were published in Scientific Journal
of Nature.
</P>
<P>
At a scientific news briefing organized today in Xi'an, Shu
Degan, one of the authors of the article, said that the finds push
the history of vertebrates to 50 million years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese teams separately excavated two fossilized fish-like
creatures of the Cambrian period, some 490 million to 545 million
years ago near Kunming, Yunnan Province in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The jawless fish-like creatures have traces of zigzag muscle
patterns and gill structures, both physical features of modern
fish, said Shu, head of the Institute of Primitive Life at
Northwest University.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that the two three-centimeter long fish-
like creatures lived during the Cambrian period, which witnessed a
great evolution of creatures.
</P>
<P>
Simon Conway Morris, a Cambridge University paleontologist who
also co-authored the Nature article, said that "the so-called
Cambrian explosion was more abrupt and dramatic than we thought."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Opposition Raps Oslo Summit Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), one of the Syria-based Palestinian
opposition groups, has rejected the results of the just concluded
Oslo summit.
</P>
<P>
Terming the results as harmful to the Palestinian national
dialogs, a press statement released Thursday by the DFLP said the
November 1-2 summit in Oslo, Norway, was within the context of the
biased Israeli-U.S. notion to uphold the Oslo process and accords.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Declaration of Principle in
1993, which grants limited autonomy to the Palestinians and was
regarded by the opposition as a compromise to the Palestinian
rights.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the Israeli government led by Ehud
Barak was seeking a lasting solution through a Camp Oslo by
February 2000, apparently analogizing it to the U.S.-manipulated
Camp David, rather than adhering to international legitimate
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that the Israeli stance would lead
negotiations to drag on and on for 20 years or more; by then the
Palestinian territories would have been digested by Israeli
settlements and Judaization.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Palestinian-Israeli peace deal in
September, the outlines for a permanent peace agreement will be
worked out by February next year.
</P>
<P>
At the tripartite meeting in Oslo, Arafat and Barak have
promised U.S. President Bill Clinton to work hard to draw up
outlines by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on Arafat's Palestinian National Authority
to stand fast against pressure from Israel and the U.S., and to
reject the attempts to impose an agreement beyond the framework of
international legitimate resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It also called for resumption of national dialog on the basis
of national unity of all Palestinian forces under the banner of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Urges for Full Partnership in Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien Wednesday called for "full partners" of the Americas at
the opening day of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)
Ministerial Meeting in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Addressing both the closing of the Americas Business Forum (ABF)
and the opening of the FTAA Ministerial Meeting, he told business
leaders and senior officials from 34 American countries that the
rise of a truly global economy needs "good bridges" that can bring
the Americas together.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the future business forum in the Americas
will become even more inclusive "to tap into the energy and
abilities of indigenous peoples and youth.
</P>
<P>
"We must also allow all of the economies in the Americas to be
full partners and beneficiaries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
His call for a Pan-American partnership came a day after the
chief of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Thomas Donohue urged an end
to the embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Donohue told the ABF meeting Tuesday that unilateral economic
sanctions against Cuba benefit neither the United States nor the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
He was supported by Canadian Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew,
who reiterated his country's support for the lifting of sanctions
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has been excluded from either ABF or FTAA discussions
under strong pressure from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day FTAA meeting, the trade ministers will discuss a
framework of FTAA by 2005 and a package of measures to simplify
customs clearances and make trade and investment policies
transparent.
</P>
<P>
Another focus during the two-day meeting will be a united stand
in a new round of talks of the World Trade Organization late this
month in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Disneyland Land Lease Conforms to HK's Land Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The proposed land lease for
the Hong Kong Disneyland project is not out of line with the
current land policy, though it is rather unique, a Hong Kong
government spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the current land policy, the grant of new leases
is for a 50-year term and to extend non-renewal leases for another
50 years is at the discretion of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to a media inquiry about the
authority of the HKSAR government in granting land leases beyond
June 30, 2047.
</P>
<P>
"Under Article 7 of the Basic Law, it provides the HKSAR
government the authority to manage, lease or grant land and
natural resources and for their lease or grant to individuals,
legal persons and organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed land lease for the Hong Kong Disneyland project,
like other land leases, is also subject to the payment of land
premium and annual government rent, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The comment that land leases granted after 1997 could not go
beyond June 30, 2047 is, therefore, plainly incorrect," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Basic Law's Article 121 has no such
restriction and that Annex III of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration only covered the grant of land leases before July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year plus 50-year lease term is not over-generous,
taking into account the huge investments in the project and the
fact that other overseas Disneyland parks are operated on a free-
hold lease term, he said.
</P>
<P>
The land grant for the Hong Kong Disneyland project will be
subject to the approval of the chief executive-in-council.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government would continue to follow the
existing land policy in granting new leases by taking into account
any particular circumstances of individual cases and to seek the
approval of the Executive Council where appropriate.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Scientists Find What May Be Oldest Known Vertebrates (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International academic circles widely believe that roughly 90
percent of specimens, which still exist today in the globe,
appeared during the explosion.
</P>
<P>
"The fish fossils could unveil the whole picture of the epoch,
as well as show us reliable evidence of the evolution of
vertebrates and their special organs," Shu said at an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In a Nature commentary together with the article, Philippe
Janvier, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History in
Paris, said that the new fossils "are probably the long-awaited
early Cambrian vertebrates."
</P>
<P>
Richard Aldridge from Leicester University in Britain sent an e-
mail to Professor Shu lauding his findings as extremely important.
</P>
<P>
The primary findings made by Shu and his colleagues stunned the
world after an international symposium in April in London. However,
some scholars are still suspicious of the so-called creature
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Desmond Collins, a paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum
in Toronto, asked: Why is there so little fossil records?
</P>
<P>
Shu and his team explained that the fin-bearing animals would
have been active swimmers, making it less likely that they would
have been buried alive when storms stirred up sediment from the
bottom of the sea.

<HEADLINE> Socialist Democracy and Legal Construction Key to China's Growth, Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's socialist democracy and
construction of its legal system has resulted in China's high-
speed economic growth over the past decades, said Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made these remarks in response to a German journalist's
question when he and visiting German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
briefly met the press after they held talks this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that "we have considered that politics and the economy
cannot be separated while economic growth is the overall basis of
development."
</P>
<P>
"Economic development is inseparably linked with democracy and
the legal system," he added. Since new China was founded 50 years
ago, "socialist democracy and legal system have witnessed great
progress unprecedented in Chinese history."
</P>
<P>
China and Germany hold different views on the concept of
democracy, Zhu said, but we can still exchange and communicate
ideas about democracy. We have already built channels for such
exchanges with Germany, and China is willing to continue such
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In response to a Chinese reporter's question on the one China
policy adopted by the new German government, Schroeder answered
that the new German government will unequivocally continue to
adopt the one China policy and Germany will not participate in any
activity that may pose a potential threat to China.

<P>
Powerhouse China, where Wushu was born, fielded only two

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers' Outpost Dismantled After Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers at the
Mitzpeh Hagit settlement in the West Bank dismantled their outpost
Thursday after a warning by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Settler families at the outpost, built nine months ago on a
barren hill southeast of the West Bank city of Ramallah, packed
their belongings Thursday and left, the army said.
</P>
<P>
Barak issued a warning Wednesday at the Defense Ministry in Tel
Aviv while presiding over the security cabinet meeting. He
required the settlers at four outposts in the West Bank to move
out by Friday or he would order the army to evict them by force.
</P>
<P>
The four outposts, inhabited by a handful of people, are among
the 12 hilltop settlements to be evacuated as part of a compromise
Barak reached with the settler leaders.
</P>
<P>
Security officials said the army has been given orders to
dismantle the encampments Sunday if the settlers fail to do
so. The other eight settlements have been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlements will be one of the thorny issues to be
dealt with during the final-status talks between the Palestinians
and Israeli negotiating teams, which will start intensive
negotiations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other key issues to be discussed include the status of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, water resources and the borders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
reaffirmed their intentions to strike a framework deal by next
February and a permanent peace treaty by next September at a
summit with United States President Bill Clinton in Oslo, Norway.

<HEADLINE> France Suggests Gradual Lifting of EU Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- France has suggested lifting some
sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) against Yugoslavia,
which have greatly affected the Serb.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine has written to his
counterparts in 14 other EU countries regarding the suggestion,
said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the continued reinforcement of measures that punish
the Serb leadership, while gradually lifting sanctions that punish
the Serb people, she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the French proposal came after the United
States suggested on Wednesday a possible lifting of sanctions if "
free elections" are held in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The United States seems to have changed its stand that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic should step down before lifting the
sanctions, she said.
</P>
<P>
The United States "joins us" by sharing the same perspective
for lifting the sanctions, "But we think it is necessary to act
right now," said Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
France is also considering "coordination" with the Serb
opposition parties "before, during and after" the election
campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The EU has decided to provide heating oil to two Serb cities
governed by the oppositions, Nis and Pirot.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the overall sanctions imposed by the West after the
Kosovo crisis broke out, Serbia is subject to an embargo of oil
products.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A gunman walked into an office building near a shipyard in
Seattle Wednesday and opened fire on a group of workers, killing
two and igniting a massive manhunt that kept students cowering
inside neighborhood schools and police officers searching door-to-
door for the suspect.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite Colombian and U.S. efforts to stem the flow of drugs
and guns that have helped build Latin America's most powerful
guerrilla insurgency, the rebels are amassing a sophisticated
arsenal from new sources in the former Soviet Bloc that is rapidly
changing the balance of power in Colombia's civil war, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The cyclone that hit India on Friday destroyed much of
Paradip, on the Bay of Bengal. State officials estimate that 3,000
people have died.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. government sued seven giant electric companies in the
Midwest and the South, accusing the utilities of defying anti-
pollution regulations and illegally contaminating the air of
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Nasdaq composite closed above 3000 points for the first
time, propelled by enthusiasm for technology stocks. Intel, which
has been an integral part of Nasdaq's success through the years,
rose 2.0625 dollars to 79.50 dollars. The Nasdaq composite now has
more than doubled in value since early October of last year. The
Dow Jones industrials advanced 27.22 points to 10609.06.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton vetoed the 313.6 billion dollars measure funding
labor, health and education, as well as its 1% across-the-board
spending cut, but tempered his remarks as he walked a fine line
between blasting Republican Party leaders and nurturing a
compromise.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Warns NPA Rebels Against Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada gave the rebel New People's Army (NPA) Thursday an
ultimatum to cease and desist from their terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
In an radio program, the president warned that the government
has unleashed the full might of the police and military forces
against them.
</P>
<P>
"I'm calling on them to stop their terrorist attacks. If they
don't do so, the government won't stop either until they are
punished," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on the public to help the government
flush out these guerrillas, especially those who are engaged in
abuses, like extortion in the guise of "revolutionary tax."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Estrada ordered the Philippine National
Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines to wage an all-out war
against the NPA for their recent atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The government believed that the NPA guerrillas were linked to
the recent abduction of two foreigners and the torching of a
Korean firm's construction equipment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the NPA raided two police stations, looting
some firearms and abducting four policemen, including a town
police chief.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of
National Defense said the government is doing everything to secure
the release of the policemen kidnapped by the NPA.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Mercado said the government is
negotiating for the safe release of Chief Inspector Abelardo
Martin and three others abducted by the NPA.
</P>
<P>
Mercado stressed, however, that this does not mean the
government will stop its operations to flush out the NPA rebels
from their lairs.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try everything. We will negotiate but we will also
implement the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also emphasized that peace talks with the NPA rebels at
the local level would go on, noting that there are local leaders
still willing to discuss peace with the government.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President on Resolving Conflicts Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said here Thursday that all the conflicts can be resolved by
heartfelt dialog.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement at the opening of the All
Africa Peace Conference in Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
It is the reluctance and failure by leaders to pursue dialog in
 resolving local and regional dispute that deteriorates the
situation, Moi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"In our part of the world, there are many problems, including
poverty, boundary disputes and social upheavals, which give rise
to conflicts," he said. "But I believe that these can be resolved
through the existing frameworks of our regional organizations."
</P>
<P>
Offering Nairobi as a venue for peace talks, Moi reiterated
Kenya's stand on politically solving the conflicts between
Ethiopia and Eritrea and those in the Sudan, Somalia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president was awarded a peace prize Thursday by the
U.K.- based Life Foundation Africa, the organizer of the peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence in 1963, Kenya has been an island of
peace among the turbulence of wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference will include workshops, seminars and
paper presentations on effective ways to bring about lasting peace
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
About 100 delegates from Africa, Europe and America are
attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Begins to Join Creditor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, which has repaid its
foreign debt of more than 50 billion U.S. dollars, owed when it
was gripped by a financial crisis in late 1997, is lending more
than it is borrowing overseas, said the Finance and Economy
Ministry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In September, South Korea's external debts dropped to 140.9
billion dollars while its loans to foreign nations totalled 141.3
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted that the country will maintain a net
creditor status next year due to the surplus of the current
account.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for South Korea to have entered the
group of creditor countries since its balance of foreign debts in
1979.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korea needs to further reduce its net foreign
debts to become a real creditor country as up to eight percent of
its overseas bonds went to such debt-ridden countries as Indonesia
and Russia, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Although the foreign debt ratio against gross domestic product
has fallen to 37.6 percent from 46.3 percent in December 1998, it
remains higher than the internally-accepted level of 30 percent.

HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- E-commerce is a key to Hong
Kong's continued competitiveness, a senior trade and industry
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It enables our firms to find ways to be more responsive to
changing market trends and to conduct business activities more
efficiently and more cost-effectively," Secretary for Trade and
Industry Chau Tak Hay said at the opening ceremony of the first
center for the advancement of e-commerce technologies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The past few years have seen a very rapid growth in the use of
information technology, and in particular, the growth of the
Internet has been phenomenal, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian-Pacific region is forecast to be the fastest growing
area in the world in Internet usage, he said, adding that "as one
of the leading business centers in the world, we in Hong Kong must
ensure that we keep pace with developments in information
technology."
</P>
<P>
The potential market that e-commerce can generate in cyberspace
is enormous, he said. There is little doubt that this new form of
doing business will become a powerful engine for future economic
growth, Chau stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore imperative that we grasp the opportunities
brought by e-commerce quickly or else we will lose out," he added.
</P>
<P>
With its high flexibility and cost-effectiveness, Chau said, e-
commerce will be a particularly suitable means to enhance the
businesses of small and medium-sized enterprises, which constitute
the bulk of Hong Kong companies.
</P>
<P>
The secretary emphasized that the government fully recognizes
the important role that it can play in encouraging the use and
development of e-commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to providing a favorable environment for e-
commerce to thrive and flourish in Hong Kong," Chau said.
</P>
<P>
The government will in the near future introduce an electronic
service delivery scheme to establish an information infrastructure
with an open and common interface, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is not only to provide more efficient and better
quality services to the community, but also to encourage the
community to accept e-commerce as an integral part of our daily
life," Chau said.
</P>
<P>
"We also recognize the importance of a sound legal framework
for the adoption of electronic transactions in Hong Kong," he said.
"An Electronic Transactions Bill is now going through our
legislature."
</P>
<P>
Full support and participation of the community to further
promote the development of e-commerce is also needed, Chau
stressed.

<HEADLINE> HK to Introduce Exchanges, Clearing Houses Merger Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- An Exchanges and Clearing
Houses Bill which seeks to enable the merger of the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange and their associating
clearing houses into a single holding company has been approved by
the Executive Council for introduction into the Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Hong Kong Financial Services Bureau said
Thursday that the merger of the two exchanges and their clearing
houses into a single holding company -- the Hong Kong Exchanges
Clearing Houses Limited (HKEC) -- is "an integral part of the
strategic financial market reform announced by the financial
secretary in March this year."
</P>
<P>
He said the bill would modify the existing legislative
framework for the securities and futures market to accommodate the
new market structure and ensure efficient regulation following the
merger.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the bill would prohibit any persons
to control either directly or indirectly any exchange companies or
clearing houses without permission from the Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC).
</P>
<P>
The bill would also impose a 5-percent shareholding limit and
demand that corresponding provisions be made to provide a clear
legal basis and procedures for the conversion of the Hong Kong
Securities Clearing Company from a company limited by guarantee,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Consequential amendments will be made to the existing
securities-related ordinances, including the Securities Ordinance,
Commodities Trading Ordinance, Stock Exchanges Unification
Ordinance and Securities and Futures Commission Ordinance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The merger would take place on the basis of the schemes of
arrangements approved by the members of the exchanges on September
27 and sanctioned by the court on October 11, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government is to complete the merger by late
January and early February 2000, or by March 2000 at the latest.
The bill will be gazetted on November 5 and introduced into the
Legislative Council for first and second readings on November 10,
the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Autonomous European Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said Thursday that European countries should develop an
autonomous force capable of staging military interventions
independent of NATO's existing command structure.
</P>
<P>
Richard made the remark at a French Institute of International
Relations (IFRI) seminar, which was attended by a large audience
including NATO Secretary General George Robertson and former U.S.
presidential advisor Brent Scowcraft.
</P>
<P>
"Our (European) countries have a great part of their military
capacities organized within the alliance (NATO), and we will make
sure not to overlap (with NATO)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a European capacity to intervene outside the
framework of NATO will change the international balance of power
in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
Richard said a stronger European defense force will also
benefit the United States, since Washington will have the "freedom
of choice" as to whether or not it joins a military operation in
Europe in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kosovo war demonstrated that Europeans could not
act alone without the technological and logistical support of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the United States is reluctant to buy
European defense armaments in order to protect its national
interests and its own defense industries.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the United States imports less than 5 percent of its
purchase in the defense field, while the Europeans import at least
20 percent of their purchases," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for SAARC Summit as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday called for
holding the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) summit as scheduled, saying there is no precedent that the
meeting is postponed because of any political developments.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman opposed India's request to postpone
the SAARC summit scheduled to be held in Kathmandu, Nepal, from
November 26 to 28.
</P>
<P>
"The (Pakistani) government is of the view that the summit
should be held as scheduled for which invitations have been
already personally delivered by the Nepalese foreign minister,"
the spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the history of the SAACR there is no precedent
for the postponement of the summit, nor does the organization's
charter provide for postponement, on account of political changes
in any member state.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC's "fundamental principles" are non-interference in
the internal affairs of member countries, eschewing of engagement
with political developments in individual countries and adoption
of decisions by unanimity, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he added, appreciated that no other member country of
the SAARC has moved for the postponement of the summit, which is a
proof of their maturity and their strong belief in the collective
interest of the region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf, who took
power after a coup three weeks ago, intends to take part in the
regional summit in the place of ousted Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Expands Operations in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Volvo, one of the largest bus
and truck makers in the world is planning to seize up to one-
fourth of China's heavy-duty truck market in the next few years as
part of its expansion move in Asia and the rest of world.
</P>
<P>
Volvo is preparing to set up its first heavy-duty truck joint
venture in China, expected to begin operation in the first half of
next year. The annual sales of the joint venture are planned to
reach 10,000 trucks in five years.
</P>
<P>
Ulf Norman, vice president and chief of General China
Operations of Volvo, told Xinhua that Volvo will bring to China
the advanced technologies of truck manufacturing through the joint
venture with China National Heavy-duty Truck Corporation (CNHTC)
in Jinan, east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40,000 heavy-duty trucks are sold in China every year.
The figure is expected to grow rapidly due to increased investment
in road constructions.
</P>
<P>
As the second largest heavy-duty truck producer in the world,
Volvo produces more than 90,000 such trucks every year. Recently
it has been strengthening its leading position in this market
sector by focusing on production of commercial vehicles and
engines for ships and aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
Volvo made 6.45 billion US dollars through selling its car-
making section to Ford in the US in January. It will use some of
the money to acquire the European truck manufacturer Scania and
buy bus and truck companies in Mexico, the U.S. and other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Norman said that though it was "painful" to make the decision
on selling Volvo Cars, it was an inevitable move to sharpen the
competitive edge of Volvo.
</P>
<P>
In October, Volvo entered into an alliance with Mitsubishi
Motors of Japan. Norman noted that the Volvo-Mitsubishi alliance
is highly complimentary because Volvo is strong in the heavy-duty
bus and truck sectors while Mitsubishi is big in the medium-sized
bus and truck sectors. The two companies combined will account for
more than 30 percent of the Asia market.
</P>
<P>
Volvo is now negotiating with China on setting up a city bus
manufacturing joint venture in Shanghai. Volvo has already set up
a luxury coach joint venture in Xi'an, in northwestern China.

<HEADLINE> China To Build More Subways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese government will
encourage big cities to build more subways to relieve traffic
congestion and air pollution caused by the increase of urban
population and vehicles, according to the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The development of subways will also boost the production of
machinery and electronic products. China has 90 km long subways in
Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, while big cities in
developed countries usually have subways 200 to 300 km long.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that high costs hold back the development of
subway systems in China. As the price of subway tickets remain low,
it will take long to get back money invested in developing and
expanding subway systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A division bench of the
Bangladeshi High Court on Thursday stayed elections to three of
the country's four city corporations for one week which were
earlier scheduled for early December this year.
</P>
<P>
The court passed the order after two hours of hearing on three
separate writ petitions filed by six ward commissioners from the
three corporations of Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi which
challenged the election schedule and gazette notification on the
delimitation of Khulna and Rajshahi.
</P>
<P>
The court also issued rules on the chief election commissioner
and five other officials, demanding explanations within two weeks
as to why the election schedule for the three corporations and
"notifications on delimitation" of Khulna and Rajshahi "shall not
be declared to have been made without any lawful authority."
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission announced on October 28 that polls to
three of the country's four city corporations would be held on
December 6.
</P>
<P>
The court order came amid growing political tension in the
country as major political parties had announced to boycott the
polls and were intensifying their anti-government campaign.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Cubs Leave for U.S. Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Two giant panda cubs from
Sichuan Province -- Jiu Jiu and Hua Hua -- have arrived here today
and are scheduled to leave tomorrow morning for Atlanta, the
United States, and spend the next 10 years there.
</P>
<P>
The United Parcel Service (UPS) will take the responsibility
for carrying the two panda cubs to the U.S. free, the first time
since 1996 that giant pandas are making the trip to the U.S.,
according to company sources.
</P>
<P>
The company has been working with panda researchers from
Chengdu, provincial capital of Sichuan and the Atlanta Zoo in the
last couple of months to finalize transportation plans.
</P>
<P>
The UPS has also financed the design and building of containers
to house the pandas during their journey in the specially equipped
Boeing 767, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
To ensure safety of the pandas, the company has also arranged
three veterinarians and fresh bamboo shoots to accompany the
pandas on their flight.
</P>
<P>
The company will also donate 620,000 U.S. dollars to the
Atlanta Zoo, where the two panda cubs will spend the planned ten
years, over the next five years for scientific research in panda
breeding.
</P>
<P>
Sending the panda cubs to the U.S. is part of an international
program aimed at protecting and studying pandas.
</P>
<P>
Born September 9, 1997, Jiu Jiu is male and has a good
disposition, while the female Hua Hua, half a month older, is more
active and aggressive. Both pandas are in excellent health.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is now facing extinction. About 1,000 giant
pandas inhabit the mountain areas of the Sichuan Basin.

<HEADLINE> China Needs More Engineers in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China needs to cultivate more
outstanding engineers and scientists for the 21st Century, said
Song Jian, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
The industrialization of the country will reach its peak in the
next century, when large groups of skilled engineers will be
needed in various industries, Song told an ongoing international
symposium on engineering education, which started in Beijing
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
China has set the goal to develop itself into a mid-level
developed country, which means that people's per-capita income
should be raised from current 780 U.S. dollars a year to 8,000 U.S.
dollars in 2050.
</P>
<P>
The investment in construction, power supply, transport,
housing, water control projects and other engineering projects
should be increased by ten times to meet the need of such rapid
development, Song said.
</P>
<P>
He said that by then, major projects will also be launched to
develop airlines, railways, expressways and other infrastructures,
while education, culture, health care are being improved.
</P>
<P>
Song reiterated that the theme of the symposium is that the
engineering education will be of great importance for the
industrialization and modernization of China in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Experts, scholars and government officials from China, France,
Germany, Japan, the United States and other countries will
exchange experience in promoting the engineering education in the
three-day symposium, which is jointly sponsored by the Chinese
Academy of Engineering and the China Engineering Education Society.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Denies Criticism of Bouteflika </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Cabinet Secretary
Tayeb Abdel Rahim has denied reports that the Central Committee of
the Palestinian Fatah Movement has issued a statement criticizing
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah Central Committee categorically denied the adoption
of such a statement and considered it as forged and fabricated,
the "Voice of Palestine" radio Thursday quoted Abdel Rahim as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Al Charq Al Awsat daily, which carried the
reports Wednesday, made "such fabrications with the aim of
deforming the Palestinian image and driving a wedge between the
Palestinian leadership and Arab brothers," said Abdel Rahim.
</P>
<P>
President Bouteflika and his "wise policies in all fields" are
highly respected and esteemed by the Palestinian leadership,
particularly with regard to Algeria's support of the just and
national rights of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah Central Committee demands that the newspaper adhere
to objectivity and accuracy in reporting Palestinian developments,
bring to account those who continue to deform its image by
fabricating news stories about what is going on in the Palestinian
arena, said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the statement has been issued by a
Damascus-based group which has split from the Fatah Movement.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Issues Arrest Warrants in Bofors Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A New Delhi city court
Thursday issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Italian
businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi after taking cognizance of the
charge sheet of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the
Bofors case.
</P>
<P>
Summons were also issued to Dubai-based former Bofors agent Win
Chadha, former Defense Secretary S. K. Bhatnagar and former Bofors
company chief Martin Ardbo.
</P>
<P>
The four have been charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating
and various other provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act
in a 640 million rupees (34.3 million U.S. dollars) payoff case in
the 14.37 billion rupees (770.1 million dollars) Howitzer gun
deal.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has alleged that Quattrocchi's A.E. Services received
7.3 million U.S. dollars while Chadha's Swenska got 27 million
dollars as kickbacks for getting the gun deal to the Swedish
company A.B. Bofors in March 1986.
</P>
<P>
However, the controversy over the inclusion of former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's name in the charge sheet continued as the
prosecution made no application for the deletion of his name.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Sonia Gandhi has repeatedly said her late
husband was innocent in the case and his name should be deleted
from the charge sheet since he could not defend himself.

<HEADLINE> Resettlement Project Makes Way for Wildlife, Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The relocation, expected to be completed in three years, is not
part of the massive Three Gorges Project, but to protect the
nature reserve, one of China's five global bio-diversity
preservation centers, located at the middle reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 5,000 farmers who lived in the nature reserve
have voluntarily moved from their homes.
</P>
<P>
Hu Hongxing, professor of ecology at Wuhan University, calls
the resettlement project an innovative act in the world's
ecological and environmental protection campaign, and says the
program will advance China's development of eco-protection zones.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve, established in 1986, covers 70,000 hectares,
and is home to 50 species of plants and 70 animals under State
protection. Sightings of albino animals and the legendary Bigfoot
have all made Shennongjia a mysterious, primitive spot.
</P>
<P>
Yinyuhe Village, situated in the center of the reserve, will be
demolished this week, and all of the 200 villagers have moved.
</P>
<P>
The government has given each resettled family a subsidy of 1,
000 yuan (about 120 U.S. dollars), an amount twice the per-capita
annual income in the area. Resettled families also benefit from a
range of preferential policies, including free allotment of arable
land for farming.
</P>
<P>
Now wild animals roam about the village, which is linked to the
outside world by just a rocky path, and their howls float up from
a quiet ravine.
</P>
<P>
"Wild animals are increasing in great numbers and are becoming
more and more bold," said Zhou Benxiu, a 43-year-old villager,
standing in the rubble of her former home. "The animals are
protected by law, so we simply move out and make way for them."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the State has spent about 200 million yuan (
about 24.18 million U.S. dollars) to build the largest forest area
along the middle reaches of the Yangtze into an important tourist
attraction, which in turn has provided jobs to many of the
relocated people.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Benxiu built her new home along the national highway near
the nature reserve, and her daughter has just been hired at a
nearby hotel. "The future will be much better than before," said
Zhou, smiling.
</P>
<P>
"More and more residents are joining the government's eco-
protection efforts," said Susan Shen, a senior ecologist with the
Global Environmental Facility attached to the World Bank, who made
a special inspection tour to Shennongjia. "The resettlement
project is a good example for the protection of nature."
</P>
<P>
According to Yan Xun, a senior official with the State Forestry
Administration, China's total area of nature reserves accounts for
more than 7.6 percent of the country's land.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to encourage and support eco-
protection programs in areas with suitable conditions.

CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Arab states generated about 13 billion U.S. dollars
from tourism revenues last year, accounting for 2 percent of the
total income of international tourism which amounted to about 455
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arab states have not gained their just share in the world
tourism sector, which is the second largest industry in the world,
the Alam Al Yom newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism experts called on Arab states to further expand their
tourism industry by forming giant marketing firms which
incorporate more than one Arab state and numerous branches in
various parts of the world. The measure will help promote tourism
in the region and compete with tourism companies which are
steadily growing in the world.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Algeria saw a foreign trade surplus of 1.01 billion
U.S. dollars during the first nine months of 1999, as compared to
a surplus of 852 million dollars during the corresponding period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's export volume stood at 7.7 billion dollars during
the period under review in 1999, down by 2.32 percent as compared
to the corresponding period of 1998, the Alam Al Yom newspaper
Thursday quoted a statistical bulletin by the Algerian National
Information and Statistics Center as saying.
</P>
<P>
The import volume hit 6.69 billion dollars, down by 4.88
percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and the United States Wednesday signed an accord
to build an environment-friendly plant for manufacturing
paints.
</P>
<P>
USAID will provide the new plant with all the equipment and it
will help market 70 percent of the final product abroad, said
Chairman of the 10th of Ramadan City Investors Association Mahmoud
Soliman who attended the signing ceremony along with State
Minister for Environment Affairs Nadia Ebeid.
</P>
<P>
It is the first project of its kind to be built in the Middle
East region with a total investment of 20 million Egyptian pounds
(5.8 million U.S. dollars), The Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The European Union (EU) will buy 250,000 tons of
Egyptian potatoes this season from ten new areas in the
governorates of el-Sharqia, Ismailia and el-Sharqia.
</P>
<P>
The EU has banned importing Egyptian potatoes for reasons that
they failed to meet EU's standards for agricultural products, The
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Thursday.

SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Hosts China moved one step
closer to their fourth straight title as they extended their magic
streak of not letting one goal in after nine games at the 7th
Asian women's softball championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Games runners-up, who had won three consecutive

SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua)-- Vice-premier Li Lanqing called
for greater efforts to open university logistic services to the
public in a bid to improve higher education.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on college logistics reform

However, university services which include essential facilities
pose a major problem in expanding university enrollments, Li said.

"Now, if we allow universities to take a more active role in
society, the government will be able to expand education rapidly
without spending too much money," the vice-premier said.

<HEADLINE> Rabin's Family Members Raise Questions About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- As Israelis are mourning the
death of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Thursday, Rabin's
family members raised a series of questions about his
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, one of the architects and a supporter of the Middle
Rast peace process, was assassinated on November 4, 1995 at Tel
Aviv by Yigal Amir, a right-wing Jewish youth who was opposed to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, daughter of the late Rabin, told the
Israel Radio Thursday that she and other members of the Rabin
family believe there are many question marks about the night
of the murder.
</P>
<P>
"Was there any mix-up inside the General Security Service (GSS)
which provided security to Rabin or was there any political
motive behind the assassination," she asked.
</P>
<P>
Dalia said she does not want to point any figures until
she has solid proof and she is not interested in getting
entangled in slander suits.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with the magazine The Women's
World, Dalia also asked so many questions surrounding what
happened immediately after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
"Why did the security men tell mother it was an exercise?
What happened to those essential instincts that every bodyguard
must have and why didn't the security men kill the murderer
immediately? " she asked.
</P>
<P>
A big rally is scheduled to be held Thursday evening in
Tel Aviv's Rabin Square to commemorate the fourth anniversary of
the assassination of Rabin, but due to security reasons, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has still not decided whether to address
the rally in public, Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly received a wide variety of death threats,
and the GSS said it will not be able to adequately protect him in
the square.

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Nepalese Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat postponed his trip to Bhutan Thursday because of poor
airport condition in Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The flight to Bhutan was canceled because the airport in Bhutan
was not ready for the landing of the plane, according to
well-informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said at the airport that he is leaving for Bhutan Friday
and will extend the invitation for an SAARC (South Asian

leader.
</P>
<P>
But according to a diplomatic source, the summit which was
scheduled for November 26-28 will be postponed.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation about the postponement of the summit
due to the military coup in Pakistan on October 11 when the
civilian government led by Nawaz Sharif was ousted by the
military.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was formed in 1985 and groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Durban next week is expected to
generate between 30 and 40 million rand (between five and 6.7
million U.S. dollars) for KwaZulu-Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
South African economic development and tourism MEC Mike
Mabuyakhulu Thursday told a media briefing in Durban that 10,000
foreign visitors, including more than 550 foreign journalists, are
expected to visit the resort city during the conference starting
from November 11.
</P>
<P>
Mabuyakhulu described the conference as the most lucrative
happening yet on African soil.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the message of the conference has not only been
beamed to the 54 Commonwealth countries , but also "reach some of
our key markets like the United Kingdom, and also get to
developing markets like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia
and India."
</P>
<P>
Financial spin-offs for small business in KwaZulu-Natal are
also likely, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he is satisfied that everything possible is being done
to ensure the safety and security of visitors during the
conference, with the deployment of about 2,300 security personnel
in and around Durban.
</P>
<P>
Experience gained in this respect during the Non-aligned
Movement summit in Durban last year indicated the city was more
than capable of ensuring the safety and security of delegates,
Mabuyakhulu said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Threatens Economies in Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic development in
the Southern African Development Community region was under
serious threat from the scourge of HIV/AIDS, South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day special conference of SADC health
ministers, Zuma said studies had shown that the killer disease
affected the people aged between 15 and 40 in society -- the most
economically active sector in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called for the increased involvement of communities in the
control of the spread of the disease, adding that this would give
the health sector an opportunity to empower them to take charge of
their own health and development.
</P>
<P>
Controversies about possible vaccines for HIV/AIDS had not
brought the regional governments closer to solutions. Drastic
changes in behavior patterns were needed, Zuma added.
</P>
<P>
The conference brought together SADC health ministers and other
health officials from organizations such as the World Health
Organization (WHO) to find ways of tackling the spiralling
HIV/AIDS pandemic in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims to help SADC governments gather
information, and to lay a basis for decision-making on
preventative measures for mother-to- child transmission of the
illness.
</P>
<P>
Topics for discussion later in the day will include a feedback
on the effects of the anti-HIV drug Nevirapine, currently on trial
in Uganda and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Privatization Program Brings Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tanzania's Minister of State in the President's Office Nassoro
Malocho was quoted as saying that the total value of the memoranda
of understanding for the parastatals privatized by September 1999
amounted to 195.5 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 244 million
U.S. dollars) while cash received during the same period totalled
103.4 billion shillings (about 129 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He told the House that the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission
(PSRC) of Tanzania has already presided over the divestiture of
263 parastatal organizations among a total of 395 entrusted to the
commission by the government.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the earnings, the minister said, the privatization
program has attracted a total investment of 335.9 billion
Tanzanian shillings (about 420 million U.S. dollars), mostly in
foreign currency, for the renovation and expansion of these
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Malocho informed the House that some 102 billion shillings
(about 128 million U.S. dollars) has been spent out of the
earnings accrued from the divestiture program and a total of 34.3
billion shillings (about 43 million U.S. dollars) was spent to pay
various debts for the concerned parastatals as well as to pay
terminal benefits for the employees whose services were halted as
a result of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Since the PSRC was established in 1993, public corporations and
 production concerns in Tanzania have been privatized to ease the
government of budget burden.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process also aims to acquire modern
technology, management skills and production enhancement.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Nigeria's Ethnic Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Seven people, including two
policemen, were killed in an ethnic conflict on Tuesday night in
Nigeria's Lagos State.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place in a town called Festac, where pitted
youths suspected to be Ijaws went into clash with Oodua People's
Congress (OPC) activists, reported the Guardian, a major Nigerian
newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Five bodies were visible in the swamps of the "no-man's-land",
the report said, adding that two police inspectors were also
hacked to death by the militants.
</P>
<P>
One of the dead policemen was identified as head of a Rapid
Response Squad (RRS) who arrived first on the scene, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The RRS was established several months ago to combat the
surging violence in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Eye-witnesses said the clash was triggered when some youths
were suspected to be heading to torch the magnificent Century
Hotel on Ago Palace road, Lagos, owned by Frederick Fasehun,
leader of OPC. The conflict prompted the intervention of the RRS,
who arrived in several patrol vans.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing fracas, five youths and two police officers were
 felled while a reinforcement of anti-riot policemen was called in
to save the situation.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited an eyewitness as saying that the youths
attacked a police patrol team, killing an inspector and setting
the police pick-up van ablaze.
</P>
<P>
More dead bodies might be found in a bush area near the battle
zone, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. (1900 to 0500 GMT)
curfew was announced in Ajegunle, another area in Lagos, after a
two-day ethnic strife claiming at least 15 people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was between local Yorubas, an ethnic group to
which Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo belongs, and Ijaw
immigrants from the country's oil-producing Niger Delta.

intention to "liberate not only Grozny, but all Chechnya." Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that the Russian army has been
ordered to put an end to the independence of the republic, not by

items in leading French newspapers on Thursday.

<P>
-- The Russian authorities announced on Wednesday their
intention to "liberate not only Grozny, but all Chechnya." Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that the Russian army has been
ordered to put an end to the independence of the republic, not by
making an assault on the capital Grozny, but by forcing the
Chechens to capitulate with intensive bombings.
</P>
<P>
-- Some 600 experts and leaders of aeronautics industry from 53
countries have been meeting since Sunday in Washington to study
the cause for the crash of EgyptAir Boeing 767 last week in the

suspected to be the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was harmed by the recent scandal over
the student's health association MNEF which led to the resignation
of Minister of Economy and Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn on
Tuesday. In an angry answer to a question by a parliament deputy
of the Gaullist RPR on Wednesday, Jospin implicitly accused Chirac
's party of being involved in illegal financial affairs and in the
scandal of the City Hall of Paris on fictitious jobs.
</P>
<P>
-- On the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall,
Vernon Walters, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, told Le Figaro
that when German Chancellor Helmut Kohl opened the Berlin Wall in

<HEADLINE> Inflation Slows Down Lao Development: Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Lao Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobouphanh said that inflation was one of the factors that are
slowing down the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath Keobouphanh was talking at the Prime Minister's Office
on Tuesday about the implementation of the 1998-1999
socio-economic plan, the Lao official news agency KPL reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Because of inflation, the prime minister said, progress made in
many projects has been below target or delayed because of the fall
in the value of the Lao currency kip.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath pointed out that for the current fiscal year, even
though revenue is 46 billion kip (about 5.75 million U.S. dollars)
higher than anticipated, the lower value of the kip has increased
commodity prices, which in turn has made life more difficult for
the general public.
</P>
<P>
The Lao Prime Minister forecast that Laos would still face
difficulties in the next fiscal year due to the inflation problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lao National Assembly has adopted a socio-economic
development plan anticipating a 5 percent increase in the
development rate and a revenue of 1,680 billion kip (210 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that expected expenditure would be
around 2,700 billion kip (335.5 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
To convince his followers of his supremacy, "Li has also
concocted a survey report of 10,000 practitioners and fabricated
cases of illnesses cured by practising Falun Gong," the official
revealed.
</P>
<P>
After China publicized the truth that the practice of Falun
Gong had led to more than 1,400 deaths, Li, who now lives overseas,
repeatedly denied that he has instructed his followers not to take
any medication.
</P>
<P>
"Truth is undeniable. Numerous facts have shown that many
practitioners have lost their lives only because they believed in
Li's fallacies," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong
organization have been involved in countless illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Should anyone overtly criticize or even make negative remarks
about Falun Gong, Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong organization would,
under the pretext of "seeking a clarification" or "safeguarding
Falun Dafa," mastermind large-scale illegal gatherings to besiege
and harass government institutions, media and schools, for the
sole purpose of taking revenge against society.
</P>
<P>
"These activities have seriously disrupted the public order,
disturbed the normal life of the people and infringed upon their
freedom of speech and personal safety," Ye stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "Li Hongzhi has made a fortune out of Falun Gong
illegal activities. And he has evaded taxes for most of his ill-
gotten wealth," Ye noted.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference, Ye also showed some video clips of
Li Hongzhi preaching his fallacies on various occasions.
</P>
<P>
The conference was chaired by Li Bing, deputy director of the
Information Office of the State Council.

analysts said.
</P>
<P>
John Stafford, American Home's chairman, will become chairman
of the combined firm, while Warner-Lambert's chairman, Lodewijk J.
R. de Vink, will be its chief executive, eventually taking over

Analysts said the market value of Warner-Lambert Co. would be
about 71.80 billion dollars, while American Home Products Corp.
had a market value of about 72.93 billion dollars. The combined
company will have an estimated market capitalization of about 145
billion dollars, based on Wednesday's closing prices.

<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua)-- In line with its anti-terrorism
policy, China recently voted in favor of a UN resolution imposing
sanctions on Afghanistan's Taliban, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"Long-lasting warfare and social instability have landed
Afghanistan and its people into a pit of misery, a situation for
which China has deep concern and compassion," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China is in principle against the frequent use of sanctions,
which would only worsen the misery of the Afghanistan people,
according to the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions should only be employed as a last resort, and
carried out with clear distinction," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government consistently opposes all forms of
terrorism, she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Based on this principle, China took an active role in the
discussion of the resolution concerning the Afghanistan issue by
the UN Security Council, and voted in favor of the resolution,
according to Zhang.

SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder this morning laid a foundation stone in the
Pudong New Area for the Shanghai New International Expo Center,
which is jointly financed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
Co-funded by Shanghai Pudong Land Development Corp. and three
major Germany-based exhibition companies headed by the world-
renowned Hannover, the center will cover 170,000 square meters in
its first-phase construction, using a total investment of 99
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the center, designed by U.S. architects, will
eventually reach an impressive 250,000 square meters, expanding
the current exhibition area by nearly three times.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's current exhibition space, totaling 90,000 square
meters, can barely meet the demand of over a hundred exhibitions
held in the city annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Germany said that the new expo center marks the
first joint investment of all three major German exhibition
companies in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Friendship Envoys Leave for Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Two giant panda cubs, Jiu Jiu
and Hua Hua, left here today for a ten-year stay at the Atlanta
Zoo in the United States as part of an international research
program.
</P>
<P>
"We guarantee excellent living conditions for the two
friendship envoys from China," said Dr. Rita, deputy head of the
Atlantic Zoo, who expressed hope for closer relations between the
people of the two nations in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic zoo has spent several million dollars on a
luxurious habitat for the cubs, including three indoor apartments,
two outdoor air-conditioned playgrounds, and plenty of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Two-year-old Jiu Jiu and his wife Hua Hua, six months older,
were both born in the breeding center for pandas in Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province in southwest China, known as the home
of pandas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Coca-Cola Co., Chinese and American scientists are
working together to develop an international breeding program to
protect the endangered pandas, and the visit of the two cubs, part
of the program, is aimed to provide research opportunities for
American zoologists.
</P>
<P>
The cubs left Chengdu's Shuangliu International Airport before
noon today and are scheduled to arrive in Atlanta, in the state of
Georgia, tomorrow. They will be met by former U.S. president Jimmy
Carter and his wife, some government officials and celebrities of
all circles.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 pandas in the world now, most of them
living in the mountains of the Sichuan Basin. The number of
artificially-bred pandas is 120, with only five in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Vow to Continue Anti-U.S. Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of students
from Iranian universities and schools on Thursday morning staged a
massive rally in front of the former U.S. embassy in Tehran,
vowing to continue their campaign against the U.S. arrogance.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Wednesday's strong-worded speech of the supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the demonstrators burned a dozen of
U.S. flags, images of "Uncle Sam" as well as Israeli flags at the
rally to mark the 20th anniversary of the takeover of the
U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian students.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei on Wednesday ruled out the possibility for a
resumption of ties between Iran and the U.S., and termed the
campaign against the U.S. arrogance as "an innate part of the
Islamic revolution."
</P>
<P>
During the demonstrations, the former Commander of the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezai, blasted the
U.S. for interfering in Iran's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It was the U.S. that initiated the confrontation (between
Iran and the U.S.) by masterminding a coup to overthrow the
Iranian government of Prime Minister Mohammad Masadeq in 1954,"
said Rezai, Secretary of the powerful State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
Before and after the 1979 Islamic revolution, the U.S. has
never stopped plots against Iran, he said, even today the
U.S. intend to impose western style democracy and freedom on
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent call by some U.S. officials for
dialog with Iran, Rezai said the U.S. call is aimed at forcing
Iran to make a compromise with Israel, drop missile programs and
put an end to its support for Palestinian and Lebanese resistance
movement.
</P>
<P>
Last month several senior U.S. officials called for
"unconditional dialog" between Iran and the U.S. in order to set a
road map for the normalization of bilateral relations. The two
countries severed their diplomatic ties in 1980 following the
occupation of the U.S. embassy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firm Tries New Practice in Public Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Konka Group Co., Ltd., one of
China's largest color TV producers, has succeeded in offering 80
million new A shares in an innovative way that is nearest to the
international practice but never been tried here before.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous non-initial public offerings, in which new
shares were allocated among prior shareholders at a price usually
40-50 percent lower than the market value, Konka's former
shareholders did not participate in the allocation, but could bid
on the stock exchange like ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
A second difference relates to pricing. Instead of the usual
fixed price, the price of Konka's new shares is negotiated between
the underwriter and institutional investors, based on the current
market value of the Konka A share listed on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange and at a discount of no more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of the these new stocks is offered to general
investors on the stock exchange. Based on the bidding, the
underwriter decides on the shares for institutional and general
investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the underwriter, China International Capital
Corporation, the price of the new offer was finally fixed at 15.50
yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
Total bids by investors exceeded 16 billion yuan, while valid
bids at prices equal to or higher than 15.50 yuan totaled 370
million shares.
</P>
<P>
According to bidding by institutional and ordinary investors,
it was decided that 60 million would be sold to ordinary investors,
with the rest going to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Konka raised more than 1.2 billion yuan from the issue, as it
had planned.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts here said Konka's success marks a major
step by China in regulating its securities market in accordance
with international standards and would help achieve a better
balance between the interests of issuers and investors.
</P>
<P>
Sources say Konka's success may lead to a new government policy
on non-initial public offers.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Hands Over Famous Rivonia Trial Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG November 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Former
president Nelson Mandela on Thursday donated the records of the
1963 Rivonia trial, which committed him and seven others to a life
in prison, to Ben Ngubane, Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
The records will be handed over to the national archives in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
They will be registered with the archives committee which logs
all documents of significance to history and government or is
relevant to the working processes of government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his offices in Houghton, Johannesburg, Mandela said
the records, consisting of about 40 bound documents were of
significance to South Africa and belonged in archives.
</P>
<P>
When the documents were opened to the public in 1994 some were
missing but Ngubane said Mandela had been instrumental in securing
the missing documents.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was arrested after his return from London in August
1962 and tried and sentenced to five years for incitement and
illegally leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
While serving his sentence, the underground headquarters of the
African National Congress at Liliesleaf farm, Rivonia, was raided
and several top leaders were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The Rivonia trial started in October 1963 and Mandela was
brought from jail to join the other accused being tried under the
General Law Amendment Act and the Suppression of Communism Act for
sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government by revolution.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's statement from the dock received world-wide
attention.
</P>
<P>
After an eleven-month trial, on June 12 1964, Mandela and seven
others, including Govan Mbeki and Walter Sisulu, were sentenced to
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Among the guests at the handover of the documents were national
 archivist Marie Olivier and Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture,
Brigitte Mabandla, and Arts and Culture director general Robert
Adam.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Urged to Stop Interfering in China's Internal Affairs ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China strongly opposes a
resolution passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S.
Senate condemning China's crackdown on the Falun Gong cult,
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said at a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the resolution, which demands that China immediately
cease persecuting religious institutions, wantonly reproaches the
Chinese government's lawful handling of the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is by no means a religious institution but a
heretical cult which poses a threat to Chinese society and people,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's ban of the Falun Gong cult according
to law has saved a large number of victims brainwashed by the cult,
safeguarded the human rights and freedom of the Chinese people,
and maintained the rule of law, she added.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Corp. Likely to Face Court Receivership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government may
have to place Daewoo Corp., the flagship of the debt-ridden Daewoo
Group, under court receivership if South Korean domestic creditors
fail to win approval from foreign creditors on the debt workout
program.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Financial Supervisory Committee said Thursday
the assets of 12 major Daewoo companies under debt workout totaled
61 trillion won (some 51 billion U.S. dollars) in the latest audit,
31 trillion less than the reported ones by Daewoo ledgers. Their
debts were found to hit 87 trillion won.
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to draw approval from creditors at home
and abroad on workout plans due to the larger-than-expected losses
and risks," said the committee after an economic policy council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee said South Korean domestic banks will discuss
with foreign creditors to finalize workout plans which is likely
to be accepted by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The debts of Daewoo Corp. exceeded its assets by 14.5 trillion
won and debt-to-equity swaps of 18.7 trillion won were required.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean watchdog said it disclosed assets and debts in
overseas operations which were left out in the company's ledgers.
</P>
<P>
Foreign creditors are demanding the right to veto the debt
workout plan on Daewoo Corp. and Daewoo Motor.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, which occurred in late 1997 due to
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions, has
plagued South Korea, the 11th largest industrialized nation in the
world, and it also exposed Daewoo's high indebtedness, negative
cash flow and low profitability that hid under its rapid expansion.

JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Parliament's
Finance Portfolio Committee (PFPC) Wednesday approved a
much-needed 107 million rand cash injection for the Legal Aid
Board (LAB), the Citizen newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to newly-appointed LAB Chairman Justice Mahomed
Navsa, the board has its debts accumulated to 428 million rand and
needs 107 million rand in order to function and meet its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Although a marked improvement has been made in the processing
of claims since he took control of the board, there is still a
huge backlog, Navsa added.
</P>
<P>
Rates paid to lawyers for appearances in the High Court have
been reduced to 750 rand a day, which is significantly lower than
the previous figure of up to 3,000 rand a day.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision is still to be endorsed by the National
Assembly, Navsa said.

Regardless of these facts, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the

<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature,
the National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee,
will take on the job of supervising the conduct of the country's 1.
5 million policemen, a senior legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Since the cleaning up of the police forces is a great concern
of the public and a long-term task, the legislature will for a
long period of time list it as key part of legislative supervision
over government and judicial work," said Cao Zhi, vice-chairman of
the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Cao made the remarks at the conclusion of a two-day meeting to
review China's top cop Jia Chunwang's report on police conduct,
issued by the NPC sub-committee Internal and Judicial Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee, or executive body, of the NPC will also
study the matter at its upcoming legislative session, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese legislature has increased its efforts in checking
the work of the government and judiciary in the past few years,
and particular progress has been made during the period with
courts and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Now it's the police's turn following a series of high-exposure

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit Thursday left here for a three-day official visit to
Russia in a bid to strengthen bilateral political and economic
ties.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are expected
to sign an anti-terrorism agreement between Turkey and Russia
during Ecevit's stay in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that Turkish citizens of Chechen origin
from the northern Caucasus are demanding that Ecevit raise the
issue of the conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit told the parliament on Wednesday that his government
considers the Chechnya issue as a "domestic matter" of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, it is both sad and worrisome to see that civilians are
being harmed by the military operations taking place in the
region. We are sad because of humanitarian concerns and worried
because of the possibility that a great wave of migration could
result," said Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Turks of Caucasian origin in major cities around Turkey have
been staging protests against the Russian military operations in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a big natural gas deal will be a key point of
energy debate during Ecevit's talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said here on Wednesday that the Blue Stream project is
on Turkey's agenda together with the trans-Caspian natural gas
deal.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-kilometer-long Blue Stream pipeline project to pump
up to 16 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Turkey via a
pipeline running under the Black Sea is opposed by the Central
Asian states as well as Washington, which supports an east-west
energy corridor.

<P>
The NPC will continue its supervisory duties of examining
government and judiciary reports, launching law-enforcement
inspection tours, and organizing people's deputies to assess
government and judicial work, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
He asked police departments to focus more on shaking up staff
at the grassroots level, since they account for more than 80
percent of all the policemen in the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the situations of unfair and illegal law enforcement,
abuse of power, and rudeness to the people are mostly perpetrated
by police and staff in grassroots police stations," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
This sort of wrongdoing occurs because of the failure to
observe existing laws, regulations and charters on police work,
and leaders of the police departments must be more conscientious
in this respect, Cao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He requested that detailed rules on the recruitment, training,
assessment, promotion, and dismissal of policemen be formulated so
as to upgrade the general moral and professional level of China's
police.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, members of the NPC Internal and Judicial
Committee also pointed out that lack of funds and poor equipment
for police in some areas are dangerously affecting the normal
operations of police departments.
</P>
<P>
"If this problem remains unattended for too long, the social
stability and the regime would be in jeopardy," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Before today's meeting, members of the subcommittee had
conducted extensive investigations across the country on police
work.

<HEADLINE> HK Among First Places to Adopt New IP standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is one of the first
places in the world to incorporate in its copyright law the new
standards set out in the 1996 World Intellectual Property
Organization Treaties on Copyright and Performance and Phonograms
Rights, Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak Hay
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1999 International Symposium on Intellectual
Property (IP) and Information Technology (IT), Chau said that it
is clearly in the Special Administrative Region's (SAR) interest
to ensure that Hong Kong's intellectual property protection regime
is able to keep pace with technological developments.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government had recently introduced legislative
amendments to classify certain copyright piracy and trade mark
counterfeiting offenses as organized and serious crimes, according
to Chau.
</P>
<P>
"This will provide our Customs officers with additional
investigative and enforcement powers to tackle these offenses," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the challenges presented by the knowledge economy at the
turn of the century, Chau said that a conducive environment for
high value-added economic activities would be essential for Hong
Kong to become a center of innovation and technology in the region.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the SAR government is putting in place the
necessary infrastructure and support facilities, including the
establishment of a 5 billion HK dollars (641 million U.S. dollars)
Innovation and Technology Fund to finance projects that contribute
to the upgrading of innovation and technology of the territory's
industries, and it is also planning for the establishment of a mid-
stream research institute.

<HEADLINE> Leopard Rescued in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A female leopard recently
rescued from a cliff where she had been stuck in a trap for days
is receiving treatment at an animal hospital in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The leopard, whose right front paw was infected, was given
blood transfusions at the medical facility in the Zhengzhou Zoo.
</P>
<P>
A villager gathering wood discovered the cat near the National
Mihou Nature Reserve at Mount Taihang.
</P>
<P>
The four-year-old leopard, who weighs about 30 to 40 kilograms,
was believed to have wandered into a trap set by local people, and
had been there for at least four days. She was yowling in pain
when the villager found her.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers climbed to the cliff dozens of meters above the ground
and shot a dart of anesthetic into her before she was released and
placed in a cage.
</P>
<P>
The leopard is the only mammal under top state protection in
Henan. Only about 100 of the cats now live in the province.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are investigating the case.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Explosion Near MKO Camps in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and
dozens of others injured in a big explosion which occurred
Tuesday evening near camps of the Mojahideen Khalq Organization
(MKO), a major Iranian military opposition group in Iraq, an
Iraqi official spokesman announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The explosion led to the martyrdom of one Iraqi and the
injuries of 24 others from the Iraqi armed forces, and the
martyrdom of six Mojahideen members and the injuries of 54
others," the spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "a foreign state" carried out the
terroristic act without mentioning it by name. MKO earlier
claimed that Iran had fired a missile into its base near
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iran in the past launched several missile attacks against
camps of MKO, the Iranian military opposition group which was
outlawed by Iranian authorities in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are behind such act are determined to continue
the policy of aggression and harming Iraq under various pretexts
and will bear alone the consequences resulting from that," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It added that Iraq condemns this aggression and preserves
its right to reply in proper time against this act which
constitutes aggravated escalation of the situation and threat to
stability and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon the international community to
condemn such "flagrant acts."

<HEADLINE> Official: Falun Gong Cult Endangers Society (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The banned cult organization
Falun Gong poses a grave threat to society, and the Chinese
government can't just sit back and do nothing, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ye Xiaowen, director of the State Administration of Religious
Affairs, briefed the press on the cult at a press conference held
by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"Like every other cult in the world, the cult of Falun Gong
poses a great danger to society," the official said, noting that
its founder, Li Hongzhi, has spread heretical ideas just as other
cult leaders have done.
</P>
<P>
"Li has hoodwinked Falun Gong practitioners into believing that
he has many versions of being to protect them and he has installed
a wheel of law in the belly of his followers in an attempt to
control their mind," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The cult leader has devised many absurd fabrications that go
against science and civilized society, claiming that scientific
reasoning and common sense are foolish, and that his Falun Dafa
alone offers the right law and super science.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong cult practitioners would acquire supernatural
abilities as long as they persevered in practising Falun Dafa, the
cult leader has said.
</P>
<P>
Li has ordered that Falun Gong practitioners not to take
medicine, and he preaches that the power achieved by practising
Falun Gong cult can automatically kill disease and break away with
the karmic chain -- the cosmic principle that acts from previous
lives are rewarded or punished in this life.
</P>
<P>
Medicine would blocks karma, Li has said, making it impossible
to cleanse the body and rid oneself of diseases. If one gets over
this, he will become a superman, according to the cult leader. (

items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Mere days before the final-status negotiating teams are
slated to begin work, questions are already arising as to who
exactly will be doing the real negotiations.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that associates of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak are already carrying out back-channel talks
with senior Palestinians, including Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat. Barak's office has not denied these
reports.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In a diplomatic blow to Syria, a senior U.S. State
Department official denied Wednesday that Israel and Syria had
agreements on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights
in the peace talks which halted in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The official was responding to remarks made by Syrian
Information Minister Mohammad Salman that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright did not object to the Syrian understanding
that Israel had committed to a full withdrawal in exchange for
peace in previous talks.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- In his interview with Ma'ariv, the first with the media,
Gaza contractor Kamal Hamed accused Israel of using him to
eliminate Yehye Ayash, a Palestinian bombing mastermind who had
been responsible for a series of suicide bombings in Israel, but
now wanting to throw him out in the street.
</P>
<P>
Hamed, who gave Ayash a booby-trapped cellular phone that led
to his death in early 1996, and his family members were ordered to
be evacuated from their apartment inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Wednesday set a deadline
for evacuation of four small outposts in the West Bank, telling
the security cabinet that if this is not done voluntarily by the
settlers themselves by the weekend, he will order the army to do
it by force.
</P>
<P>
The four sites are among the 12 outposts Barak ordered to be
evacuated 10 days ago as part of a compromise with the settlers.

transformed securities investment funds the go-ahead to issue new
shares to increase their capital, marking a milestone in the
government's efforts to regulate the old funds.
</P>
<P>
All investment funds existing before the promulgation of a
regulation on securities investment funds in November 1997 are
known in China as "old funds."
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, many investment funds were emerged overseas
only for investing in China. Encouraged by this trend, some local
governments in China began to the set up their own investment
funds.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, China's first investment fund, the Zhuxin Fund, was
started in Zhuhai, a southern China coastal city neighboring Macao.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1994, more than 70 such funds were approved by local
governments and branches of the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
These old funds have many inherent drawbacks in internal
management, risk control and information disclosure, mainly
because no laws over them existed then.
</P>
<P>
For example, the nature of some of the old funds was not
clearly defined in their constitutions, and some closed-end funds
did not have a life span.
</P>
<P>
For some funds, the sponsor, custodian and manager were one and
the same, while many funds did not set limits on fields of
investment.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these drawbacks, the old funds were often too
small in the size of capital and not economically viable, and did
not serve to stabilize the market as the government had expected.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the central bank realized the problem and ordered
improvements in the issue of new funds. A year later, the approval
of new funds was stopped.

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's population is
estimated at 22.5 million, according to the latest mid-term
projection by the Ministry of Population and Environment.
</P>
<P>
The projection put Nepal's present population growth at 2.37
percent, suggesting that there has been no improvement in
population growth rate as compared to the previous years.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the ministry shows that if the present
growth rate and fertility rate (4.35) continue unabated, the
country's population is likely to reach 32.2 million by the year
2016 and 62 million by 2050.
</P>
<P>
Illiteracy, superstition, gender discrimination, lack of women
empowerment, poverty and influx of immigrants are the factors
contributing to population increase in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Makes Efforts to Improve Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has decided to
offer more efficient and convenient services to foreign investors
in a bid to improve its investment environment, a senior foreign
trade official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
D. Jargalsaikhan, head of Mongolia's investment and foreign
trade bureau, said more than 40 million U.S. dollars were invested
in the country in the first 10 months this year, bringing the
total foreign capital to 260 million dollars since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 foreign enterprises have been set up in
Mongolia, most of them engaged in commercial services, mining,
animal products processing, building material industry and garment
industry.
</P>
<P>
China leads in the investor countries with the setting up of
340 businesses, accounting for 40 percent of Mongolia's total
foreign capital. It is followed by Russia, Japan, the United
States and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The official said heavy bureaucratic practices, casual
interpretation of law by government officials, scanty information
and improper charges have hindered the inflow of foreign capital.
The Great Hural (parliament) is planning to amend the country's
foreign investment law.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Regulate Old Investment Funds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the State Council regulations on securities investment
funds in place in 1997, China began to experiment with regularized
securities investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the authorities have approved about 20 securities
investment funds and nine professional fund management companies.
Fifteen of the funds have been listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the new funds in the last two years has
proved satisfactory to both investors and the regulator in
earnings, internal management, risk control, information
disclosure and stabilizing the market as rational investors.
</P>
<P>
These conditions led to the transformation of the old funds
into regularized securities investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The first step taken is to convert real estate and other assets
of poor liquidity from the old funds into cash, stock and other
assets of good liquidity, as securities investment funds could
only invest in stocks, treasury and other bonds.
</P>
<P>
The funds are then transferred to professional fund management
companies approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission
and put under the control of commercial banks approved by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Like all the new funds, the transformed old funds are unit-
trust and closed-end.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the transformation of the old funds would help
regulate the capital market and prevent financial risks. It would
also produce a stronger group of securities investment funds that
would promote the sustainable and healthy development of the
securities market.

NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Scottish police believe there
could be a Cyprus link to the bombing of an PanAm flight 103 over
Lockerbie in southern Scotland in December 1988, in which 270
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
A team of Scottish officers arrived on the island on Saturday
to probe the activities of a Libyan businessman as part of
inquiries into the Lockerbie disaster, the Cyprus Mail newspaper
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Scots, who are being helped by Cyprus police, are trying to
uncover the relationship the unnamed man had with the two Libyans
who are held responsible for blowing the plane and due to stand
trial in Holland next year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police have already secured a court injunction lifting
secrecy laws on a bank account the Libyan businessman had at a
branch of a foreign bank in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The man is no longer on the island and authorities could not
immediately say what sort of business he was involved in.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that he used various names while he was in
Cyprus," a security source stated.
</P>
<P>
Police are also hoping to get records of telephone calls the
Libyan made when he visited Cyprus "years ago", the source said.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the two Lybians named Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and
Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima is due to start next February in Holland.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The High Court in
Malaysia's northern state of Kedah Thursday sentenced to death a
businesswoman from the Republic of Benin in Africa for trafficking
heroin two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Justice Allaudin Mohamed Sheriff passed the sentence after
ruling that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable
doubt, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
Helen Ayoromi, 30, was found guilty of trafficking in the drug
of 1,713.9 grams at the Bukit Kayu Hitam customs and immigration
checkpoint near the Malaysia-Thailand border on May 7, 1997 and
was charged under section 39B (1) (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act
1952 which carries the mandatory death sentence upon conviction.
</P>

Ayoromi was charged with committing the offense with Greene
Richard Charles of Cape Town, South Africa, who died after
suffering breathing difficulties at the Alor Setar Prison in the
state on March 13 last year before the trial began.

WARSAW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The value of the zloty fell
Wednesday to a record low against the dollar in 28 months.
</P>
<P>
It dropped by 1.4 percent in value Wednesday to 4.3 to the
dollar compared with Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the zloty stood at 3.5 to the dollar. But it
dropped to 4 to one dollar in September.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Poland's inflation this year will hit 9
percent, one percentage point higher than the planned 8 percent,
due to the severe economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government said that the country's deficit this
year is expected to account for 7 percent of its gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Leszek Balcerowicz, vice prime minister and also finance
minister, said he would not rule out the possibility of his
resignation. If this happens, economic sources said, the economic
situation will become worse and fluctuation of the zloty will not

<P>
NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has decided to call back
its suspended ambassador to Egypt Charalanbos Kapsos for reasons
of national interest, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said on Wednesday that
Kapsos would continue to be under suspension, but would be brought
back to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kapsos' presence in Cairo, where he is acting as if he was
still the ambassador, discredits Cyprus' standing in Egypt,"
Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' cabinet Wednesday decided to appoint Dimitris
Droussiotis, an adviser at the Cyprus Embassy in Cairo, as the new
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The case against Kapsos was not closed and investigations are
underway, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Foreign Ministry ordered an inquiry into the
activities of Kapsos in August on allegations that he had smuggled
large amount of wine into Egypt by declaring the container as
inexpensive personal staff, thus escaping the 300 percent import
duty levied by Egyptian customs.
</P>
<P>
Kapsos have also been accused of organizing a "Cyprus night"
at his residence, charging 60 dollars from each of Cairo
dignitaries who attended the event.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Escapes After Killing 2 in Seattle Shipyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Police with armored
vehicles, dogs and a helicopter are combing a residential area
near downtown Seattle in search of a man who shot and killed two
men and wounded two others at the Northlake Shipyard, according to
reports reaching here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that he has left this immediate area, so
we make the assumption that he is still afoot or... holed up
somewhere in this area," Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper said.
</P>
<P>
Stamper also warned homeowners to be careful returning from
work because the suspect could still be in the area.
</P>
<P>
Stamper said the police will maintain a very comprehensive
coverage of the entire area through the night."
</P>
<P>
The gunman in camouflage clothing and sunglasses calmly walked
and shot four employees at the shipyard earlier Wednesday, then
escaped on foot, according to a 19-year-old man who survived with
a gunshot wound in his arm.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the latest in a wave of shootings at offices and
schools across the United States, coming just a day after seven
people were shot to death at a Xerox Inc. warehouse in Honolulu,
allegedly by a disgruntled worker.
</P>
<P>
The motives of both attacks are unknown.
</P>
<P>
Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, deploring "another senseless act of
violence," said the city of 540,000 was safer than most but that "
we've got too many guns out there."
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who offered federal help to the
officials trying to solve both of the latest shootings, said that
the country has been plagued for too long with gun violence.

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides Loan for Cambodia's Road Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has provided a 68-million-U.S.-dollar soft loan to Cambodia
for road upgrading and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was held Thursday at the Council of
Ministers with the attendance of Cambodian Finance Minister Keat
Chhon and Vice President of the ADB Myoung-Ho Shin.
</P>
<P>
The targeted project is a large one to rehabilitate and improve
about 577 kilometers of three national roads, Road No 5, Road No 6
and Road No 7.
</P>
<P>
More than two million people in some of the poorest provinces
of Cambodia will get direct benefit from this project which will
also contribute to poverty alleviation in the country as a whole
and help promote more balanced regional development.
The ADB loan will finance over 77 percent of the cost, which is
estimated at 88.1 million U.S. dollars, and the balance will be
met by the OPEC Fund Loan of six million U.S. dollars and
Australian Government's grant of about one million U.S. dollars.
The Royal Government of Cambodia on its part will contribute about
13 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan, which will be from the bank's Asian Development Fund,
is repayable over 32 years, including an eight-year grace period.
The interest charge will be one percent per annum during the grace
period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The project implementation is expected to start by next year
and to be completed by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Most of Cambodia's infrastructure deteriorated during the 30
years of war and only a third of its 7,700 kilometers of primary
roads are passable all year round.

LUSAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is to release

</P>
<P>
The Post, a Zambian newspaper, Thursday quoted U.N. observer

<HEADLINE> China's Building Materials Industry Reports Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's building materials
industry, a losing proposition in 1997 and 1998, reported profits
of 380 million yuan (about 45 million U.S. dollars) in the first
three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Tan Zhongming, an official with the State
Administration for Building Materials, the industry has maintained
a steady growth since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw a loss of 2.65 billion yuan in the industry, but
this year it had earned 3.3 billion yuan by the end of September,
with profits of 380 million yuan, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with annual sales of more than five million yuan
each had a combined industrial value-added of 29.5 billion yuan
for the first nine months, up 12.8 percent over the same period
last year, Tan added.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers also reported recovering growth during the
period, with exports of 1.6 billion dollars worth of building
materials in the period, up 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises realized profits
of 149 million yuan after suffering losses for two consecutive
years, Tan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this growth to the industry's structural
readjustment and the closing of many small-capacity cement and
glass works.
</P>
<P>
Tan predicted that by the end of this year, the industry will
have a combined industrial added value of 88 billion yuan and see
profits of 700 million yuan.

TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday denied a claim by Iran's

their headquarters by a missile the day before.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said no missile had been fired from the Iranian soil to

Iran has nothing to do with the incident, which was termed by

The MKO, a major Iranian military opposition group which was

fired a missile into its base.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA reported that a source with the militant
opposition Mo'aredhin in Iraq, which is opposed to the MKO
presence in Iraq, claimed responsibility for the attack.

NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A suicide squad of militants
late Wednesday evening stormed the heavily-guarded headquarters of
the 15th Corps of Indian Army in Srinagar, summer capital of
India-controlled Kashmir, killing a major and six others.

</P>
<P>
The militants first killed a border security soldier who was
sitting in his vehicle by lobbing a handgrenade at him, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
They then stormed into the office, killing the public relations
officer of the 15th Corps and five others, the paper said, quoting
an army spokesman in the area.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, B. D. Bawa, said in a statement that another
five people were injured in the attack.

Shortly after the attack, reports reaching here said, Indian
troops surrounded the entire area and a fierce encounter went on

<P>
Indian media said that a Pakistan-backed militant outfit named
Lashkar-e-Toiba claimed responsibility for the attack.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua)-- Chinese scientists for the first
time discovered an ice field covering 400 square meters on
southwest China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in September.
</P>
<P>
Yao Tandong, deputy director of the Institute of the
Environment and Engineering in Cold and Arid Regions, said the
Purogangri ice field in the western part of the Danggula Mountains
on the plateau provides evidence for the academic debate on
whether or not an icecap existed in the area in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese scientists also found a tract of desert
and sand dunes near the ice field that they had never seen
elsewhere before.
</P>
<P>
Experts say there are different kinds of glaciers of varying
magnitudes, the largest being those found in the Antarctic and
Arctic which cover an area of millions of square meters.
</P>
<P>
Yao said that they will continue studying the ice cores they've
recovered, along with desert evolution records, to obtain a
clearer picture of the geological history of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau.

XI'AN, November 4 (Xinhua)-- An 80-km-long and 200-m-wide
shelterbelt will created along a round-the-city expressway in Xi'

to a local traffic department.
</P>
<P>
The famous tourist city of Xi'an suffers from air pollution
caused by heavy dust from the Loess Plateau to the north and
industrial wastes. As a key project this year, the greenbelt is
expected to improve the city's environment, in conjunction with
several other afforestation efforts, by absorbing some 19,000 tons
of carbon dioxide and releasing 14,000 tons of oxygen annually.
</P>
<P>
The greenbelt will have an outer main belt 170 meters wide and
an inner belt 30 meters. The project will start this winter with a
330 million yuan (about 37.5 million U.S. dollars) investment from
the Shaanxi Transport Department, officials say.

WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tony DiCicco, coach of the
United States Women's World Cup winning-team, resigned on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DiCicco said he wanted to spend more time with his family. He
will leave the team at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for my stepping down is that it's more
important for me to be a world-class husband and father than a
world-class coach," DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at the generous financial opportunities
available to me next year, I didn't see how they could possibly
enrich my life more than spending time with my wife and boys."
</P>
<P>
DiCicco began his career with the women's national team in 1990
as the goalkeepers coach, and was an assistant on the 1991 women's
World Cup championship team before taking over the head coach
position in 1995. He guided the team to finish third in the 1995
World Cup and led the squad to win the gold medal in the 1996

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Airlines to Ground Fleet on Millennium Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's national airlines,
Biman, has decided to keep its aircraft grounded for seven hours
on the eve of the new millennium despite having necessary Y2K
compliance certificates for its fleet, The Daily Star Business
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The airline would recall all its aircraft from midnight
December 31 to 7 a.m. the next day and the flights would remain
suspended during the period.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to keep flights suspended for the brief period
comes as a precautionary measure to study the immediate effect of
the Y2K bug," said Ashan Quadir, chairman of Biman Y2K Committee,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said there were also commercial reasons for the rollover
period during which the flight would be kept suspended. "We are
expecting a sharp fall in the traffic during the time and only
three of our flights would be delayed."
</P>
<P>
Biman officials said a rollover test was quite expensive
because it had a limited number of aircraft, and a single rollover
test involved a huge amount of dollars. A rollover test means
changing dates of all chips in advance and carrying out a test run
to see how they function.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the manufacturing companies of our fleet have done
successful rollover tests before certifying the plane," a high
official with Biman said.
</P>
<P>
The airline started preparing for the millennium glitch form
mid-1998 after the government formed a national committee in May
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem, also called the "Millennium Bug," has been the
cause of concern among users all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The millennium problem is caused by the common programming
practice of using the last tow digits in a date to represent a
particular year, such as 98 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the onset of the new century, the year digits will show
00, which may be interpreted by the computer as 1900, giving
erroneous results which may halt normal operations of the computer
systems.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Cracks Down on Underworld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has directed that necessary senior police officials
should be released from other duties to speedily crack down on the
underworld gangs, said the Presidential Secretariat Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This followed a series of crimes and murders recently which
have been taking place in and around Colombo where 18 crime gangs
were operating.
</P>
<P>
Gangs linked with contract killings, prostitution, extortion,
robberies, hijacking, drugs and gun-running have been causing
massive problems for law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to a secretariat's statement, the president recently
met the Inspector General of Police Lucky Kodituwakku and other
senior police officials to discuss the trend of crimes.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the outdated status of punishments and fines,
bailing procedure, the lack of proper time frames to complete
preliminary inquiries, external influences and the special
treatment given to some criminals while in prison.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the need to revise the criminal law
procedure or make new laws to deal with crimes, commending the
police officers to respect the law.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Kodituwakku as saying that there has not
been an increase in crime as such but newspapers have recently
highlighted the crimes and consequently the public have risen
their awareness and were extending their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In late October, the police conducted a massive operation to
crack down on the underworld in Colombo's Maligawatte, where at
least one to two shooting incidents took place per week recently.
</P>
<P>
During the operation over 500 suspects were rounded up and
detained, including a number of leaders of the underworld and
their "big brains".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia Missile Testing "Distressing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. State
Department official said on Wednesday that the anti-missile
missile test by Russia on Tuesday is "distressing" although the U.
S. itself is planning its own national anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
"We find it distressing that Russia is raising the specter of
an arms competition when what we're trying to do is work
cooperatively with them to focus on rogues states," the official,
refusing to be identified, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that on the one hand the Russians would be
complaining about our desire to move forward into a possible
limited deployment and yet they're testing their own ABM system,"
the U.S. official added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is pressuring Russia into modifying the Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Washington and Moscow in
1972 so that it can develop its anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes the proposal, warning that the U.S.
development of anti-missile defense system will cause serious
consequences.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Russia tested the anti-missile missile in
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The commander of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, Vladimir
Yakovlev, was quoted as saying that it could be seen in the
context of possible Russian responses if Washington breaks the ABM
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Arrest Top Mafia Forger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Italy's top Mafia forger Giorgio
Graziani was arrested for drug trafficking and forgery in the
northern Italian city of Milan on Wednesday evening after seven
years in exile.
</P>
<P>
The special anti-Mafia police DIA seized in his apartment
mobile phones, pre-paid phone cards, a document forging kit, false
papers including a Spanish journalist's card bearing his name,
several credit cards and materials for disguise including wigs,
the Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
Graziani, 55, escaped after being prosecuted in 1992 for
forgery, drug trafficking and involvement in Mafia crime. He had
since kept traveling between Italy, England and Spain, using
forged papers, which made it difficult to trace him.
</P>
<P>
The hunt was closed in on him when the Italian police
discovered he called his family in Rome from various phone boxes
in Milan.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema and the chairman of the
parliamentary anti-Mafia committee, Ottaviano Del Turco,
congratulated DIA chief General Carlo Alfiero on the success of
the operation.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Italian police on Wednesday
arrested more than 30 drug producers and dealers in Salerno and
Venice. Among them were a police officer and his wife, in whose
home the police seized more than 30,000 new-type drug tablets,
worth more than two billion liras, or 1.1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recently, new-type synthetic drug tablets have run rampant in
Italy, which has provoked widespread concern after a young man was
found dead in front of a ballroom after taking one kind of such
tablets and a young woman was forced to have a liver transplant
for only taking half a tablet.

SOFIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov said here on Wednesday that he will not discuss with U.S.
President Bill Clinton the deployment of nuclear weapons on the

President Clinton would discuss the deployment of NATO nuclear

S. nuclear weapons in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to clarify the issue, Stoyanov told reporters that
"President Clinton and I will discuss a wide range of issues,"
including Bulgaria's relations with NATO -- closer integration and
cooperation with the alliance, improvement of their inter-
operatability and the provision of infrastructure facilities for
joint military exercises.
</P>

But, he said, the deployment of nuclear weapons in Bulgaria

BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (
PLA) has developed an automatic mapping system, military sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The new computer mapping system called "Campaign Mapping
Guarantee System" is a digital information processing program

</P>
<P>
The PLA map database can zoom, display and draw diverse maps as
well as search geographic information quickly and accurately.
</P>
<P>
The mapping system was developed in three years by a research
group in the PLA Information Engineering University and will help
mapping units fulfill all-weather tasks in various types of
terrain at higher speeds, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
"It has dramatically enhanced the army's maneuver and combat
effectiveness," they stressed.
</P>
<P>
The mapping system was successfully used in the army's rescue
efforts during last summer's worst flooding along the Yangtze and
other major rivers.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Czech Republic Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic has absorbed
a total of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars of direct foreign investment
in the first nine months of this year, doubling that in the
previous corresponding period, the National Bank reported.
</P>
<P>
This ranks the country second after Poland among the Eastern
and Central European transitional economies in terms of foreign
capital attraction.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the country's worsening investment environment
has caused a decline in foreign investment attraction. Foreign
investment dropped to 1.4 billion dollars in 1996 and 1.3 billion
dollars in 1997, far less than those attracted by Hungary and
Poland during the same period.
</P>
<P>
To check this trend, the Czech government introduced a series
of preferential policies in April 1998 to lure foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that increased foreign direct investment
will help bring about an early economic recovery in the country.

<HEADLINE> US Shuts Door for Negotiations on Osama Issue: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Taliban official for foreign
affairs Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil said Wednesday that the United
States has shut the door to negotiations on the issue of alleged
terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from Kabul, the Afghan
capital, Muttawakil said at a press conference that the Taliban
were ready to negotiate, but Washington was intransigent.
</P>
<P>
The United States insisted on handing over the Saudi dissident
for trial on terrorist charges, said the Taliban
</P>
<P>
"We will never force him to leave Afghanistan, or hand him
over," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Osama bin Laden is reported to have offered to leave the
war-ravaged country. However, Muttawakil said that the United
States believed it was not good enough for the Taliban to avoid
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed a U.S. proposed resolution on
October 15, giving the Taliban one month to hand over bin Laden.
Otherwise, financial sanctions will be imposed against the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, have rejected the U.N. resolution, saying
that this unfair action was taken under the pressure of the United
States, and the sanctions will hurt only the Afghan people who
have already been plunged into plenty of problems.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the proposed sanctions are inevitable as there
are only 11 days before the deadline for handing over the Saudi
dissident.
</P>
<P>
Muttawakil said that if sanctions are imposed against the
Taliban "it is the people who will suffer."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Taliban have offered talks but the United
States is not interested."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official had earlier said that the Taliban did not
have an extradition treaty with the United States, and according
to the Afghan tradition and culture, the Taliban are not supposed
to hand over Osama, "a guest of the Afghan nation", to a third
country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have accused the United States of pressuring the
militia under the pretext of fighting against terrorism by using
the Osama issue.
</P>
<P>
Muttawakil said that the Taliban would not expel Osama from
Afghanistan unless he himself opted to leave.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeological
workers have discovered in Henan Province more than 760 tombs
believed to date back to the Qin Kingdom during the Warring States
Period (475 BC-221 BC).
</P>
<P>
The tombs were found at Hangu Pass near Lingbao City on the
Sanmenxia-Lingbao Expressway. The pass was a well known military
fortress in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou Junjie, head of the Cultural Relics Bureau of
Sanmenxia City, the tombs contain soldiers who lost their lives in
battles.
</P>
<P>
Chambers of the tombs are all square. And judging from remains,
the deceased were buried either with their faces upward or on
their side.
</P>
<P>
Items buried include breast-mirrors, bronze ware, pottery and
cooking utensils. The tombs are distributed in an orderly manner,
said Hou.
</P>
<P>
The entire tomb area covers an area of 15 sq km. The tombs
unearthed are just a small part of the tomb area.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, a well-known Chinese archaeologist, explained that
areas around the Hangu Pass were the site for many famous battles
fought during the Warring States Period. Yu believes that the
findings will be of value in unravelling transport, military
affairs and politics during this period.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian trade relations
with the United States soured again as Australian Trade Minister
Mark Vaile Thursday expressed frustration at the latest U.S.
import restrictions on sugar.
</P>
<P>
The United States has decided to reduce imports of sugar, with
Australia's allocation cut by 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The news came as Australia was arguing against U.S.
restrictions on lamb imports at the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"From time to time you get frustrated," Vaile told ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
"We are making progress, and it's better to be making
incremental progress where you keep moving forward rather than
slipping back," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. sugar growers have said they hope the new 1.501 million
tones tariff-rate quota will strengthen the domestic market by
reducing the threat of foreign subsidized sugar entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
Growers have complained of falling production prices for raw
sugar, which are at their lowest level in 14 years.

SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Audemars Piguet watches
showed up for the first time at a recent exhibition in Shanghai
attracting more than 60 watch dealers.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the tip of the iceberg", said Daniel Chan,
director of a Shanghai Exhibition Hall of World Watches.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening-up which began in 1979, private
entrepreneurs have emerged in China, Chan said, adding that "They
like to wear and collect famous watches from around the world".
The Audemars Piguet watch is well known abroad with a history of
over 100 years, but it has just begun to appear in China.
</P>
<P>
The "Royal Oak" model of Audemars Piguet displayed in Shanghai
range in price from 70,000 to 2 million yuan (about 8,464 to 120,
918 US dollars). Five dealers so far are acting as agents of these
models which expect to sell well at exhibitions to be held in
Beijing, Guangzhou, Xi'an and Harbin.
</P>
<P>
China is a large watch exporter, but they are of average
quality, said Chan. He also added that China should learn
marketing strategies from some of the top watch producers from
overseas.

<P>
JINAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- By the end of this August, some 1,
193 State-owned industrial enterprises (SOEs) in east China's
Shandong province, or 37.5 percent of its total, had established a
standardized corporate system, according to the statistics
provided by the provincial planning commission.
</P>
<P>
Operating under the new system, profits from Shandong's SOEs in
the first eight months of 1999 increased 70 percent over the same
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The corporate system underscores the importance of clearly-
defined ownership, rights and responsibilities of the company and
its employees, separation of government and enterprise functions,
and scientific management. Stockholders, enterprise directors, the
board of supervisors and managers work together to lead the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Governments and Party committees can now focus on supervising
and providing general guidance and services for SOEs, instead of
becoming directly involved in operations.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some basic reforms to improve
competitiveness are scheduled to be completed in most of Shandong'
s SOEs in the next three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Henning Schulte-Noelle,
president of Germany's Allianz Insurance Group, said recently that
the Asian market including China is very attractive to Allianz and

We pay attention to China because entering China means real
globalization for Allianz."

He was pleased to know that the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission has recently approved some new services provided by
ADLI, and said this has encouraged Allianz to further exploit
China's market.

investment space for domestic and international insurance
companies by allowing insurance capital to enter the securities
market as investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Allianz Insurance Group is the largest comprehensive
insurance group in the world, taking in 54 billion marks in
premiums during the first half of 1999, up 18.8 percent over the
same period of 1998", sources said.

ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Over use of natural resources

Their study also shows that people had to move several times

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi will finish the year
as world number one after his leading rivals were crushed or
forced out of the Paris Open tournament.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, winner at this year's French Open and U.S. Open,
dispatched Moroccan Younes El Aynaoui 6-4, 6-3 in the second round
on Wednesday but the year-end top ranking was mainly helped by the
poor showing of his leading rivals.
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras, the finalist last year here, quit the competition
for back problems following a hard-won win over Spaniard Francisco
Clavet on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His withdrawal came only hours after defending champion Greg
Rusedski was forced out of the tournament for injury. The Briton
hinted he might call an end to his season.
</P>
<P>
Besides the withdrawals, Agassi was also helped as nine of the
16 seeds given a bye to the second round have lost their matches.
</P>
<P>
12th seed Alex Corretja fell at the first hurdle with a 7-5, 6-
3 loss to Marc Rosset of Switzerland, eighth seed Richard
Krajicek lost to Mark Philippoussis, 7-5, 6-3 while 14th-seeded
Carlos Moya was thrashed 6-2, 6-1 by American Jim Courier.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Marcelo Rios also suffered a 7-5, 6-2 loss to
Michael Chang and late in the day Karol Kucera, the 16th seed, was
eliminated by Dutchman Sjeng Schalken 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Enqvist, last week's winner of the Eurocard Open, beat
fourth seed Todd Martin in a final-set tie-break, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5),
7-6(8-6).
</P>
<P>
But the top ranking became certain only after defending
champion and second seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov from Russia lost to
Australia's rising star Lleyton Hewitt 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 at the second
round on Wednesday, handing the American the first year-end No.1
ranking in his career.
</P>
<P>
Agassi lead with an unbeatable margin for Kafelnikov to make up
with just one more tournament to be played before the ATP Tour
world championship.

In other matches 13th seed Tommy Haas pounded Austria's Stefan

<HEADLINE> Intense Rains Leave 57 Dead in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Intense rains in
Colombia have left 57 people dead and 355,000 homeless over the
last few weeks, said official sources Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest downpour occurred early Wednesday morning in
Manizales, central Colombia, where a mother and child died due to
a landslide in a poor neighborhood of the city known as
Chachafruto.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers searched for further buried people, but work was
delayed due to the rain and mud which made rescue almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the transit of vehicles on 40 highways throughout
the country is very difficult, with delays of an hour daily, due
to either the heavy rains or thick mist obscuring vision.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the southern zone of Suba, in Santafe de Bogota,
have requested help from the government of Andres Pastrana, due to
the Juan Amarillo river breaking its banks and destroying
everything in its path and leaving thousands of homes flooded.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities confirmed that they would continue to
supply help to the people who have lost their homes or who cannot
make contact with other family members in hostels which have been
provided as temporary shelter until the climactic phenomenon
passes.
</P>
<P>
However, climactic specialists believe the rains may continue
until mid-December and are advising people who live near rivers to
be aware of the chances of flooding.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Internet Economy Expected to Exceed 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide Internet
economy, by the measurement of an American market research firm,
will surpass the mark of 1 trillion U.S. dollars in 2001.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, it will be well on its way to 3 trillion dollars,
according to a report released Wednesday by International Data
Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The report breaks the Internet economy into three key elements
-- Internet commerce, Internet information technology
infrastructure and Internet business infrastructure -- and found
that the three are shifting in importance in terms of
contributions to the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
In the early Internet economy years, IDC said, investments
focused around technology products and services to strengthen the
infrastructure, achieve critical mass and introduce online users
to commerce. Now, however, non-technology spending is slowly
catching on. The marketing and sales functions, along with content
creation, will take a lead role in enhancing the Internet
experience and stimulating Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
IDC's report found that for every dollar of e-commerce revenue
generated in 1998, 93 cents were directly invested in the Internet
commerce infrastructure. The research firm expects corporations to
increase their investments significantly to improve this ratio by
2003.
</P>
<P>
Technology investments accounted for 52 percent of worldwide
Internet spending last year. But in 1999, for the first time, IDC
expects non-technology investments to surpass technology
investments. By 2003, technology investments' share will have
decreased to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Building the infrastructure to support Internet commerce is
not cheap," said the report. "Everyone praises the benefits of
Internet commerce, but few understand the size of the investment
required, and fewer still understand that technology
infrastructure is just a part of that investment."
</P>
<P>
IDC has been revising its predictions on the worldwide Internet
economy. In September last year, the firm predicted that the
Internet economy, totaling 200 billion U.S. dollars then, would
approach 1 trillion dollars by 2002. IDC also predicted last year
that worldwide Internet commerce would top 1 trillion dollars by
2003.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study by the University of Texas, the
Internet economy in the United States has pumped an estimated 507
billion dollars into the U.S. economy over the past year. The
study divides the Internet economy into four layers: companies
that provide networked applications, businesses that build
hardware for the basic Internet infrastructure, companies that act
as so-called intermediaries over the Net as Web gateways or online
travel agents, and Internet commerce businesses that sell directly
over the Net.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Expresses Shock Over Recent Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday he feels "shock and profound sorrow" over deadly
workplace shootings in Honolulu and Seattle, and pressed Congress
to stay in town to pass tighter gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
"Our nation continues on this day to be reminded of the horrors
of gun violence. We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands
of criminals and children," Clinton told reporters in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle City of Washington State Wednesday, a gunman killed
two people and wounded two others Wednesday in a commercial
building and remained at large. In Honolulu City of Hawaii State
Tuesday, an employee at a copier company shot seven co-workers to
death before surrendering to police after a five-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
Clinton bemoaned the fact that the United States has been
plagued for 20 years by both "periodic outbursts" of gun violence
that claim at least two lives, and smaller-scale shootings that
kill an average of 13 children each day, "one and two at a time in
distant places or tough neighborhoods."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Americans already have accepted such
shootings as "something fundamental and inevitable" in the U.S.
society, Clinton said he believes that could change if citizens
press Congress to fund federal efforts to put more police officers
on the streets, teach children to avoid violence and prevent
felons from obtaining guns.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was briefed on the shootings in both cities and
offered federal help to local officials in solving the crimes. He
also noted that there are more than 200 million guns in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Urges Congress to OK Paying Dues to U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke to the United Nations Wednesday urged Congress to
approve paying all the dues it owes to the world body, otherwise,
his country has no chance of paying a less membership fee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Holbrooke
made clear that there will be no chances to reduce the U.S. share
from 25 percent of the U.N. budget to 20 percent if it does not
pay the arrears.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain, Japan and other countries are asking why
they should bear more of the United Nations budget when the United
States is in arrears.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled Senate earlier this year approved a
926 million U.S. dollar package for the United Nations, but
conditioning that the U.N. will reduce the U.S. share of the U.N.
budget.
</P>
<P>
The bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton for some
anti-abortion languages in it.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke told the senators that the 926 million U.S. dollars
is "the absolute minimum we need for our national security needs."
"Less money than 926 is required to keep the vote, we need the
full 926 to function."
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the panel, Senator Joseph Biden noted that the
United States would lose its vote in the General Assembly unless
it makes a payment on past dues
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that 100 million of the 926 million U.S.
dollars actually will come back to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Over 100 million of the 926 goes to the Pentagon. So it's
really a little more than 800 million. No bargain could be much
more of a bargain," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N.'s cupboard is bare, and we have national security
interests at work in East Timor, Sierra Leone, Kosovo, and
elsewhere in the world where we're getting a terrific bargain by
the leveraging effect," Holbrooke said.

<HEADLINE> Ruddock Escapes FA Action over Vieira Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- West Ham defender Neil Ruddock
has escaped punishment over remarks he made about Arsenal
midfielder Patrick Vieira following their Upton Park bust-up.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock met Football Association compliance officer Graham Bean
on Wednesday to discuss the comments made on television in the
aftermath of his being spat on by the Frenchman in the Premiership
clash on September 3.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the spitting incident, Ruddock had said: "
Vieira missed but was near enough for me to smell the garlic on
his breath."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal had presented the video of that interview to the FA
disciplinary commission - which handed Vieira a six-match ban and
45,000 pounds fine last week - as evidence that he had been
provoked by Ruddock.
</P>
<P>
It led to reports that the FA were to throw the book at Ruddock
for alleged racist remarks although in reality those at Lancaster
Gate were more concerned at what they saw as insulting behaviour
by the former Liverpool star.
</P>
<P>
But now the FA insist that the matter is closed and are to take
no formal action against Ruddock.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said: "Neil Ruddock had a meeting
with the Football Association this afternoon as regards comments
made in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
"It was never the FA's contention that Neil Ruddock made racist
remarks and we fully accept that he is not racist - as his many
black friends in the game will testify.
</P>
<P>
"However, he was reminded of his responsibilities towards his
fellow professionals and the matter is now closed."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal insist they had never claimed Ruddock was racist and
manager Arsene Wenger said: "It was never our intention to make
Ruddock a target. We just wanted to show how much Vieira had been
provoked."

<HEADLINE> Britain's Arms Exports Under Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government Wednesday
faced criticism of its record on arms exports as it revealed the
extent of its weapons sales to other countries last year.
</P>
<P>
Ministers published their second annual report on arms exports
amid claims by critics that the Labor government's "ethical"
foreign policy was in tatters.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that the government issued more than 10,000
individual arms licenses in 1998 and that the number of "open
licenses" which allow multi-shipments of arms without further
reference to the government was up from 156 in 1997 to 566.
</P>
<P>
In September, when it was revealed that Britain was millions of
pounds over the past year to assist the Indonesian government to
continue with the purchase of British-built Hawk jets, many
parliament members had already expressed their outrages.
</P>
<P>
However, Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain Wednesday insisted
that the government had acted ethically and openly in its arms
sales policy.
</P>
<P>
He said no British arms were sold for repression or aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We have banned land mines. We have banned torture equipment.
We do not supply arms anywhere in the world for internal
repression or external aggression," Hain said.

WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Republicans
Wednesday blasted the Clinton administration's policy toward the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as "appeasement" and
vowed to make a complete review of the policy next year.
</P>
<P>
"The administration policy of appeasement and bribery with
North Korea has not worked," said Republican representative Floyd
Spence, chairman of the House's Armed Services Committee. He has
worked out a report with a Republican advisory group.
</P>
<P>
The report will be used by the Republicans to serve as
ammunition in a brewing political fight over the Clinton
administration's DPRK policy.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton last year appointed former Defense
Secretary William Perry to coordinate U.S. policy toward the DPRK,
and Perry submitted a policy review in May, suggesting sanctions
against Pyongyang be eased on the condition that it does not make
nuclear and long-range missile tests.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders said they would make a complete review
of the administration's policy next year, using the Republican
report as a starting point.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President-Elect Reaffirms Strengthening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZILIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine president-elect
Fernando De la Rua reiterated here Wednesday his intention to
consolidate the Souther Common Market (Mercosur) during a meeting
with his Brazilian counterpart, Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua said that strengthening the commercial bloc would be
a fundamental objective of his government and that it was
necessary to promote the Mercosur, resolve any upcoming problems
and intensify the commercial interchange between the member
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said he planned to incorporate new themes to the
commercial bloc, such as cooperation in the fields of science,
technology, university life and politics.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua said that he did not discount the possibility of
creating an internal currency for the Mercosur, but the member
countries would have firstly to promote their economic growth and
sign agreements which clearly outline the conditions for its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
In his first international trip after being elected as the
forthcoming president, De la Rua stated that trade relations
between Brazil and Argentina and subsidies provided to specific
sectors were a difficult issue, but his government would examine
thoroughly and seriously all aspects of the topics, together with
his Brazilian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The incoming Argentine president defended a higher
participation of the private sectors of the member countries in
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Talking on internal Argnetine themes, De la Rua said that his
government would begin a wide-sweeping fight against corruption,
poverty and unemployment within the country by way of incentive
programs for small and medium-sized businesses.

Europe. In response to the request, Clinton recommended General
Ralston for consideration as successor to General Clark "with the
same powers and functions."

<HEADLINE> Cuban Tribunal Sentences U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's Popular Provincial
Tribunal of Havana has sentenced the U.S. government to payment of
181.1 billion dollars for the human suffering caused by the
40-year embargo imposed by Washington against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was delivered Tuesday in a case presented by
social organizations and the Cuban population against the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
"We declare due to the present intervening suit," says the
sentence, which is transcribed in full in the official diary
"Granma" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The verdict requests the U.S. government to publicly retract
the moral suffering caused to the families and victims of the
presented cases, supported by the testimony of the witnesses in
the trial, and additionally to documents presented throughout the
case.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, eight social organizations and a group of people
presented a suit for human suffering against the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal, made up of two university professors and lawyers,
upheld the claim for the death of 3,478 people and the illicit
bankruptcy of the physical integrity of a further 2,099 people.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans accused the U.S. government of committing criminal
acts against the island, over a 40-year period, including
terrorism and organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the case are aggressions carried out from the
U.S. base in Guantanamo, a North American enclave on the island,
and bacteriological warfare, with particular emphasis on an
epidemic of hemorrhagic dengue fever, which caused the deaths of
158 people, of which 101 were children.
</P>
<P>
This was a civil trial, with neither district attorney nor
accused, only a suit, and in this case the U.S. government is
considered as a person.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time this kind of case has been carried out
against a foreign government, on the basis of Cuban legislation,
before the islands courts. Throughout the trial 200 people gave
testimony.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday announced a series of steps to
provide support for the opposition in Yugoslavia, a move strongly
criticized by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"First, in cooperation with our allies, we will evaluate the

assistance to the opposition-controlled cities of Nis and Pirot
before possible expansion to other municipalities," Albright said

</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks with the presence of a few of
opposition leaders in Yugoslavia including Zoran Djindjic, leader
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"We will be watching closely to see if the assistance actually
gets to the intended recipients in the manner proposed,"
Albright added.

The Clinton administration vowed to provide every support for
the opposition in Yugoslavia to topple the current government of
that country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has allocated some 11.8 million U.S. dollars to the
opposition since July, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also said that the United States will support
suspending the flight ban and oil embargo as soon as "free
elections" are held in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we will consult with Congress and discuss with our
European partners and other donors, the scope of external
assistance that could be made available after free elections have
been held and a new government is in place," Albright noted.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Belgrade said Goran Matic, Yugoslavia's federal
information minister, immediately criticized the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
"Since those so-called opposition leaders will have less than 1
percent of the votes in Serbia, it seems that Washington is trying
to prepare a jackass to win the horse races," an Associated Press
report quoted Matic as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better for Washington to stop with its interfering
in Yugoslav internal affairs and to abandon plans for overthrowing
legally elected leadership of our country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO conducted a 78-day air bombing of Yugoslavia
early this year to force Belgrade to withdraw its troops from its
own province Kosovo. Thousands were killed and many facilities
were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. and its allies also imposed an arms and
economic embargo against Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Fed Finds Continued Economic Growth in Most Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
reported Wednesday that a survey of its 12 regional banks showed
manufacturing activity was continuing to expand in almost all
regions, helped by a rebound in demand from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said robust economic growth is keeping labor markets
tight with the Cleveland, Dallas, and Richmond, Va., districts
reporting strong demand for temporary workers. The New York Fed
reported that there were no more temps to be found.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tight labor markets, which have caused Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan to worry about the danger of rising wage demands
and inflation, the new report found "there are few signs of a
general pickup in prices of final goods and services."
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey, known as the "beige book," will be used when
Fed policy-makers hold their next meeting on Nov. 16 to decide
whether to raise interest rates for a third time this year.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe the odds slightly favor a rate increase
in November, but that it remains a close call given the fact that
inflation has remained under control and there are signs the
economy is slowing from its breakneck pace of the summer.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Wednesday, the Conference Board said a key
gauge of future economic activity fell slightly in September. The
board's Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined 0.1 percent
in September to 107.9 after showing no change at 108.0 the month
before, according to revised figures released by the private
business-financed study group.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Anti-drug War Fails, Leaders Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. war against drugs
on the western hemisphere is a failure, a group of U.S. leaders
and experts said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The focus should be on reducing the consumption of drugs, the
group said in a letter to the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy
Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, co-sponsored by the U.S. Office of
National Drug Control Policy and the Organization of American
States, were attended by anti-drug officials from the U.S. and
Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by politicians, judges, religious leaders
and others, demanded U.S. federal anti-drug Czar Barry McCaffrey,
a senior State Department official, to admit the U.S. war on drugs
in Latin America and the U.S. has failed.
</P>
<P>
"The escalation of a militarized drug war in Colombia and
elsewhere in the Americas threatens regional stability...and has
put U.S. arms and money into the hands of corrupt officials and
military... units involved in human rights abuses," it said.
</P>
<P>
Three former Latin presidents _ Belisario Betancur of Colombia,
Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Oscar
Arias of Costa Rica, signed on the letter.
</P>
<P>
"As you meet to develop hemispheric drug strategy, it is time
to admit that after two decades, the U.S. war on drugs _ both in
Latin American and in the United States _ is a failure," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
It added that despite spending tens of billions of dollars for
raids on drug labs, crop eradication and arrests and imprisonment
at home, illicit drugs are cheaper, more potent and more easily
available in the U.S. than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The letter urged the officials at the conference to consider
policies that will focus more on reducing consumption, expanding
drug treatment programs, and promoting economic development to
decrease the reliance on drug income among people who produce it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the country which consumes largest amount of
different illegal drugs in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Sanctions on Belgrade to Be Lifted if Elections Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
suspend all flight and oil embargo against Yugoslavia if "free
elections" are held in that country, said U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the move indicates a change of the U.S.
strategy on Yugoslavia by delinking the step-down of Serbian
leader Milosevic and the removal of sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, the Clinton administration repeatedly said
the sanctions will not be lifted so long as Milosevic remains in
power.
</P>
<P>
Albright also announced a series of steps to provide support
for the opposition in Yugoslavia, a move strongly criticized by
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"First, in cooperation with our allies, we will evaluate the
EU's pilot project.... This project will provide energy assistance
to the opposition-controlled cities of Nis and Pirot before
possible expansion to other municipalities," Albright said at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks with the presence of a few of
opposition leaders in Yugoslavia including Zoran Djindjic, leader
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"We will be watching closely to see if the assistance actually
gets to the intended recipients in the manner proposed," Albright
added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration vowed to provide every support for
the opposition in Yugoslavia to topple the current government of
that country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has allocated some 11.8 million U.S. dollars to the
opposition since July, Albright said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. President to Veto School Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
plans to veto a massive Republican bill financing education and
other social programs as both sides sought to solidify bargaining
positions in budget talks, the White House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"He (Clinton) will veto it and articulate why he has vetoed it,
because of its lack of investment in teachers, in prioritizing
school programs and in holding schools accountable," said White
House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.S. Congress sent the 314-billion-U.S.-dollar
measure for schools, health and labor -- the last of the 13 annual
spending bills for the month-old fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has criticized its education priorities and the 0.97
percent across-the-board cut the measure would make in all
proposed agency budgets.
</P>
<P>
Five of the 13 bills for 2000 have been vetoed by Clinton or
face a veto threat, covering seven Cabinet departments, dozens of
other agencies, foreign aid and the District of Columbia budget.

LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. senator George
Mitchell briefed British Prime Minister Tony Blair Wednesday on
the progress made during nine weeks of talks to unlock the stalled
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell refused to disclose details of his one-hour meeting to
media when he emerged from Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
"We have now completed approximately nine weeks of consultation
with the parties in Northern Ireland. I have asked for an
assessment which I believe is essential for the completion of the
review," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have made no secret of the fact that I would like to
complete this as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he would not impose any specific date as a deadline for
the talks.
</P>
<P>
His meeting with Blair followed discussions in Dublin on
Tuesday with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace talks mediator said he will meet
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace talks will resume on Monday and

break the deadlock process soon after.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Demands U.N. Recognition for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A Taliban official has said
that the movement could satisfy U.N. requests only after the world
body recognized it, said a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report was made by Hamal Hossain, special rapporteur of the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The report tells that Hossain
visited Kabul on September 9-12 and met Taliban representatives
there. He will submit the report to the U.N. General Assembly
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hossain said in the report that the Taliban authorities
repeatedly raised the issues of recognition during his visit and
urged that "recognition be extended to them."
</P>
<P>
One of the Taliban representatives told Hossain it was the
movement's understanding that the U.N. attached importance to
three issues: elimination of narcotics, dealing with Saudi-born
Osama bin Laden and education of women, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It was stated that if recognition was accorded, the Taliban
authorities would be able to satisfy the United Nations with
regard to each of these matters," the report said.
