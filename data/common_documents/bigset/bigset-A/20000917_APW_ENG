Fujimori Calls New Elections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, besieged by a bribery scandal
surrounding a top aide, announced in a nationwide television address Saturday
that he was calling new elections and that he would not be a candidate. Fujimori
also said he would deactivate the National Intelligence Service, whose powerful
head has been accused of offering bribes to an opposition congressman to support
the government. He did not announce a date for the new vote. The authoritarian
Fujimori was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term in voting that
ended with a second round in May.

Officials: No Sign of Philippine Hostages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Military mortars pounded the camps of Muslim
rebels Sunday as thousands of troops continued their assault to free 19 foreign
and Filipino hostages, but there was still no sign of the captives, officials
said. ''They haven't been eyeballed,'' said presidential press secretary Ricardo
Puno. ''The rebels are clearly moving them from place to place.'' The military
imposed a news blackout after the surprise attack aimed at rescuing the hostages
held on remote Jolo island. Authorities launched the attack before dawn Saturday
following nearly five months of negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf rebels and the
reported payment of more than $15 million in ransom for other captives.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Heavy rain began falling along the Gulf Coast today as
Hurricane Gordon bore down on central Florida. The storm had deluged Cuba with
up to 10 inches of rain before reaching hurricane strength with 75 mph winds
today. Gordon was expected to strike land between Fort Myers and the Panhandle
sometime late tomorrow. But its unpredictability and direction changes left
forecasters urging all coastal areas from Florida to Alabama to closely monitor
its progress.

   LAKEVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Police arrested four people today in connection with
the execution-style killings of three construction workers found dead inside a
barn where they were installing a loft. The bodies of Wayne A. Shumaker, 59;
Corby Myers, 30; and Lynn Ganger, 54, were found Thursday afternoon by a
co-worker. Each victim had been shot in the head, and all were found with their
hands tied behind their backs, said Mike Swanson, commander of the St. Joseph
County Special Crimes Unit. Swanson said the three workers may have stumbled
upon a burglary attempt. ''It appears they were caught by surprise,'' he said.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United Nations is prepared to send peacekeeping troops
along a future Israeli-Palestinian border should a peace accord be signed, a top
Palestinian official said Saturday. The issue of final borders between Israel
and a future Palestinian entity is one of the main subjects to be resolved in
negotiations for a peace deal, which have been deadlocked over the future of
Jerusalem. Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath, in Washington for consultations
on the floundering peace process, said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan made
the assurance during a meeting between the two at the United Nations earlier
this week.

Sydney: Romanian Lifters Thrown Out
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Romanian weightlifting team was thrown out of
the Sydney Olympics after two lifters failed drug tests before the games, while
another nine Olympic athletes have recorded suspected positive tests.
International Olympic Committee director general Francois Carrard said Sunday
(Saturday night EDT) that the expulsion of the Romanian lifting team was ordered
by the International Weightlifting Federation. Under federation rules, any
nation is suspended from competition for the rest of that year if three or more
of its weightlifters test positive for banned drugs. A third Romanian
weightlifter tested positive earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Gore Courts Black Support  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton at his side, Al Gore
summoned the black community to vote by the millions in November to
help extend the Democratic grip on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it's time to take the next step in civil rights,''
Gore told applauding members of the Congressional Black Caucus
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is time to end racial profiling in America,'' he
said. ''And that will be the first order of business of the
Gore-Lieberman administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also promised to work for full voting rights for the
District of Columbia, which has a majority black population but,
under the Constitution, no voting representation in the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the caucus by its three initials -- CBC -- Gore
launched a long litany in the style of civil rights activist Jesse
Jackson in admonishing the CBC members to vote and get out other
blacks to vote Democratic in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ''For another administration that looks like America, vote
CBC,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For an administration that keeps affirmative action going,
vote CBC.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated the theme, touching more than a dozen issues,
including education, health and, repeatedly, the expansion of civil
rights for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''With your help, I'm hoping to come back here next year in a
different capacity,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight, I came to listen and clap and say thanks,'' the
president said as he followed Gore to the podium. ''Thanks you for
giving me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for standing with Al Gore and me in our simple and
profound mission to make sure that everyone in our country has a
chance,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And the president said that when his own troubles mounted, he
took heart from the support he received from black officials in
general and the CBC in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing that I have achieved would have been possible without
the Congressional Black Caucus,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's address highlighted a weekend rallying black support for
himself and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A peppy, overflow crowd of 1,600 students at historically black
Howard University cheered him Friday morning. A standing-room-only
audience of black Clinton administration appointees provided
repeated chants of ''Go Al! Go Al!'' during his half-hour speech
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say that Gore may be able to count on a high
percentage of the black vote in his race against George W. Bush.
But they say assuring a heavy black turnout is vital to his chances
-- especially in swing states like New Jersey, Missouri, Florida and
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore now has the support of about eight in 10 blacks,
solidifying support which dipped before the Democratic convention,
polls suggest.
</P>
<P>
   This coming week, Gore will head West to raise more money for
the Democratic National Committee, which has been financing the
bulk of Gore's TV ad war with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC began running a new ad Saturday featuring Gore talking
about education. The committee will spend $2 million to $3 million
over the next week airing the spot in 17 battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president had fund-raisers planned through the week,
including a Monday night event in Beverly Hills organized by
director Rob Reiner, a Tuesday fund-raiser in the San Francisco Bay
area, and a Saturday event in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Gore plans to focus on health policy, an
area where he currently enjoys a clear advantage over Bush in
polls. This week, he plans to put a twist on his long-proposed
''bill of rights'' for HMO patients, promote proposals to seal the
privacy of medical records, and hold a rally around his plan to
give seniors a Medicare benefit for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the week, Gore will head home to Washington for
preparations for the first of three presidential debates on Oct. 3.

<HEADLINE> Marijuana Rally Pushes Legalization  </HEADLINE>
By LISA LIPMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- What was billed as a rally to support marijuana
legislation Saturday turned into a drug festival on Boston Common
with 40,000 people, many of them minors illegally smoking
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 67 people for marijuana possession during the
Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition's 11th Annual Freedom
rally. Another person was arrested for possession of 100 hits of
acid, and two people were arrested for prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was intended to raise awareness about using voting
power to get marijuana legalized, but many of the attendees weren't
old enough to cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   David Brown, 19, of Hartford, Conn., said he was unaware the
event had a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we'd come down, listen to the bands, and pay homage
to weed on the Common,'' Brown said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of teen-agers sat in circles, some of them smoking
cigarettes and discreetly passing around joints or pipes. Many
sported various facial piercings or '60s flower-child dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The use of marijuana at the event didn't bother Ann McCormick,
whose son, Todd, a cancer patient, is appealing a five-year
sentence he received for growing marijuana. He is currently
incarcerated in a California prison, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather see someone use marijuana than to drink alcohol
or to smoke cigarettes,'' McCormick said. ''The problem is in
overuse of anything. It can be sports, it can be television, it can
be video games. Moderation is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Keith Stroup, executive director of the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said he disapproved
of young people smoking at the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think we all need to make the distinction that when we
talk about stopping the arrest of marijuana smokers, we're talking
about adults smoking marijuana in the privacy of their own home,''
Stroup said. ''We're not advocating that it should be legal to
smoke in the park, and we certainly don't think marijuana is for
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-marijuana protesters such as William Breault of The
Concerned Citizens for Drug Prevention were also at the rally and
supported the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't be a breeding ground for drug use,'' Breault
said as he handed out anti-marijuana pins. ''It's not legal. We're
here today to say it's wrong, and we're going work against it.''

<HEADLINE> Charged Guardsman Speaks Out  </HEADLINE>
By JULIET WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A former National guardsman cleared of all
charges in an anti-NATO graffiti attack and bombing attempt at a
Milwaukee base spoke out Saturday night, saying he holds no grudges
against either the National Guard or the government that accused
him.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint against Milan Mititch, dismissed Friday,
said a tipster told investigators Mititch had spoken of his
animosity toward the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I harbor no animosity toward the Army or the National Guard,''
Mititch told The Associated Press on Saturday. ''I never have. That
statement is false, false, false.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very proud of my 17 years with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mititch, 35, a commuter airline pilot and son of a Serbian
immigrant, said one of the worst things to come from his arrest was
''the cloud that has been cast over the Serbian community in
Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely devastated by the fact that the entire Serb
community has been brought under suspicion, and I am the focal
point of that,'' he said as he sat in his lawyer's home for his
first interview since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch had contended from the start that he was on vacation
with his mother in Door County, about 140 miles north of Milwaukee,
when an intruder broke into the 128th Air Guard Refueling Wing on
July 19, scrawled ''Free Kosova,'' an Albanian spelling for Kosovo,
on a satellite dish and left behind two pipe bombs when guards
chased the intruder away. The bombs did not explode.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office said Friday that a continuing FBI
investigation found evidence that didn't support the case against
Mititch and that officials now believe the July 19 incident is
connected to another graffiti incident that occurred March 17, when
a Humvee vehicle was burned and graffiti left at the scene. The FBI
had confirmed Mititch was in Philadelphia on that date.
</P>
<P>
   The two felony counts against Mititch of federal explosives
violations, which carried a sentence of up to 40 years in prison,
were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel in many respects it was an act of God,'' Mititch said
in the interview. ''I happened to be working in Philadelphia when
these crimes occurred -- by coincidence. I could just as easily have
been at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mititch said the spelling of ''Kosova'' made him think whoever
invaded the base was someone of another ethnic origin. He wouldn't
say which one, saying he didn't want to label anyone as he was
labeled.
</P>
<P>
   A guard at the base who chased the intruder had identified
Mititch as the man who broke into the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder also wrote vulgar remarks about ''KFOR,'' the
NATO-led force charged with maintaining peace between Serbs and
Albanians in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. Personnel from the
128th provided support services during a NATO bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch spent 35 days in custody before his release on $100,000
bond Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his lawyer, Nick Kostich, had not talked about
suing the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no plans at this time of that type. Basically all I
want is a normal life,'' Mititch said. ''I don't have any grudges
towards anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like to resume his career as a pilot, though he
is not sure whether that will be possible with the negative
attention he's received. He was suspended without pay by American
Eagle and hasn't spoken with his employer since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think that once a case is dismissed it's over,''
Mititch said. ''In a case like this, it may never be over. I may be
living with this for the rest of my life.''

   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- Two-time defending gold medalist
Cuba made a dominating start in Olympic baseball as three pitchers
combined on a no-hitter in a 16-rout of South Africa.

<P>
   The Cubans pounded 18 hits Sunday (Saturday night EDT).

</P>

for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   None of the pitchers allowed a walk; only a late error by third
baseman Gabriel Pierre prevented a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Pacheco had three hits and three RBIs. Miguel Caldes had
four hits and Antonio Scull drove in three runs for the Cubans.

<HEADLINE> Softball: United States 6, Canada 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- It's tough to improve on the 0.00
ERA that Lori Harrigan posted in the Atlanta Games, but she managed
to do it in the Olympic softball opener in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan pitched the first solo no-hitter in Olympic softball
history Sunday (Saturday night EDT) to begin the Americans'
gold-medal defense with a 6-0 victory over Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once 'Vegas' threw that first pitch, it was showtime,'' said
Dot Richardson, who homered along with Crystl Bustos and Jennifer
Brundage. ''Lori Harrigan did a great job -- in the first game of
the Olympics. There was a lot of pressure on her because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan fumbled a grounder in the first inning, although the
error was charged to first baseman Sheila Douty. She then retired
20 consecutive batters. Only four batters hit the ball out of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave up the perfect game,'' Harrigan said, ''so I don't have
to blame it on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no-hitters and perfect games are more common in
softball, where the quality of opponents can vary widely, no one
ever has pitched a perfect game in the Olympics. Two Chinese
pitchers combined on a no-hitter in 1996, when softball was added
as an official Olympic sport.
</P>
<P>
   The United States won gold in Atlanta, losing just one game
during the tournament and only three games since. They have won 111
consecutive games dating to the 1998 world championships, going
60-0 on their pre-Olympic tour while allowing a total of four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan may be less accomplished than U.S. ace Lisa Fernandez,
who pitched five consecutive perfect games during the ''Central
Park to Sydney'' tour, including six straight no-hitters. ''Vegas''
-- so called because of her security job at the Bellagio hotel and
casino -- is no slouch, but her invisible ERA was only good enough
to tie for tops on her team in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Harrigan was picked to start the opener because the
Canadian lineup is dominated by lefties. And if anyone thought the
Americans were saving their best for the big matchup against
Australia, they soon discovered how deep the U.S. pitching staff
can be.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're both good pitchers,'' Canadian pitcher Vicky Bastarche
said. ''Obviously, Lisa is an excellent pitcher. But Lori threw
well today and she deserves the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the Olympic opener, she set down the Canadians like they
were counting cards at a blackjack table.
</P>
<P>
   After her first-inning error, she retired every batter she
faced, finishing off the gem herself by fielding Erin Woods' nubbed
grounder to the pitcher's circle and throwing easily to first.
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates were relatively subdued in congratulating her,
except for the always exuberant Richardson, who jumped up and down
while slapping Harrigan with a high five.
</P>
<P>
   Douty had an RBI single in the first inning to give the
Americans all the runs they would need. Bustos hit a two-run homer
in the third, Brundage hit a two-run shot in the fifth and
Richardson added a run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harrigan has lost count of all the no-hitters she's
thrown as a schoolgirl and at college at Nevada-Las Vegas, where
her number is retired, that hasn't diminished the thrill of
throwing them. As in baseball, none of her teammates would say the
words during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter who we throw it against,'' she said. ''It's
still special.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Miklos Molnar scored in the 18th minute
as the Kansas City Wizards opened the MLS playoffs with a 1-0
victory over the Colorado Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City earned three points in the quarterfinal series,

   Molnar scored off an assist from Preki, heading the ball past
Colorado goalkeeper David Kramer. It was Molnar's fourth goal in as

</P>
<P>
   Colorado came close to sending the match to overtime when Paul
Bravo took a shot from outside the box. Junior Agogo redirected the
shot to the far post where Tony Meola made a spectacular diving
save, trapping the ball against the goalpost just before it crossed

Roman Yakovlev, Russia rallied from an early deficit to defeat
Yugoslavia 3-1 in a close battle between two of the world's best

</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev, whose stutter-step approach produces a wicked 75-mph

   Russia lost seven of the last nine points to drop the first
game, then stormed back behind Yakovlev. A clean ace broke a 23-23
tie, and Iakovlev won the set with another serve the Yugoslavs
barely got a hand on.
</P>
<P>
   The teams matched each other shot for shot in the third set, and
once again it was tied at 23. A smash by Russian Sergei Tetioukhin
over 6-foot-7 blocker Igor Vusurovic made it 24-23, and Igor
Choulepov got the winner on another shot past Vusurovic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians jumped to a 7-1 lead in the fourth game and didn't
look back. Yakovlev finished with five aces.

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Michigan St. Beats Missouri  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- T.J. Duckett carried the load for Michigan
State again.
</P>
<P>
   Duckett ran for 131 yards and a touchdown as the Spartans
overcame a 10-point deficit to beat Missouri 13-10 on Saturday
night. Michigan State was held to 125 yards and three points in the
first half, but kept plugging.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still trying to figure out what we're doing,'' Duckett
said. ''We just have to start out quicker. The defense came up big
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duckett, who had a career-best 219 yards rushing last week
against Marshall, tied it at 10 on a 7-yard run with 5:21 to go in
the third quarter. Zack Abron scored on a 7-yard run for Missouri,
but his fumble at the Tigers' 26 set up Duckett's score.
</P>
<P>
   One of Duckett's biggest runs came at the end of the game when
he reversed field and gained 7 yards on third-and-6 from the
Michigan State to enable the Spartans to run out the clock. Duckett
carried the last four plays for Michigan State, totaling 23 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was running and I didn't see anything and I saw basically
the whole defense on that one side,'' Duckett said. ''I took a
gamble and cut it back and luckily I made that extra yard.''
</P>
<P>
   David Schaefer's 27-yard field goal with 10:48 to go was the
difference for Michigan State (2-0), which ended Marshall's 18-game
winning streak last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, with freshman Jeff Smoker at quarterback in place
of injured Ryan Van Dyke, struggled against Missouri (1-2), which
was coming off a 62-9 loss at Clemson. Van Dyke, who has a bruised
right thumb, will return to the lineup next week against Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were just trying to hang in there and deliver our
punches,'' Duckett said. ''They kept throwing things at us,
different blitzes and defensive fronts, and we just couldn't make
anything happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri had been outscored 199-73 in its previous four games,
but controlled play much of the game. Still, the Tigers fell to
1-24 against ranked opponents under coach Larry Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our team played a heck of a game,'' Smith said. ''We showed we
were a team to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players didn't seem happy with coming close, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's what a bad team would say,'' defensive end
Justin Smith said. ''I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Duckett's biggest runs came at the end of the game when
he reversed field and gained 7 yards on third-and-6 from the
Michigan State to enable the Spartans to run out the clock. Duckett
carried the last four plays for Michigan State, totaling 23 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was running and I didn't see anything and I saw basically
the whole defense on that one side,'' Duckett said. ''Basically I
took a gamble and cut it back and luckily I made that extra yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Smith at least delivered on a promise of showing some
new wrinkles. The Tigers opened the game in a ''swinging gate''
formation with the quarterback, center and two others at the left
hash and everyone else far across the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers started their second possession with a lateral pass
from Kirk Farmer to Justin Gage, who then hit John Dausman for a
70-yard gain to the Michigan State 6 to set up Brad Hammerich's
25-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used them to try and create some momentum,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   They also used a no-huddle offense most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State coach Bobby Williams sniffed at all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't any trickery about Michigan State football,''
Williams said. ''When you see that, it's coming right at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State missed a scoring chance its next possession when
Gary Anthony intercepted Smoker's pass from the 11 in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri dominated in the first half, outgaining Michigan State
259-125 and taking a 10-3 lead. But the Tigers missed chances for
more points with drives stalling at the Michigan State 38, 37 and
49.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-yard pass from Farmer to Gage to the Michigan State 15
helped Missouri take a 10-0 lead on Abron's 7-yard run with 6:57
left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest play of the half for Michigan State was a 40-yard
pass play to Ivory McCoy to the Missouri 9. McCoy broke a tackle
near the line of scrimmage and his play set up Schaefer's 22-yard
field goal with 2:47 to go.

<HEADLINE> Volleyball: Russia 3, Yugoslavia 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Riding the high-velocity serves of
Roman Yakovlev, Russia rallied from an early deficit to defeat
Yugoslavia 3-1 in a close battle between two of the world's best
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev, whose stutter-step approach produces a wicked 75-mph
jump serve, led the Russians to a 19-25, 25-23, 25-23, 25-20
victory Sunday (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Russia, ranked second in the world, is trying to regain the
prestige it lost in the 1990s. After winning three golds and two
silvers in their first six Olympics, the Russians finished seventh
in 1992 and fourth in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, which came out of nowhere to win the Olympic bronze
in 1996, is ranked sixth, but also a strong contender for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost seven of the last nine points to drop the first
game, then stormed back behind Yakovlev. A clean ace broke a 23-23
tie, and Iakovlev won the set with another serve the Yugoslavs
barely got a hand on.
</P>
<P>
   The teams matched each other shot for shot in the third set, and
once again it was tied at 23. A smash by Russian Sergei Tetioukhin
over 6-foot-7 blocker Igor Vusurovic made it 24-23, and Igor
Choulepov got the winner on another shot past Vusurovic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians jumped to a 7-1 lead in the fourth game and didn't
look back. Yakovlev finished with five aces.

   DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche re-signed forward Chris
Drury to a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Drury, 24, was Colorado's third-leading scorer in his sophomore
year last season with 67 points. He was second in assists (47) and
tied for third in goals (20).

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- World champion Italy was tested early
but earned a 27-25, 25-23, 25-18 victory over South Korea in the
first round of Olympic men's volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Italian star Andrea Sartoretti had 15 kills, and Alessandro Fei
added four blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has been the world's dominant team for the past decade,
but still is looking for its first Olympic gold medal. The team
finished a disappointing fifth at the 1992 Games and won silver in
'96.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians committed 24 errors in the match, struggling to get
past South Korea in the first two sets. Slowly, Italy began to get
its offense and blocking going.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean hitter Shin Jin-sik had 18 kills.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth-ranked South Korea, which has participated in all but one
Olympics since volleyball was added in 1964, still is looking for
its first medal.

<HEADLINE> Wife of IOC President Dies  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- After presiding over the splendor of
the opening ceremony, Olympics head Juan Antonio Samaranch faced a
personal tragedy: His gravely ill wife died Saturday as he flew
home to Spain to be with her.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Teresa Salisachs-Rowe, 67 and reportedly suffering from
cancer, died Saturday in Barcelona -- just two hours before
Samaranch arrived after a flight of more than 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a wonderful woman,'' Samaranch told reporters in
Barcelona. ''I not only loved her, I admired her.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said his wife had been ill for several months and he
last spoke with her on Sept. 3 before traveling to Sydney. He said
he was notified of her death by telephone during the flight to
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been a big loss,'' Samaranch said. ''But life is that
way. Everything has a beginning and an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said the funeral will be held Monday in Barcelona and
that he would return to Sydney for the rest of the games.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee officials, Sydney organizers and
the Australian government offered their condolences and paid
tribute to Mrs. Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was not an IOC member, but she was a very close friend to
all of us,'' Hungarian member Pal Schmitt said. ''She was like the
first lady of the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to tears, IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz said Samaranch
knew in Sydney, where he was presiding over his last Olympics, that
his wife was near death.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a glorious woman. She was always exquisite,'' she
said. ''She was kind and generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, who as first vice president has temporarily taken
over Samaranch's duties, said the Olympic flag would be lowered to
half-staff from noon Sunday to noon Monday (9 p.m. EDT Saturday to
9 p.m. EDT Sunday) at the Olympic Stadium, three hotels where IOC
officials are staying and IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A Mass is scheduled Monday at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Sydney
for Olympic officials and others.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Sydney, Samaranch said he expected to return by
next weekend. IOC officials, speaking after his wife's death was
announced, said they believe he will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's his decision,'' DeFrantz said. ''He said at the executive
board that he would come back, but I certainly wouldn't insist on
it. What he did in opening the games is just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's now resting,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard
said. ''His plans, as of today, are that he should come back. We'll
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said Samaranch received a call from his family Friday
night advising him that his wife was close to death and he should
fly home as quickly as possible. Pound said he believed the call
came during the opening ceremony itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very sad indeed,'' Pound said. ''The pressure he has
been under in the past few months generally, and with this
particular problem in the background, must be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said a tradition in Spain is to have a quick burial with a
Mass, followed by a service at a later date, which Pound guessed
would be sometime after the Olympics. He said there wasn't enough
time for other IOC officials to fly to Spain for the burial.
</P>
<P>
   He said a condolence register would be placed at each of the
three Olympic family hotels, and possibly at the Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   In the village, a moment of silence was observed by the 199
national team mission chiefs at their morning briefing.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 hours after presiding over his last Olympic opening
ceremony and wishing the world ''G'day,'' Samaranch abruptly left
Sydney for Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Samaranch -- known by her friends as ''Bibis'' -- died at
noon Saturday (6 a.m. Saturday EDT), IOC spokesman Franklin
Servan-Schreiber said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrard said she died two hours before Samararch's plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Varela, a veteran Spanish journalist and close friend of
Samaranch and his wife, said the two met in 1953-4 in Barcelona and
were married in December 1955. Both grew up in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Samaranch's mother came from Ireland, while her father was
an industrialist from Spain's Catalan region. She was one of four
children and had two brothers and a sister.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch and his wife had two children, Maria Teresa and Juan
Antonio. The son is a businessman in Madrid, while the daughter is
an economist with a Barcelona bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper, an IOC vice president from Australia, called Mrs.
Samaranch ''very popular, a wonderful mother, and a great partner.
She had great style.''
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala, heading a
U.S. delegation to the games, said the delegation was ''deeply
saddened'' by news of the death.
</P>
<P>
   Under IOC protocol, Pound will lead the daily joint meetings of
the IOC executive board and Sydney Organizing Committee. He said it
would be business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no change of command,'' he said. ''We're just all
helping out the boss as best we can. His objective is, the
organization should continue to run as if he were here.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch is to step down in July after 21 years as president.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- On a day when the U.S. baseball team
made its Sydney debut, the Olympic news was captured in a
linescore: No hits, a stirring run, and the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   The no-hitter belonged to U.S. softball pitcher Lori Harrigan,
whose near-perfect game Sunday (Saturday night EDT) led the
Americans past Canada 6-0 as her team opened its defense of the
1996 gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The run came from Canadian Simon Whitfield, who capped a
grueling men's triathlon by sprinting to victory in the final 200
meters outside Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   And the end of era was marked by the passing of IOC head Juan
Antonio Samaranch's wife, who stood beside him during his 20-year
reign atop the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Olympic men's triathlon, Whitfield survived a crash
during the bike race, then summoned his energy for a medal-winning
burst. Whitfield blew past silver medalist Stephan Vuckovic of
Germany for the victory; the bronze went to Jan Rehula of the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The American baseball team took on Japan in its Olympic opener.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SOFTBALL: Harrigan, who celebrated her 30th birthday earlier
this month, blew away the Canadians to hurl the first solo
no-hitter in Olympic history. Dot Richardson, Crystl Bustos and
Jennifer Brundage all homered for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan was a first-inning error away from a perfect game.
After the mistake, she retired 20 consecutive batters for the
dominating American team.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has won 111 consecutive games dating to the
1998 world championships, going 60-0 and allowing just four runs on
its Olympic preparation tour.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BASEBALL: The two-time defending gold medalists, Cuba, pounded
18 hits in a 16-0 no-hit victory over South Africa. The game was
stopped after seven innings due to the mercy rule.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SAMARANCH: The flag in Sydney's Olympic Stadium will fly at
half-staff for a day after the death of Samaranch's wife. Maria
Teresa Salisachs-Rowe, 67 and reportedly suffering from cancer,
died Saturday in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   A Mass is scheduled Monday in Sydney for Olympic officials and
others. It was unclear if IOC head Samaranch, presiding over his
last games, would return to Sydney after a service for his wife in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WEIGHTLIFING: The Romanian weightlifting team was kicked out
of the Sydney Games after two members failed pre-Olympic drug
tests, giving the team three positives in a single year.
International Weightlifting Federation rules require a suspension
for any nation with three bad drug tests; another Romanian had
failed a test earlier in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SWIMMING: After picking up two gold medals in his Olympic
debut, Australia's Ian Thorpe picked up where he left off by
setting an Olympic best Sunday (Saturday night EDT) in the
200-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   A relaxed Thorpe, who already holds the world record in the
event, qualified for the semifinals later Sunday; the finals were
scheduled for Monday (Sunday night EDT). Three-time U.S. gold
medalist Josh Davis placed fourth, the highest American finish.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, the 17-year-old began his Olympic career with two
gold medals while U.S veteran Jenny Thompson earned one in showing
that swimming's old guard could keep pace with its new wave.
</P>
<P>
   Five world records were set in the pool Saturday -- when only
four finals were held.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, in her third Olympics, captured her sixth gold medal
Saturday -- the most ever by a U.S. woman athlete. Before anchoring
the winning 400-meter freestyle relay, she had shared the honor
with skater Bonnie Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched around Thompson's record-setting effort were two gold
medals for Thorpe, the 17-year-old Australian superswimmer. Thorpe,
after breaking his own world record to win the 400-meter freestyle,
anchored the Australian 400-meter freestyle relay to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was part of a veteran squad that captured the first
swimming gold for the Americans. She ripped off her cap and goggles
and received pats on the head from teammates Amy Van Dyken, Dara
Torres and Courtney Shealy.
</P>
<P>
   The relay tied Thompson, who has never won an individual gold
medal, with Kristin Otto of Germany for most golds by a female
swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: Credit veterans Sheryl Swoopes and Lisa
Leslie with helping keep the defending gold medalist U.S. women's
basketball team from losing its opener. With Swoopes scoring 29
points and Leslie adding 24 and 11 rebounds, the Americans
struggled past South Korea, 89-75.
</P>
<P>
   The women played without sometime starter Chamique Holdsclaw,
who was diagnosed with the beginning of a stress fracture in her
right foot. The WNBA All-Star will miss at least five games.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S SOCCER: For the second time in as many games, the U.S.
soccer team was fit to be tied. After a 2-2 deadlock with the Czech
Republic in their opener, the men came back Saturday for a 1-1 tie
with Cameroon in a game where they missed several chances to take
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. goal was scored by Pete Vagenas on a second-half
penalty kick. The Americans will need a win in their third and
final preliminary game to advance into the second round for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S GYMNASTICS: A gutsy effort by veteran John
Roethlisberger helped vault the Americans into Monday's finals. The
U.S. finished fourth, and the top six teams made the final round.
Defending gold medalist Russia finished on top.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: Make it three straight wins for the U.S. boxers. David
Jackson, fighting at 132 pounds, pounded out a 19-7 victory over
Naoufel Ben Rabah. It was a particularly satisfying victory for
Jackson, who returned to the sport this year after two years off.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- CYCLING: It was just the wrong season for Chris Witty, who
failed in her bid to become the fourth person to win medals at the
Summer and Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The American speedskater, who won a pair of medals in 1998 at
Nagano, did not fare as well in her cycling bid in Sydney. Despite
a personal best, she finished fifth in the women's 500-meter time
trial as world champion Felicia Ballanger of France won the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: The United States, led by 19-year-old
Logan Tom, upset China 3-1 in a first-round women's match. The
Americans recovered from a slow start to win 19-25, 25-21, 25-12
and 26-24.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WATER POLO: At age 39, Maureen O'Toole was the oldest women on
the U.S. water polo team. But the veteran was feeling just like a
kid after scoring the go-ahead goal in the Americans' 6-4 victory
over World Cup champ Netherlands as women's water polo made its
Olympic bow.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Thinks of Dad After Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Peter Diamond broke down in tears with
thoughts of his father after winning his second consecutive Olympic
trap shooting gold medal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was for Dad,'' the Australian said. His father, Con, was
also a shooter and died earlier in the year, while Peter was coming
back from a World Cup event in Europe. His father financed his
career and influenced his son considerably.,
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking of my father, wishing he could have been
here,'' Diamond said. ''I didn't know how I'd go without him behind
me at such a big event, my first major event without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond ended with a score of 147 and was 25 for 25 in the
final. He also had a perfect score in the qualifying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Peel of Britain was second with 142. Third was Giovanni
Pellielo of Italy with 140.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Bade of Vancouver, Wash., who won the bronze medal in
Atlanta, failed to recover from a poor first day and finished in a
tie for 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond had to face the failure of his good friend, Mark
Russell, who was expected to challenge for the medal but failed to
make the final. Russell was the gold medalist in the men's double
trap at Atlanta and among the favorites in that event later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was just 22nd after the first day. Although he rallied
to 13th on the second day, he did not qualify for the six-man
final.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 10-meter air pistol completed earlier in the day,
Tao Luna of China started strong with an Olympic mark in qualifying
and went on to take the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Tao tied the Olympic mark with a qualifying score of 390 and
went on to win with 488.2 points. Jasna Sekavic of Yugoslavia won
the silver with 486.5 points and Annemarie Forder of Australia
scored 484 to take the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Aspandiyarova of Kazakstan was a surprise qualifier,
shooting a perfect 100 in the third round to secure third place for
the final. She finished sixth with 483.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   World finals record holder Ren Jie of China failed to make the
finals, as did World Cup winner Lolita Evglevskaya of Belarus.

<HEADLINE> Fight Turns To Mat for US Wrestlers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The match that sent wrestler Matt
Lindland to the Olympics was decided by a shuffle of papers in
Washington, with a U.S. Supreme Court justice serving as the
ultimate referee.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that a referee on the mat had missed an illegal trip in
the Greco-Roman wrestling qualifier he lost, Lindland fought both
USA Wrestling and the U.S. Olympic Committee all the way to the
Supreme Court for a right to a rematch. He won in court. He won on
the mat.
</P>
<P>
   So there he was Sunday in Sydney, lined up with seven other
Olympians on an unheralded but unpredictable U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going through something like that can either tear a guy down
or make him stronger and I think it made me stronger,'' Lindland,
30, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Sieracki had defeated Lindland 2-1 at the trials for the
167&AMP;frac12;-pound berth on the U.S. team. After winning his appeal,
Lindland beat Sieracki 8-0 in a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland, who went to high school in Gladstone, Ore., said he
wasn't sure he'd make the trip to Sydney until he actually boarded
the plane to join the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take a bad situation and make something good come out of it --
that's what's going to come out of it, I believe,'' said coach Dan
Chandler. ''It's a terrible situation for those two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Chandler and Lindland said the disruption wouldn't
affect the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got two kids. I've got a wife I've got to support,''
Lindland said. ''I've got a lot of things going on in my normal
life so when I go to practice, when I walk into the room, I leave
all that at the door.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Greco-Roman team has Olympic experience and many
experts have low expectations for the team. Sports Illustrated's
pre-Olympic issue projected the U.S. Greco-Roman squad to win zero
medals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like that. We're going to use that to motivate the team the
last couple of days,'' Chandler said. ''We've got that issue of
Sports Illustrated. It's much better than having somebody pick you
to win five golds.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler noted that members of the team had beaten several
top-ranked international wrestlers, and said the United States was
one of the few teams to qualify in all eight weight categories
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the wild card in this tournament,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Replacement Boxer Wins for U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- David Jackson got a trip to Sydney
because another boxer quit the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he became more than just a replacement. The
24-year-old boxer from Seattle became a winner at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great feeling, nothing like it,'' Jackson said after
beating Naoufel Ben Rabah of Tunisia 19-7 at 132 pounds. ''It's
great to be an Olympian right now. I'm looking for the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson replaced Marshall Martinez of Fontana, Calif., who
turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   ''We call him 'Nine Lives' because he's lucky to be here,'' said
Tom Mustin, head coach of the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who returned to the sport this year after a two-year
absence, set up his punches with a good left jab and took complete
control after leading only 5-4 in the second round. By the round's
end, Jackson led 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Jackson is Selim Palyani of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Craig of Cincinnati shook off first-round jitters and
became the second U.S. boxer to advance when he stopped Fadel
Showban Showban of Egypt on the 15-point rule Saturday night. The
22-year-old Craig, ahead 3-1 after one round, led 17-2 early in the
fourth round when the 147-pound match was halted. Craig next will
box Bulent Ulusoy of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just had to get used to being in the ring again,'' said
Craig, who had not boxed in five months because of surgery on his
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Vinson, 22, of Washington, D.C., advanced at 119 pounds
Saturday afternoon with a 9-2 decision over Rachid Bouaita of
France.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the best bouts of the first two days, Liborio Romero
of Mexico, trailing 13-6 in the third round, swarmed all over
Mebarek Soltani of Algeria and won their 106-pound bout 16-15 with
a scoring blow right before the bell.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two rounds and part of the third, Romero, several
inches shorter than Soltani, had trouble getting inside as the
Algerian scored with counter punches. Then Romero's pressure began
to tell, and in the fourth round Soltani could not keep him off.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last second with the last punch I knew I had won,''
Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   La Paene Masara of Indonesia counter-punched his way to a 10-5
win over Ivan Calderon of Puerto Rico in the final 106-pound bout
on the day card.
</P>
<P>
   A third Latin fighter also advanced when Patrick Lopez, a Pan
American Games bronze medalist, trounced Norman Schuster of Germany
24-10 at 132 pounds. Lopez, of Venezuela, forced Schuster to take a
standing 8-count in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   In the first fight of the day, Kim Un-Chol, the only North
Korean in the boxing competition, stopped Sebusiso Keketsi of
Lesotho in the third round on the 15-point rule (17-2).
</P>
<P>
   Alexandr Maletin of Russia, a world champion in 1997, was too
experienced for Makhach Nuriddinov of Azerbaijan, winning 14-5 at
132 pounds.

Gore Courts Black Support
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton at his side, Al Gore summoned the
black community to vote by the millions in November to help extend the
Democratic grip on the White House. Gore also promised to work for full voting
rights for the District of Columbia, which has a majority black population but,
under the Constitution, no voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Referring
to the caucus by its three initials -- CBC -- Gore launched a long litany in the
style of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson in admonishing the CBC members to
vote and get out other blacks to vote Democratic in the November election.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, besieged by a bribery scandal
surrounding a top aide, announced in a nationwide television address Saturday
that he was calling new elections and that he would not be a candidate. Fujimori
also said he would deactivate the National Intelligence Service, whose powerful
head has been accused of offering bribes to an opposition congressman to support
the government. He did not announce a date for the new vote. The authoritarian
Fujimori was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term in voting that

Officials: No Sign of Philippine Hostages
</SUBHEAD>

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Military mortars pounded the camps of Muslim
rebels Sunday as thousands of troops continued their assault to free 19 foreign
and Filipino hostages, but there was still no sign of the captives, officials
said. ''They haven't been eyeballed,'' said presidential press secretary Ricardo
Puno. ''The rebels are clearly moving them from place to place.'' The military
imposed a news blackout after the surprise attack aimed at rescuing the hostages
held on remote Jolo island. Authorities launched the attack before dawn Saturday
following nearly five months of negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf rebels and the
reported payment of more than $15 million in ransom for other captives.

   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Flames leapt from tree to tree and shot high into the

prompting authorities to urge the evacuation of 200 mountain homes. A plume of
smoke hundreds of feet high was visible from Fort Collins, nearly 50 miles away.
Lt. Joe Gang, spokesman for the Boulder County Sheriff's Office, issued an
urgent plea for more help, saying the fewer than 200 firefighters struggling to

Sydney: Romanian Lifters Thrown Out

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Romanian weightlifting team was thrown out of
the Sydney Olympics after two lifters failed drug tests before the games, while
another nine Olympic athletes have recorded suspected positive tests.
International Olympic Committee director general Francois Carrard said Sunday
(Saturday night EDT) that the expulsion of the Romanian lifting team was ordered
by the International Weightlifting Federation. Under federation rules, any
nation is suspended from competition for the rest of that year if three or more
of its weightlifters test positive for banned drugs. A third Romanian
weightlifter tested positive earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Calls New Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, besieged by a
bribery scandal surrounding a top aide, announced Saturday that he
was calling new elections and that he would not be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the announcement on national television,
thousands of people gathered outside the presidential palace in
Lima, chanting anti-Fujimori slogans and demanding the
authoritarian president who has ruled this country since 1990 leave
office.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of Lima and cities in Peru's interior, caravans
of drivers waved Peruvian flags and honked their car horns late
into the night, celebrating the news.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Fujimori, smiling and looking at ease, did not
announce a date for the new elections, but said they were necessary
after the political uproar over a videotape allegedly showing his
intelligence chief bribing an opposition congressman to support the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said he would ''deactivate'' the National Intelligence
Service, headed by the feared Vladimiro Montesinos, a close
Fujimori adviser at the center of the bribery scandal. Fujimori did
not elaborate what steps he would take with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a profound reflection, and an objective evaluation of
the circumstances, I have made the decision, first, to deactivate
the system of national intelligence and, in second place, call in
the quickest time possible general elections,'' Fujimori said in
the eight-minute address.
</P>
<P>
   ''In these general elections, it's obvious he who is speaking
will not participate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term in
voting that ended with a second round in May. His opponent in the
runoff dropped out because of allegations of vote-fixing and
Fujimori's victory brought heavy criticism from the United States
and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   He had been working to repair his international reputation when
the video was released Thursday showing what appeared to be
Montesinos offering a wad of cash to opposition congressman Alberto
Kouri for his support of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal fueled calls for a new election by leaders of the
opposition, who since the election have accused Fujimori's
government of systematically offering opposition legislators cash
to join their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said that once the video was released, his position was
''to support a severe investigation to determine responsibilities
before the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This above all is a political development which obviously has
had a strong impact on the stability of my government and of the
country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Fujimori's announcement, the Organization of
American States issued a strongly worded demand that he suspend
Montesinos and other officials allegedly linked to the scandal,
warning that otherwise attempts at reconciliation with the
opposition would be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Montesinos has been accused of illicit
enrichment and engineering smear campaigns against Fujimori's
opponents in this year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   A leading opposition congressman, Henry Pease, questioned
whether Fujimori could carry out his promise and said that it could
be that Montesinos, long considered the power behind the
government, would stay and Fujimori go. Pease also expressed
concern over the lack of a timetable for elections.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Luis Solari, a supporter of Alejandro Toledo, who
pulled out of the May presidential runoff charging Fujimori with
planning to rig the results, praised Fujimori for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of anti-Fujimori protesters crowded around him in
the Plaza de Armas in front of the palace, Solari said, ''It's a
victory for the forgotten of Peru.''

<HEADLINE> US Gymnasts a World Away From Gold  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A slide off the balance beam, a step or
two off the mat and the U.S. women's gymnastics team knew one thing
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   They're not in Atlanta anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This is Australia -- the natives call it Oz -- a land half a world
away from home and even farther from the gold-medal success the
Americans enjoyed on their own turf in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. performances in the preliminary round of the Olympics
Sunday (Saturday night EDT) were far from awful. In fact, national
champion Elise Ray and two-time Olympian Amy Chow were the third-
and fourth-best gymnasts on the floor in the morning session.
</P>
<P>
   But those two got little help from their teammates and left the
SuperDome in trouble. As a team, it wasn't championship stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Team coordinator Bela Karolyi sensed it, sitting placidly in the
stands, knowing it would take more than one of his patented bear
hugs to set things right. Then again, maybe a little motivation
might have helped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, we had a lot of mistakes,'' Karolyi said. ''It's not
a real surprise. It's things we've seen before in practice and in
training. There were some strong efforts. We just have to sit down
and think about what it's going to take to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   That's only if they get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in the first session of the day, on the same floor
with the Australians, the United States finished second, a whopping
1.949 points behind China, which wasn't considered a prime medal
contender.
</P>
<P>
   The world powerhouses, Russia, Romania and Ukraine, weren't
competing until later, in an afternoon session in which scores tend
to inflate and the early birds almost always see their standings
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Team finals are Tuesday, and the United States had to wait an
agonizing 10 hours to learn whether it would qualify among the top
six. Canada and England went in the second session and neither
scored better than the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. women do qualify, the scores will be wiped clean and
they'll have a chance for a new start, something they could
desperately use after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The girls have worked out so well, they've warmed up well,''
coach Kelli Hill said. ''I don't have anything to blame it on. I
have no idea what happened. We're going to figure it out and make
sure it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering their struggles since Atlanta, the U.S. women
figured they'd be going for the bronze this year, and after their
first day's performance, that would probably be considered a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bronze is still wide open,'' Karolyi said, confirming that
third place is America's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Opening on the beam, traditionally its worst event, the team
stood in the corner with that deer-in-the-headlights look, watching
teammate Tasha Schwikert fidget nervously for about 5 minutes,
awaiting her cue from the judges.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old, last-minute replacement for injured Morgan
White scored a 9.237 and waited for the leaders to take over.
</P>
<P>
   They never did.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Dawes, in her third Olympics, fell off the beam.
</P>
<P>
   Later on the floor, Ray and Kristen Maloney each took huge steps
off the mat, costing precious tenths of points in a competition
where nothing can be spared.
</P>
<P>
   Ray left the floor holding her left shoulder, but she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said it didn't hurt after floor and she vaulted and did
bars beautifully,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   At the vault, it was Maloney's turn to get hurt. She landed on
her knees on her first jump, then walked back down the runway
crying and biting her lip. She stuck her second vault, a la Kerri
Strug in 1996, although the stakes weren't nearly as high.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurt pretty bad,'' Maloney said. ''I was scared because I
wasn't sure how it was going to feel to run down and vault again. I
just told myself I could do it and to relax.''	   Meanwhile, the home fans, who
spurred America to victory in
Atlanta, were cheering wildly for the Australians this time, even
though their gymnasts could barely clear the vault on the first
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Aussie Allana Slater's hands slipped as she pushed off the
vault. She just made it over, then used her hands to keep from
falling forward and landing on her head.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Walker followed with a pair of jumps in which she brushed
her head on the backside of the vault both times. She actually
stuck her landing after the first vault and got a rousing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fantastic, we could feel it all the way,'' Slater said.
''It's an amazing feeling to have the whole crowd behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   The unproven Australians stood in third after the second
session, 0.382 behind the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   If that form holds, there's a good chance the United States
won't face the same fate it did at last year's world championships,
when it finished sixth behind Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It was that humbling week in Beijing that brought Karolyi out of
retirement to turn this team around.
</P>
<P>
   The project has had its ups and downs. Last week's departure of
White and her coach, Mary Lee Tracy, combined with an ankle injury
to Jamie Dantzscher, didn't make things any easier.
</P>
<P>
   Dantzscher competed on the vault and floor and said the ankle
was feeling fine. Her scores -- a 9.325 on vault and 8.987 on floor
-- may have said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi said lineup changes would occur if the Americans made it
to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we have to think about them,'' he said. ''I don't want to
get into anybody's head right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, single out Chow as a surprising disappointment
for a quick hiccup on her uneven bars routine that earned a 9.4 and
dampened the Americans' strongest event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting here thinking, there's no explanation for
that,'' he said. ''It's the last thing I expected today -- besides
all the other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang Yun and Dong Fangxiao of China were the top two gymnasts
after two sessions, before the Russians and Romanians took the
floor.

<HEADLINE> Baseball: US 4, Japan 2, 13 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The United States blew a chance to beat
Japan's best pitcher, then rallied to win the longest game in
Olympic baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Neill's two-run homer in the bottom of the 13th inning gave
the United States a face-saving 4-2 victory in its tournament
opener Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The homer set off a high-fiving, back-slapping celebration at
home plate that was more of a relief than an outburst -- the United
States had thrown away a chance to win it with two outs in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Neill, a 30-year-old outfielder who has spent most of a
nondescript career in the minors, hit a full-count pitch for the
deciding homer off Toshiya Sugiuchi, an industrial league pitcher
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. players raised their arms in weary triumph and headed
for home. Manager Tom Lasorda pumped his left arm and yelled, ''All
right, yea! That's No. 1!''
</P>
<P>
   It could have been an emphatic No. 1, but a throwing error
turned it into an extra-inning game of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Heartthrob pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka lived up to his billing as
Japan's best by pitching 10 tough innings, but he needed a break to
save him from a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one out away from beating Matsuzaka when
third baseman Mike Kinkade threw away a tough-chance grounder in
the top of the ninth, letting in a run that tied it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were standing and chanting ''USA! USA!'' when Kinkade
charged Jun Heima's soft roller and threw past first, causing
thousands of Japanese fans to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, it was a tight match between two young starting
pitchers, and the United States surprisingly came out on the better
end of it.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuzaka, a high school champion who was Japan's major league
Rookie of the Year in 1999, allowed only two hits until a vagabond
minor leaguer got the United States rolling.
</P>
<P>
   John Cotton opened the seventh with a triple to the base of the
wall in right-center, sliding into third base headfirst. It was a
career moment for Cotton, 29, who has been let go six times and
traded twice in his minor league odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. players standing on the first step of the dugout
and screaming encouragement, Kinkade -- Mets fans will remember him
from 1998-99 -- lined a single to left for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Mientkiewicz followed with a single and Matsuzaka made a
big mistake, failing to look the runner back to third on Marcus
Jensen's comebacker, allowing Kinkade to dash home after Matsuzaka
threw to second for a forceout and a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's lineup of four major leaguers could hardly touch Ben
Sheets, Milwaukee's first-round draft pick last year. The
right-hander gave up only four hits in six shutout innings, getting
late swings with a fastball that topped out on the scoreboard at
153 -- that's kilometers per hour, or 95 mph.
</P>
<P>
   So Taguchi tripled off Shane Heams and scored on a groundout in
the eighth, cutting it to 2-1, and Japan tied it against Todd
Williams with the help of Kinkade's error -- the third by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A day after he dedicated an upcoming game against Cuba to the
exiles in Florida, Lasorda found himself locked in a first-inning
argument with an umpire from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his familiar No. 2, the Hall of Fame manager shuffled
onto the field to argue a ''safe'' call at first base that left the
bases loaded with two outs. The argument was mild by Lasorda
standards -- a little arm waving, over in less than a minute -- and
became moot when the next batter lined out to short.

<HEADLINE> US Team Chases Aussies in Three-Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australia is having little trouble
dominating equestrian at the Sydney Olympics, although the United
States got closer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The second day of the dressage phase of the team three-day event
saw Karen O'Connor of Middleburg, Va., boost the American position
to third place with a personal best of 32.6 on Prince Panache. It
was the third-lowest score of the two days of dressage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Timing is everything,'' she said. ''He's been training great
for the last three weeks, going from strength to strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies are traditionally weak in dressage and dominant in
the jumping phases, so they're in a strong position to add a Sydney
gold to the ones they won in Barcelona and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Australia takes 112.6 penalty points into the demanding
cross-country phase Monday, with stadium jumping to follow on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Tinney added 36.0 points on Jeepster for Australia, while
Andrew Hoy had a leading 30.6 on Darien Powers.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts are followed closely by Britain with 115.2 and the
United States with 125.4. Britain's Pippa Funnell had the
second-best score Sunday of 32.0 on Supreme Rock. The top three
scores from each team's four riders count for the total.
</P>
<P>
   Linden Wiesman of Bluemont, Va., was delighted with her score of
48.4 on Anderoo, which was added to David O'Connor's 44.4 on
Giltedge from Saturday. David and Karen O'Connor are married and
veterans of the silver-medal team in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hoped, maybe on a good day, we'd break 50,'' Wiesman said.
''It was amazing cantering into that ring.''

<HEADLINE> Volleyball: Netherlands 3, Cuba 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Towering blockers Martin van der Horst
and Bas van der Goor led the Netherlands to a surprisingly easy 3-0
victory over high-flying Cuba in the first round of Olympic men's
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch began their longshot quest to repeat as gold-medal
champions with a 25-23, 25-20, 25-23 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch aren't nearly as powerful as they were four years ago,
having barely qualified for the 12-team field. But their ball
control, and the net play of the 7-foot van der Horst and 6-10 van
der Goor, were too much for the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's graceful leapers are famous for playing some of the most
exciting volleyball in the world, but they're also known for their
mistakes. Two of the Netherlands' final three points came on Cuban
net violations.
</P>
<P>
   The first game was tied at 22 when the Dutch took control. An
ace by van der Goor made it 23-22, and after van der Horst and
Reinder Nummerdor stopped cold a spike from Cuba's 6-11 Osvaldo
Hernandez, van der Goor served out the set with another ace.
</P>
<P>
   The second game also was close, but the Netherlands pulled away
from a 20-19 lead by taking five of the next six points.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch hitter Richard Schuil had 18 kills in just 29 attempts.
Cuba's Angel Denis, a 6-4 player with a spectacular vertical leap,
had 12 kills in 30 tries.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The pile of bodies at midcourt looked
like the end of an NCAA tournament first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday (Saturday night EDT), players from Italy, not
Valparaiso, were jumping on each other, and it was the Olympics,
not March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Meneghin's 3-pointer with 25 seconds to play -- his only
points of the game -- gave Italy a 50-48 victory over Lithuania. The
celebration that followed capped a tense, possession-by-possession
game between the teams most consider the second and third best in
Group A behind the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first game is always the most important. That's why we're
so happy,'' said Italy's Carlton Myers, who had nine points in a
foul-plagued 22 minutes. ''It was very tense, close and ugly, but
at the end we won it and that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Meneghin, the son of Dino Meneghin who is considered the
greatest player in Italy's history and is an assistant coach, had
missed all six shots he had taken, including two 3-pointers in the
previous 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But he made the one that counted. And when Lithuania misfired on
two 3-point shots in the final 12 seconds, Italy won its first
Olympic game since 1984 when Dino Meneghin was the star of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came down to one shot and they made it and we didn't,''
said Lithuania's Mindaugas Timinskas, who played at Iona College.
</P>
<P>
   Timinskas' driving layup with 41 seconds left gave Lithuania a
48-47 lead and were his only points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe we scored 50 points. There were no easy
baskets,'' Italy coach Bogdan Tanjevic said. ''I didn't think we
played that well but we were fortunate and it was a game of good
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy finished with a better shooting percentage, 32.6
(15-for-46), as Lithuania managed a 13-for-50 effort (26 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ''The shooting hurt us but maybe it was also the Italian
defense,'' Lithuania coach Jonas Kazlauskas said.
</P>
<P>
France 76, New Zealand 50
</P>
<P>
   France, making its first appearance in men's Olympic basketball
since 1984, used its speed advantage to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Yann Bonato and Cyril Julian each had had eight points in a 26-4
run that gave France a 35-19 lead with 2:32 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   France held New Zealand to one field goal over that stretch as
it overcame a six-point deficit and went on to a 38-23 lead. France
then scored the first nine points of the second half and the rout
was on.
</P>
<P>
   Bonato finished with 16 points for France, which hadn't been in
the basketball competition for 24 years before competing in Los
Angeles and finishing 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Marks, who played at the University of California and for
the NBA's Toronto Raptors, had 12 points to lead New Zealand, which
was making its first appearance in the basketball competition.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia 66, Russia 60
</P>
<P>
   Zeljko Rebraca scored 18 points and fellow center Dejean
Tomasevic added 13 as Yugoslavia took advantage of Russian center
Sergei Panov's foul trouble in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's last lead was 36-34 with 15:48 to play and that's when
Panov went to the bench with his third foul. Rebraca and Tomasevic
then combined for 10 points in a 12-2 run that gave Yugoslavia the
lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Panov, who finished with 13 points, fouled out with 5:08 to play
and Russia trailing 58-48 and it never got closer than six points
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Danilovic, who played for the Miami Heat, added 14
points Yugoslavia, which won the silver medal in the 1996 games and
has won a medal in the last five Olympics in which it has competed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can play much, much, much better than we did today and we
will show that,'' Danilovic said.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Gymnast Takes Scary Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Hungary's only Olympic female gymnast
fell off the uneven bars and landed on the mat in a crumpled heap,
sending a scare throughout the SuperDome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienn Nyeste was shaken by the fall, but otherwise uninjured,
according to Dr. Eva Martos, the team doctor, who said the gymnast
would be examined again later. Nyeste skipped her last event.
</P>
<P>
   Nyeste, who lists the bars as her favorite event, was getting
ready to do her dismount during the preliminary competition. After
a couple of full-body swings to build momentum, she put her feet on
the bars so she could launch herself into the air.
</P>
<P>
   But her fingers slipped and, with her body already below the
higher bar, she went hurtling face-first toward the ground. She
broke her fall with her knees, but her chest and head still slammed
into a solid mat that is beyond the softer landing area. The crowd
gasped as she hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Nyeste lay still for several minutes, her arms at awkward
angles. Her coach and trainers rushed onto the floor, and she
finally sat up a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded and she gave a weak wave.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Olympic Medalist Withdraws  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An emotional and solemn Frankie
Fredericks, Namibia's only Olympic medalist, withdrew from the
Sydney Games Sunday with an Achilles' tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the toughest days of my life,'' said the
32-year-old Fredericks, the silver medalist in the 100 and 200
meters at the 1992 Barcelona Games and the 1996 Atlanta Games. ''I
thought this would be my time to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't an easy decision to make ... it was very difficult.
I wish someone would have made it for me. I'm very sad I can't take
part, but for my health it's best not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Having declared himself out of the games, Fredericks tipped
world record-holder and two-time world champion Maurice Greene to
win the 100-meter gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the man to beat,'' Fredericks said. ''I can't see anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks said the pain in his tendon began in December during
heavy training. His doctors advised resting for two months, but
when the pain didn't disappear, Fredericks had a successful
operation in February.
</P>
<P>
   The pain returned in May, and Fredericks rested again.
</P>
<P>
   He tried competing for the first time this year Sept. 3 at
Rieti, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Warming up, there was a lot of pain,'' he said. ''I couldn't
do the warmup I was used to, but I thought I could run a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, running 20.79 seconds for the 200, much slower than
his career-best of 19.68 in finishing second to Michael Johnson at
the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks said he has no difficulty walking with the injury,
''but jogging and running are hard and warming up is the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his poor performance at Rieti, where the injury
worsened, Fredericks went to Yokohama, Japan, in hopes of competing
Sept. 9. He couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he came to Sydney, still hoping to compete in the
games. After much treatment and consultation with doctors, he
decided to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could take injections and run,'' Fredericks said, ''but I
thought I would do well by waiting until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't going to run 20.5 or 20.3 just to say I've run in the
Olympics. They could not guarantee there would be no risk. I'm not
willing to take that risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors are optimistic that I can run well next year. I've
had eight or nine good years. Hopefully I'll be on top again next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks was the first to win an Olympic medal for his little
country, taking the 200 world title in 1993. He also was the 200
world silver medalist in 1991, 1995 and 1997. He withdrew from the
semifinals of the 100 and then from the final of the 200 at the
1999 world championships with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he ended Johnson's two-year unbeaten streak in the 200,
running 19.96 at Oslo. That victory, shortly before the Olympics,
stamped him as the favorite at the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Atlanta, I had a taste of being the favorite,'' Fredericks
said, ''but Michael ... ran 19.32. I didn't expect that. It
probably was a mistake to beat him before the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks also thought he should have won the Olympic 100.
Before the games, he had the two-fastest times in the world, 9.86
and 9.87, and in the heats, he ran 9.93
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Donovan Bailey won the gold with a world-record 9.84.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not taking anything away from Donovan ... but I was
disappointed in running 9.89,'' Fredericks said. ''If we didn't
have so many false starts, who knows what would have happened. And
if Linford (Britain's Linford Christie, the 1992 gold medalist)
didn't get kicked out ... When your best friend and training
partner gets kicked out ... I felt I could have run faster than
9.86.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie was disqualified for two false starts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Fredericks also ran nine sub-20 second 200 times, a
season's record, and had a record nine legal sub-10.00 100 times in
1997. He also ended last year with a career 26 sub-10.00 times in
the 100, another record.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks was able to compete internationally once Namibia
gained independence in 1990 and the International Amateur Athletic
Federation approved the country as a member in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Seles, Davenport at Olympic Village  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The athletes' village at the Sydney
Games had two new residents Sunday with lots of tennis rackets and
12 Grand Slam titles between them.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport, the defending Olympic women's singles
champion, and Monica Seles, the four-time Australian Open winner,
are rooming together at the village after checking out of a Sydney
hotel on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee said the tennis stars wanted to savor
the ''Olympic experience'' by living with more than 6,000 other
athletes in the compound of apartments just across the street from
Olympic Park, where the tennis tournament will be held beginning
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are like kids at camp,'' said Sandy Baldwin, a USOC vice
president and mission chief for the U.S. team in the village.
</P>
<P>
   Because the village is crowded with a record number of athletes,
Baldwin had to move, too, to make room for the new residents. She
left her apartment, where she was living solo, to share space with
three other U.S. team administrators.

   STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Five people killed when a

<HEADLINE> Aussie Shooter Wins Olympic Gold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Peter Diamond cried Sunday. But it
wasn't simply because he had just won his second consecutive
Olympic gold medal in trap shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was for Dad,'' Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian athlete's father, Con Diamond, also a shooter,
died earlier this year when Peter was returning from a World Cup
event in Europe. His father had financed his career and was a major
influence in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking of my father, wishing he could have been
here,'' Diamond said Sunday. ''I didn't know how I'd go without him
behind me at such a big event, my first major event without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond ended with a score of 147 and was 25-for-25 in the
final. He also had a perfect score in the qualifying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Peel of Britain was second with 142, followed by Giovanni
Pellielo of Italy with 140.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Bade of Vancouver, Wash., who won the bronze medal in
Atlanta, failed to recover from a poor first day and finished in a
tie for 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's good friend Mark Russell was expected to challenge for
the medal, but failed to make the final. Russell was the gold
medalist in the men's double trap at Atlanta and is among the
favorites in that event later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was just 22nd after the first day. Although he rallied
to 13th on the second day, he did not qualify for the six-man
final.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 10-meter air pistol completed earlier in the day,
Tao Luna of China started strong with an Olympic mark in qualifying
and went on to take the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Tao tied the Olympic mark with a qualifying score of 390 and won
with 488.2 points. Jasna Sekavic of Yugoslavia won the silver with
486.5 points and Annemarie Forder of Australia scored 484 to take
the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Aspandiyarova of Kazakstan was a surprise qualifier,
shooting a perfect 100 in the third round to secure third place for
the final. She finished sixth with 483.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   World finals record-holder Ren Jie of China failed to make the
finals, as did World Cup winner Lolita Evglevskaya of Belarus.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, besieged by a bribery scandal
surrounding a top aide, announced in a nationwide television address Saturday

also said he would deactivate the National Intelligence Service, whose powerful
head has been accused of offering bribes to an opposition congressman to support
the government. He did not announce a date for the new vote. The authoritarian
Fujimori was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term in voting that

Officials: No Sign of Philippine Hostages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Military mortars pounded the camps of Muslim
rebels Sunday as thousands of troops continued their assault to free 19 foreign
and Filipino hostages, but there was still no sign of the captives, officials
said. ''They haven't been eyeballed,'' said presidential press secretary Ricardo
Puno. ''The rebels are clearly moving them from place to place.'' The military
imposed a news blackout after the surprise attack aimed at rescuing the hostages
held on remote Jolo island. Authorities launched the attack before dawn Saturday
following nearly five months of negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf rebels and the
reported payment of more than $15 million in ransom for other captives.

Fire Prompts Evacuations in Colo.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Flames leapt from tree to tree and shot high into the
air Saturday as a wildfire raged through more than 600 acres west of the city,
prompting authorities to urge the evacuation of 200 mountain homes. A plume of
smoke hundreds of feet high was visible from Fort Collins, nearly 50 miles away.
Lt. Joe Gang, spokesman for the Boulder County Sheriff's Office, issued an
urgent plea for more help, saying the fewer than 200 firefighters struggling to
extinguish the blaze had been slowed by the area's rough terrain.

Hurricane Gordon Bears Down on Fla.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Heavy rain began falling along the Gulf Coast today as
Hurricane Gordon bore down on central Florida. The storm had deluged Cuba with
up to 10 inches of rain before reaching hurricane strength with 75 mph winds
today. Gordon was expected to strike land between Fort Myers and the Panhandle
sometime late tomorrow. But its unpredictability and direction changes left
forecasters urging all coastal areas from Florida to Alabama to closely monitor
its progress.

Clinton Presses Nursing Home Funds
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed spending $1 billion to remedy
what he said is inadequate staffing at nursing homes, the ''number one culprit''
leading to neglect for too many older Americans. The Republican-controlled
Congress, which expects to consider health care this fall, ''will try to find
fair middle ground'' on a variety of issues, said John Czwartacki, spokesman for
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Clinton, speaking before about 100
residents and employees at the nursing home, said he believes Congress could act
this year on his five-year plan to increase nursing home staffing levels and
raise the quality of care.

Sydney: Romanian Lifters Thrown Out
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Romanian weightlifting team was thrown out of
the Sydney Olympics after two lifters failed drug tests before the games, while
another nine Olympic athletes have recorded suspected positive tests. Under
federation rules, any nation is suspended from competition for the rest of that
year if three or more of its weightlifters test positive for banned drugs. A
third Romanian weightlifter tested positive earlier this year.

Hungarian Gymnast Takes Scary Fall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Hungary's only Olympic female gymnast sent a chill
through the SuperDome on Sunday when she fell off the uneven bars in a crash
that left her in a crumpled heap on the mat. Adrienn Nyeste appeared to be OK
after being checked by trainers. Nyeste, who lists the bars as her favorite
event, was getting ready to do her dismount during the preliminary competition.
After a couple of full-body swings to build momentum, she put her feet on the
bars so she could launch herself into the air.

<HEADLINE> Beach Volleyball: Canada Beats U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Americans Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong
lost a five-point lead and failed to convert a half-dozen match
points Sunday, losing 17-15 to Canadians Jody Holden and Conrad
Leinemann in Olympic men's beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   The loss by Heidger and Wong on the first day of the men's
competition Sunday followed victories by both U.S. women's teams in
their opening matches the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The other U.S. men's team of Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana
was playing later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong started strongly, jumping to leads of 5-1 and
7-3 before Canada, on strong serving by Holden and Leinemann that
included two aces on the back line, scored six straight points for
a 9-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   American supporters started a ''USA'' chant, and Heidger and
Wong came back with five points of their own for a 12-9 lead after
35 minutes of play that had the sellout afternoon crowd roaring.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger then scored points on successive blocks of Leinemann to
make it 14-9 before the Canadians mounted their own comeback, with
Holden firing serves in excess of 50 mph to set up two straight
kills by Leinemann off the U.S. returns.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Leinemann's turn, serving for two more points to
make it 14-13. Heidger and Wong called time out as the crowd full
of flags and costumed spectators danced and chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Holden's fault tied it 14-14, but Heidger then blocked Leinemann
for a one-point U.S. lead before Wong put the next serve. The
Canadians, with the serve back, scored for 15-15.
</P>
<P>
   Leinemann provided defensive heroics late, running down balls to
keep rallies going and then lobbing a deep kill to give Canada the
lead at 16-15. His block of Heidger ended the game that lasted more
than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians hugged each other as the audience cheered the most
entertaining match so far.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Juan Ibarra and Joel Sotelo of Mexico pulled off the
first major upset by outlasting the top-seeded Australians Julien
Prosser and Lee Zahner, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the first in four matches for the Mexican pair
over Prosser and Zahner, and advanced the last-seeded team into the
final 16 of the men's competition, while sending Prosser and Zahner
to the loser's bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarra provided strong defense, constantly digging out kill
attempts by the Australians and setting up Sotelo for lobs and
smashes that kept the top seeds off balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans trailed only twice, at 3-2 and 12-11, and scored
the final four points, with Ibarra's dig of a smash by Zahner
ricocheting back off the top of the net and falling between the
Australians to finish the match.
</P>
<P>
   That set off a celebration for the Mexicans and a small,
flag-waving contingent of their fans, while Prosser and Zahner
slumped in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't good, that's all I know,'' Zahner said. ''It's going
to take a few hours to get over it. Right now it's pretty
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   In other morning matches, the fourth-seeded Swiss brothers Paul
and Martin Laciga held on for a 15-13 victory over the Czech duo of
Michal Palinek and Martin Lebl, and fifth-seeded Eduardo Esteban
Martinez and Martin Conde of Argentina defeated the Italian team of
Andrea Raffaelli and Maurizio Pimponi, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
   Defending bronze medalists John Child and Mark Heese of Canada,
the sixth seeds, cruised to a 15-5 triumph over the 19th-ranked
French duo of Jean Philippe Jodard and Christian Penigaud.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Sergey Ermishin and Mikhail Kouchnerev beat Mariano
Baracetti and Jose Salema of Argentina, 15-4, and Luis Maia and
Joao Brenha of Portugal topped Jan Kvalheim and Bjorn Maaseide of
Norway 15-10.
</P>
<P>
   In a mild upset, Jorg Ahmann and Axel Hager of Germany beat
10th-seeded Javier Bosma and Fabio Diez of Spain 15-13, and
Norway's Joerre Kjemperud and Vegard Hoidalen won over Nikolas
Berger and Oliver Stamm of Austria by 15-6.
</P>
<P>
   The winners advance to the final 16 and get four days off while
the losers enter elimination play to try to remain in contention
for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Laciga leveled the first complaint about the Bondi Beach
court, which had been widely praised by players as a top quality
facility on the picturesque beach. The sand in the stadium was
deeper than on the practice courts and required getting used to,
Laciga said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You practice on the side courts and then you go to the center
court and it's different,'' he said. ''No one told you about it and
that's not right.''

<HEADLINE> Dragneva Wins Gold in Weightlifting  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Tara Nott, who tried two other sports
before settling on weightlifting only four years ago, won a
surprise silver medal for the United States as women's
weightlifting made its Olympic debut Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nott, never higher than ninth in the world championships, placed
second to gold medalist Izabela Dragneva of Bulgaria at 106 pounds.
Raema Lisa Rumbewas of Indonesia took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Dragneva had the best lifts in both the snatch (187&AMP;frac14; pounds) and
the clean and jerk (231&AMP;frac14; pounds) to finish with a total lift of
418&AMP;frac34; pounds. Nott's total was 407&AMP;frac34; pounds, 181&AMP;frac34; pounds in
the
snatch and 225&AMP;frac34; pounds in the clean and jerk.
</P>
<P>
   Rumbewas, who missed a final lift of 236&AMP;frac34; pounds that would have
moved her past Nott, also had a total of 407&AMP;frac34; pounds, but was
placed lower because she weighed slightly more than Nott.
</P>
<P>
   Nott also missed her final lift in the clean and jerk, at 231&AMP;frac14;
pounds, but it would not have been enough to overtake Dragneva,
normally the No. 2 lifter on Bulgaria's team.
</P>
<P>
   Nott got a big break when Donka Mincheva, the reigning world
champion and world record holder from Bulgeria, bombed out by
missing all three lifts in the snatch. A lifter must make at least
one successful lift in the snatch, raising the bar above the head
in one fluid motion, before advancing to the clean and jerk, where
the bar is raised to the collarbone and then overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Mincheva, who had an appendectomy about a month ago, did not
look strong or especially confident and didn't come close on three
lifts, two at 176&AMP;frac14; pounds and one at 181&AMP;frac34; pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It took Nott several years to do so, but she finally settled
into weightlifting after first trying gymnastics and soccer. Now
28, she is the only athlete to have trained at the U.S. Olympic
Training Center in Colorado Springs in three sports.
</P>
<P>
   After playing on the U.S. under-21 and under-23 soccer teams,
she landed a desk job at the Atlanta Games helping soccer players.
There, she met several weightlifting coaches who, noticing her
strength and compact size, encouraged her to switch sports.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, the Colorado College graduate who grew up
in Stilwell, Kansas, trying to outdo her three male cousins in
virtually every sport, was a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   She has won national titles in the lowest weight class every
year since except 1998, when an injury contributed to a bronze
finish. She was the only female lifter to make all six of her lifts
in the U.S. Olympic trials in suburban New Orleans in July.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Goad, considered the grand dame of American women's
weightlifting after 18 years in the sport, couldn't match her U.S.
trials lift of 176&AMP;frac14; pounds in the snatch. She missed two of three
lifts, converting only at 170&AMP;frac34; pounds, and wound up with a total
lift of 391&AMP;frac14; pounds for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Goad was pregnant upon learning in 1996 that women's
weightlifting would be an Olympic sport in 2000. After giving birth
to a daughter that she and weight-lifting husband Dean Goad named
Sydney, she immediately came out of retirement and resumed
training.

<HEADLINE> New York Mayor Marches in Parade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after undergoing major treatment for
prostate cancer, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Saturday marched two
dozen blocks in a Manhattan parade.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor appeared to be operating at full force, stepping off
at noon in the German-American Steuben Parade up Fifth Avenue.
Wearing a cap inscribed ''Mount Sinai'' -- the hospital where he
underwent the procedure Friday -- Giuliani said the doctors ''did it
in such a skillful way that I'm able to march.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the parade, Senate candidate Rep. Rick Lazio and
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner greeted Giuliani with hugs.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor proceeded up Fifth with Lazio and Steinbrenner,
followed by Judith Nathan, a woman Giuliani has called his ''very
good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   At the parade's end, the mayor held a news conference -- as he
had done Friday, barely five hours after radioactive seeds were
implanted in his cancerous prostate. His doctors said Friday the
treatment went ''perfectly'' and called the mayor's prognosis
''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's parade, Giuliani dove into the crowd on the
sidewalk, shaking hands and chatting before ducking into a
drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   Then, accompanied by a handful of people, including Nathan, he
walked toward Gracie Mansion, greeting surprised passersby.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- On a day when the U.S. baseball team
made its Sydney debut with a victory, the Olympic news was captured
in a linescore: No hits, a stirring run, and the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   The no-hitter belonged to U.S. softball pitcher Lori Harrigan,
whose near-perfect game Sunday (Saturday night EDT) led the
Americans past Canada 6-0 as her team opened its defense of the
1996 gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The run came from Canadian Simon Whitfield, who capped a
grueling men's triathlon by sprinting to victory in the final 200
meters outside Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   And the end of era was marked by the passing of IOC head Juan
Antonio Samaranch's wife, who stood beside him during his 20-year
reign atop the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Olympic men's triathlon, Whitfield survived a crash
during the bike race, then summoned his energy for a medal-winning
burst. Whitfield blew past silver medalist Stephan Vuckovic of
Germany for the victory; the bronze went to Jan Rehula of the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SOFTBALL: Harrigan, who celebrated her 30th birthday earlier
this month, blew away the Canadians to hurl the first solo
no-hitter in Olympic history. Dot Richardson, Crystl Bustos and
Jennifer Brundage all homered for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan was a first-inning error away from a perfect game.
After the mistake, she retired 20 consecutive batters for the
dominating American team.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has won 111 consecutive games dating to the
1998 world championships, going 60-0 and allowing just four runs on
its Olympic preparation tour.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BASEBALL: Mike Neill's no-doubt-about-it, two-run homer in the
bottom of the 13th inning gave the Americans to a 4-2 victory over
Japan in the longest Olympic baseball game. The blast by the
obscure Olympian came four innings after a U.S. error in the ninth
allowed Japan to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''All right, yea!'' shouted U.S. manager Tom Lasorda. ''That's
No. 1!''
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending gold medalists, Cuba, pounded 18 hits in
a 16-0 no-hit victory over South Africa. The game was stopped after
seven innings due to the mercy rule.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SAMARANCH: The flag in Sydney's Olympic Stadium will fly at
half-staff for a day after the death of Samaranch's wife. Maria
Teresa Salisachs-Rowe, 67 and reportedly suffering from cancer,
died Saturday in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   A Mass is scheduled Monday in Sydney for Olympic officials and
others. It was unclear if IOC head Samaranch, presiding over his
last games, would return to Sydney after a service for his wife in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WEIGHTLIFTING: American Tara Nott, who tried two other sports
before settling on weightlifting four years ago, won a surprise
silver medal in the Olympic debut of women's weightlifting. The
106-pound Nott placed second to gold medalist Izabela Dragneva of
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian weightlifting team was kicked out of the Sydney
Games after two members failed pre-Olympic drug tests, giving the
team three positives in a single year. International Weightlifting
Federation rules require a suspension for any nation with three bad
drug tests; another Romanian had failed a test earlier in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SWIMMING: After picking up two gold medals in his Olympic
debut, Australia's Ian Thorpe picked up where he left off by
setting an Olympic best Sunday (Saturday night EDT) in the
200-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   A relaxed Thorpe, who already holds the world record in the
event, qualified for the semifinals later Sunday; the finals were
scheduled for Monday (Sunday night EDT). Three-time U.S. gold
medalist Josh Davis placed fourth, the highest American finish.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, the 17-year-old began his Olympic career with two
gold medals while U.S veteran Jenny Thompson earned one in showing
that swimming's old guard could keep pace with its new wave.
</P>
<P>
   Five world records were set in the pool Saturday -- when only
four finals were held.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, in her third Olympics, captured her sixth gold medal
Saturday -- the most ever by a U.S. woman athlete. Before anchoring
the winning 400-meter freestyle relay, she had shared the honor
with skater Bonnie Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched around Thompson's record-setting effort were two gold
medals for Thorpe, the 17-year-old Australian superswimmer. Thorpe,
after breaking his own world record to win the 400-meter freestyle,
anchored the Australian 400-meter freestyle relay to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was part of a veteran squad that captured the first
swimming gold for the Americans. She ripped off her cap and goggles
and received pats on the head from teammates Amy Van Dyken, Dara
Torres and Courtney Shealy.
</P>
<P>
   The relay tied Thompson, who has never won an individual gold
medal, with Kristin Otto of Germany for most golds by a female
swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: Credit veterans Sheryl Swoopes and Lisa
Leslie with helping keep the defending gold medalist U.S. women's
basketball team from losing its opener. With Swoopes scoring 29
points and Leslie adding 24 and 11 rebounds, the Americans
struggled past South Korea, 89-75.
</P>
<P>
   The women played without sometime starter Chamique Holdsclaw,
who was diagnosed with the beginning of a stress fracture in her
right foot. The WNBA All-Star will miss at least five games.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S SOCCER: For the second time in as many games, the U.S.
soccer team was fit to be tied. After a 2-2 deadlock with the Czech
Republic in their opener, the men came back Saturday for a 1-1 tie
with Cameroon in a game where they missed several chances to take
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. goal was scored by Pete Vagenas on a second-half
penalty kick. The Americans will need a win in their third and
final preliminary game to advance into the second round for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S GYMNASTICS: A gutsy effort by veteran John
Roethlisberger helped vault the Americans into Monday's finals. The
U.S. finished fourth, and the top six teams made the final round.
Defending gold medalist Russia finished on top.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: Make it three straight wins for the U.S. boxers. David
Jackson, fighting at 132 pounds, pounded out a 19-7 victory over
Naoufel Ben Rabah. It was a particularly satisfying victory for
Jackson, who returned to the sport this year after two years off.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- CYCLING: It was just the wrong season for Chris Witty, who
failed in her bid to become the fourth person to win medals at the
Summer and Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The American speedskater, who won a pair of medals in 1998 at
Nagano, did not fare as well in her cycling bid in Sydney. Despite
a personal best, she finished fifth in the women's 500-meter time
trial as world champion Felicia Ballanger of France won the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: The United States, led by 19-year-old
Logan Tom, upset China 3-1 in a first-round women's match. The
Americans recovered from a slow start to win 19-25, 25-21, 25-12
and 26-24.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WATER POLO: At age 39, Maureen O'Toole was the oldest women on
the U.S. water polo team. But the veteran was feeling just like a
kid after scoring the go-ahead goal in the Americans' 6-4 victory
over World Cup champ Netherlands as women's water polo made its
Olympic bow.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops Pursue Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- The military pounded the camps of
Muslim rebels with mortars Sunday and thousands of troops continued
their assault to free 19 foreign and Filipino hostages, but found
no sign of the captives, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential press secretary Ricardo Puno said on the second day
of the offensive that troops had not seen the hostages, who include
an American. ''The rebels are clearly moving them from place to
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had no evidence that any hostages had been
killed. ''As far as our assessment is concerned, they are all
believed to be alive,'' Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   The military imposed a news blackout after launching the
pre-dawn attack Saturday aimed at rescuing the hostages, including
six foreigners, held by the Abu Sayyaf rebels on remote Jolo
island.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada flew Sunday to Zamboanga city, near
Jolo, to be briefed on the fighting and broadcast a radio message
to encourage the troops.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang called a government
emissary after the attack began Saturday and asked for a
cease-fire, but did not offer to release the hostages, chief
government negotiator Robert Aventajado said. He added that the
chances of the request being accepted by the government were
''almost nil.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said clashes were continuing Sunday and that the
military had overrun two rebel camps, including the area where two
French journalists had been held, but found no hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said mortars were relentlessly pounding rebel
positions in the hills of Jolo. In neighboring Malaysia, Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was quoted by the New Sunday
Times newspaper saying patrols had been stepped up to prevent Abu
Sayyaf rebels from fleeing into Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
   One woman died and four other civilians were being treated at a
Jolo hospital. They said they were in a group of about 10 people
strafed by the military because one was wearing camouflage
clothing. Other injured civilians were unable to pass through tight
military blockades to reach the hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Four government soldiers were wounded in the fighting, Mercado
said.
</P>
<P>
   Puno said four bodies of rebels were recovered and 18 guerrillas
had been taken captive.
</P>
<P>
   Various Abu Sayyaf factions are holding an American Muslim, two
French journalists, three Malaysians, a Filipino captured in April
and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Before they began their kidnapping spree in March, the heavily
armed Abu Sayyaf had fewer than 200 members. That ballooned to more
than 3,000 as large ransoms reportedly paid by Libya and Malaysia
for the release of other hostages attracted many new recruits on
impoverished Jolo, the military says.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada announced Saturday that he decided to order the assault
after the rebels, who claim to be fighting for an independent
Islamic state, seized the Malaysian hostages on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany and Malaysia expressed concern that the attack
could endanger the lives of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it did not believe an unconfirmed report that
the American, Jeffrey Schilling of Oakland, Calif., was killed
during an escape attempt Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe he is still alive. There is a strong possibility he
is still alive,'' Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   The military also was attempting to verify unconfirmed reports
that the evangelists were executed by a rebel firing squad after
the military attack began, and that the French journalists had
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of these have not been confirmed, and no bodies (of
hostages) have been found,'' Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   At her Oakland apartment, Schilling's mother said she had no
word on her son. ''No news is good news, as far as I am
concerned,'' Carol Schilling told journalists, then broke down
crying.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had earlier threatened to attack southern Philippine
cities and behead Schilling if troops launched an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Support for a military assault has soared since the rebels
abducted three more people last week from a Malaysian diving resort
-- despite their earlier pledge not to seize more captives while
negotiations were underway.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping came just one day after the rebels released four
Europeans -- the last foreigners from a group of 21 people abducted
April 23 from another Malaysian resort.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac criticized the assault, saying
he was concerned it might put the French journalists in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But Puno insisted, ''This is a matter that the Philippines has
to decide on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Because after all, when the French leave, we will be left with
the problem here in our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the remaining hostages had been suspended
because of rising tensions among Abu Sayyaf factions over the
division of ransom money from the release of earlier hostages.
Negotiators say more than dlrs 15 million in ransom has been paid,
about dlrs 10 million of it by Libya for 10 Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   Critics had warned that large ransom payments would encourage
new waves of kidnappings in the troubled southern Philippines, home
of the country's Muslim minority.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Paper Denounces Opposition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Myanmar's democratic opposition party
should be eliminated before its leader Aung San Suu Kyi becomes
more daring and causes more suffering to the nation, an editorial
in an official newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions in the official press reflect those of the military
government in Myanmar, and the commentary underscored rising
tensions between the regime and its political opponents, amid
rumors the government plans to close the party down by the year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy held its
first meeting since a two-week crackdown against the party, and
declared it would draft a national constitution in defiance of the
military government.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is almost no political party in Myanmar history which is
as mean and evil as the NLD'' and Suu Kyi, said an editorial in the
Myanma Ahlin newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has tolerated the NLD for so many years but it
is time the party be completely eliminated,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary was written by Hla Soe, a disaffected former NLD
member. He was elected as a parliamentary representative for the
party in 1990 general elections that were swept by the NLD, which
was never allowed to take power.
</P>
<P>
   Nine party leaders including Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize for her peaceful struggle for democracy in Myanmar --
also known as Burma -- were confined to their homes for two weeks in
late August after Suu Kyi tried to travel outside Yangon on party
work.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sept. 1, Suu Kyi was forcibly brought back to the
capital Yangon after a nine-day stand-off in which she and other
party members camped by their vehicles after authorities prevented
them from traveling to the provinces to do party work.
</P>
<P>
   Yangon's crackdown drew vehement international criticism, mainly
from the United States and Britain, which accused the regime of
blatantly violating the Myanmar opposition leaders' political
rights. Myanmar accused both countries of meddling in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time the government takes care of the problem according
to the law,'' Hla Soe wrote. ''If the problem is taken lightly the
Americans, British and Daw Suu Kyi will become more daring and the
country will suffer more.''

<HEADLINE> Stanford 27, No. 5 Texas 24  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- DeRonnie Pitts cartwheeled into the end
zone after catching a 15-yard touchdown pass from backup
quarterback Chris Lewis with 1:12 to play as Stanford rallied to
beat No. 5 Texas 27-24 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford led 20-9 with 10 minutes left but allowed two touchdown
drives led by Texas quarterback Major Applewhite, who was
ineffective until the game's final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal then made a frantic four-play, 59-yard drive in
just 43 seconds. It ended when Pitts caught a short sideline pass,
broke Joe Walker's tackle at the 10, leaped for the goal line, was
flipped into the air by Roderick Babers and landed in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' final drive died when Brandon Healy dropped a fourth-down
pass from Applewhite with 33 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   With former Stanford golfer Tiger Woods cheering on the
sideline, Lewis led a dramatic comeback in place of starter Randy
Fasani, who injured his left knee when he was sacked by Maurice
Gordon just seven minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   After the Texas offense was stymied all evening by an inspired
Stanford defense, Applewhite hit B.J. Johnson for a 71-yard
touchdown strike with 9:29 to play. Applewhite then hit Victor Ike
over the middle for a 38-yard scoring play with 5:44 left to give
Texas a 24-20 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fasani appeared to injure his left knee when he was sacked.
Lewis immediately keyed a 77-yard touchdown drive for the
Cardinal's first points, throwing a 37-yard TD pass Luke Powell on
his second pass of the game and the fifth of his college career.
</P>
<P>
   Fasani, his knee in a brace, stood on the sideline on crutches
to cheer on Lewis, a freshman who holds the California high school
record for career TD passes. Lewis' previous college experience
consisted of three passes against Washington State two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was just 12-of-33, but he threw for 214 yards and three
touchdowns. Tight end Russell Stewart had three catches for 82
yards, and Pitts had three receptions for 62 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' 17-yard TD pass to Pitts gave Stanford a 13-9 lead at
halftime. A minute into the third quarter, the Cardinal scored
again when Emory Brock, the son of baseball great Lou Brock,
blocked Kris Stockton's punt, grabbed the loose ball and scored.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the game was a defensive battle, with both teams
combining for 23 frustrating punts. The Longhorns' frustration
showed in a hat-throwing tantrum by Texas coach Mack Brown after a
penalty in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The game bore no resemblance to Texas' 69-17 thrashing of
Stanford in Austin last season. Both Applewhite and backup Chris
Simms had trouble against a Stanford defense that looked nothing
like the lackluster unit that allowed lowly San Jose State to score
40 points last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns couldn't run -- Mitchell had just 52 yards on 19
carries -- and couldn't pass until the game's final minutes.
Applewhite was 18-for-40 and was intercepted twice, while Simms was
3-of-6 and played sparingly in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite started the game but gave way to Simms after two
ineffective series. Taking over after the Texas defense recorded a
safety, Simms capped the Longhorns' only scoring drive of the first
three quarters with a 38-yard pass to Roy Williams.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Appearance for Chelsea  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Australia (AP) -- Chelsea Clinton is a private citizen,
Donna Shalala is a U.S. Cabinet minister. Guess which one drew the
crowd?
</P>
<P>
   The president's daughter stepped out of her car and was quickly
surrounded by Australian children and their parents at an
appearance Sunday to promote a smoking prevention initiative aimed
at Australian girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a good time in Sydney,'' Chelsea said as she autographed
soccer balls and even a boy's green soccer jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the end of a press conference in this Melbourne
suburb, Chelsea did a first on her Olympics trip: she answered a
reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never smoked a cigarette in my life,'' she said when
asked if she had a smoking history.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, launched
the campaign along with Australian health minister Michael
Wooldridge and a member of the Australian women's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   The program is similar to one launched with the U.S. women's
soccer team four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased to be here as Australia joins the team -- helping
us to reach young girls from Melbourne to Milan to Milwaukee,''
Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Shalala's speech got upstaged by Chelsea. A young girl in a
blue dress, pacifier in her mouth, walked to Chelsea's chair during
the speech. Chelsea leaned forward and stroked the girl's blonde
hair as the cameras flashed.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea, Shalala and the rest of the U.S, government delegation
attended swimming events Saturday night in Sydney before flying to
Melbourne Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation was in Melbourne to watch the U.S.-China
women's soccer game that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Rushed to get to the game on time, Chelsea turned over her
autograph signing session to Australian soccer player Amy Taylor,
who signed the new posters coinciding with the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can teach the kids when they're young the do's and
don't's, they've got a better chance,'' Taylor said.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Calls New Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, under fire at home
and abroad over a bribery scandal, made a surprise announcement
Saturday that he would call new elections and that he would not be
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the announcement on national television,
thousands of people gathered outside the presidential palace in
Lima, chanting anti-Fujimori slogans and demanding that the
authoritarian president, who has ruled this country since 1990,
leave office.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of Lima and cities in Peru's interior, caravans
of drivers waved Peruvian flags and honked their car horns late
into the night, celebrating the news that the man dubbed ''The
Emperor'' for his tough governing style was stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Fujimori, smiling and looking at ease, did not
announce a date for the new elections. But he said the vote was
necessary after the political uproar over a videotape allegedly
showing his intelligence chief bribing an opposition congressman to
support the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite having been elected by a majority of the population, I
do not want to become a disturbing factor, and much less, an
obstacle to the strengthening of the democratic system,'' Fujimori
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would ''deactivate'' the National
Intelligence Service, headed by the feared Vladimiro Montesinos, a
close Fujimori adviser at the center of the bribery scandal.
Fujimori did not elaborate on what steps he would take with the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a profound reflection, and an objective evaluation of
the circumstances, I have made the decision, first, to deactivate
the system of national intelligence and, in second place, call in
the quickest time possible general elections,'' Fujimori said in
the eight-minute address.
</P>
<P>
   ''In these general elections,'' he said, pausing to take a deep
breath, ''it's obvious he who is speaking will not participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Congressman Carlos Ferrero said Fujimori was forced
to take the steps he did because the armed forces, especially the
army, withdrew their support for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Fujimori had continued to have the support of the armed
forces, he never would have said what he said tonight,'' Ferrero
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term in
voting that ended with a second round in May. His opponent in the
runoff dropped out because of allegations of vote-fixing and
Fujimori's victory brought heavy criticism from the United States
and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   He had been working to repair his international reputation when
the video was released Thursday showing what appeared to be
Montesinos offering a wad of cash to opposition congressman Alberto
Kouri for his support of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal fueled calls for a new election by opposition
leaders, who since this year's vote have accused Fujimori's
government of systematically bribing opposition legislators to join
its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said he supported ''a severe investigation to determine
responsibilities before the law.'' But he admitted the scandal
''had a strong impact on the stability of my government and of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the announcement, the opposition said they would
boycott reconciliation talks with the government unless Fujimori
acted. The Organization of American States added pressure with a
strongly worded demand Saturday that Fujimori suspend Montesinos
and other officials allegedly linked to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A leading opposition congressman, Henry Pease, questioned
whether Fujimori could carry out his promise and said that it could
be that Montesinos, long considered the power behind the
government, would stay and Fujimori go. Pease also expressed
concern over the lack of a timetable for elections.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Luis Solari, a supporter of Alejandro Toledo, who
pulled out of the May presidential runoff charging Fujimori with
planning to rig the results, praised Fujimori for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of anti-Fujimori protesters crowded around him in
the Plaza de Armas in front of the palace, Solari said, ''It's a
victory for the forgotten of Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori leaves behind a legacy of having successfully combatted
a bloody leftist insurgency that took 30,000 lives and taming
hyperinflation that reached nearly 8,000 percent his first year in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have governed Peru for the last 10 years. Not even my
detractors would fail to recognize fundamental achievements which I
will not enumerate. You know what they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that Peru -- my country and the place to which I have
devoted 10 years of intense work, seeking the maximum efficiency to
raise it from the ruins -- will not move backwards in terms of peace
and development.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops Pursue Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- The military pounded the camps of
Muslim rebels with mortars Sunday and thousands of troops continued
their assault to free 19 foreign and Filipino hostages, but found
no sign of the captives, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential press secretary Ricardo Puno said on the second day
of the offensive that troops had not seen the hostages, who include
an American. ''The rebels are clearly moving them from place to
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had no evidence that any hostages had been
killed. ''As far as our assessment is concerned, they are all
believed to be alive,'' Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   The military imposed a news blackout after launching the
pre-dawn attack Saturday aimed at rescuing the hostages, including
six foreigners, held by the Abu Sayyaf rebels on remote Jolo
island.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada flew Sunday to Zamboanga city, near
Jolo, to be briefed on the fighting and broadcast a radio message
to encourage the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are banking on you,'' he told Gen. Narciso Abaya, commander
of the army's 1st Infantry Division. Abaya replied that the assault
would be completed in three days to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada ordered the military to give top priority to the lives
of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang called a government
emissary after the attack began Saturday and asked for a
cease-fire, but did not offer to release the hostages, chief
government negotiator Robert Aventajado said. He added that the
chances of the request being accepted by the government were
''almost nil.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said clashes were continuing Sunday and that the
military had overrun two rebel camps, including the area where two
French journalists had been held, but found no hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said mortars were relentlessly pounding rebel
positions in the hills of Jolo. In neighboring Malaysia, Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was quoted by the New Sunday
Times newspaper saying patrols had been stepped up to prevent Abu
Sayyaf rebels from fleeing into Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
   One woman died and four other civilians were being treated at a
Jolo hospital. They said they were in a group of about 10 people
strafed by the military because one was wearing camouflage
clothing. Other injured civilians were unable to pass through tight
military blockades to reach the hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Angelo Reyes said six rebels were
killed and 20 captured. Four soldiers were wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are believed to have taken the journalists with them
when they fled, Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Various Abu Sayyaf factions are holding an American Muslim, two
French journalists, three Malaysians, a Filipino captured in April
and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Before they began their kidnapping spree in March, the heavily
armed Abu Sayyaf had fewer than 200 members. That ballooned to more
than 3,000 as large ransoms reportedly paid by Libya and Malaysia
for the release of other hostages attracted many new recruits on
impoverished Jolo, the military says.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada announced Saturday that he decided to order the assault
after the rebels, who claim to be fighting for an independent
Islamic state, seized the Malaysian hostages on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany and Malaysia expressed concern that the attack
could endanger the lives of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it did not believe an unconfirmed report that
the American, Jeffrey Schilling of Oakland, Calif., was killed
during an escape attempt Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe he is still alive. There is a strong possibility he
is still alive,'' Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   The military also was attempting to verify unconfirmed reports
that the evangelists were executed by a rebel firing squad after
the military attack began, and that the French journalists had
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of these have not been confirmed, and no bodies (of
hostages) have been found,'' Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   At her Oakland apartment, Schilling's mother said she had no
word on her son. ''No news is good news, as far as I am
concerned,'' Carol Schilling told journalists, then broke down
crying.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had earlier threatened to attack southern Philippine
cities and behead Schilling if troops launched an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Support for a military assault has soared since the rebels
abducted three more people last week from a Malaysian diving resort
-- despite their earlier pledge not to seize more captives while
negotiations were underway.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping came just one day after the rebels released four
Europeans -- the last foreigners from a group of 21 people abducted
April 23 from another Malaysian resort.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac criticized the assault, saying
he was concerned it might put the French journalists in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But Puno insisted, ''This is a matter that the Philippines has
to decide on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Because after all, when the French leave, we will be left with
the problem here in our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations for the remaining hostages had been suspended
because of rising tensions among Abu Sayyaf factions over the
division of ransom money from the release of earlier hostages.
Negotiators say more than dlrs 15 million in ransom has been paid,
about $10 million of it by Libya for 10 Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   Critics had warned that large ransom payments would encourage
new waves of kidnappings in the troubled southern Philippines, home
of the country's Muslim minority.

<HEADLINE> Battle Over Italian Author's Estate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A long-running battle over the estate of Giorgio
Bassani, author of ''The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,'' took
another ugly turn over the weekend when police raided his
companion's hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   They hauled off several carloads of paintings, manuscripts,
silver and other valuables, Italian newspapers reported Sunday.
They said the valuables were worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Bassani, renowned for his semi-autobiographical novel about
Italian Jews during the rise of Fascism, died in April at age 84.
He suffered from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   His later years were marked by bitter court battles between his
family, which tried to have him declared incompetent to manage his
financial affairs, and Bassani's longtime companion, Portia Prebys,
an American-born professor of comparative literature.
</P>
<P>
   Bassani was long separated from his wife, Valeria Sinigallia,
with whom he had two children.
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers said that police, acting on a complaint from
Bassani's wife and children, on Saturday raided the Hotel Tiziano
in central Rome where Prebys had been living since the writer's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Police confiscated valuables -- including paintings, silver,
jewelry and manuscripts -- which allegedly were from the Rome
apartment Prebys and Bassani had shared.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,'' first published in 1962,
was widely translated and made into an Academy Award-winning movie
by director Vittorio De Sica in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Backtracks  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A senior Palestinian negotiator has backtracked
on the willingness to discuss ceding some West Bank territory to
Israel, a major taboo broken during the U.S.-brokered Camp David
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
rejected Israel's demand that most of the Jewish settlers be
allowed to remain in the West Bank, under Israeli sovereignty,
concentrated in large blocs of settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''These blocs would mean continuation of the Israeli occupation
of Palestinian land,'' he told reporters in remarks broadcast on
Palestinian radio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia also rejected Israel's insistence on retaining a strip of
land in the Jordan Valley for up to 20 years, for reasons of
security.
</P>
<P>
   At the Camp David talks in July, the Palestinians became the
first Arab negotiators to discuss ceding territory. Palestinian
negotiators said they were ready to give up the land in exchange
for land in Israel proper. Israelis confirmed that, but said the
amount of Israeli land be only ''symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has also appeared to backtrack on some of the taboos it
broke at Camp David, including acknowledging the refugee crisis
created by its birth in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Palestinians say Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
failed to implement long-standing interim agreements to release
prisoners and hand over more territory.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remained divided on the future of Jerusalem, where
the Palestinians wish to establish their capital alongside that of
Israel. It was over Jerusalem that the Camp David summit broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia said Israel must recognize full Palestinian sovereignty
over all of east Jerusalem. ''After that Israeli interests can be
discussed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive issue is who will control the Al-Aqsa mosque
compound. It is the third holiest place in the Islamic world but it
is also sacred to Jews, because it is the site of the First and
Second Jewish temples.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Sunday that Israel
will never give up sovereignty over the site. ''The principle which
guides Israel is that we came to the site of the temple never to be
separated from it, and never to give up sovereignty there.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks have resumed, albeit at a low level. One round was held in
New York during the Millennium Summit, and another was due to be
launched in the region on Sunday evening, according to Voice of
Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reflection of the deadlock, about 50 Palestinian
school children aged 10-13, pelted Israeli troops and police with
stones and empty bottles Sunday at the Netzarim junction in the
Gaza Strip. The police responded with tear gas and rubber-coated
bullets. Five children and one Israeli border policeman were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Around 50 children tried to break into the nearby Jewish
settlement of Netzarim but were driven back by Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was attributed to the stalemate in the peace
negotiations but also to the anniversary of the 1982 massacre of
Palestinians by Israel's Christian allies at the Sabra and Shatila
refugee camps in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army retaliated by closing the two crossing points
from the Gaza Strip into Israel to Palestinian trucks.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Blair in Slump After Protests  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair's summertime slump may
be turning into an autumn of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   New polls in two British newspapers suggested his Labor Party's
approval rating has dropped to the level of the opposition
Conservatives for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on the survey results, Conservative leader William Hague
told Britain's GMTV on Sunday that Blair's government was ''paying
the price for arrogance and complacency and broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Top government officials, though, suggested the show of
disapproval was probably temporary. Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon
called it a ''short-term knock in the opinion polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be much more interested in the polls in a month's
time,'' he told GMTV. ''If the polls are still as bad as that then,
we will clearly have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in popularity for Blair's party follows a week of fuel
protests that dried up gasoline pumps across Britain, disrupting
schools, transport and business. The protests -- and a groundswell
of public resentment over Britain's sky-high fuel prices -- appeared
to catch the prime minister off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel flap marked the latest erosion of the suave, confident
public image the prime minister enjoyed after his landslide
election win three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Blair's 16-year-old son was arrested for being drunk in
public, shortly after the prime minister had floated the idea of
on-the-spot fines for drunken hooligans. In June, he was booed and
heckled during a speech to a normally placid and cordial audience,
the Women's Institute. And in May, Londoners snubbed Blair by
electing Ken Livingstone as mayor despite the prime minister's
vociferous opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in The News of The World, a Sunday tabloid,
said 38 percent of those asked would vote for the Conservatives,
and 36 percent would vote Labor if there were an election now. The
poll of 1,006 British adults, taken Thursday and Friday by Market
and Opinion Research International, had an error margin of 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   An NOP poll published in The Sunday Times found support among
1,002 interviewees was tied at 37 percent for both parties. The
margin of error for the poll, taken Thursday through Friday, was 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's personal reputation appeared also to be hurt. Of those
polled by NOP, 73 percent described him as ''out of touch and
arrogant,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The government had already seen its popularity slide somewhat
since Blair's sweeping 1997 election victory, when Labor won a
179-seat majority in the House of Commons. Even so, Labor had
enjoyed an unbroken lead in the opinion polls since the months
following the 1992 general election victory of Conservative Prime
Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
   The protests that left filling stations empty around the country
were spurred by demands for a fuel tax cut. Britain's fuel prices
are the highest in Europe, and taxes account for three-quarters of
the pump price.
</P>
<P>
   Blair refused any tax concessions, and said his decision was a
victory for democratic government. But analysts said he risked
looking out of touch with public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming 85 percent of those polled by NOP wanted fuel
duties to fall and 78 percent said they backed the protests that
left the country stuggling to move. Only 18 percent thought Blair
was ''in tune with the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the MORI poll for the News of the World, 85 percent of those
asked blamed the crisis on the government. The protests were
supported by 82 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Military Captures Town  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lankan soldiers captured a
strategic northern town from Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday in a fresh
offensive backed by artillery and newly acquired Russian MiG-27
warplanes, an army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Four soldiers, including one officer, died and 46 were injured.
There were no immediate reports of rebel casualties and no comment
from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can confirm that we have finished the operation and that we
took over the town of Chavakachcheri,'' said Brig. Sanath
Karunaratne.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Chavakachcheri, nearly six miles east of Jaffna
city, is seen as a major victory for the government ahead of Oct.
10 parliamentary elections. Military gains against the rebels could
win votes for the ruling People's Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels wrested Chavakachcheri from the military after a
major offensive in May.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said government troops
have seen the Tamil rebels deserting their bases and defense lines.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been fighting a 17-year civil war for a separate
Tamil homeland in the north and east since 1983. More than 62,400
people have been killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels accuse the majority Sinhalese, who control the
government and the military, of widespread discrimination against
the minority Tamils in education and jobs. The government denies
the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's military operation was the government's third attack
this month. Last weekend, troops consolidated their hold on the
northern territory wrested from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by MiG-27 warplanes, government troops destroyed 14 rebel
bunkers close to Jaffna on Sept. 10, killing 70 guerrillas and 17
soldiers. The operation succeeded in clearing the guerillas from
positions five to 10 miles east of Jaffna. The rebels hope to
reclaim Jaffna, a former guerrilla stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no comment by the rebels on the new attacks, but
a government statement released Saturday said the rebels have
admitted losing 392 fighters since the latest military operations
began Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to dislodge the rebels from positions close
to Jaffna ahead of the elections to prevent possible guerrilla
attacks during voting in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Independent verification of the reports is not possible as both
sides don't allow reporters into the battle zone.

<HEADLINE> Networks Go Overseas for New Shows  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The British are coming -- to the fall TV
schedule. And so are the Dutch, the Swedes, the Australians and the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who hasn't been keeping up, several network hits of
the past year were imported from foreign countries. ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,'' the show that saved ABC, came from England, and
''Survivor'' on CBS got its start in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   There's more on the way. ''Millionaire'' continues and
''Survivor II'' is scheduled for January. Meanwhile, several new
shows were hatched overseas. NBC bought ''Chains of Love'' from the
Dutch creator of ''Big Brother,'' where one person will be chained
to four others of the opposite sex. ABC is developing two group
task-type shows, ''The Mole'' from Belgium and ''Jailbreak'' from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? For years, ''foreign programming'' meant the
subversive, overeducated humor of Monty Python or such starchy
dramas as ''Masterpiece Theatre'' with the even starchier Alistair
Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of exporting heaps of lowbrow popular culture
to the rest of the world, the United States has turned the tables,
becoming a voracious consumer of pop programming produced on
foreign shores.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing we were really good at, after we lost the auto
and electronics industries, was really stupid entertainment
ideas,'' says Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study
of Popular Television at Syracuse University. ''When the British
crossed the Atlantic with 'Millionaire,' what a sad day that was.
We may even lose our supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that the two monster successes brought
in from overseas were originally developed here. Quiz shows like
''Millionaire'' go back to the '50s, and MTV helped pioneer reality
television eight years ago with ''Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, that makes the current boom of foreign TV imports
even more like the British invasion of rock bands in the '60s, when
the Rolling Stones wowed us with music rooted in the blues, a
distinctly American invention.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from overseas TV formats is not exactly new, but
previous examples were far more subtle or went through substantial
adaptation for U.S. tastes. ''All in the Family,'' ''Sanford and
Son,'' ''Three's Company'' and ''Cosby'' all had roots overseas.
</P>
<P>
   These days the opportunities for foreign shows to make it big
here are greater than ever. Networks are looking for new material
to keep viewers from going to cable, and cable networks have an
appetite for new programming that can hardly be satisfied with
in-house productions.
</P>
<P>
   Such ready-made shows as ''Absolutely Fabulous'' and ''Two Fat
Ladies'' went a long way to getting Comedy Central and the Food
Network off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Food Network had an even bigger hit with the campy ''Iron
Chef'' cooking-contest show from Japan, which is now the channel's
No. 2 show, following the rapid-fire ''Emeril Live'' with chef
Emeril Lagasse.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Girard, the Food Network's general manager, said the
unexpected success of ''Iron Chef'' -- which was brought to the
attention of executives by a production assistant -- has made her
more open to new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We programmers all think we know what the viewer wants and
that getting ratings and viewers is very predictable,'' Girard
said. ''But the show that's going to make your schedule is always a
surprise. 'Iron Chef' shouldn't work, but it does. It's what keeps
programming people like me humble.''
</P>
<P>
   While the boom in imports can be traced to last summer's arrival
of ''Millionaire,'' networks and studios have been experimenting
with foreign formats for years.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Stanley Entertainment has been scouring Europe and other
continents for years, remaking the British shopping show ''Born
Lucky'' for Lifetime and then Pax beginning in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the company has several projects in the works based
on overseas formats including ''The Mole'' for ABC and ''Popstars''
for WB, an Australian show where people audition for parts in an
amateur rock band. Two other shows in the works at Stone Stanley,
''All You Need Is Love'' and ''The People Vs.,'' also came from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much easier to buy a format that's already developed than
it is to develop one yourself,'' said Scott Stone, co-founder of
Stone Stanley. ''Once we use up all the international formats that
are brilliant, my expectation is that American companies will come
up with the new formats.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the United States is just one of many countries
importing successful TV formats. After being launched in Britain in
1998, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is now shown in 31
countries. The CBS version of ''Big Brother'' is one of the few

<HEADLINE> Military Tries Better-Fitting Shoes  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wearing running shoes that are wrong for the
runner's feet is an easy way to get an exercise program off on the
wrong foot.
</P>
<P>
   In the military, where fitness is a way of life, a new program
aims to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   From basic training posts to overseas post exchanges, the system
teaches personnel which type of shoe is right -- and therefore least
likely to cause them injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very simple, and I think anyone can learn how to do these
methods,'' said 1st Lt. Lance Cross, chief of physical therapy at
Fort Drum, N.Y., home of the 10th Mountain Division light infantry.
Cross was one of the organizer's of Fort Drum's version of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Military clothing centers and the Army and Air Force post
exchange system have been rolling out their versions this month and
last, said officials at the Army Air Force Exchange Service
headquarters in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which is commonly used by civilian experts in
fitting shoes, has never been used on a service-wide scale before.
It matches the arch of a person's foot to the model of shoe that
should fit that arch.
</P>
<P>
   Arches are divided into three groups: low or flat, normal and
high.
</P>
<P>
   The division is based on the principle that the arch acts as a
spring, compressing as the foot strikes the ground and returning to
its original shape as the foot lifts back off.
</P>
<P>
   A low arch makes the foot act like a car with a worn-out
suspension by allowing free play during the forward motion of
running. The poorly controlled movement creates twisting pressures
on the leg, which can wrench ankles or knees. Low arched feet do
best in shoes with strong motion control, Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   A normal arch does well in a shoe that lets the foot do what it
needs to do, Cross said. The shoe provides stability, emphasizing a
smooth feel during a run while retaining movement control and shock
absorption.
</P>
<P>
   A high arch is fairly rigid, creating risk of jarring injuries.
Shoes to fit these feet offer more cushioning to absorb the impact
of running, Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   The military program is intended to make sure personnel know
their foot type, and to ensure they can use the knowledge when they
select shoes.
</P>
<P>
   At the store, shoes are categorized according to their ability
to fit one of the three types. Color-coded displays and tags on the
shoe models tell which type is which. The customer then simply
tries on shoes and selects styles from within the proper type.
</P>
<P>
   Publications such as Runner's World magazine and the Road Runner
Sports catalog rate shoes by such categories. Fort Drum relied on
the ratings, as well as the opinions of its own foot experts, in
setting up its categories, Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Drum and some other posts where soldiers do a lot of
running, such as basic training facilities, a trained examiner
studies the foot and makes the classification.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the exam is do-it-yourself simple, and can be
performed anywhere. The difference is easy to spot, simply by
looking at the imprint of a wet foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''All you need is a bathtub and a floor,'' said Dr. Glenn B.
Pfeffer of San Francisco, an orthopedic surgeon who is not
connected with the military initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In a high-arched foot, the print of the wet instep appears as
''only a tiny band,'' maybe one half inch wide, Pfeffer said. In a
low-arched or flat foot, the print may be almost as wide as the
rest of the foot, he said. And in a normal foot, the imprint may be
about 1 inch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the military, the goal is to improve training and reduce
injuries. Fort Drum is still analyzing its data, but it appears
fewer people are getting hurt, Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a military command structure to set up this
system. Some civilian footwear chains are trying it, said Diana
Eckert, a footwear manager for the PX system.
</P>
<P>
   However, most civilian shoe buyers don't check their feet or
examine the ratings, said Dr. Carol Frey, an orthopedic surgeon in
Manhattan Beach, Calif. They go to a store -- possibly a discount
chain with many shoes and few workers -- and guess at a fit,
assisted by a sales representative who also has little more than a
best guess to offer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, learning how to classify an arch is not
rocket science, Frey said. ''You see it once and you can do it 100
times,'' she said. ''But you still have to go and see it once.''

<HEADLINE> Theaters Helping Deaf and Blind  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Connie Stratigos' passion for movies blossomed
when she worked at her father's theater in Memphis, Tenn., in the
1940s as ''box office girl, popcorn girl, candy girl, ticket-taker
and usher.''
</P>
<P>
   But her fondness for the big screen faded when health problems
caused her to lose most of her hearing more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively new technology called rear-window captioning is
changing that, helping people with hearing or vision problems enjoy
movies on the big screen without changing the way others see the
films.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, which involves detailed descriptions for the
visually impaired and a personal captioning device for those with
hearing problems, has been installed in movie theaters in about a
dozen cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Seattle and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Parkway Pointe, a General Cinema theater just north of Atlanta,
installed the technology last year, making it the only conventional
theater in the Southeast that uses the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For the price of admission, people with hearing problems get a
smoked Plexiglas panel attached to a gooseneck arm that fits into
the cupholder. That panel reflects red-lettered subtitles, which
are projected in mirror reverse from the back of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was developed by the National Center for
Accessible Media, a joint effort of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting and the Boston public television station WGBH, which
is spearheading efforts to make movie theaters accessible to the
nation's 34 million deaf, hard-of-hearing, blind and visually
impaired movie fans.
</P>
<P>
   Stratigos' first movie was ''8MM,'' a violent film -- not the
kind she usually goes for -- but she was happy just to be back in
front of the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow, we were just really overwhelmed,'' said Stratigos, 66.
''At first we had a hard time adjusting the gooseneck panel, but
once we got it squared away, it was no problem at all. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Parkway Pointe, the featured film changes about every month.
The theater has already shown ''28 Days,'' ''The Green Mile,''
''Random Hearts,'' ''Star Wars'' and most recently, ''The Patriot''
starring Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the National Center for Accessible Media, however,
is to offer visually and hearing-impaired movie fans the choice to
see a movie at any time, instead of specific viewing times.
Already, ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''102 Dalmatians'' are expected
to feature rear-window captioning when those films are released in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rear-window captions display almost every word of dialogue in
''The Patriot,'' including certain sound effects, such as groans
and horse whinnies.
</P>
<P>
   Blind moviegoers get a special headset to listen to a
description of the visual elements of a film. The fast-paced
narrative, called DVS Theatrical, works in tandem with the
dialogue, sneaking into the movie's natural pauses.
</P>
<P>
   During the final battle scene in ''The Patriot,'' the narrator
says, ''Martin parries, then takes a hit in the back of the knee
... Martin falls to his knees, his face contorted with pain.''
</P>
<P>
   It costs a theater about $15,000 to install the equipment for
rear-window captioning and descriptive narration in a single
auditorium. It costs WGBH another $2,000 to caption and $8,500 to
describe a two-hour film.
</P>
<P>
   General Cinema, a subsidiary of Massachusetts-based GC
Companies, has been the only theater chain thus far to test the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But some activists are pressuring other national theater chains
to use the technology. Eight people with hearing impairments filed
suit in Oregon earlier this year to force several movie theater
chains to install rear-window captioning, citing the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   And the Federal Communications Commission in November offered
proposals on how to mandate video description services for
television programming. The proposals are part of a broader FCC
effort to make technology more reachable for people with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Mauldin, facilities manager for Parkway Pointe, said
General Cinema installed the system in Atlanta not because it's a
moneymaker, but because it is ''the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of people use the equipment regularly, but
Parkway Pointe is trying to increase that number by sending out
e-mail notices to a database of blind and deaf people every time a
new movie is released, Mauldin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for the deaf and hard-of-hearing have criticized
the rear-window captioning system as hard to use.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've seen a movie in years,'' said Jennifer
Whitcomb, executive director of the Georgia Council for the Hearing
Impaired. ''I tend to stay away from them because I don't want to
deal with the captioning. I think it takes the fun out of it when
we have to deal with that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stratigos, a retired microbiologist who serves as an officer
in hearing support groups, said there is no other way for the blind
and hearing-impaired to be able to enjoy first-run movies the way
they were meant to be enjoyed -- on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''People like me are thankful to get what we can get,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> School board and union at odds over contract, and now, over a poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - As Buffalo teachers prepare to head back to
classes for at least some of this week, a poll shows 57 percent of
county residents think they should not strike again.
</P>
<P>
   While 59 percent of Erie County residents say Buffalo teachers
have legitimate complaints, only 33 percent think walking out is
necessary, according to poll conducted by Zogby International for
Sunday's Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers union and school board offered different
interpretations of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we're not going to make our decisions on poll results,
it is comforting to know that almost two-thirds of the community
supports our belief that the strike shouldn't occur,'' said Paul
Buchanan, school board president.
</P>
<P>
   It was a view seconded by one of the state's top education
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't it ironic that with this strike in Buffalo we have the
appalling example of calculated lawlessness on the part of the very
people we rely on to bring to our children the message of respect
for the law and our legal institutions?'' said Regents Chancellor
Carl T. Hayden, an Elmira attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Rumore, president of the Buffalo Teachers Federation,
said he was surprised and gratified by the results. ''It's very
unusual to have that many people support a public employee
strike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby had much the same impression.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that the recent strikes are ''not such a bad
move as one would expect,'' Zogby said. ''There is public sympathy,
but perhaps they have found the only tool available to focus that
public sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Teachers Federation's 3,700 teachers walked out for
two days earlier this month and unexpectedly resumed the strike
Thursday, canceling classes for 47,000 students. Under a judge's
order, they returned Friday and promised to stay there until the
state's mediator releases a proposal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the countywide survey, 29 percent thought the teachers had no
reason to complain. The remaining 12 percent were undecided in the
poll conducted Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 400 registered voters was conducted Thursday and
Friday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Corsica Targeted for Peace Program  </HEADLINE>
By PAMELA SAMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AJACCIO, Corsica (AP) -- The sun splashes across the craggy
Mediterranean island of Corsica, birthplace of the emperor
Napoleon, casting magnificent mountain shadows and drawing
holidaymakers to its beaches and sapphire seas.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the lush facade is an island in the grips of a
violent campaign by separatists who have sought since the mid-1970s
to break away from France.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem reached a shocking climax in 1998 with the
assassination of Claude Erignac, France's highest official on the
island, and now, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's own presidential
ambitions may be jeopardized by his attempts to strike a compromise
with the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Corsica is a hot-button issue for a country that has always been
preoccupied with its own identity, especially nowadays as it merges
into the borderless, single-currency European Union. All its
neighbors -- Britain, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy
-- have given their regions some measure of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But not France. And from Alsace on the Rhine, through Celtic
Brittany on the Atlantic to the Basque country straddling the
border with Spain, the regions are fed up with living in a country
so centrally controlled that all major roads lead to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the discontent, the French government may need to
swallow its pride and show greater flexibility. But so far, Jospin
has little to show for having opened talks with the separatists
last year and for offering the island some limited control over its
affairs. Bombs keep exploding on the island 100 miles off southern
France, and Jospin's initiative has led to the resignation of
Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
   While some observers cautiously predict a chance of peace,
Chevenement maintains that Jospin's initiative threatens France's
cohesion by encouraging other groups to demand self-rule. Others
say Jospin is caving in to terrorism and that handing any power
over to unruly Corsica -- where separatist violence is compounded by
Mafia-style clan wars and racketeering -- is like letting the fox
guard the hen house.
</P>
<P>
   Corsicans, too, have their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the mainland was deeply shaken when Bernard
Bonnet, who replaced the murdered Erignac as prefect, was
implicated in a 1999 arson attack that destroyed an illegally built
restaurant frequented by the nationalist crowd. An elite French
military squad confessed to setting the fire, and Bonnet was fired.
Nationalists suspect the fire was meant to spark a gang war.
</P>
<P>
   While separatists have confounded successive French governments,
the island's 260,000 residents have adapted to the chaos. Killings
are mostly the result of rival groups battling it out, and frequent
bombings of government buildings -- one particular tax office has
been hit 19 times -- are carefully planned to avoid deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''They shoot at each other, but they leave people like me
alone,'' said Salvatore Delogu, a barber in Ajaccio, the island
capital. ''I stay away from politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While polls through the years show an overwhelming majority of
Corsicans want the island to remain part of France, the separatist
movement does speak to their wishes for recognition as a people
apart, with a language closer to Italian than French and a proud
history of resistance to outside rule.
</P>
<P>
   The movement also embodies a deep frustration at being dependent
on subsidies from France, according to Charles Napoleon, candidate
for mayor of Ajaccio and great-great-grandnephew of Corsica's most
famous son.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon said he supports Jospin's plan and noted Britain has
already undertaken a similar experiment by handing some powers to
Scotland and Wales while maintaining their union with England.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists say France should follow Britain's example.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great Britain recognizes that the Welsh are a nation, that the
Scots are a nation,'' said Jean-Francois Luciani, spokesman for
Corsica Viva, one of the main nationalist groups. ''The French
government doesn't want to recognize this. The French only
recognize one people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem may not go away even if Paris grants
concessions, which is what makes Jospin's initiative so risky.
Already, some separatists warn that it is just a step toward the
self-rule that Corsica had for 14 years until France bought the
island from Genoa in 1768.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once Corsicans have devolution, they can decide in the future
if they want independence,'' said Paul Quastana, president of
Corsica Nazione, a nationalist party. ''This is only the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best hope for peace is that so many Corsicans appear
weary of violence. In December 1999, less than a year after
Erignac's assassination, the separatists called a cease-fire and
stepped up to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence continues. In August alone, there were two
political killings, three bombings and a wave of suspicious brush
fires. The outcome of the 2002 presidential race -- where Jospin is
likely to face incumbent Jacques Chirac -- may hinge in part on
whether the government can tame this wildly beautiful island.

<HEADLINE> Russians Not Paying for Electricity  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- As the electricity monopoly in the world's largest
country, Russia's Unified Energy Systems has plenty of prodigious
statistics -- including what could be the world's longest list of
deadbeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they owe the partly state-owned UES an estimated $5
billion, but they include some of the country's most secret sites,
including nuclear missile bases and the Plesetsk space launch
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The utility's attempts to collect its bills grabbed national
attention last week when one of its local branches cut off power to
a missile base that owed $683,000. The base retaliated by sending
soldiers to a switching station to turn the lights back on.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that dispute, the Plesetsk cosmodrome announced
it had received a warning that switchoffs were imminent unless it
paid $1.6 million in arrears. A missile base in Altai said it was
being pressured to pay up on bills exceeding $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   UES later ordered its subsidiaries not to cut power to strategic
military units. But if that order quelled the uproar, it did not
resolve the company's debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The utility is caught in a web of financial problems that seem
as complex as the 1.8 million miles of power lines it manages. It
is both a victim of Russia's economic troubles and a contributor to
them.
</P>
<P>
   UES can't collect from many state-run installations, such as the
military bases, because those operations are themselves
underfunded. Even when it does collect, it's often in barter or
in-kind services.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this year, only 62 percent of the payments
to UES were in cash, board member Andrei Trapeznikov said in a
statement. Nonetheless, that's an improvement over past years, when
cash collections were reported as low as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   UES complains it has to sell electricity for unreasonably low
rates, about 1 cent per kilowatt-hour. ''I am not proud of the
epithet that UES is the world's largest and also the world's
cheapest power company,'' chief executive Anatoly Chubais said in a
letter to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   According to UES, power demand in Russia is rising at about 3
percent a year while the utility's troubles reduce its ability to
increase supply, and it predicts demand will exceed capacity within
about five years.
</P>
<P>
   But charging more realistic rates could be catastrophic for
Russia's economy, where many businesses survive by being able to
sell their products at low prices made possible in part because of
low power rates. Analysts say the energy-intensive aluminum
industry, one of Russia's major exporters, could be especially
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Industries that are effectively subsidized in this way are at
the heart of what many Western economists have taken to calling
Russia's ''virtual economy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one of the scholars who popularized the phrase,
Barry Ickes of the University of Pennsylvania, rationalizing UES
operations is the key to bringing Russia out of its economic bind.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you would need to have in place policies to cope with the
political byproducts,'' such as wide unemployment that would be
caused by raising rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government, plagued by low tax collections, is
unlikely to be able to marshal the money for that, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the whole chain, the state hasn't been able to
collect taxes,'' agreed William Browder of the Hermitage Fund,
which has invested in UES.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian state holds 52.5 percent of the utility's shares and
foreigners own about 30 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais has proposed a complicated restructuring plan that he
argues would bring more efficiency to the electricity market.
Generating facilities would be spun off into some 70 regional
operations while transmission and distribution facilities would
remain national.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been widely criticized. Analysts say it would
accomplish little and could be a new opportunity for unscrupulous
entrepreneurs to grab pieces of an important enterprise at bargain
prices. That happened at many other state-owned firms when Chubais
was chief of the Russian government's privatization program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see it as a thinly disguised attempt at asset-stripping,''
Browder said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Floods Leave Farmers Waiting  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAN CHAU, Vietnam (AP) -- For the residents of Vietnam's Mekong
Delta, the summer has been a grim waiting game, watching waters
creeping up to claim their farmland and homes in the worst flooding
in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many nights, I couldn't sleep because I would worry about
the water coming up a little more,'' said Nguyen Van Quan, 72, a
rice farmer whose thatched-roof home is largely submerged under
more than six feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Quan and his wife have been living on bamboo platforms set in
the rafters of their house for the past month. ''Of course I'm
afraid, but I've lived here all my life. Where will I go?'' he said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Record flooding in Cambodia and Vietnam has affected more than 1
million people in recent weeks, forcing tens of thousands of
families from their homes in search of higher ground. Areas of Laos
and Thailand have also been hit.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon rains began in July, a month and a half ahead of
schedule. The rain has continued since, swelling the Mekong River
along its course through all four countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambodia, officials say nearly 100 people have died in
flooding since July. In Vietnam, the death toll stands at 15,
including 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say 150,000 people have been displaced in
the three hardest-hit Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap
and Long An. More than 200,000 homes have been flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists say nearly half the three provinces are
submerged, with water levels at or above those of 1996, when floods
killed 217 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Mekong, rising an average of two to four inches a day, will
probably peak in early October, approaching the 17-foot record set
in 1961, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Tan Chau, about 160 miles west of Ho Chi Minh City
in An Giang province, lies near the Cambodian border, where the
Mekong rushes down into the delta and most families make a living
growing rice.
</P>
<P>
   Acres of verdant rice paddies have been swallowed by muddy brown
water. Low-lying rural roads are often swamped, despite
sandbagging. And thousands of homes are flooded, sometimes to the
rooftops, driving tens of thousands of people to seek shelter
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Along a dirt dike six feet wide near Tan Chau, almost 200 people
evacuated from their low-lying homes live jammed into makeshift
shelters -- like thousands of other families in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Thi Phu, 34, and her five relatives camped under plastic
tarps held up by bamboo rods. They managed to rescue their wooden
bed, and some pots and pans. A tiny altar stood in one corner of
the shelter, but most of their possessions are submerged.
</P>
<P>
   ''My house is flooded up to here,'' Phu said, gesturing at her
waist. ''We're only living day to day. I don't know when we'll be
able to go home again. They tell us the water will go down by
November. Until then, we will have to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are cramped and unsanitary. The lapping waters are
eroding many of the sodden dikes, but 2,500 soldiers and volunteers
are helping reinforce them.
</P>
<P>
   Rising waters threaten increasing numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Red Cross appealed for $1.9 million for people in
Southeast Asia, with the bulk going to Cambodia. This week,
officials said an additional appeal of up to $1.5 million would be
launched for Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The money will buy plastic sheeting for emergency shelters for
around 35,000 people, at least 2,750 tons of rice, 25,000 mosquito
nets and 6,000 inexpensive boats.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's government has already pledged $2.2 million in aid to
the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a disaster here, but it's been a slow disaster, not like
the central region's floods,'' said Nguyen Thanh Na of the An Giang
People's Committee, referring to the record flash floods in 1999
that killed more than 700 people in central Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the water has risen so slowly, there's no panic. I
think people here have resigned themselves to it.''

<HEADLINE> Schumer says heating oil prices could double  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Sen. Charles Schumer said Sunday that home
heating oil prices could nearly double this winter unless more oil
is supplied to the market.
</P>
<P>
   At a Manhattan news conference, Schumer urged New Yorkers to
fill their residential tanks now to avoid expected price increases
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers could pay as much as $2.28 per gallon for home heating
oil compared to last year's $1.31 per gallon average price, Schumer
said.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the residential price of home heating oil was
$1.59 in the city, 2 cents higher on Long Island and $1.41 in the
rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer reiterated his call for the Clinton administration to
release oil from the nation's strategic reserve in order to
stabilize prices.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Catholic Worker, Conn Bjt,950  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Chris Doucot isn't sure how many times
he's been arrested for civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost track. Forty or so,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the arrests stand out, like the time several years ago
when Doucot and his elderly mother-in-law chained shut the doors of
the federal building in downtown Hartford. At another protest he
spilled his blood on the building's pillars to symbolize the blood
spilled in wars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took them a while to get it off,'' Doucot said, smiling
slightly as he carried a sign at a weekly protest at the federal
building against American support for sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Doucot, 32, has fasted for up to 30 days to protest the Iraqi
sanctions. A junkie pistol-whipped him last year while Doucot was
giving food to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life of a Catholic Worker. The radical movement was
started during the Depression by Dorothy Day, a Roman Catholic
convert and journalist, and Peter Maurin, a French peasant.
</P>
<P>
   Many groups help the poor. Catholic Workers actually live, in
voluntary poverty, among the poor. That, they say, helps them
understand the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what we believe we're called to do as Catholics,'' Doucot
said, recalling the Biblical story in which Jesus tells a rich man
to give up his wealth and follow him. ''We're trying to do our best
to not just believe in Jesus but to try and practice that with our
daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Worker movement has more than 100 homes across the
country and abroad where they take in the homeless and others in
need. The homes are located in poor areas and some provide food,
furniture and other services. Nonviolent protests are a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the Catholic Worker has houses in Hartford, New
Haven and Bridgeport and runs programs around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgeport house opened a year ago in a Spanish-speaking
neighborhood. Its main work so far involves coordinating a program
that brings high school and college students from surrounding towns
to Bridgeport to break down barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old New Haven house takes people in, offers meals and
engages in protests. A prayer circle is held in an area known for
drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come to the conclusion the service we do is a
privilege,'' says Mark Colville, a Catholic Worker in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Colville, who has a wife and two children, recently spent a year
in jail for participating in a protest in Maine in which blood was
spilled on a battleship.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Catholic Worker home is formally known as St.
Martin De Porres House. Neighbors call it ''the purple house''
because of its bright paint.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford house has taken in prisoners, the poor and the
pregnant. A current resident, an 18-year-old woman, came from an
abused home and now is able to attend college because of the
Catholic Worker.
</P>
<P>
   Doucot and his wife, Jackie Allen, who have two young boys,
opened the house seven years ago. Some neighbors were skeptical at
first.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a white family moving in the middle of the city,''
said D. McNeil, who lives next door. ''They found that unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   But the neighbors gradually came to accept the Catholic Worker
as they watched the group provide arts and crafts, summer camp and
other services for children. McNeil sends her niece to the house
and says she could talk for months about the good works done there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris and Jackie are wonderful people,'' McNeil said. ''They
do a great job working with the kids in the community - lots of
patience, very caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Children come by the purple house after school. A small boy
dressed in a polo shirt stands quietly outside the front of the
house, next to a black, wrought-iron fence where donated clothing
hangs for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hello Rodney,'' Doucot calls out. ''Do you want to come in the
backyard?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney walks through the house and is soon playing on a swing,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   A group of children arrive, but they are leery of an old dog in
the house. One child asks if the dog bites.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only if you bite him,'' Doucot says.
</P>
<P>
   The children come into the house and Doucot hands each of them
two pencils.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get this stuff for free?'' a boy asks, bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, why not?'' Doucot replies.
</P>
<P>
   Doucot gives a girl a box of crayons, but she tries to give them
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't use crayons,'' the girl explains. ''I'm a
third-grader.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the children, Julio Rodriguez, 12, is asked what he
thinks of the people in the purple house.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're blessed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   More and more children come by the house, and soon the backyard
playground is filled. Doucot prepares Kool-aid, while a woman who
calls herself Princess Di brings over snacks for the children.
</P>
<P>
   In another room, Doucot's son is watching Brian Kavanagh paint a
sign for a military protest planned the following day. A colorful
''Happy Birthday'' sign hangs on the wall for Brian, who just
turned 57.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Kavanagh and Doucot quietly handed out
fliers at the federal building. Doucot, who says he has seen babies
who died because of the Gulf War-era sanctions against Iraq, holds
a sign contending that the sanctions have killed 600,000 Iraqi
children in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Most people ignore the protests. Others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let them all die,'' a woman once told Kavanagh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the response, the Catholic Workers have protested every
Friday for years. And while poverty may be the antithesis of the
American dream, the Catholic Workers find fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced I'm doing what God wants me to do in the place
God wants me to be,'' said the soft-spoken Kavanagh. ''I don't know
how many people can say that.''

<HEADLINE> Girl dies from E. Coli infection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTVILLE, Conn. (AP) - Lauren Mansel was an honor student and
athlete who was looking forward to starting the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12-year-old Montville girl became the third person in
Connecticut this year to die from an E. coli infection when she
passed away Thursday at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, who was to attend Leonard Tyl Middle School, was a
member of the school's track and soccer teams, an assistant coach
of local recreation teams and a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   She was brought to the hospital after exhibiting symptoms more
than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lauren was a social, caring child who was totally active,''
her parents, Lynn and Donna Mansel, wrote in a statement to The Day
of New London.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixteen days ago she was excited about starting seventh grade
and now she's gone. It's been devastating to our entire family,''
the Mansels wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Family members say they don't know how Lauren ingested the
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say they believe Lauren's case is an isolated
one. They say there is no public health threat.
</P>
<P>
   An epidemiologist from the Department of Public Health will
investigate Mansel's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no information at this point that people would need to
be concerned about an E. coli outbreak,'' said Arthur Cohen,
director of the Uncas Health District, which covers Montville and
Norwich.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases you can't determine the source,'' Cohen said.
''It's a detective job.''
</P>
<P>
   One form of E. coli, 0157:H7, can be fatal, according to
officials at the state Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   People can contract the bacteria by eating contaminated, rare or
inadequately cooked meat. E. Coli can be spread via unwashed hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Mansels have established a fund to help teach Connecticut
residents about E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public is just not made aware enough of the dangers of E.
coli and prevention,'' Lynn and Donna Mansel wrote. ''No family
should have to go through what we are going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations may be sent to the Lauren A. Mansel E. coli Awareness
and Education Fund, c/o the Connecticut Children's Medical Center
Foundation, 12 Charter Oak Place, Hartford, CT 06106.

<HEADLINE> In Atlantic City, clock tower in casino breaks longtime taboo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Casinos aren't known for sure bets,
but there's always been at least one thing gamblers here could
count on: No clocks inside casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The omission is no design oversight. After all, if gamblers saw
clocks, they might realize the time of day. And if they did, they
might decide it was time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new casino room is breaking that taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote Kate's Slot Parlor, a new addition to the Wild, Wild West
casino at Bally's Park Place, features a 30-foot clock tower in the
middle of the room.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only clock in any of Atlantic City's 12 casinos, not
counting those in restaurants, retail stores and public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The floor-to-ceiling structure, which sprouts up out of a bank
of 14 slot machines, features a four-sided clock face set inside a
multicolored, Victorian-style tower.
</P>
<P>
   The tower complements the rest of the room, which is themed
after a 19th-century western town and includes storefront facades,
a 30-foot-by-70-foot hand-painted mural, a bakery called Gold Tooth
Gerties and a general store called City Slickers. It opened Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Park Place Entertainment Corp., which owns the
casino, decided on the clock because the brick pillar was a key
structure in the building and they wanted to dress it up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was going to be there anyway, so the question became 'What
do we do with it?''' said casino president Kenneth Condon. ''We
thought a clock tower would fit the theme quite well, and it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Place isn't worried about losing gamblers who see the time
on the clock and reconsider whether to keep dropping quarters in
the slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's strictly old-school casino thinking,'' said Wallace
Barr, executive vice president of Park Place Entertainment. ''We
think it's consistent with everything else we've done in Coyote
Kate's.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of a clock may be old school, but it remains the rule in
most casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Friedmutter, a casino architect with offices in Las Vegas
and Atlantic City, said he knows of no other casino with a clock in
it.
</P>
<P>
   He said the clock taboo reaches back to the early days of Las
Vegas, when casino designers sought to insulate their customers
from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted people to feel like time was irrelevant. It became
one of those dream fantasies: Time doesn't exist, the place doesn't
exist, it's all part of the mystique,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, those traditions have fallen by the wayside.
Exterior windows, another feature long avoided because they can
remind gamblers of the passage of time, have begun to appear in
casinos over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Coyote Kate's clock the start of a trend? Only time will
tell.
</P>
<P>
   But Friedmutter believes it may.
</P>
<P>
   ''As these facilities incorporate more than just gambling,
that's a natural evolution,'' Friedmutter said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, gamblers are hardly noticing. Most are well-used
to the absence of clocks and wear wristwatches. Six gamblers
interviewed at random in the casino Thursday saw the clock only
after it was pointed out to them.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, several of them said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's looking up at a clock?'' said Norbert Meehan, 60, of
Brick, stopping in front of the $1 Slingo slot machines to crane
his neck. ''I think it's a good idea. People should know what time
it is so they leave before they lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All casinos should have one, if you ask me,'' said Isadore
Evans, 80, of Philadelphia. ''That way, you don't have to ask
anyone for the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Harkin, 69, of Philadelphia, had a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can't afford a watch, you shouldn't be in a casino in
the first place,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gucci: 'A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour and Greed'  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - What do you get when you mix murder, money and
sex - and soft Italian loafers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion dynasty that started as a mom-and-pop shoe shop in
1920s Florence ended up with heir Maurizio Gucci executed in 1995 -
by order of his ex-wife, with the family business on the brink of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   This week in New York, the moccasin-maker was on its feet again,
capping its five-year turnaround with the reopening of its Fifth
Avenue store.
</P>
<P>
   And the lurid tale behind the signature horse-bit label was just
around the corner - quite literally.
</P>
<P>
   On East 53rd Street, a Manhattan publisher was marketing ''The
House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour and
Greed'' - a real-life thriller tracing three generations of Guccis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an account of passion, fashion and finance, all wrapped
into one,'' says author Sara Forden, a former Milan bureau chief
for Women's Wear Daily and editor in chief of the new Italian
lifestyle magazine L'Una.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she takes a close look at the company Guccio Gucci
opened in Fascist Italy, with artisans working in a gilded
Florentine palazzo. His son Aldo eventually took the goods
overseas, making the Gucci scarf and bamboo-handle bag symbols of
clout worn by the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy, Grace Kelly and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   But Aldo's three sons, his brother Rodolfo and nephew Maurizio
didn't appreciate Aldo's arrogance, and their meetings often ended
with ashtrays and poisoned words flying. After the Fifth Avenue
store first opened in 1980, the family squabbles got so bad that
Aldo's son Paolo publicized financial documents showing that his
81-year-old father had evaded taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Then Maurizio ousted his uncle and cousins and, in 1993, sold
his share of the company to a Bahrain-based investment group.
</P>
<P>
   As the wild-spending Maurizio was about to marry his mistress,
his jealous ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani, paid a stylishly dressed
gunman to kill her 47-year-old ex at his Milan office, according to
court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The spurned socialite and the couple's two daughters attended
the funeral; months later, Patrizia posed for a photographer,
reclining on a sofa at home with a smile that could have been an
omen of what it took police two years to discover.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio's once glamorous spouse was arrested on a winter dawn
in 1997 - now looking like a haggard middle-aged suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Her six-month trial the following year ''was the Italian
equivalent of the O.J. Simpson case in the United States,'' says
Forden. ''I couldn't have made up a more intriguing story.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a jailhouse correspondence with Patrizia, while Gucci
executives cooperated with the author as she researched the book.
</P>
<P>
   The woman the Italian press dubbed the ''black widow'' was
convicted of hiring her ex-husband's hit man and sentenced to 29
years in prison, later reduced by three years. Gucci store windows
worldwide displayed sterling silver handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the fashion empire itself was facing the law, with
exorbitant expenses and sinking sales.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, it would become the comeback kid of the industry,
with the Harvard Business School conducting a case study of its
rise and fall - and rise again.
</P>
<P>
   As the new Gucci-less Gucci Group, the company re-emerged on the
fashion map under the creative leadership of Texas-born designer
Tom Ford. Its initial public offering was successfully floated on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But the goods behind Gucci would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when asked for the source of the original Gucci
magic, Maurizio's cousin, Roberto Gucci, replied: ''L'azienda era
la famiglia e la famiglia era l'azienda!!'' (The company was the
family and the family was the company!)
</P>
<P>
   And the family is gone, along with its signature style. Witness
the Gucci G-string on an all-but-naked man introduced in the 1997
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's for effect rather than to wear. It's to get talked
about,'' says Eleanor Lambert, a New York-based fashion expert who
has studied international style almost as long as the Gucci firm
has existed.
</P>
<P>
   The prim, classical Gucci look of the last century ''is a dead
issue. It's a brand that they want to sell,'' says Lambert. And,
though she has high praise for designer Ford's talent, ''he should
be on his own. And Gucci should be forgotten because there isn't
any more Gucci. It's nonexistent. It's too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site now offers a sexy 21st century edge,
including some diaphanous ensembles for both men and women. The
moccasins still sport the trademark ''GG'' - Guccio Gucci's linked
initials - but the cool new image has coated the bloodied past.
</P>
<P>
   Only a touch of red is still attached to the Gucci name - a
crimson stripe on the latest black leather loafer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The House of Gucci, A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness,
Glamour and Greed.'' William Morrow, $26.

<HEADLINE> Ang Lee Takes Film Award in Toronto  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- After 10 days and more than 300 movies at the
world's ultimate ''people's'' film festival, the people have
spoken. ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger,'' Ang Lee's historical
action-romance, was named the winner Sunday of the People's Choice
Award at the Toronto International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is a native of Taiwan best known for such English-language
movies as ''The Ice Storm'' and ''Sense and Sensibility.'' His
current film, however, is set during the Qing dynasty in China and
stars Chow Yun-Fat as a martial arts warrior who longs to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an innocence, a pure magic of movement to this
movie,'' said festival director Piers Handling. ''It takes you back
to your childhood days, when people fly across rooftops and have
sword fights in trees.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dish,'' an Australian comedy about the 1969 moon landing,
finished second among audience voters. Previous winners have
included ''American Beauty,'' ''Shine'' and ''Life is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the 25th year of the festival, which ended Saturday,
and it was marked by appearances from Gwyneth Paltrow, Al Pacino,
Ed Harris and many other celebrities. But what defined the 25th
festival is what has defined it from the start: the public.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cannes, Toronto is where filmmakers get to show their
work to a general audience. For the past week and a half, lines
formed in lobbies, down stairwells, around street corners and back
again. Film lovers woke up early, went to bed late, used up
vacation time and came out to see everything from ''Midnight
Madness'' horror screenings to comedies in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cut out of work to see a couple of movies,'' admitted
27-year-old Andrew Egan, a bank programmer who stood in the late
summer cold one morning to catch a showing of ''The Dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a far more intimate affair, the Toronto festival can be
likened to a small business that grows beyond its own expectations.
The challenge becomes how to handle all the extra customers without
losing what made it special in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very worried a few years ago that the industry side
would crowd out the public side,'' Handling said. ''So we just
added press and industry screenings. In fact, it was press people
who had a hard time getting to see movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto has been known to ''make'' films. In 1999, response to
''American Beauty'' was widely believed to be a major step to its
Academy Award success six months later. In previous years,
productions such as Robert Duvall's ''The Apostle'' and the German
action film ''Run Lola Run'' picked up U.S. distributors thanks to
that mysterious, essential aura known as ''buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, there were no obvious favorites. Festival
bees buzzed among several movies, including the Australian romance
''Innocence,'' the British comedy ''Billy Elliott'' and the
American political drama ''The Contender.''
</P>
<P>
   For salespeople, the 25th Toronto festival was the busiest yet;
Toronto now challenges Cannes and Sundance as an industry showcase.
From the Iranian drama ''The Circle'' to the Thai gangster movie
''Bangkok Dangerous,'' films received distribution deals all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my 10th festival and it was the most successful so
far,'' said Wouter Barendrecht, chair of Fortissimo Film Sales, a
company based in Hong Kong that represented ''Bangkok Dangerous''
and several other releases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before Night Falls,'' painter Julian Schnabel's tribute to the
late Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas, was acquired by New Line. Lions
Gate picked up Kathryn Bigelow's ''The Weight of Water,'' which
stars Sean Penn and Elizabeth Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   Other movies attracting strong interest included ''Iron
Ladies,'' a trans-gender comedy from Thailand; ''The Princess and
the Warrior,'' by ''Run Lola Run'' director Tom Twyker; and the
Canadian horror movie ''Ginger Snaps.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with more markets than ever; every single
company wants to come here,'' said Kelley Alexander, director of
the festival's industry center. ''That only makes it better for
filmmakers.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Held for Common Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police accusations that militant Israeli
Muslims had planned widespread anti-Israel violence are misplaced,
a prosecutor said Sunday, casting official doubt on a claim that
sparked Arab outrage last week.
</P>
<P>
   Haifa District Attorney Lili Borishansky told The Associated
Press that the police files she received concerning the arrests 41
Arabs from the town of Umm al-Fahm and three West Bank Palestinians
contain no evidence of planned terror.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, announcing the arrests on suspicion of arson,
unlawful association, incitement to violence, trafficking in arms
and related offenses Northern Israel police commander Alik Ron
suggested that they were part of a pattern of planned terror.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case, according to the files, Borishansky said.
''All I can say is that the files submitted to us contain no
evidence of nationalist motivation for the offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The torchings of houses and businesses were acts of revenge for
a double murder committed in 1999 over a property dispute, she
said, and had nothing to do with the Islamic Movement, a political
party that controls Umm el-Fahm and other Arab local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The arms trafficking was motivated purely by greed, not
anti-Israel intentions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron painted the arrests as indicative of a pattern of violence
emerging among Israeli Arabs -- a group that largely avoided joining
the Palestinians during the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a long time since such serious nationalist activity with
such serious intentions has been uncovered,'' among Israel's Arab
minority Ron told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Islamic Movement, which has representatives in
parliament, of fomenting nationalist activity through inflammatory
sermons preached in the mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Ron's statements sparked an angry reaction from Israeli Arabs,
who say they are typical of an Israeli establishment that still
treats them as second-class citizens, and that has neglected their
towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Arabs attended a rally of the Islamic Movement in
Umm el-Fahm Friday. Many of those present were not Islamic
fundamentalists or not religious at all.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editorials accused Ron of having united the entire
Arab community in an anti-government protest.
</P>
<P>
   Arab legislators called Ron a racist and demanded his dismissal,
saying they had evidence Ron was already plotting a post-police
career in the hard-line Likud party, a charge Likud activists hotly
denied
</P>
<P>
   Police Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami hinted that he had reservations
about Ron's statements. Asked if Ron had shown the sufficient
sensitivity, Ben-Ami said ''I certainly have something to say to
him,'' but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Borishanky, who has already submitted indictments against some
of the suspects, denied reports of tension between Ron and the
prosecution over his statements about the case.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- A passenger bus plunged off a ferry into a river
in central Russia on Sunday, killing 13 people, emergency officials

   The bus, traveling a standard route from the regional capital
Kazan to the town of Bazarniye Mataki, had just driven onto the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Holding Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels fleeing the second
day of a government offensive Sunday appear to have taken their 19
hostages, including one American, with them, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of government troops pursued the Abu Sayyaf rebels in
an assault aimed at rescuing the hostages, including six
foreigners, held by the rebels on remote Jolo island. More than
4,000 soldiers had launched the pre-dawn attack Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Angelo Reyes said the guerrillas
apparently took the hostages with them. There has been no sign of
them, but all are believed to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been no reports from the field indicating that any
of them are casualties,'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada flew to nearby Zamboanga city on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are banking on you,'' he told Gen. Narciso Abaya. The
general replied that the assault could take three days to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said his top priority was rescuing the hostages, but
also ordered the military to ''destroy the Abu Sayyaf so they can
no longer engage in kidnapping activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The military took over two rebel camps, including the one where
two French television journalists had been held, but found no
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Mortars pounded rebel positions in the hills of Jolo as attack
planes and helicopter gunships fired missiles and bullets from
above.
</P>
<P>
   One woman died and four other civilians were treated at a Jolo
hospital. They said they were in a group of about 10 people strafed
by military gunfire. Other injured civilians were unable to pass
through tight military blockades to reach the hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said six rebels had been killed and 20 captured since
Saturday. Four government soldiers were wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang called a government
emissary after the attack began Saturday and asked for a
cease-fire, but did not offer to release the hostages, chief
government negotiator Robert Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said the chances of the request being accepted by the
government were ''almost nil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is seeking an independent Islamic state in the
predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines. They have taken hostages
for ransom, reportedly receiving $15 million from Libya and
Malaysia for captives freed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the French journalists, various Abu Sayyaf
factions are holding an American, a Filipino who was kidnapped with
a larger group in April, 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who came
to pray at the camp and three Malaysians abducted Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian defense minister Najib Tun Razak said Sunday the three
resort workers kidnapped last week from Pandanan Semporna Island
were safe. Malaysian military officials on Jolo assured him of
this, the national Bernama news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it did not believe an unconfirmed report that
the American hostage, Muslim convert Jeffrey Schilling of Oakland,
Calif., was killed during an escape attempt Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a strong possibility he is still alive,'' Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was taken hostage Aug. 28 after he went to visit the
Abu Sayyaf camp and reportedly argued with the rebels. His mother,
Carol Schilling, remained hopeful and awaited word in her Oakland
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I firmly believe that he is still alive, and I just know in my
heart that he will return home to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had earlier threatened to attack southern Philippine
cities and behead Schilling if troops launched an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The military also was investigating unconfirmed reports that the
evangelists had been executed by a rebel firing squad after the
attack began, and the French journalists had escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of these have not been confirmed, and no bodies (of
hostages) have been found,'' presidential Press Secretary Ricardo
Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said the journalists are believed still to be with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Before their kidnapping spree began in March, there were fewer
than 200 armed men in the Abu Sayyaf. They now number more than
3,000 as massive ransom payments have attracted recruits, the
military says.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said Saturday he had decided to abandon negotiations
after the rebels seized the Malaysians, despite their earlier
pledge not to abduct more captives while talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone and transportation links to Jolo were cut, isolating
panicked villagers who streamed into the island's capital and
snapped up goods in crowded grocery stores.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges 'Full Democracy' in Peru  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The United States, which questioned the
legitimacy of Peru President Alberto Fujimori's re-election this
year, on Sunday urged a peaceful and open move to ''full
democracy'' after his surprise decision to call new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, reeling from a bribery scandal involving his closest
adviser, announced the new vote Saturday and said he will not be a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert, traveling in Pennsylvania
with President Clinton, pointed out that the United States has been
encouraging political reform since the elections in May.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Fujimori's decision, Siewert said, ''We hope that
all elements in Peru will work a peaceful and transparent process
to achieve full democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru's health minister said Sunday that the new elections would
probably be held in six months to seven months. Some opposition
leaders called for Fujimori to step down immediately and allow for
a transition government. Fujimori did not disclose his plans.
</P>
<P>
   After the May elections' first round, Clinton requested a delay
in the runoff because of ''well-documented concerns'' from
international monitors that Fujimori was cheating. Clinton said
democracy depends on ''free, fair and open elections.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Without them, our relationship with Peru inevitably will be
affected,'' Clinton said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori ignored Clinton's plea, and the principal challenger,
economist Alejandro Toledo, boycotted the runoff. After Fujimoro's
re-election, the State Department said the ''flawed process'' made
it impossible for him to ''claim legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   By late July, when Fujimori was sworn in, the Clinton
administration had not punished him but did join most of the
hemispheric democracies in boycotting his inaugural and asking that
Peru do a better job of staging democratic elections the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also avoided Peru when she
toured Latin America in August.

<HEADLINE> New NBC Show Not a Kramer Copy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Richards says he wasn't sure if there
was life after Kramer. Acting life, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I didn't really want to work,'' the former
''Seinfeld'' star said. ''There wasn't anything that was really
exciting me. So I thought I was going to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning a reported $13 million on the hit ''show about
nothing,'' Richards took it easy. He traveled, restored his home,
read classic books by authors like Herman Melville and did little
acting, outside of a role in the TNT version of ''David
Copperfield.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's back on NBC next month in ''The Michael Richards
Show,'' playing a befuddled detective.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mannerisms are the same, but Richards told the Los
Angeles Times for Sunday's editions he wants the audience to
realize he won't simply rehash his ''Seinfeld'' role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not the Kramer character,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Russian Cop Killed in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Attackers gunned down a pro-Russian police
official in one of Chechnya's most volatile southern towns, news
reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Shamil Azayev, deputy chief of police in Vedeno, was killed
Saturday night when unidentified gunmen drove by his home and
opened fire with automatic rifles, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel forces frequently target pro-Russian officials in Chechnya
to intimidate them against cooperating with the Kremlin. Vedeno, in
Chechnya's southern mountains, is surrounded by rebel-controlled
territory and the Russian forces' grip there is shaky.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels occupy much of southern Chechnya, and have had little
trouble launching ambushes and raids there and in the
Russia-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, military officials forcibly stopped a live
broadcast from the federal headquarters in Chechnya's capital
Grozny on the NTV nationwide television network.
</P>
<P>
   A crew from privately-owned NTV, a vocal critic of the Kremlin,
was interviewing an officer who claimed he had watched servicemen
throw an NTV cameraman to the ground and pin him down to keep him
from filming an outspoken pro-Russian Chechen leader, Bislan
Gantamirov.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the live spot on the Itogi weekly news program,
a hand covered the camera lens, while the reporter protested. The
link was soon cut off.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear who blocked the filming and why. The military
headquarters could not be reached for comment Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The military has strictly controlled media coverage of the war,
citing safety reasons, and has occasionally detained and questioned
Russian and foreign journalists in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came a day after the head of the pro-Russian
civilian government in Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov, criticized the
Russian military for its harsh actions in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe arrived in Moscow on Sunday to check on human
rights in Chechnya, Russian news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly, which has sent several delegations to Chechnya,
has sharply criticized the Russian army's human rights record, and
suspended Russia's voting rights in the assembly in protest this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces returned to Chechnya last September after rebel
raids on a neighboring region and four bomb blasts across Russia
that killed some 300 people. Russia blamed the blasts on Chechen
rebels, though no one has been convicted of involvement in
explosions.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For six years, Jakob Dylan never mentioned
the word ''dad'' in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When your father is pop icon Bob Dylan, it's hard to step out of
his shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was always aware that there was no story to talk about

   However, after his band, the Wallflowers, won Grammys and sold 5
million albums, Dylan is coming to terms with his famous lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is, I am very proud of my heritage,'' he said. ''The
only thing I ask is to be taken at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   He says it didn't seem like a ''big deal'' growing up in a

   COOKEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dolly Parton has appeared in films
before.
</P>
<P>
   But the entertainer admits that the prospect of appearing on an
IMAX movie screen seven stories tall has her feeling a little
intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm already larger than life, but in this movie I'm gonna be

<P>
   ''Lord, I'm scared to see it, but I'm proud to be part of it.''

<P>
   The as-yet untitled large-format movie is a project of Gaylord
Entertainment Co., which owns the Grand Ole Opry among other major
country music entertainment properties. It is scheduled to premiere
in Nashville in June and eventually go on the IMAX theater circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The movie showcases country music and various subgenres
including bluegrass, mountain, gospel, honky-tonk, rockabilly,
Western swing, cowboy and contemporary country.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes The Dixie Chicks, Martina McBride, Alan

<HEADLINE> Analysis of new Conservative Party ad  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of a new television advertisement from
the
Conservative Party.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIME: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   TITLE: See Your Doctor.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Warfield &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMARY AND TEXT: The ad, on behalf of Rep. Rick Lazio, takes
Lazio opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton to task for her role as the
head of a presidential commission charged with reshaping the
nation's health care system in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The ad opens with an unflattering picture of the first lady and
a male voice asking, ''Remember the last time we trusted Hillary
Clinton with an important job in Washington?''
</P>
<P>
   A female hand, meant to be Clinton's, is shown playing the
children's game ''Operation.'' She is performing poorly, setting
off the game's buzzer and sending sparks flying. The narrator says
that Clinton ''proposed a government-run system, a bureaucratic
plan of rationing that destroyed your choice of doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator adds, that Clinton ''worked in secret and had to be
sued to disclose the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad concludes with the narrator saying, ''So if you trust
Hillary Clinton, maybe you should see your doctor, while you still
can.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The ad goes after what could be one of Clinton's
vulnerable spots: Her handling of the Clinton administration's
failed universal health care plan. Clinton led closed-door meetings
with policy experts, keeping the public in the dark about what was
going on. Once the plan became public, it died a quick death, in
part because of concerns about its high costs, the federal
government's broad role in managing care, and the fact that people
may not have been able to choose their own physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has acknowledged that she did not handle the health care
plan well, and the Lazio campaign has hammered her on the issue of
late, questioning her management style and judgment, and seeking to
portray her as someone ill-equipped to take on complicated issues
that require sensitive handling.
</P>
<P>
   The word ''trust'' is emphasized in the ad, a continuation of an
effort by the Republican Party to label Clinton as untrustworthy,
or as Lazio says, ''Clintonesque.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad however, could cause unintended negative consequences for
Lazio. During last week's debate, Lazio theatrically challenged
Clinton to sign a contract barring the use of soft money in the
final two months of the campaign. The ad, however, is paid for by
the Conservative Party - a use of soft money that Lazio professes
to be opposed to.

<HEADLINE> Germans To Get Fuel Tax Relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Traffic flowed relatively smoothly across Europe
on Sunday as truckers, farmers and others angry about climbing fuel
costs took a break after more than a week of protests.
</P>
<P>
   The German goverment was preparing measures to help commuters
pay for gas and needy apartment dwellers pay for heating oil, the
Finance Ministry said Sunday. Details of the measures will be
announced in the next few days, a spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported that Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and Finance Minister Hans Eichel have already agreed to
earmark $444 million to help the 2 million Germans receiving
housing assistance to pay for heating oil this winter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government will raise the amount people who
drive to work can claim as a tax write-off from 30 to 40 cents per
kilometer, starting in 2001, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers in Stockholm and Goteborg, Sweden's two biggest cities,
were planning protests Monday, according to spokesman Adam
Flamholc, with other cities joining Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   French truckers began demonstrations Sept. 4, winning a tax
break from Paris and inspiring protests in other countries.
Motorists in several other countries also have won concessions,
while governments in Britain and Germany have refused to cut fuel
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   German truckers were planning a nationwide day of protest on
Sept. 26.

<HEADLINE> French Question Basque Separatists  </HEADLINE>
By PAMELA SAMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, France (AP) -- French authorities launched a large-scale
weekend sweep against Basque separatists, bringing in 11 people for
questioning, seizing weapons and uncovering a clandestine
bomb-making factory.
</P>
<P>
   Six of those apprehended Saturday night are suspected of
belonging to ETA, an armed group that has been fighting for an
independent Basque homeland in northern Spain. The other five are
suspected of lodging the suspects at homes in southwestern France.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said Sunday the
police action caused ''almost irreparable damage'' to ETA because
some suspects play key roles in the group's forgery and logistical
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the expertise that allows them to put bombs in
vehicles,'' Mayor Oreja told Spanish media. ''It will be hard to
replace these people with so much experience in the area of
logistics and electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those taken into custody Saturday were six Spaniards: Juan
Angel Otxoantesana-Badiola, Ignacio Santesteban-Goikoetxea, Angel
Pikabea-Ugalde, Maria del Rosario Delgado-Iriondo, Jesus Maria
Zabala-Muguirra and Jose Luis Turrillas-Aranceta, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Turrillas-Aranceta was identified as the head of ETA's
logistical unit.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they also found two large weapons caches and
uncovered a small weapons factory that belonged to ETA. Both
caches, which included dynamite and detonators, were found on farms
in the southwestern Landes region. The factory was found not far
away, in the small town of Sare.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin issued a statement
praising Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant and law enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has reaffirmed its determination to fight
against all forms of terrorism and to cooperate fully with the
Spanish authorities,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar,
French President Jacques Chirac said he was ''very pleased'' by the
cooperation demonstrated by France and Spain and said it stood an
example of European unity.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began just a day after the arrest of Jose Ignacio
Gracia Arregui in the French town of Bidart. Spanish authorities
consider him the leader of the military wing of ETA and suspect him
of ordering a 1995 assassination attempt against King Juan Carlos
of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has claimed responsibility for the deaths of nearly 800
people since 1968 in its campaign for Basque independence. It ended
a 14-month truce last December and has since been blamed for 12
killings, eight of them since June.
</P>
<P>
   The group, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has mostly targeted security force members, but in recent years has
begun killing members of both the Popular Party and the Socialist
opposition, both of whom oppose Basque independence.
</P>
<P>
   The French Basque region, just across the border with Spain, has
long served as a haven for militant Spanish Basques.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine To Protect Against Herpes  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Researchers have made the first vaccine that
protects against genital herpes. But there is a major catch: It
works only in women and only if they have never had cold sores.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported Sunday, are a surprise. Until now, no
vaccine has ever been shown to work in one sex but not the other.
Experts say this could present unexpected trouble for creating
other vaccines for sexually transmitted diseases, such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The results were not the clear home run that the vaccine's
developer, SmithKline Beecham, had hoped when it began designing
the latest studies a decade ago. Further testing will almost
certainly be required for the drug to be approved, assuming that
the company keeps working on the product.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, doctors say a vaccine that offers even partial
protection against a chronic disease is noteworthy. The only other
sexually transmitted disease that can be stopped with a vaccine is
hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say the chances are good but not at all certain'' that
the herpes vaccine will eventually be approved for routine use,
said Dr. Spotswood Spruance of the University of Utah, one of those
who tested it.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the vaccine would be given to adolescent girls.
Widespread use of the vaccine this way would probably reduce
genital herpes for both sexes, since it would lower the chance of
men coming in contact with infected females.
</P>
<P>
   Genital herpes and cold sores result from closely related bugs.
Herpes simplex virus type 1, or HSV-1, causes fever blisters on the
mouth, while HSV-2 triggers sores on the genitals. Once acquired,
both infections last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Both infections grow more common with age. Recent surveys
suggest that in the United States, 45 million people ages 12 and
older are infected with the genital herpes virus.
</P>
<P>
   Spruance and colleagues reported the results of two major
studies of the vaccine at a meeting in Toronto of the American
Society for Microbiology. Both were conducted on couples in which
one partner had genital herpes but the other did not. The studies
involved more than 2,700 people in the United States, Canada,
Australia, Italy and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the studies, the partners who were free of genital
herpes had never been infected with either HSV-1 nor HSV-2, while
the other included those who had HSV-1 but not HSV-2.
</P>
<P>
   During 19 months of follow up, it turned out that the vaccine
did nothing to protect men or to protect women who already had
HSV-1. However, it was about 75 percent effective in warding of
genital herpes sores in women who had never had either form of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 percent got genital herpes after taking the vaccine,
compared with about 11 percent of those receiving dummy shots.
Another 3 percent of those getting the vaccine became infected but
never developed genital sores.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that being infected with HSV-1 probably
helps protect people from getting genital herpes, and the vaccine
does little to increase this natural barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Why the vaccine works in women but not men is unclear, although
the researchers said it probably has something to do with
differences in sexual anatomy. Perhaps the vaccine boosts the
immune system so it can attack the herpes virus while still in the
vagina, but it is unable to stop the virus after it gains access to
the bloodstream through tiny tears in the penis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results are not exactly what we expected,'' said Gary
Dubin, who heads adolescent vaccine development for SmithKline
Beecham in Belgium. He said the company is getting reaction from
regulators and public health officials before deciding what to do
next.
</P>
<P>
   However, Spruance said the vaccine could be targeted at girls
ages 10 to 13. At this age, about half have not yet been infected
with either form of the herpes virus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its drawbacks, the vaccine ''really looks very
effective. It seems potentially useful,'' commented Dr. William
Craig of the University of Wisconsin, head of the conference
program committee.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is made from a protein taken from the outer surface
of the herpes virus. It is combined with a bacterial toxin that
acts as an immune system booster.

<HEADLINE> Officials look for statewide solutions to traffic congestion  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   With traffic congestion becoming a growing concern in
Connecticut for commuters and businesses, officials are vowing to
take statewide action to ease the gridlock.
<TEXT>
<P>
   State and business leaders have scheduled a transportation
summit for Sept. 28 at the Sheraton Hotel in East Hartford.
Findings from the summit will be submitted to the General Assembly
for possible action during its next session, which starts in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all tired of studies. We want to see action,'' said
House Speaker Moira Lyons, D-Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic must be addressed on a statewide basis to prevent the
problem from affecting the state's economic development, Lyons, an
organizer of the summit, said last week at a forum of the
Connecticut Regional Institute for the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics provided by Lyons' office indicate that economic
development in Connecticut is growing one-tenth slower than the
national average. The slower growth is attributed to a lack of
workers and transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut Business &AMP; Industry Association survey of small-
and medium-sized companies released this month showed that 64
percent of respondents believed a first-rate transportation system
is important for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Rush hour traffic jams have already affected businesses in the
Stamford area, said Jack Condlin, president of the Stamford Chamber
of Commerce. Improvements to Interstate 95 are not keeping pace
with the city's burgeoning economy and the surge of workers coming
into the city, Condlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the same basic highway system we had in the 1950s,''
Condlin said. ''It's an existing highway system that was strained
20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60,000 people commute into Stamford daily, nearly double
the 35,000 who commuted into the city during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Commuting to work also has become increasingly difficult for
drivers who depend on interstates 91 and 84, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the problem is apparent, solutions are more complicated.
There are limits to highway construction, said Tanya Court,
executive director of the Southwest Regional Planning Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut can no longer build its way out of congestion,''
Court said.
</P>
<P>
   Court advocated reducing rush hour traffic by having businesses
offer staggered work hours. She also said officials must find ways
to have more goods shipped on rail lines to reduce the number of
large trucks on the state's highways.
</P>
<P>
   A widening of I-91 is unlikely for many years, so more public
transit is needed, said Richard J. Porth, executive director of the
Capitol Region Council of Governments.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said she wants the summit to be independent from political
considerations. She predicted that information from the event could
change the way state agencies approach transportation and economic
development projects.

<HEADLINE> New Jerseyans favor abolishing tenure for public school teachers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A majority of New Jersey residents think
public school teachers shouldn't have tenure, according to a
Gannett New Jersey poll released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if tenure should be retained or abolished, 59 percent
said it should be scrapped, while only 30 percent favored keeping
it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, seven out of 10 of those surveyed said teachers' pay
should be based on performance. Many liked using student scores on
standardized tests as a benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters randomly surveyed 551 New Jersey adults by phone from
Aug. 24 through Aug. 27. The poll has a margin of error of 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hannmann of Moorestown said there was probably a good
reason for creating tenure, but he still opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's counter to the way a lot of business is done, and it can
allow teachers to coast,'' he told the Gannett New Jersey Bureau
for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey Education Association spokeswoman said the poll
results indicate nothing new. Spokeswoman Lynn Maher said many
people don't understand that tenure simply requires hearings for
teachers before they can be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers qualify for tenure at the beginning of their fourth
year of work. After that, districts must follow a process that
allows teachers to defend themselves against complaints before they
can be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people have tenure, they don't have a job for life,''
Maher said. ''That's not what tenure is.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that more of the people surveyed would have
supported tenure if the word ''tenure'' was replaced with the term
''due process.''
</P>
<P>
   While tenured teachers can be fired, Michael Yaple of the New
Jersey School Boards Association said it's a difficult process most
districts are reluctant to undertake. Firing a teacher can take up
to 12 months and cost more than $100,000 in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The association opposes the current tenure system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Theoretically they can'' be fired, Yaple said. ''Occasionally,
they are. The blunt reality is it is so expensive to remove a
teacher and so lengthy that only the worst violations are (homed)
in on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaple said a 1994 survey done by the school boards association
indicated that districts undertook firing 30 tenured teachers in
1993. That was the last year the group did the survey, but he said
the number has probably stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   Maher said that survey isn't the best indication of how often
districts get rid of unsatisfactory teachers, because supervisors
instead often urge unsuccessful teachers to leave their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see a lot of people counseled out of teaching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey became the first state to provide tenure to teachers,
in 1909. The system was created to protect teachers from arbitrary
dismissals that occurred when control of city hall changed.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no movements to eliminate tenure in New Jersey,
Republican Assemblyman Guy Gregg of Morris County has proposed a
bill to eliminate tenure for principals and other administrators.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, tenure has become a hot issue. Georgia
eliminated tenure, and a Louisiana gubernatorial committee
recommends replacing it with individual contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also asked if a teacher's pay should be based on job
performance or something else. Seventy-one percent of the
respondents said job performance should be the basis and 17 percent
said something else. The other 12 percent said they were undecided
or it depended on circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what factors were most important in judging a teacher's
job performance, respondents ranked standardized test scores at the
top, and teacher experience and peer opinions at the bottom.

<HEADLINE> 'The Watcher' Stays in Top Spot  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''The Watcher,'' a thriller about a serial
killer tracking an FBI agent, held onto its No. 1 spot at the box
office for the second week in a row as theaters recorded one of the
lowest-grossing weekends in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The film starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa Tomei
pulled in just $5.7 million, according to box office estimates
Sunday, for the smallest take of any No. 1 film since Super Bowl
weekend in January 1997, said Paul Dergarabedian of Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc., a box office tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is now the eighth down weekend in a row versus the same
weekend last year,'' he said. ''This is a time (of year) when
people are doing other things. Without a momentum keeping people's
interest in moviegoing, you're going to have this slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of ''Bait,'' a comedy starring Jamie Foxx as a thief
used by the feds to track a master gold thief, came in second with
$5.5 million, followed by ''Bring It On,'' which pulled in $5.1
million in its fourth week.
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow's turn as a karaoke singer in ''Duets,'' the
weekend's other new release, brought in $2 million on 581 screens
for a per-screen average of $3,442, tying at ninth place with
''Scary Movie'' in its eleventh week.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's bright spot was the limited-release opening of
DreamWorks' ''Almost Famous,'' Dergarabedian said. The film opened
in eighth place with $2.3 million on just 131 screens for a
blockbuster per-screen average of $17,557.
</P>
<P>
   The film fictionalizes Cameron Crowe's teen-age days writing
rock 'n roll for Rolling Stone magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost Famous'' will appear in a few more theaters next
weekend and will open in wide release Sept. 29, Dergarabedian said.
He predicted the film, along with the release of Denzel
Washington's ''Remember the Titans,'' will reinvigorate the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 films this weekend grossed an estimated $38.1
million, while the top 12 films in this same weekend last year
grossed $67.4 million. ''Blue Streak,'' the top film in this
weekend last year, grossed $19.2 million followed by ''For Love of
the Game'' with $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''The Watcher,'' $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Bait,'' $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Bring It On,'' $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Nurse Betty,'' $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Space Cowboys,'' $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''The Cell,'' $2.45 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Almost Famous,'' $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Duets,'' $2 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gunfire unnerves Utica neighborhoods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Residents here already plagued by crime have
been even more unnerved in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight people were wounded and three remain hospitalized
in five separate, unrelated shootings which ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Tim Julian said the city is trying to make a dent in the
violence. Last week, city and Oneida County officials formed a
Major Crimes Investigations Unit to combat serious felonies. The
task force will combine Utica officers with state troopers and
sheriffs deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a little jumpy,'' said 60-year-old Annie Bell, who can
watch from her front porch as youths sell drugs on a nearby corner
that has become as popular as a fast-food drive-through. ''That's
the way most people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell moved into her home in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a nice street back then,'' she said. ''People around
here don't even come out here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some pizza shops wont deliver to homes on her street, she
said, glancing at an empty, gravel-strewn corner farther down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been getting really bad the past six or seven months,''
Bell said. ''Summer was really bad over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Nardell, a 75-year-old Utican sometimes known as ''the
James Street Historian'' spoke sadly of the changes for the worse
he's seen over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was down there that the boy was shot,'' he said, referring
to the Sept. 9 shooting of 16-year-old Eugene James.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the kids,'' he said. ''They have no respect for people,
hanging out in the middle of the street making noise, using bad
language, very bad. When they get together in groups, anything
goes. That's why you don't see a lot of old people out. They just
treat people with contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nardell does not fault police. They do the best they can, he
said. But the prostitutes who turn away for a moment as a squad car
passes, or the drug dealers, scarcely pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Makarri knows all about the problems. Makarri closed his
discount store temporarily this summer to return to his native
Syria. While he was gone, youths broke into the store five
different times, smashing through the front window, the front door,
and the back door.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves sold his stock openly on the street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard they were saying 'buy one, get three free,''' said
Makarri, who wasn't sure if he would re-open.

<HEADLINE> Onondaga Lake gets cleaner as ammonia levels fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Scientists have detected the first signs
that Onondaga Lake, one of the most polluted bodies of water in the
country, is slowly but surely becoming cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   But the newfound evidence of a cleaner lake is the scourge of
healthy waterways across North America: the zebra mussel.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Onondaga Lake's waters were too toxic for zebra
mussels to proliferate. In 1997 and 1998, the lake had few, if any,
established zebra mussel colonies.
</P>
<P>
   That changed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Upstate Freshwater Institute in Syracuse last
month completed a study along the shoreline and found millions of
zebra mussels.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists estimate 200 to 600 million zebra mussels now
live in Onondaga Lake, a federal toxic waste site lined with
mercury and reputed to be the most polluted lake in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a zebra mussel infestation, absolutely,'' said Steven
Effler, Upstate's director of research. ''And it has the potential
for major water quality implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Onondaga County began a 15-year, $380 million cleanup effort
last year to stop sewage pollution of the lake, complying with a
federal court order.
</P>
<P>
   Effler said scientists saw the start of the zebra mussel boom as
levels of ammonia discharged from the county's sewage plant last
summer reached the lowest level recorded. The ammonia remained
extremely low this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the smoking gun on ammonia in Onondaga Lake,'' said
Effler, who has spent 25 years studying the lake's pollution. ''As
soon as the ammonia drops, we get the ammonia-sensitive organisms
returning to the lake. But who would have thought it would be zebra
mussels?''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the near-shore zone in Onondaga Lake is
covered with zebra mussels. In some spots, the mussels are
concentrated in densities of more than 3,000 per square meter.
</P>
<P>
   The dime-sized mollusks were discovered in North America in 1988
after entering the Great Lakes in ballast water of ships from
Europe. Since then, the mussels have spread to every large lake and
river across Central New York and down the Mississippi River as far
south as New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, zebra mussels attached themselves to almost any
hard surface in lakes and rivers, clogging water pipelines and
upsetting the ecological balance in those waterways. The zebra
mussel is the only freshwater mollusk that can firmly attach itself
to solid objects. Experts have predicted the mussels will cause $5
billion in damage in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Key Facts About Peru  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Key facts about Peru, which President Alberto
Fujimori put on a
path for new general elections late Saturday in a surprise
announcement, saying he would not stand as a candidate and would
deactivate his feared intelligence service:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   --Alberto Fujimori, 62, was first elected in 1990 as a political
unknown. He seized dictatorial powers in April 1992, dissolving
Congress and closing the courts. A new constitution was written and
a new Congress elected, dominated by his supporters. He was
re-elected in 1995 by Peruvians grateful to him for stemming
guerrilla violence and ending the economic chaos of the 1980s. He
won an unprecedented third five-year term in May amid rampant
irregularities and allegations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   --Vladimiro Montesinos, 54, was, until Saturday, Fujimori's top
adviser and the head of Peru's intelligence network. He was widely
believed to control the courts, the attorney general's office and
the armed forces. In the early 1990s, Fujimori and Montesinos set
out to co-opt Peru's military, eliminating a time-honored promotion
system based on seniority and merit and installing loyalists in key
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's foes accuse Montesinos of spearheading smear
campaigns against Fujimori's opponents in the recent presidential
elections. His intelligence service also has been linked to death
squad killings and torture.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY: Roughly the size of Alaska, Peru is the third-largest
country in South America. Flanked by the Pacific Ocean to the west,
it is bordered by Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil and
Bolivia to the east, and Chile to the south. More than 30 percent
of the population of 25 million lives in the capital, Lima. Peru is
divided into three geographical regions: the coastal desert, the
Andean highlands, and the Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY: In the early 1990s, Fujimori tamed hyperinflation,
reversed Peru's pariah image with international lenders and
implemented neoliberal, free-market policies with remarkable
success. Growth averaged more than 7 percent annually, but the
trend ended in his second term, as Asian financial turmoil spread
throughout Latin America and Peru was rocked by the El Nino weather
phenomenon. About half the population lives in poverty and only one
in two people in the labor force has steady work.

<HEADLINE> Serb Troops Gather in Albanian Areas  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOBROSIN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The leader of an ethnic Albanian
rebel army in southern Serbia claimed Sunday that Serbian forces
are massing in the Albanian-majority region in the run-up to
Yugoslav elections.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group is prepared to fight back if the Serbs attack
ahead of the Sept. 24 presidential and parliamentary elections,
said Bexhet Mehmeti, a commander in the Liberation Army of Presevo,
Medvedja and Bujanovac, known by its Albanian-language acronym
UCPMB.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of Serb forces has been increasing recently and
continuously. There are reinforcements around this area,'' Mehmeti
told reporters, flanked by two men armed with rifles and wearing
uniforms with the group's red and black insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmeti claimed the Yugoslav government may try to distract
attention from problems inside Serbia during the election by
creating tension in the sensitive area near the U.S.-patrolled
Kosovo boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade considers the UCPMB a terrorist organization and blames
it for numerous attacks on its forces. It also claims a number of
Serbs have fled the region.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmeti said the UCPMB would boycott next week's elections -- a
precedent set by rebel Albanians in Kosovo in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The group first appeared in January. It is unclear how large the
rebel force is, although it claims to have support and potential
fighters throughout the ethnic Albanian majority area of southern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers have repeatedly said they do not support
the rebels' actions and have conducted several raids on suspected
weapons stockpiles of the group inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers moved into Kosovo last year, following NATO
bombing aimed at halting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade on Sunday, three student activists were sentenced to
10 days in prison each for spraying anti-government graffiti. A
Serbian court found them guilty of violating ''law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Otpor, which translates as ''Resistance,'' the
students were accused of scrawling ''He's finished'' on buildings
in a Belgrade suburb Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan referred to Milosevic, who hopes to be re-elected
president. Independent polls show him trailing the leading
opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica warned Saturday evening that Milosevic would use
''thugs and liars'' to rig the upcoming ballot if necessary to stay
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, 15 activists from the non-governmental Center for
Free Elections and Democracy were arrested while attending a course
for elections monitors in the central Serbian town of Knic, the
independent Beta news agency reported. They were released later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which hopes to monitor the ballot, has been targeted
by the authorities, who raided several of their offices recently.

<HEADLINE> 'The Watcher' Leads Dull Weekend  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''The Watcher,'' a thriller about a serial
killer tracking an FBI agent, held onto its No. 1 spot at the box
office for the second week in a row as theaters recorded one of the
lowest-grossing weekends in years.
</P>
<P>
   The film starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa Tomei
pulled in just $5.7 million, according to box office estimates
Sunday, for the smallest take of any No. 1 film since Super Bowl
weekend in January 1997, said Paul Dergarabedian of Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc., a box office tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is now the eighth down weekend in a row versus the same
weekend last year,'' he said. ''This is a time (of year) when
people are doing other things. Without a momentum keeping people's
interest in moviegoing, you're going to have this slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of ''Bait,'' a comedy starring Jamie Foxx as a thief
used by the feds to track a master gold thief, came in second with
$5.5 million, followed by ''Bring It On,'' which pulled in $5.1
million in its fourth week.
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow's turn as a karaoke singer in ''Duets,'' the
weekend's other new release, brought in $2 million on 581 screens
for a per-screen average of $3,442, tying at ninth place with
''Scary Movie'' in its eleventh week.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's bright spot was the limited-release opening of
DreamWorks' ''Almost Famous,'' Dergarabedian said. The film opened
in eighth place with $2.3 million on just 131 screens for a
blockbuster per-screen average of $17,557.
</P>
<P>
   The film fictionalizes Cameron Crowe's teen-age days writing
rock 'n roll for Rolling Stone magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost Famous'' will appear in a few more theaters next
weekend and will open in wide release Sept. 29, Dergarabedian said.
He predicted the film, along with the release of Denzel
Washington's ''Remember the Titans,'' will reinvigorate the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 films this weekend grossed an estimated $38.1
million, while the top 12 films in this same weekend last year
grossed $67.4 million. ''Blue Streak,'' the top film in this
weekend last year, grossed $19.2 million followed by ''For Love of
the Game'' with $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''The Watcher,'' $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Bait,'' $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Bring It On,'' $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Nurse Betty,'' $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Space Cowboys,'' $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''The Cell,'' $2.45 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Almost Famous,'' $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Duets,'' $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Scary Movie,'' $2 million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Celebrates Constitution  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Clinton marked the 213th
anniversary of the signing of the Constitution by attending the
groundbreaking Sunday for a museum that will tell the historical
document's story.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also watched as 72 immigrants from 23 countries became
U.S. citizens. Earlier on the short visit, he spoke at a reception
that raised $50,000 for first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's New
York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The main event was held at the future site of the National
Constitution Center, which will feature interactive displays, live
theater and high-tech exhibits about the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The $105 million museum is the cornerstone of a $200 million
renovation at Independence Mall, an area where Thomas Jefferson and
Benjamin Franklin strolled when the city was the seat of power in
America in the late 1770s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We revere the Constitution because it is at the core of who we
are,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The protections guaranteed by the Constitution were cited by
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who joined the president on stage and
mentioned the government's handling of the Wen Ho Lee case. Lee is
the nuclear scientist who went free last week after pleading guilty
to taking classified material from Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to understand how a man can be a major threat to
national security one day and walk free the next,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, has raised questions about the fact that Lee's
plea came shortly after the government argued that he needed to
remain in jail without bail. The president said that flew in the
face of the nation's opposition to ''abusive executive authority.''
</P>
<P>
   During the naturalization ceremony, Clinton joined in reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   As the president and Susan Yuh, a 24-year-old from South Korea,
signed their names to a construction beam suspended by a crane at
the museum site, a choir sang ''America'' and red, white, and blue
streamers fell over the audience of more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''About four months from now, I will change jobs and I will be
restored to the title that Harry Truman once said is the most
important title an American can have -- that of citizen,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country is great because there are good people who get up
everyday and do their very best and live their dreams ... because
this country has a system inscribed in the Constitution that gives
them the maximum opportunity to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first stop in Philadelphia was the City Tavern, a
reconstruction of a late 18th century landmark where members of the
First Continental Congress gathered in the 1770s. The event raised
about $50,000 for the Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also turned to presidential politics, noting that after
the parties' nominating conventions, the race becomes ''an
elaborate chess game'' for the 270 electoral votes needed to win
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pennsylvania has 23 votes and it's also in the heartland of
America with Ohio and Michigan and Illinois and Wisconsin and
Minnesota,'' Clinton said. ''And if you have Pennsylvania, it
drastically increases your changes of carrying New Jersey and of
carrying Ohio. No Republican has been elected since the Civil War
without carrying Ohio and it is very hard for a Democrat to be
elected without carrying Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls give Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
nominee, wide leads over Republican George W. Bush in Pennsylvanian
and Illinois, an edge in Michigan, and a tie in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic internal surveys reflect the same general picture in
those states, except they are not quite as far ahead in
Pennsylvania. Republican internal polling suggests that Bush is in
better shape -- ahead in Ohio, close or slightly ahead in Michigan
and trailing slightly in Illinois and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Police Fire into Riot killing 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Police fired at mobs of rival political
groups during municipal elections in a western Indian state Sunday,
leaving seven people dead, a domestic news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people were injured in stabbing and other incidents of
violence during the clashes between political activists, Press
Trust of India reported. The news agency did not identify the rival
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Ahmedabad in Gujarat state fired at the rioters after
tear gas shells failed to disperse them, PTI said. Three people
were killed on the spot and four died of bullet wounds in a
hospital, it reported.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes occurred after members of rival political parties
argued over balloting in some booths in Ahmedabad, one of the main
trading centers in the state. Authorities imposed a curfew in the
worst-affected areas and polling was suspended in dozens of booths.
</P>
<P>
   Few other details were immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM To Be Honored at Dinner  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House prepared a lavish official
dinner Sunday for Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, more
evidence of a warming relationship with a nuclear power in a
dangerous part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the cold shoulder given last week to the military
ruler of India's nuclear rival, Pakistan, President Clinton invited
Vajpayee to a South Lawn Pavilion tent filled with fall fruits and
tables adorned with gold-base plates, cream china and gold candles.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 700 guests were invited for the largest official dinner
of the Clinton presidency to honor a single visiting dignitary.
Only a NATO summit dinner for 19 heads of state was larger.
</P>
<P>
   With crystal chandeliers hanging above tables bedecked with
hydrangea, guests were to feast on wild Copper River salmon with
red kuri squash and rice bean ragout for a main course. The dessert
menu included mango and banner lotus, litchis and raspberry sauce,
honey almond squares and chocolate coconut bars.
</P>
<P>
   For entertainment, the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton
invited the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York,
where the first lady is seeking a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Vajpayee's address Thursday to Congress, the
prime minister's visit took on a serious tone because of India's
resumption of nuclear testing in 1998, its explosive feud with
Pakistan and its rocky relationship with the United States during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In this presidential election year, both parties are courting
Indian-Americans, who are becoming an important political force
that is influential in U.S. high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list was dominated by Indian-Americans from all walks
of life. Among those invited: Clarence Chandran, chief operating
officer of Nortel Networks; NASA astronaut Dr. Kalpana Chawla; Dr.
B. K. Angnihotri, chancellor of the Southern University Law Center;
Dr. Satya Ahuja, past president of the American Association of
Physicians of Indian Origin; tennis player Vijay Amritaj.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities included model-turned environmental activist
Christie Brinkley, actor Chevy Chase, singer Melissa Etheridge and
author Elie Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was a big contrast from the recent reception for
Pakistani ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who was in New York for the
Millennium Summit. Clinton kept his distance from the military
ruler who overthrew an elected government and leads a country with
links to radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, 75, has not had an easy time physically on this visit.
He has chronic pain in his left knee from osteoarthritis, which
erodes the cartilage around the knee. He will have knee replacement
surgery in India.

Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Sunday to avoid taking any
''aggressive action'' against his country's neighbors, saying the
United States and Britain could defeat any threat.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait urged world leaders Sunday to take steps to restrain Iraq
from threatening the emirate or stability in the Persian Gulf as a
whole after Baghdad warned last week that it would take action to
stop what it called Kuwaiti theft of its oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Saddam should ''understand that the United States and
our British friends are fully prepared to take whatever action is
necessary to prevent him from trying to repeat his past actions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can certainly handle Saddam should he choose to take any
kind of aggressive action,'' he said aboard the USS Germantown, a
warship docked in Singapore, one of the stops on his six-nation
Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
   Tension increased in the Middle East last week when Iraq accused
Kuwait of drilling wells that allow it to siphon Iraqi oil and
warned that it would move to halt its smaller neighbor's action.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq historically has accused Kuwait of stealing its oil, one of
the justifications it made for invading in 1990. A U.S.-led
coalition army drove Iraq from Kuwait seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Iraq also has flown a jet fighter over
Saudi airspace for the first time in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaiti Cabinet ministers discussed Iraq's recent threats
Sunday, Interior Minister Sheik Mohammed Al Khaled Al Sabah said,
calling the Iraqi accusation ''baseless'' and an attempt to create
regional instability.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait ''calls on the international community to take serious
steps against the Iraqi regime's threats and to take all the needed
measures to guarantee that it does not repeat its threats against
Kuwait and regional countries,'' the state-run Kuwait News Agency
quoted Sheik Mohammed as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Sheik Salem Al Sabah said in an interview
published Sunday the Iraqi leadership ''will pay a high price this
time if it carries out any foolish military act against Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Iraqi regime's continuous threats do not scare us, whether
they are serious or for political consumption,'' Sheik Salem was
quoted as telling Al-Rai Al-Am daily.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi official said late Sunday that Baghdad was not making
threats and that it meant only that it would take ''technical
measures'' to prevent Kuwaiti theft of its oil. The Iraqi comments
were ''explained by others differently as it suited them,'' the
official said on condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   Friction between the United States and Iraq has been rising,
mainly over renewed efforts to have U.N. inspectors search for
hidden weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has announced plans to give $8 million to
Saddam's political foes and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned Iraq risks American attack if it crosses U.S. ''red lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also met with Iraqi dissidents to discuss building a
war crimes case against Saddam and took several opportunities
during the recent U.N. Millennium summit to denounce Saddam and his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Saddam ordered his party members last week to
conduct military training year-round; he said it was necessary
''because our enemy is fighting us in all fields.'' Military
training is usually conducted during crises and summer vacations
only.

<HEADLINE> Interest rises in race for Boehlert's seat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - A lackluster primary showing and tensions
over an Indian land claim have combined to heighten anticipation
over veteran Congressman Sherwood Boehlert's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, 63, is seeking his 10th term in the House of
Representatives. In last week's primary, he narrowly defeated David
Vickers, a 35-year-old Spanish teacher at Hamilton High School.
Vickers, who will run in the general election on the Conservative
and Right To Life lines, has been telling voters they need a change
in the 23rd Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmer and political rookie Richard Engelbrecht is the
choice of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have agreed to at least three debates and those
meetings and money may determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert spent $150 for every $1 Vickers spent in the months
before the primary, which Boehlert won 56 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Utica pollster John Zogby has predicted that Boehlert, with the
Republican and Independence parties' lines, will win decisively
over Vickers.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be sure, (Boehlert's) Republican base will come out to
vote,'' Zogby said. ''He'll win and win big, but he can expect Mr.
Vickers ... to be looking over his shoulder for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert blamed low voter turnout for his unconvincing
performance at the polls while Vickers complained the media hasn't
taken his candidacy seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert's supporters didn't come out on the rainy Primary Day,
possibly because he didn't do ''the aggressive kind of
get-out-to-vote campaign,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers rallied a ''more passionate following'' for his right
wing, pro-life, anti-Oneida Indian land claim agenda, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby predicts Vickers won't add to the 10,000-plus votes he
mustered in the primary. But Vickers has other ideas. He said he
will focus on convincing voters he could get results in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will address issues. I will not sit on fences,'' Vickers
said. ''I'm going to offer a very positive alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelbrecht, with the spotlight on his opponents during primary
season, has lurked in the background. Zogby said the 56-year-old
Madison farmer will get votes on the Democratic line and from Green
Party members but doesn't pose much of a threat to Boehlert.
</P>
<P>
   But Engelbrecht, a 28-year member of the Madison-Oneida BOCES
Board of Education, said Boehlert and Vickers will split much of
the Republican vote, leaving the door open for him.
</P>
<P>
   To have a chance, Engelbrecht knows he has to get his name and
message out in Oneida County. He said he has visited other counties
in the 23rd district but has yet to make his presence felt in
Oneida County.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Boehlert said he will step up his publicity
campaign, especially in Madison County and western Oneida County,
where the Oneida Indian Nation land claim is paramount to many
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not been able to prove to people in the land claim we
have been working on their behalf,'' Boehlert said. ''I have to
redouble my efforts to prove to the landowners that I'm working in
their interest and I have been for some time now.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said he will continue to tout his 18-year record of
fighting for district residents in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point is, in a campaign you have to tell people what you
have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But voters in the land-claim territory who say Boehlert hasn't
done enough to calm their fears of losing their land helped Vickers
get 66 percent of the primary in Madison County, his home turf.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas are seeking compensation for 250,000 acres in Oneida
and Madison counties they claim were wrongly taken from them in the
late 18th and early 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been high in the land-claim territory since
December 1998, when the Oneidas asked the court to include the
owners of some 20,000 parcels as defendants in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Engelbrecht said he can steal some votes from residents in the
land-claim territory as well. He favors a quick resolution to all
Indian land claims and said the state and federal governments
should pay Indians for past wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to abolish the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs,
which he said has ''moved and manipulated the Native American
people to a point of near destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickers, meanwhile, said he will continue to raise questions
about Boehlert's Congressional record.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's blood in the water, and I think everyone knows that,''
he said. ''He's got to fend off a lot of sharks.''

<HEADLINE> As suburbs develop, cartographer tries to record web of new roads  </HEADLINE>
phqjp
<TEXT>
<P>
   KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa. (AP) - Few know better than Andy Amsterdam
about how Philadelphia's suburbs have turned into a confounding web
of Picket Post Ways, Red Fox Circles, and Hunting Horn Lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam is a mapmaker and part of his job is making sure the
maps he produces keep up with new streets, new names and new
developments.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, there were about 18,000 streets in the four
Pennsylvania counties bordering Philadelphia. Today, there are
nearly 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam, a mapmaker of 40 years, owns Franklin Maps in King of
Prussia. His father, Lewis, started the company in 1928 and it
remains one of only a handful of local mapmakers, with annual sales
of about 150,000 maps. Its books cover 19 counties in southeast and
central Pennsylvania and south and central New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Mapping Philadelphia is easy - its 2,792 streets remain
essentially unchanged year-to-year.
</P>
<P>
   The suburbs, however, are a cartographer's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   As chief researcher, Amsterdam digs through tax files, deed
books, zoning maps and building permits to keep up with
development. He also drives through every new development in search
of street signs, sometimes before the pavement is even put down.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's county maps are generally updated every 18 months and
it takes the company about three months to produce a map. Still, by
the time a map is printed, it is probably out of date.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting to the point where we'll no longer be able to
show all the streets on the map - there's so many,'' said Mike
Stokes, a Montgomery County planner.
</P>
<P>
   There are also practical hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Newer developments employ spidery cul-de-sacs that, when shown
on a map, are too short for the grandiose names they'd been given.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yuppie names like Fox Hunt Drive and Blue Jay Way,'' Stokes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, mapmakers draw an arrow from short streets to a
list of names printed on a blank spot. But there aren't many blank
spots anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The areas where we used to list names are developed,'' Stokes
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Franklin continues to add maps, it moves into counties with
wide expanses of open space being gobbled up by development.
</P>
<P>
   In just two days this summer, Amsterdam tried to visit about
half of Cumberland County's 34 municipalities.

<HEADLINE> Senate race seems stagnant; outcome hangs on huge undecided block  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - With plenty of summertime distractions, New
Jersey voters have shown little interest in the Senate race and
there's been little movement in the candidates' standing, according
to the latest Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers poll.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat John Corzine was clinging to a small lead over
Republican Bob Franks among likely voters, but had a respectable
advantage over Franks among registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   A lot could change by Election Day, with 21 percent of New
Jersey adults saying they were undecided, and 47 percent of voters
saying they could change their mind by the time they enter the
voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as New Jersey voters are concerned, it is as if their
Senate race has gone into hibernation,'' Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers
University professor of public policy and the poll's director, told
The Star-Ledger for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see little evidence of increased attention to the race,
familiarity with the candidates or comfort in having made a
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 670 New Jersey residents were interviewed by
telephone between Sept. 6 and 13 for the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Among poll respondents saying they are likely to vote, 45
percent favored Corzine, a former Wall Street executive, compared
with 36 percent backing Franks, a four-term congressman
representing New Jersey's 7th District. But with the poll's margin
of error, 4 percentage points for most responses, Corzine could be
leading by as little as 1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered voters, Corzine has a more comfortable lead, 47
percent to 32 percent, which is slightly bigger than the
millionaire's 10-point lead among registered voters in a
Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers poll taken right after the two men won
their respective primaries on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slight improvement for Corzine, the percentage of
undecided voters has stayed about the same.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's because Franks, who has had trouble raising
campaign funds, so far has aired no television commercials, while
Corzine, who spent a record $35 million on his primary campaign,
halted TV ads until Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Corzine-Franks race has been overshadowed by
heavy coverage of New York's Senate race, between first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio. For instance, the
poll found only 14 percent of respondents had heard or read roughly
the same amount about the Franks-Corzine race as about the
Clinton-Lazio contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is where the lack of in-state commercial television hurts
New Jersey,'' Zukin told the newspaper. ''It is much harder to
become an informed voter in New Jersey then in most states.''
</P>
<P>
   Public interest in New Jersey's Senate race was barely half as
high as interest in the presidential race pitting Vice President Al
Gore against Texas Gov. George W. Bush; 34 percent told pollsters
they had ''a lot'' of interest in the Senate race, compared to 61
percent with ''a lot'' of interest in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ''decided'' voters were wishing for more information
about the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Gorski, 75, of Piscataway planned to vote for Corzine
but complained he has not given enough specifics about his plans to
reform education, health care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''He saying a lot, but he's not saying how he's going to do
these things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Rebovich, a Rider University political scientist, said the
many voters who are undecided or open to change give Franks a
chance to overcome Corzine's money advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means Franks is still in the ballpark,'' he said. ''He can
look to the one-on-one debates next month to help him sway some
undecided voters who still are looking for cues.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Oil Experts in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Russian oil experts landed Sunday in
Baghdad aboard a flight apparently meant to test a U.N. Security
Council that is divided on just what sorts of flights into Iraq are
acceptable under sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven oil experts, seven crew members and some medicines were
aboard the YAK-42 that arrived at Saddam International Airport
directly from Moscow, according to Iraqi and Russian media reports.
U.N. approval can be secured for humanitarian flights into Iraq,
but the U.N. sanctions committee maintains flights of commercial
benefit to Iraq violate a U.N. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Iraqis nor the Russians said whether Sunday's flight
had U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
   Arngolt Bekker, director of Stroytransgaz pipeline company, said
the purpose of the trip was to hold talks with Iraqi Oil Ministry
officials about boosting cooperation between Russia and Iraq.
Bekker was received at the airport by Iraqi deputy Oil Minister
Faiz Abdellah Shahin.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official Iraqi News Agency, Bekker also gave
another reason. ''The trip is an expression of Russia's rejection
of the flight ban illegally imposed on Iraq,'' it quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, enforcer of
sanctions on Iraq, are divided on what sorts of flights are allowed
into Iraq. The question has gained importance lately as Russia and
Jordan consider resuming flights to Iraq. For the past decade,
travelers to Iraq generally have had to fly to Amman, Jordan, then
drive 10 to 12 hours to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France, two of Iraq's strongest allies on the
Security Council, say the council never adopted a specific text
banning all flights to and from Iraq. The United States and Britain
maintain civil flights constitute an economic resource, making
their reinstatement a breach of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian airline Aeroflot has been making plans with Iraqi
officials to resume civilian passenger flights between Moscow and
Baghdad perhaps as soon as October. And on Sunday, a Jordanian
Cabinet official said the kingdom also was considering a resumption
of flights.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian Transport Minister Mohammad Kalaldeh said Jordan thus
far is only studying the matter and has not gotten as far as
considering details.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu-Ragheb has said that the United
Nations turned down a Jordanian request last month to resume
flights to Iraq. He said it has only sanctioned humanitarian
flights to transport ailing Iraqis and that Jordan must acquire
advance permission for each flight.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions require the sanctions to remain in place until
Baghdad complies with demands to dismantle its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to fix slug  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of a new television advertisement from
the
Conservative Party.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIME: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   TITLE: See Your Doctor.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Warfield &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMARY AND TEXT: The ad, on behalf of Rep. Rick Lazio, takes
Lazio opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton to task for her role as the
head of a presidential commission charged with reshaping the
nation's health care system in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The ad opens with an unflattering picture of the first lady and
a male voice asking, ''Remember the last time we trusted Hillary
Clinton with an important job in Washington?''
</P>
<P>
   A female hand, meant to be Clinton's, is shown playing the
children's game ''Operation.'' She is performing poorly, setting
off the game's buzzer and sending sparks flying. The narrator says
that Clinton ''proposed a government-run system, a bureaucratic
plan of rationing that destroyed your choice of doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator adds, that Clinton ''worked in secret and had to be
sued to disclose the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad concludes with the narrator saying, ''So if you trust
Hillary Clinton, maybe you should see your doctor, while you still
can.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The ad goes after what could be one of Clinton's
vulnerable spots: Her handling of the Clinton administration's
failed universal health care plan. Clinton led closed-door meetings
with policy experts, keeping the public in the dark about what was
going on. Once the plan became public, it died a quick death, in
part because of concerns about its high costs, the federal
government's broad role in managing care, and the fact that people
may not have been able to choose their own physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has acknowledged that she did not handle the health care
plan well, and the Lazio campaign has hammered her on the issue of
late, questioning her management style and judgment, and seeking to
portray her as someone ill-equipped to take on complicated issues
that require sensitive handling.
</P>
<P>
   The word ''trust'' is emphasized in the ad, a continuation of an
effort by the Republican Party to label Clinton as untrustworthy,
or as Lazio says, ''Clintonesque.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad however, could cause unintended negative consequences for
Lazio. During last week's debate, Lazio theatrically challenged
Clinton to sign a contract barring the use of soft money in the
final two months of the campaign. The ad, however, is paid for by
the Conservative Party - a use of soft money that Lazio professes
to be opposed to.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey sports association begins program for respect in athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) - Tired of overbearing parents and surly
coaches, a New Jersey youth sports association has established a
program to promote good sportsmanship among participants.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by the Mid-New Jersey Youth Soccer Association,
called Set A Good Example, has been in development for two years,
but is particularly timely after a Sept. 10 brawl in South
Brunswick among parents at a boys' soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic point is that people know they should show respect
for coaches, referees and players even if they're not great at what
they're doing,'' Mike Shapiro, who helped develop the program, told
the Courier News of Bridgewater for Sunday's editions. ''The game
is about fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many parents, the game has become something more.
</P>
<P>
   The South Brunswick fight was just the latest case of parental
rage at youth sporting events this year. In August, a hockey dad
was indicted on manslaughter charges in the beating death of
another father at a game in Massachusetts, and a baseball coach was
accused of breaking an umpire's jaw after a disputed call in
Florida in June.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the New Jersey association hope their program will
remind adults to be good sports. One of the main tenets will be to
require coaches, parents, players and referees to sign a document
stating that they will practice good sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-New Jersey is the state's largest soccer league, with more
than 70 clubs and about 1,000 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Parents from the North Hunterdon Soccer Club - part of the
association - and a Staten Island, N.Y. team were involved in the
brawl. One North Hunterdon parent has since been banned from
attending soccer games this fall, and a Middlesex County woman has
filed an assault complaint against a New York woman.
</P>
<P>
   Montclair resident Gloria Averbuch, co-author of a guide for
parents of young athletes, said adults on the sidelines often are
driven by personal ambitions and an adrenaline surge. But while
kids get to release their energy on the field, she said, parents
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a game until it's your kid that's out there, and
then things get complicated,'' she said. ''It's painful, it's
beautiful and it's a gamut of emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Averbuch suggested increased communication between parents and
game officials as a solution to growing violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to understand and accept those emotions and learn
how to deal with them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of new Lazio ad  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of a new television advertisement from
Lazio.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIME: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   TITLE: Plan Revised.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: MPGH Agency.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMARY AND TEXT: The ad focuses on Rep. Rick Lazio's economic
proposals, particularly his tax cutting plans, while seeking to
underscore his regular-guy image by showing scenes of him with his
family and interacting easily with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The ad starts with a beach scene in which Lazio's daughter leaps
into her father's arms and a male narrator saying, ''Rick Lazio.
He's one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   As he is shown giving a speech wearing his now-familiar khaki
trousers and blue shirt, viewers are told, ''Unlike his opponent,
Lazio offers a plan for job creation, not just a promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator mentions Lazio's plans for allowing filers to
deduct payroll taxes; for tax cuts on investments; for tax credits
to help families pay for college; and for saving 75 percent of the
surplus to preserve Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures include Lazio chatting with a farmer in a green pasture
while a fat cow ambles along behind them; holding hands with his
wife as they march in a parade; and shaking hands with
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   The spot ends with the narrator saying: ''Rick Lazio. Trust him
to fight for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The ad is dedicated to Lazio's various economic
proposals to help define a campaign that has been criticized for
its lack of attention to weighty issues. His positions are similar
to those of Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, and
last week, Lazio flew back to Washington to cast a vote with other
Republican House members to attempt to override President Clinton's
veto on eliminating the so-called marriage penalty tax.
</P>
<P>
   The override attempt failed, but gave Lazio a campaign issue.
Hillary Clinton, along with most Democrats, supports keeping the
so-called marriage penalty tax for now.
</P>
<P>
   An independent analysis found that if all of Lazio's economic
and education proposals were enacted that they would cost more than
$1 trillion, although the Lazio campaign says the figure is about
$775 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to Lazio's television ads in the past, this one again
mentions ''trust'' - the intended message being that voters can't
trust Clinton to represent them in the Senate, but can rest easy
with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The spot takes pains to show that Lazio has the common touch -
the suggestion being that his opponent does not. Separate images
show him with his wife and his daughter, and later, mingling with
smiling voters in a variety of settings.
</P>
<P>
   None of the supporters shown appear to be members of minority
groups. Before New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of
the race in April, he was criticized for running a campaign ad that
similarly lacked minorities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Penn State students challenge university's discipline methods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) - A computer engineering major at Penn
State University who helped hang a protest banner outside a
National Governors Association reception on campus faced defiant
trespass charges that were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But Justin Leto was placed on deferred suspension by the
university's Judicial Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
   He is among several students voicing concern that the state's
largest university doles out swift punishment to some - whether or
not they are convicted of anything in court - while the Nittany
Lions' starting quarterback Rashard Casey faces assault charges in
New Jersey and no discipline on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think they're going to bend over backward to find Rashard
Casey innocent. But they'll do whatever it takes to find other
people guilty,'' Leto said.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics of the university's student justice system say it
rushes cases through a process that does not ensure Fifth Amendment
rights or that they be represented by attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law's clear. The university can act to discipline
students, and their Fifth Amendment rights don't have to be applied
when the students are going through that disciplinary process,''
said Andrew Shubin, a State College lawyer representing three
students cleared of charges in connection with hanging the banner
more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that doesn't mean it's wise or fair,'' Shubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was charged May 14 with assault in an attack on an
off-duty police officer outside a bar in Hoboken, N.J. Police say
Casey and another man kicked the victim until he was unconscious.
Casey denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman William Mahon said Penn State's
disciplinary system is fair, and has received ''overwhelming''
approval from students who have faced it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system's a good system, in place for many years,'' Mahon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about how the university has handled Casey's case
emerged when students arrested early July 16 for what authorities
called ''riotous behavior'' found themselves quickly facing
suspensions before their cases went to court.
</P>
<P>
   That night 28 people - including 18 Penn State students - were
arrested after a mini-riot near the campus at the conclusion of the
annual Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago some 1,500 students gathered as rioters during the
same festival, and set bonfires, tore down light posts, battered
storefronts and injured more than a dozen police officers.
</P>
<P>
   July's melee was smaller, with the most serious charge
aggravated assault for throwing a rock at a police officer. Most
were accused of failure to disperse and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 students disciplined by Penn State for their roles in the
mini-riot, five were suspended for a year or given probation. The
other six are appealing their punishments, including suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   One of those, Martin Austermuhle, is a senior majoring in
international politics who is attending Penn State on a student
visa. He said he was charged with failure to disperse, though he
wasn't a rioter. His case has yet to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State suspended him for a year. He could lose his visa and
be sent home to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm willing to take a penalty, but this indirect deportation
is too much,'' he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   Mahon said the university met with police and viewed videotapes.
''I'm not surprised that some people facing discipline would have
complaints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others support the university's swift action, particularly in
light of the riot two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The riot is troubling because it happened two times now, and
we don't want it becoming part of the culture,'' said Peter
Marshall, manager of State College Borough.

<HEADLINE> Police seize 58 pounds of marijuana at airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) - A California woman was arrested after
police discovered 58 pounds of tightly compressed marijuana hidden
in luggage and wrapped in cellophane, dryer sheets, ammonia-soaked
towels and Cajun spices.
</P>
<P>
   None of the efforts to mask the drug's odor worked, as police
dogs sniffed out the marijuana in 25-year-old Myeshia Dixon's
luggage Saturday. Police were tipped off by California police that
Dixon was headed to Albany from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The marijuana had a street value of $280,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, of San Diego, brought the luggage out to a waiting car
where police arrested her and two others. Jeanine Carpenter, 26,
and Alford Brown, 29, both of Poughkeepsie, were found with a small
amount of marijuana charged with unlawful possession of marijuana,
a violation.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon was charged with felony first-degree criminal possession
of marijuana, and second-degree criminal impersonation, a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon purchased the plane ticket under an alias and had a forged
identification card bearing that name.

<HEADLINE> Most states don't check federal list of barred contractors  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE PFLEGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - More than half the states hire contractors
without regular reviews to determine whether the companies are
barred from doing business with the federal government for fraud or
other violations, an Associated Press review found.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government maintains an Internet-accessible list of
companies it will not hire. Fourteen states said their contracting
offices do not check the list, 20 other states check only
occasionally, and about half a dozen instituted checks as a result
of the AP inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A review of state procurement records in all 50 states found
several states that fail to consult the federal list have
repeatedly hired contractors that have had run-ins with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, two dozen contractors forbidden from working for the
federal government have done business with the state, including
Earth Waste Systems of Pittsford, Vt., banned from federal
contracts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which recycles metals and dismantles buildings,
emerged from bankruptcy in 1999 and has a contract from the Vermont
National Guard for demolition work.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont maintains no central list of its own and believes that
problems with barred contractors are not widespread enough to merit
one, said Tom Pelham, Vermont's finance commissioner until he left
in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vermont's a small state,'' Pelham said. ''We do have a good
competitive bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Medlin, an accountant for Earth Waste, said he was unaware
that his company had been on the federal list.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it did happen, then it was more than likely because of the
financial difficulties we were going through,'' Medlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Services Administration, the government's landlord
and purchasing agent, is responsible for maintaining the list, and
federal agencies are required to check it before awarding contracts
and grants.
</P>
<P>
   About 24,000 companies or individuals are barred from doing
business with the government for infractions that range from
violation of drug-free workplace laws to embezzlement and contract
fraud. The bans can be indefinite or last just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal list is accessible on the Internet, some
states said their already overworked bureaucracies cannot handle
the extra chore.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, some government agencies check the list only for
Medicaid-related contractors, although almost 300 Kansas-based
companies are excluded from federal contracts. During the past few
years, state agencies have hired at least seven federally banned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stanley, the state's secretary of administration, said
Kansas probably should consult the federal list. ''I think that's
something we need to include in our reviews,'' he said. ''It may
raise some flags.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states say using the list causes complications. States may
not trust the federal recommendations or may not have a large
enough pool of contractors to exclude companies with past bad
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much of what comes to us from the federal government I
wouldn't trust. They're incompetent,'' said Robert Carl Jr., Rhode
Island Administration Department director.
</P>
<P>
   In July, an AP analysis showed that hundreds of companies
prosecuted or sued for defrauding the government remain eligible to
receive federal business because agencies chose not to ban them.
Many had received new federal business.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Giddis, administrator of the Arkansas purchasing office,
said his state makes its own judgments on contractor quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they have run into some problems within another
jurisdiction does not mean they are not going to be able to provide
Arkansas with the services and commodities that we need,'' said
Giddis, whose office oversees up to 10,000 bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to unclear cases of banned contractors like South
Carolina dentist Charles Hanna, who says he was banned from federal
contracting for making $56 worth of Medicaid billing errors.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I see now is private pay patients,'' Hanna said. ''The
only people they punish is the people who never get care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gambrell, South Carolina Medicaid Fraud Control Unit
director, said Hanna pleaded guilty to four counts of Medicaid
fraud in 1996 and paid more than $8,500 in fines and restitution.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen states require vendors to affirm that they
have not been prohibited from doing business with a government.
When these pledges do not weed out contractors who will lie,
Louisiana relies on another check - competing contractors who
tattle on rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if anything is done to verify the accuracy of the
application,'' said Glenn Ducote, Louisiana assistant attorney
general. ''The whole public bid system kind of depends on
competitor bids. There are literally thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some contractors simply play the system. If they are
banned from state government contracts, they look for federal
business, and vice versa.

<HEADLINE> Army: Honorable Discharge for Gay  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CAVANAUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) -- Army officials on Sunday recommended
an honorable discharge for Reserve Lt. Steve May, an openly gay
Arizona lawmaker who the Army said violated its ''don't ask, don't
tell'' policy by acknowledging his sexuality during a legislative
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials wouldn't disclose why a panel of three Army colonels
recommended an honorable discharge after the Army had pursued an
other-than-honorable, general discharge. Honorable discharges are
typical for soldiers forced to leave the military because of sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We presented the position that we thought was justified in
this case,'' said Maj. Mark Johnson, who argued the military's
case.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorney Christopher Wolf said the investigation was a
personal attack on the legislator's integrity. May's record is
unblemished and he has been rated an exceptional officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the board ignored the facts and ignored the law,''
Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   May said he still considers himself a member of the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still in,'' he said Sunday. ''I'll continue to serve until
the appeals process is exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The discharge recommendation will be reviewed by an appointing
authority, typically an Army general, and then be sent to
Department of Defense personnel authorities, officials said. Until
that review is completed, likely within three months, May will
continue to serve two days a month in the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Army could have allowed May to remain in the reserves under
a Defense Department provision by declaring doing so would be for
the good of the military, Wolf said. The three colonels hearing the
case at the military base south of Los Angeles where May's reserve
unit is based rejected that argument Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision shows ''that the policy does not work,''
said Stacey Sobel, legal director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, a non-profit organization that helps military
members facing discharge because of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army is kicking out a highly qualified and valued officer
today. The loss is to the Army and the American people,'' Sobel
said. ''This sends the wrong message to the public about how the
Army values the contributions of its people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army began investigating May after he acknowledged his
homosexuality in the Arizona Statehouse during a February 1999
hearing on a bill that would have prohibited government benefits
for employees' gay partners. May had been open about his sexuality
since his first campaign for elected office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   May made the public remarks after he was honorably discharged in
1995 and before he was recalled to active duty in the Army Reserve
during the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Barak Proposes Religious Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- His peace plans stalled and his political
future in doubt, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has proposed
far-reaching reforms that challenge the pre-eminence of Jewish
religious law in areas of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   He says Sabbath travel is on the way, and last week his Cabinet
started the legal process for removing citizens' religion from
identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals have been dismissed by some as a political
expediency; still, they have taken opponents and proponents by
surprise and have launched a searing debate about the nation's
character.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our society is in a very deep crisis,'' Rabbi Michael
Melchior, the government minister charged with drafting some of the
changes, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The process has already begun. Aside from the moves to change
the ID cards, his Cabinet has ordered the dismantling of the
Religions Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said his ultimate aim is the country's first
constitution -- something avoided for 52 years precisely because of
the rifts Barak's predecessors feared it would engender.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Barak pledged public transport on Sabbath within two
months, saying it would end discrimination against families who
cannot afford cars and miss out on weekend pleasure outings.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he signed the first orders that would privatize El
Al, Israel's flagship airline carrier, and said Sabbath flights
were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes -- ending the monopoly on marriage and divorce now
enjoyed by the rabbinical establishment, introducing Sabbath
shopping and forcing religious schools to include secular civics
classes -- must wait for parliament to reconvene on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Barak may not have the numbers. After he proposed far-reaching
concessions to the Palestinians at the July's Camp David talks, two
religious coalition partners withdrew, saying they could not abide
a government willing to share Jerusalem with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   That left Barak with a minority government -- but one free of
religious influence and able to pursue constitutional changes that
secular activists have wanted for years.
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered whether Barak -- faced with an opposition that may
now have the numbers to force him into early elections -- was
sincere, or if he was already campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had hoped he would come to the next elections with a peace
deal, but that seems increasingly unlikely with talks deadlocked
over control of Jerusalem's walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef ''Tommy'' Lapid, the leader of the anti-religious Shinui
party, said it was clear Barak was campaigning -- but that was all
to the good.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he does the right thing, I don't care if it is out of
political considerations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Barak has clear majority support for most of the
changes. The latest, in the English-language Jerusalem Post on
Friday, showed 64 percent of respondents supporting El Al flights
on the Sabbath, 60 percent supporting public transport, 56 percent
supporting the introduction of civil marriage, and 53 percent
backing Sabbath shopping. The poll of 502 respondents had a margin
of error of 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are not enough to justify changes that could tear
apart Israeli society, religious leaders say -- especially after a
series of Supreme Court rulings that have rolled back religious
authority in some areas and have severely undermined religious
confidence in the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when the Israeli internal social fabric is so badly
frayed, a revolution that attempts to institutionalize forever 52
percent of the Israeli population is threatening,'' said Jonathan
Rosenblum, a lawyer who heads a group that defends the rights of
the Orthodox, who constitute 15 to 18 percent of Israel's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Shaul Yahalom, a National Religious Party legislator, said the
nature of the state was at stake. ''This is not a sectarian issue,
it's about the state -- is Israel a Jewish state?''
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish state is one that allows its citizens to choose how
they express their Judaism, said Amnon Rubinstein, who chairs the
Knesset's constitutional committee. ''The NRP would impose Judaism
through the whip. ... That turns people away from Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   Melchior, Barak's point man, said he would counsel the prime
minister to proceed with caution -- and compromise. He has proposed
the new constitution tighten the requirements for citizenship, as a
salve to the religious. Immediate citizenship is now available to
those with just one Jewish grandparent, which the religious say is
diluting the country's character.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to deal with these issues very carefully,'' Melchior
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support constitutional change said rushing it for
the sake of political expediency could do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not look serious, this is not something you do in a
month,'' said Ruth Amir, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan
university. ''It takes talking and agreement. We don't want
something spontaneous that will be laughed at afterward.''

<HEADLINE> Fighting Reported in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Government troops were engaged in heavy
combat Sunday against leftist rebels in the jungles of northwest
Colombia, with casualties reported high on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know there are a considerable number of guerrillas dead as
well as a high number of military wounded and dead,'' an army
spokesman, Col. Paulino Coronado, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Nestor Ramirez, second-in-command of the army, said 19
government soldiers were confirmed dead and that fighting was
continuing. RCN television said government forces had lost contact
with 44 soldiers, and that their fate was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The government's casualty rate in just two days of combat was
extraordinary -- equivalent to about 20 percent of the 97 soldiers
who were killed in the first six months of this year, according to
Defense Ministry figures.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate details on rebel losses.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes between the army and rebels of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia were centered around the town of Dabeiba,
located 95 miles southeast of the Panamanian border, Coronado said.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops had launched an offensive against the rebels
on Wednesday to thwart their plans to attack villages in the
region, known as Uraba, and the fighting began in earnest on
Saturday, according to Coronado.
</P>
<P>
   The government troops were supported by U.S.-made Black Hawk
attack helicopters and an AC-47 gunship, a fixed-wing plane
outfitted with .50-caliber machine guns and which during the
Vietnam War was known as ''Puff the Magic Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   During a battle Sept. 2, the same type of plane crashed into a
mountain, killing seven Colombian airmen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's fighting coincided with the scheduled arrival of Lt.
Gen. Peter Pace, the new commander of U.S. military operations in
Latin America. Pace is a veteran of the Vietnam War and of the U.S.
military mission in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   During his three-day visit to Colombia, Pace is to meet with the
armed forces commander, Gen. Fernando Tapias, and the head of the
national police, Gen. Luis Gilibert, according to a statement from

<HEADLINE> Transsexual Married in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A transsexual who was born a man exchanged
marital vows with another woman in a ceremony Saturday, taking
advantage of an appeals court ruling that defines gender only by
chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Wicks and Robin Manhart Wicks obtained a marriage
license earlier this month from Bexar County. Had Jessica Wicks
been born a woman, their Texas marriage would not be honored by
law.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica, a male-to-female transsexual, met Robin in 1997 and the
couple began dating more than a year ago. On Saturday, the Rev.
John Nicholas of the Metropolitan Community Church pronounced them
''one in holy union.''
</P>
<P>
   A small group of sign-carrying protesters gathered outside the
apartments where the wedding was held, saying the ceremony was an
abomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to do what's right according to God,'' the Rev.
Raymond Dean, pastor of the Family Worship Center, told the San
Antonio Express-News. ''We don't hate the people, we hate the
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wicks, who live in the Houston area, had been denied a
license in their hometown by a clerk who considered their union a
same-sex marriage. But in San Antonio, Bexar County Clerk Gerry
Rickhoff said the couple met the legal requirements, as defined by
the courts, for a marriage license.

<HEADLINE> Identity of Ex-POW Possibly Found  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX BANDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Authorities believe they have
established the identity of a former war prisoner who returned to
Hungary last month after spending 53 years lost and forgotten in a
Russian mental hospital, a television station reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests expected to be completed in about two weeks will
remove the last shred of doubt that the man is Andras Toma, a
former blacksmith's apprentice from the eastern village of
Sujanbokor, TV2 television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly man, formerly known as Andras Tamas, returned to
Hungary on Aug. 11, marking the end of a strange and tragic saga
that spanned more than half a century, most of it spent in virtual
isolation among people with whom he could not even communicate.
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently one of the 150,000 Hungarian troops who fought
under Nazi command at the Don River in 1944. According to Russian
records, the man was among prisoners of war sent by train from
western Russia to a prison camp in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be suffering from psychological problems, so guards
took him off the train when it passed near the Russian town of
Kotelnich and left him at the hospital, where he and his past were
forgotten. For years, no one knew who he was until an encounter
with a Hungarian-speaking Russian unlocked the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   TV2 quoted Hungarian officials as saying that once back in
Hungary, the man's memory began returning to the point that they
were able to identify a village where he was believed to have been
born.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, with a crew from TV2 in tow, he was taken to the
village, Sujanbokor, for a meeting with other aged Hungarians
believed to have been his schoolmates. In their company, he
recalled names of teachers who were working in the village whom all
the others remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand were two people believed to have been his siblings
-- Anna and Janos Toma. They will give blood samples for DNA tests,
TV2 said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks just like our dad, and all the bits he said fit,''
Anna Toma said during an interview broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomas were not among the 80 Hungarian families who had
contacted authorities believing the man might have been a lost
relative. They were tracked down instead by a team of Hungarian
military officers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Dr. Andras Veer, director of the Hungarian National
Psychiatric and Neurological Hospital, told the television station
that a team plans to visit five Russian mental hospitals to
determine whether other Hungarian prisoners may have been
transferred there.
</P>
<P>
   TV2 said that Hungarian authorities believe the man was held at
a prison camp east of St. Petersburg along with mostly German
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1947 he was showing signs of mental instability and
was then transferred to the Kotelnich hospital. The prison camp was
closed two months later and records were apparently lost.

<HEADLINE> Candidates troll for ethnic votes but soft money fight rages  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Senate candidates spent Sunday trolling for
votes with old-fashioned campaigning in ethnic neighborhoods,
churches and street fairs.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the handshakes and voter greetings, the campaigns
continued to battle over unregulated donations known as ''soft
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island said he had
just received a legal opinion from his advisers giving him
''clearance'' to ask outside groups ''to refrain from campaigning
or pursuing any advertising on our behalf or against my opponent.
And if they do, which I don't believe they will, I'm going to
disassociate myself from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign,
called Lazio's statement ''empty rhetoric. If he really wanted to
eliminate soft money and independent expenditures from this race,
he would get written commitments from his allies to stop the
attacks against Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week during a televised debate, Lazio waved a contract in
Clinton's face that he said would ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to sign the pledge because it does not prohibit
the ads and letters from outside supporters but merely ''calls on''
them to voluntarily refrain.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Lazio has said he has no control over activities by
others on his behalf - a claim he reiterated Sunday when asked
about a new ad by the Conservative Party that mocks the first
lady's failed effort to reform health care.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the ad appeared in Sunday's New York Times, but when
he was asked about the ad, Lazio said: ''I haven't seen it. I
haven't seen a text of it, so I don't really have much to comment
on about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Sunday that the new soft-money ad is
''just a further example of him saying one thing and doing
something else. Certainly his allies have gone forward with their
campaign of insults, on the air, in the mails, in every other way
they can. I don't think he was ever serious about (a ban). It was
simply a debate stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio has also noted that his campaign does not have its own
soft-money account, while Clinton has raised $3 million in soft
money for her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates were warmly received by voters Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was cheered and praised as she attended services at four
black churches in Queens, while Lazio was repeatedly greeted as the
''anti-Hillary'' in Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx
and at an Irish fair on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's everyone voting for?'' Lazio asked as he walked into the
back room of a kosher deli where a group from a Jewish center was
having lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not Hillary!'' shouted Muriel Rubin in response.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision is as easy as ABC - anybody but Clinton,'' added
Carol Hagler, a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Tyberg shook Lazio's hand on a street in Flatbush and said
of Clinton: ''There's just something I don't like about her. So the
alternative, as long as he's a decent fellow, and he seems to be a
nice guy, then definitely he has my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton was greeted with assurances of support from
black churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are in friendly quarters,'' the Rev. James Kelly of New
Jerusalem Baptist Church told her. ''The love and admiration we
have for you is well-known and will be proven in the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked worshippers in each church ''for your prayers
over the last eight years. I know my husband, my daughter and I
have felt the strength of those prayers ... They have uplifted and
sustained us, and I am also convinced they have protected us.''
</P>
<P>
   She also acknowledged that despite the economic boom, some
Americans are ''still laboring in the shadows of life, still on the
margins, still left behind,'' and promised to work for better
schools, health care and continued economic progress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made a stop at the Race for the Cure in Central
Park, a fund-raiser for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's final stop was at an Irish fair in Port Washington,
where he was introduced to voters by Rep. Peter King, the Long
Island Republican who had hoped to run for Senate before Lazio
emerged as the GOP favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll on the race, in Sunday's Daily News, showed
voters favoring Clinton over Lazio 48 to 43 percent. The survey's
margin of error is 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, James Carville, an unofficial Clinton campaign
adviser, launched a harsh attack against Lazio during an appearance
Sunday morning on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' calling the congressman
''a little clown not even worth glove-slapping.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just a little guy just trying so hard to get noticed by
people, he just crosses the line,'' Carville said when asked about
Lazio's aggressive performance against Clinton in their first
debate Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carville was taken immediately to task by fellow ''Meet the
Press'' guest, his wife Mary Matalin, a Republican political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the short time we've been on, he's called a Senate
candidate - a candidate for the United States Senate who clearly
showed he was up to the job and of the stature of the first lady -
'stupid, Little Ricky, a little clown.' This is not the dialogue of
the race,'' Matalin said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Focusing on Domestic Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, struggling to stem Al Gore's
steady advance in the polls, will spend this week in battleground
states promoting his domestic agenda, with an emphasis on issues
deemed important to women, a campaign spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think women ... are going to come back to Governor Bush,''
spokesman Ari Fleischer said Sunday, conceding that they have been
migrating to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that Bush had closed the gender gap before and
could do it again by focusing on his programs for education, tax
breaks for children and Social Security changes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Democratic convention, Gore has erased
Bush's nationwide lead and has pulled ahead in some polls,
including in some swing states that Republicans had previously
counted in their column.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll found Gore's lead
unchanged, with 49 percent of likely voters supporting Gore versus
Bush with 41 percent. Conducted Sept. 14-16, the poll had a margin
of error or plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to improve those numbers, on Monday Bush was embarking a
six-day campaign blitz through prime battleground states: Arkansas,
Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign on Sunday also released a 16-page booklet called
''Blueprint for the Middle Class'' outlining Bush's plans. It will
be distributed at campaign events and is available on the
campaign's Web site, www.georgewbush.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''People can easily flip through it and see what the governor's
agenda is,'' Fleischer said in a conference call from Bush
headquarters in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp dismissed it as a pale imitation of Gore's
recently released 191-page detailed budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip was planned as a ''metaphor of life,'' with
each day representing a new stage in development -- from birth to
retirement, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   It will begin on Monday with a visit to a hospital in Little
Rock, Ark., where Bush will stress his plan to double the child tax
credit from the existing $500 to $1,000. He will also stress this
proposal at an appearance in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after appearing on Oprah Winfrey's syndicated talk
show in Chicago, Bush will focus on school safety issues in the
Chicago area and in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he will campaign in Pennsylvania -- a state he has
been back to repeatedly -- on his proposal for eliminating the
so-called marriage penalty in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after appearing in New York on the Regis Philbin talk
show, Bush will talk about his plan of overhaul Social Security to
allow younger workers to invest some of their earnings in equity
and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Florida on Friday and Saturday, Bush will talk about
his plans for health care for the elderly and prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's focus on health was being reinforced by two new ads, one
from the Bush campaign on Thursday and a new spot by the Republican
National Committee, called ''Notebook,'' that was airing in
battleground states beginning on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Local Republicans were planning news conferences to promote the
new RNC spot, which asks viewers to compare the Bush and Gore plans
for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It presents Gore's plan in its worst possible light: ''Al Gore
will charge seniors a new $600-a-year government access fee. George
Bush opposes Gore's $600 fee,'' an announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   It never mentions the specifics of Bush's plan -- partly because
he had released no details about how much it would cost seniors or
what benefits they would get.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said it was all part of ''a more focused, very
aggressive effort to make people know where Bush stands.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the gender gap, Fleischer told reporters that much of the
week's emphasis will be an attempt to appeal to women voters who
remain undecided or have recently sided with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why women voters appeared to be more supportive of Gore,
Fleischer said Bush was ''less interested in why they left'' than
on ways to win them back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women are a key group. In the ebb and flow of this election,
Gov. Bush has been the one candidate to close the gender gap.
Things have changed. We hope to close the gap again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kym Spell dismissed Bush's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women are not going to be fooled by this last-minute attempt
by Mr. Bush to woo them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine May Protect Against Herpes  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Researchers have made the first vaccine that
protects against genital herpes. But there is a major catch: It
works only in women and only if they have never had cold sores.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported Sunday, are a surprise. Until now, no
vaccine has ever been shown to work in one sex but not the other.
Experts say this could present unexpected trouble for creating
other vaccines for sexually transmitted diseases, such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The results were not the clear home run that the vaccine's
developer, SmithKline Beecham, had hoped when it began designing
the latest studies a decade ago. Further testing will almost
certainly be required for the drug to be approved, assuming that
the company keeps working on the product.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, doctors say a vaccine that offers even partial
protection against a chronic disease is noteworthy. The only other
sexually transmitted disease that can be stopped with a vaccine is
hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say the chances are good but not at all certain'' that
the herpes vaccine will eventually be approved for routine use,
said Dr. Spotswood Spruance of the University of Utah, one of those
who tested it.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the vaccine would be given to adolescent girls.
Widespread use of the vaccine this way would probably reduce
genital herpes for both sexes, since it would lower the chance of
men coming in contact with infected females.
</P>
<P>
   Genital herpes and cold sores result from closely related bugs.
Herpes simplex virus type 1, or HSV-1, causes fever blisters on the
mouth, while HSV-2 triggers sores on the genitals. Once acquired,
both infections last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Both infections grow more common with age. Recent surveys
suggest that in the United States, 45 million people ages 12 and
older are infected with the genital herpes virus.
</P>
<P>
   Spruance and colleagues reported the results of two major
studies of the vaccine at a meeting in Toronto of the American
Society for Microbiology. Both were conducted on couples in which
one partner had genital herpes but the other did not. The studies
involved more than 2,700 people in the United States, Canada,
Australia, Italy and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the studies, the partners who were free of genital
herpes had never been infected with either HSV-1 nor HSV-2, while
the other included those who had HSV-1 but not HSV-2.
</P>
<P>
   During 19 months of follow up, it turned out that the vaccine
did nothing to protect men or to protect women who already had
HSV-1. However, it was about 75 percent effective in warding of
genital herpes sores in women who had never had either form of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 percent got genital herpes after taking the vaccine,
compared with about 11 percent of those receiving dummy shots.
Another 3 percent of those getting the vaccine became infected but
never developed genital sores.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that being infected with HSV-1 probably
helps protect people from getting genital herpes, and the vaccine
does little to increase this natural barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Why the vaccine works in women but not men is unclear, although
the researchers said it probably has something to do with
differences in sexual anatomy. Perhaps the vaccine boosts the
immune system so it can attack the herpes virus while still in the
vagina, but it is unable to stop the virus after it gains access to
the bloodstream through tiny tears in the penis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results are not exactly what we expected,'' said Gary
Dubin, who heads adolescent vaccine development for SmithKline
Beecham in Belgium. He said the company is getting reaction from
regulators and public health officials before deciding what to do
next.
</P>
<P>
   However, Spruance said the vaccine could be targeted at girls
ages 10 to 13. At this age, he said, about half have not been
infected with either form of the herpes virus and so could benefit
from the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its drawbacks, the vaccine ''really looks very
effective. It seems potentially useful,'' commented Dr. William
Craig of the University of Wisconsin, head of the conference
program committee.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is made from a protein taken from the outer surface
of the herpes virus. It is combined with a bacterial toxin that
acts as an immune system booster.

<HEADLINE> Pilot survives plane crash in Stratford  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) - A New York man was unharmed after the
small plane he was piloting crashed into the Housatonic River on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Wilson, 41, of Water Mill, N.Y., was piloting the Cessna
A-150K plane from Vermont to Islip, N.Y., when an engine failed at
about 3 p.m., police said. There were no passengers on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson tried to make an emergency landing at Bridgeport Airport,
police said. But he came up about a mile short, gliding from 7,000
feet into the river, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He settled right down flat in the water,'' Stratford Assistant
Fire Chief David Cassia told WTNH-TV. ''The plane floated. He was
able to get out of the plane (and) swam to the dock.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the station that Wilson maneuvered the plane to
avoid crashing into homes and a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Local police said they secured the plane to the dock and were
going to remove it on Monday. Officials of the Federal Aviation
Administration will investigate.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Downgraded To Tropical Storm  </HEADLINE>
By DARA KAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Gordon plowed into
Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday with winds just below hurricane
strength, drenching rain and a storm surge with waves over 6 feet
high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The storm is here,'' Cedar Key Mayor Heath Davis about 8:15
p.m. EDT. ''It's making landfall. We're starting to see the effects
of the surge.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts of 60 mph were reported in this rustic fishing town
about 100 miles north of Tampa as the storm approached. Gordon's
top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to about 70 mph
by late afternoon, just below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary evacuation was recommended, but many of town's 800
residents were staying put. Most had weathered hurricanes before.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing now waves of up to and beyond 6 feet, and the
water is continuing to rise and coming over the road at the docks
area,'' Davis said. The storm had knocked out electricity to much
of the city, and heavy rain was falling.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening of the tropical storm system though the day was
due to a combination of factors, said Hugh Cobb, a meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center in Miami: ''The circulation center is
getting close to land, plus it's pulling in dry air from the Gulf
of Mexico and southeastern U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said a storm surge of 7 to 10 feet would likely
coincide with high tide, a combination that could cause
particularly bad flooding. Cedar Key sits two to three feet above
sea level.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a threat of isolated tornadoes, forecasters said.
At least one tornado was reported by Sunday evening, in Palm Beach
County, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy County Sheriff's deputies had ordered non-residents on
Cedar Key to clear out by Sunday afternoon. Two hurricane watchers
from Atlanta had hoped to watch the storm's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been chasing hurricanes for about 15 years,'' said
John Tyler, a pizza delivery man who said he was disappointed by
Gordon's force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real weak,'' he said before the storm made landfall.
''It's too dry and cool to get much stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Others along the coast weren't taking any chances. The Red Cross
reported about 500 people were taking advantage of its shelters
around the state, dozens of flights were canceled at Tampa
International Airport, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball game
with the Oakland A's was called off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, there are a lot of people who just wanted to
leave,'' said Margaret O'Brien-Molina, a Red Cross spokeswoman.
''They wanted to try, but these bands come in again and the trees
start bending and the rain gets really, really stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas and mobile home
parks in Citrus and Taylor counties north of Tampa, and five
counties -- Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Hernando and Pasco --
were under voluntary evacuation. In low-lying Dixie County, just
north of Cedar Key, emergency management director Arthur Bellot
said most of his county's 13,000 residents ''are as ready as they
can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Levy County town of Chiefland, Iva Elbridge, 36, brought
her family to a shelter at Chiefland Elementary School without
complaint, especially after recalling their survival of 1992's
devastating Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went through Andrew when we lived in Cross City -- a tree
went through our house then,'' Elbridge said.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Florida Gulf
Coast from Anna Maria Island to Indian Pass, and another warning
was issued for the southeast coast from Titusville to Little River
Inlet, S.C. A tropical storm watch extended north to the North
Carolina-Virginia border.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarasota and Pinellas Counties, streets that typically flood
during strong summer thunderstorms were under a few feet of water.
Officials reported four minor car accidents, but no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very wet,'' said Jeff Aaron, a spokesman for Sarasota
County. ''It looks like we're are going to be out of the woods very
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's two largest utilities worked busily to restore power
to an estimated 76,000 customers Sunday evening.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, dragged down by a bribery
scandal involving his feared intelligence chief, met today with his Cabinet to
pave the way for new elections and plan his exit from power, as Peruvians took
to the streets and flooded radio stations to voice their joy or sorrow. The new

sexuality during a legislative debate. Officials wouldn't disclose why a panel
of three Army colonels recommended an honorable discharge after the Army had
pursued an other-than-honorable, general discharge. Honorable discharges are

   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Residents packed irreplaceable mementos and prepared
for the possibility of evacuation as firefighters fought a 700-acre blaze that
threatened about 250 mountain homes today. The fire's thick pall of smoke spread
eastward for miles from the canyons and foothills about 12 miles southwest of
downtown Boulder. Nearly 6.7 million acres have burned across the United States
this year, among the nation's worst fire seasons in a half century. As of

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half the states hire contractors without regular

found. The federal government maintains an Internet-accessible list of companies
it will not hire. Fourteen states said their contracting offices do not check

will remove the last shred of doubt that the man is Andras Toma, a former

<HEADLINE> White House Honors Indian PM  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threw a lavish official
dinner Sunday for Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and
as glasses clinked, the leaders praised each other for forging a
new friendship to replace the rocky relationship between the two
nations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the cold shoulder given last week to the military
ruler of India's nuclear rival, Pakistan, Clinton invited Vajpayee
to a South Lawn Pavilion tent filled with fall fruits and tables
adorned with gold-base plates, cream china and gold candles.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 700 guests, including many women wearing traditional
Indian saris of red, orange, pink and green, attended the largest
official dinner of the Clinton presidency to honor a single
visiting dignitary. Only a NATO summit dinner for 19 heads of state
was larger.
</P>
<P>
   As guests sat under crystal chandeliers hanging above tables
bedecked with hydrangea, Clinton did not mention his worries over a
potential nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan. But in
a welcoming speech and toast, he told the guests that with both
countries facing terrorism, ''the simple lesson of all this is, if
we're all in the same boat together, we must find a way to steer
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With your leadership we have built the strongest, most mature
partnership that India and America have ever known,'' the president
said. ''Its success will be our success together. India and America
can change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee responded that it was a tribute to Clinton, who visited
India earlier this year, ''that the manner in which we approach
each other is being fundamentally transformed. This year, our two
nations reached out to each other as never before.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have, I believe, created a framework of dialogue and
engagement that will stand the test of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee also praised first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
accompanied the president, for taking ''the time out from the
middle of an election campaign.'' As a parliamentarian for 40
years, he said, he was speaking ''from the experience of many
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   After the toasts, the guests feasted on wild Copper River salmon
with red kuri squash and rice bean ragout for a main course. The
dessert menu included mango and banner lotus, litchis and raspberry
sauce, honey almond squares and chocolate coconut bars.
</P>
<P>
   For entertainment, the president and Mrs. Clinton invited the
Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York, where the
first lady is seeking a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Vajpayee's address Thursday to Congress, the
prime minister's visit took on a serious tone because of India's
resumption of nuclear testing in 1998, its explosive feud with
Pakistan and its rocky relationship with the United States during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In this presidential election year, both parties are courting
Indian-Americans, who are becoming an important political force
that is influential in U.S. high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list was dominated by Indian-Americans from all walks
of life. Among those invited: Clarence Chandran, chief operating
officer of Nortel Networks; NASA astronaut Dr. Kalpana Chawla; Dr.
B. K. Angnihotri, chancellor of the Southern University Law Center;
Dr. Satya Ahuja, past president of the American Association of
Physicians of Indian Origin; tennis player Vijay Amritaj.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities included model-turned environmental activist
Christie Brinkley, actor Chevy Chase, singer Melissa Etheridge and
author Elie Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was a big contrast from the recent reception for
Pakistani ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who was in New York for the
Millennium Summit. Clinton kept his distance from the military
ruler who overthrew an elected government and leads a country with
links to radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, 75, has not had an easy time physically on this visit.
He has chronic pain in his left knee from osteoarthritis, which
erodes the cartilage around the knee. He will have knee replacement
surgery in India.

<HEADLINE> Broncos 33, Raiders 24  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- As Sebastian Janikowski stood alone on
the sideline kicking imaginary field goals, Joe Nedney was making
real ones on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney, cut by Oakland late in the preseason when Janikowski won
the kicking job, scored all of Denver's second-half points Sunday
as the Broncos beat the Raiders 33-24.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by the Broncos on Tuesday to cover for an injured Jason
Elam, Nedney kicked field goals of 24, 32, 22 and 21 yards. He was
responsible for all nine second-half points, after the two teams
emerged from halftime tied at 24.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski kicked a 19-yard field goal, but missed a 49-yard
attempt wide left midway through the fourth quarter that would have
brought the Raiders within three points.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos (2-1) have a five-game winning streak over the
Raiders (2-1), dating back to the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the first quarter, the Broncos taunted the Raiders
fans, lofting the ball after touchdowns and pointing at the crowd
just beyond the goalposts. But the gibes were quickly stifled by
Oakland, which came back to tie it at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Griese, who has not thrown an interception this season,
threw for 213 yards and two touchdowns: a 10-yard pass to Ed
McCaffrey and a 1-yarder to Howard Griffith. Trevor Pryce returned
a fumble for another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Rich Gannon threw a pair of touchdown passes to Tim
Brown and Randy Jordan returned a blocked punt for another score.
</P>
<P>
   Griese's touchdown pass to McCaffrey in the first quarter was
challenged by Raiders coach Jon Gruden because it appeared
McCaffrey might have been beyond the end zone. But the score stood.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon's fumble on the Raiders' first possession was picked up
by Pryce, who ran it back 28 yards for a touchdown to put the
Broncos up 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing series, Bill Romanowski forced Tyrone Wheatley's
fumble on Oakland's 21-yard line, and Nedney kicked a 24-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon answered by marching the Raiders down field and found
Brown with an 11-yard scoring pass to narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Griese opened the second quarter with hit touchdown pass to
Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon Kaufman's 60-yard run put the Raiders on Denver's
2-yard line, but they settled for Janikowski's 19-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon hit Brown again midway through the second quarter with a
9-yard scoring pass. It was Brown's 77th touchdown reception for
the Raiders, surpassing Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff for the
franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders tied it at 24 when Jordan scooped up a blocked punt
and ran it back three yards for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon got the Raiders to first-and-goal to open the second
half, but his pass to Andre Rison in the end zone was intercepted
by John Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney hit a 32-yard field goal despite loud boos from the crowd
with 3:53 left in the third quarter to give the Broncos a 27-24
lead. Nedney added 22- and 21-yarders in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney, picked up when Elam broke bones in his lower back, said
he would savor smiling at Gruden on the sidelines and letting
''actions speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, the 17th overall pick in the draft and the first
kicker taken in the first round in 21 years, boasted that he can
make a 65-yarder -- which would beat Elam's record 63-yard field
goal.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Ready for Dallas Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Deion Sanders loves Monday nights. After a
less than dazzling start with Washington, ''Prime Time'' is hoping
for some quality prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins opened their checkbook and were the NFL's big
attraction when the season began. But they're 1-1, having played
sluggishly in both games. They've also lost their top receiver,
Michael Westbrook, with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 0-2 and will have Randall Cunningham at quarterback
for the second straight week while Troy Aikman sits with the ninth
concussion of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And if this Monday night affair needed any more intrigue, the
game marks Sanders' first appearance against Dallas since leaving
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has lived up to his ''Prime Time'' nickname -- five
interceptions, one for a touchdown, in 15 Monday night appearances.
He also has returned two punts for TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I see Deion, I tell him it's better to play with
you than having to play against you twice a year,'' Redskins
quarterback Brad Johnson said. ''This time, Troy and those guys
will have to see what we have faced.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Cowboys are in more critical condition, expectations
for ''America's Team'' this year aren't as high as they are for the
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   After a $100 million spending spree by owner Daniel Snyder --
including the seven-year, $56 million signing of Sanders -- anything
less than a Super Bowl trip for Washington will be unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are going to see two teams that need to win very badly,''
said Redskins coach Norv Turner, whose job security after seven
years hinges on how far his team goes in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A loss would make Dallas 0-3 for the first time since 1989, when
they were 1-15 in Jimmy Johnson's first year. On the other hand,
their one win that season was a 13-3 victory in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Aikman out, but wide receiver Joey Galloway, for
whom Dallas surrendered two first-round picks, was lost for the
season after a knee injury in the opener. Aikman says it's too soon
to talk about a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to think that in Week Three we were in that frame
of mind,'' he said. ''But we are clearly a team desperate for a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has been outscored 73-45 in its first two games, and the
defense is ranked 27th in the league in yardage allowed. New coach
Dave Campo points to Sanders' absence as part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   This is the cornerback's fourth team, having also played with
Atlanta and San Francisco. But Dallas is more intent on winning a
game than winning a grudge match.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has nothing to do with Deion, it really doesn't, so I
wouldn't even try to make this a Deion-Cowboys issue,'' said Emmitt
Smith, who has 88 yards on 23 carries. ''Deion just happens to play
for a team that we are playing up against, and happens to be one of
our biggest rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Champ Bailey, who played both ways at Georgia, has
practiced at receiver. With Westbrook out, 37-year-old Irving Fryar
steps into the starting lineup opposite Albert Connell. The
Redskins last week also signed 16-year veteran Andre Reed, whose
941 receptions are third, behind Cris Carter's 942 and Jerry Rice's
1,217.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Stephen Davis has 192 yards and one touchdown this
season, but Brad Johnson threw four interceptions last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to run the football and get after you physically and
then hit the big play,'' Campo said. ''We fully expect Norv to go
after us. That's his style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, meanwhile, isn't concerned about last week, when
against Detroit he had what he called the worst game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just moved the ball with short curls all day,'' he said.
''But that will be corrected this week. I will assure you of
that.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Eights Don't Measure Up  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- By skipping the European regatta
season, the U.S. men's and women's eights could only guess how they
stacked up against the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The early verdict at the Olympics is, not as well as they hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In qualifying heats Monday (Sunday EDT), the three-time world
champion men's squad fell behind Croatia early and never caught up.
The Americans appeared resigned to defeat and eased at the end to
save strength for another qualifying round Wednesday, but still
held on to second place.
</P>
<P>
   The women flamed out after leading a tight race for the first
1,000 meters, finishing third in a three-boat race with
half-hearted strokes pulled from slumped shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   At least the women's lightweight double sculls won its heat,
giving the United States its only first-place finish in 14 events
over the first two days of qualifying. The United States is the
only country competing in every event.
</P>
<P>
   The men's eight is America's top hope for gold. Seven of the
eight rowers and the coxswain have been part of at least one of the
last three world championships, many of them for multiple
victories.
</P>
<P>
   The United States used to dominate the event, winning 11 gold
medals between 1900 and '64 including eight straight from 1920-56.
They've had just three medals since -- two silvers and a bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia and second-heat winner Australia both get a free pass to
avoid the repechage and will save their strength for the final
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Romania, the reigning world and Olympic champion, won it's
women's eight heat and the Netherlands won the heat that included
the United States. That repechage, or second-chance race for
runners-up, also will be Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In their lightweight double sculls victory, Christine Collins
and Sarah Garner had to hold off a late rally from an Australian
crew buoyed by chants and flag-waving from its home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Aussies cut the Americans' lead in half, Collins
and Garner still won by more than a second without having to sprint
to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to get away from the Aussies at the start, then hold
them off,'' Garner said. ''We got the job done and that was what's
important. It felt a little rushed, but we haven't raced for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Romania, featuring Constanta Burcica from its 1996 gold-medal
crew, did nothing to hurt its chances of repeating in the event.
Germany won its heat.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men's lightweight double sculls was a disappointing
fourth in a heat won by Poland, the 1997 and '98 world champions.
The Americans were third most of the race, then eased up in the
final 500 once they couldn't crack the top two. They'll have to get
through the repechage Wednesday to get to the semis.
</P>
<P>
   The United States earned a semifinal spot in the wide-open men's
lightweight coxless four by finishing second to Italy. The men's
quadruple sculls also jumped to the semis by finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's quad, which also finished third, wasn't as
lucky. Under their qualifying rules, only the heat winner earned a
semifinal spot. So that crew also will row Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Surprise, surprise: yet another
record-breaking effort at the Olympic pool -- this time by an
American swimmer still chasing his gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Malchow set the Olympic standard Monday (Sunday night EDT)
in preliminaries for the 200-meter butterfly. The 24-year-old
Malchow, who already holds the world record, nipped by .01 seconds
the mark set by American Melvin Stewart in winning a 1992 gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   Record-breaking feats have become de rigeur in Sydney: eight
world marks fell on the first two days of the eight-day
competition. Malchow qualified for the semifinals, along with the
youngest U.S. swimmer, 15-year-old Michael Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   Competing the morning after the U.S. swimmers swept a half-dozen
medals, two other team members advanced in the women's 200
freestyle: Lindsay Benko and Rada Owen. Australian star Susie
O'Neill, cheered by the home crowd at the Sydney International
Aquatic Center, was top qualifier at 1:59.14.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, gold medal winner Tom Dolan broke his own 6-year-old
world record in the 400-meter individual medley as the Americans
seized the spotlight from Aussie teen sensation Ian Thorpe to
capture two golds, three silvers and a bronze.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dolan's second consecutive Olympic win in the event.
Teammate Erik Vendt took a silver behind him -- the second one-two
U.S. finish of the day. Brooke Bennett and Diana Munz took gold and
silver in the 400 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, an asthmatic bothered for the last month by a viral
infection, exchanged high-fives with Vendt before climbing aboard
the lane marker and exhorting the crowd to echo his triumphant
screams.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough swim,'' said Dolan, 25. ''I was feeling it
coming home, but I knew if I got out ahead no one could beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing off the medal rush were 33-year-old Dara Torres, who
capped her comeback after a seven-year retirement with a bronze in
the 100 fly, and Ed Moses, who won silver in the 100 breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   Moses finished behind Domenico Fioravanti, who won Italy's
first-ever Olympic gold in the event. Torres couldn't catch Inge De
Bruijn of the Netherlands, who lowered the 100 fly world mark for
the third time this year in taking the gold.
</P>
<P>
   About the only bad news: Jenny Thompson finished fifth in the
fly, her first race after setting the record for gold medals by a
U.S. woman with her sixth, all in relays.
</P>
<P>
   After two days, the United States led the medals chart with 11
(4 gold, 5 silver, 2 bronze). Host Australia was second with 9
(3-2-4), while France (3-2-1) and China (1-1-4) each had 6.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S SOCCER: The Chinese team extracted a little payback
from its U.S. opponents, with goalie Goa Hong rejecting a penalty
shot by Kristine Lilly to preserve a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was U.S. netminder Briana Scurry's stop of a
shootout penalty kick that won the World Cup for the Americans. Gao
turned the tables with her lunge to stop Lilly in the 74th minute,
while Julie Foudy scored the lone goal for the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams' hopes of making the Olympic semifinals hinge on
their final group games Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S BASKETBALL: In its first rout du jour, the American
hoopsters rolled over China in a game every bit as one-sided as its
final score: 119-72.
</P>
<P>
   China stayed competitive for the game's first six minutes, but
Ray Allen's 3-pointer and breakaway dunk started the U.S.
domination. The Americans were led by Allen, who had several
highlight-reel dunks en route to 21 points, while Vince Carter had
16.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: After watching the first three U.S. boxers win in
Sydney, Brian Viloria wanted to keep the team's record intact. In a
tough fight against Russian Sergei Kazakov, the 106-pound Viloria
did just that.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Hawaiian built a 6-1 lead after two rounds, then
held on for an 8-6 win over European champion Kazakov in a first
round bout.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S VOLLEYBALL: The once-mighty U.S. volleyballers stumbled
in their first Sydney contest, losing to Argentina 24-26, 25-23,
25-21, 25-18. The loss raised the possibility that the Americans,
twice gold medal winners in the '80s, could go without medals for
the second straight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The team finished last in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS: In the land Down Under, things almost went
topsy-turvy for the defending gold medalist U.S. women's team.
After competing early Sunday (Saturday night EDT), they waited to
see if they would qualify for the Olympic finals. After six anxious
hours of waiting, they did -- by 0.4 points, barely avoiding
humiliation.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman, Broncos Fans Talk Politics  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential hopeful Joseph
Lieberman on Sunday promised health insurance for more than one
million children in Texas left uninsured under George W. Bush, the
Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, watching a televised Broncos football game with
workers at a suburban Denver union hall, said Democrats have a
chance to win Colorado and will keep knocking on the state's door
right up to Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel some wind at our backs now,'' he said, noting recent
polls, including several in Colorado that show the gap between Bush
and Al Gore has narrowed after the two national conventions last
month.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by Talmey-Drake Research and Strategy for the Denver
Rocky Mountain News and KCNC-TV of 534 registered voters questioned
statewide earlier this month, showed 43 percent said they would
vote for Bush while 40 percent said they would vote for Gore. With
a 4 point margin of error, the poll puts the race in Colorado at a
statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is going to be a battle right to the end. We know it's a
battle, but we're closing,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman criticized Bush's record in Texas, noting a federal
judge's order for the state to insure more children. Lieberman said
the judge's consent decree said more than 1.4 million children were
without health care, a figure that Bush's supporters have
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was amazed by the reaction of Governor Bush's spokesman,''
Lieberman said. ''He said Senator Lieberman's facts were wrong. He
said ... The fact is, it's only one-point-two million ... Give me a
break,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman used the opportunity to introduce himself to 250 party
and union officials, many of them unfamiliar with Lieberman or his
record.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Oldfield, 55, a member of the Pipefitters Union said he knew
Gore's record, but knew little about the Connecticut senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really felt comfortable with him,'' Oldfield said as
Lieberman sat down with the crowd to watch the Broncos beat the
Oakland Raiders 33-24.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hogue, 91, a union member who still works, said he also was
impressed with Lieberman and his promises to do more about health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the way he talks about Medicare. I might need it
someday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman later spoke at two separate fund-raisers at a downtown
hotel, including a $1,000 a person reception that drew about 250
people and a $5,000 a plate dinner that attracted about 60
supporters.

<HEADLINE> Bicyclist Killed During Race  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SUKIENNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Nicole Reinhart, a two-time U.S. National track
cycling champion, was killed Sunday when she was thrown from her
bicycle and struck a tree during a race.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart, 24, of Mertztown, Pa., was in the final 3&AMP;frac12;-mile lap of
the BMC Tour of Arlington when the accident occurred just before 1
p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The race was the final event of the 17-race Saturn Professional
Tour, which Reinhart was leading.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cuts very deep through the whole cycling family,'' said
Philip Milburn, the chief operating officer of USA Cycling, the
sport's national and Olympic governing body.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic velodrome in Sydney, U.S. team officials didn't
tell two of Reinhart's friends from Pennsylvania, Marty Nothstein
and Tanya Lindenmuth, until they had competed in qualifying races
Monday morning (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so sad and tragic when anyone dies in a bike race,'' said
Sean Petty, director of the U.S. Olympic team. ''Nicole raced with
us and knew so many of the Olympic team members. It really hit all
of us very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Race organizer Shawn McBride said a videotape showed that
Reinhart, racing in the lead pack, was squeezed by other riders
just before a turn.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were too many riders and too little space,'' McBride
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart was taken to Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, where
she died.
</P>
<P>
   The men's race, scheduled to begin at 1 p.m., was canceled out
of respect for Reinhart.
</P>
<P>
   A competitive rider since age 12, Reinhart won nine U.S.
National Junior Championship titles. She first excelled as a track
racer and won two U.S. National Track titles in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart had won the previous three races in this year's
four-event BMC Software Grand Prix, a road-racing event. She would
have received a $250,000 bonus if she had won Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   The money will instead be used to establish a foundation in her
memory, McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was one of the top five to 10 cyclists in the country,''
McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team, now
competing in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart was the second cyclist to die in three days in
Massachusetts. In Mendon on Friday, Vincent Sterlacci, 51, of
Haworth, N.J., a participant in the Boston-to-New York AIDS ride,
died when he suffered a suspected heart attack and swerved into the
path of a motorcycle.

   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped about 30 people from two
restaurants and a farm outside Colombia's third-largest city on
Sunday, and police were scrambling to try to identify the group
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion immediately fell on the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, a leftist rebel group that has kidnapped people here before,
including dozens of people last year during a Catholic Mass. But
their responsibility could not immediately be confirmed.

<P>
   ''We estimate that about 30 people were taken,'' Cali police

<HEADLINE> Central Sudan Riots Kill Two  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Students and the unemployed rioted Sunday
in a central Sudanese city, burning government buildings and banks
during hours of clashes with security forces that left at least two
dead and several injured, the governor of White Nile state said.
</P>
<P>
   The riots started in the city of Kosti, 175 miles south of
Khartoum, when students demonstrated against mandatory military
service, Gov. Badawi el-Kheir Idriss told state run television.
Then, he said, scores of the unemployed joined them and began
burning government cars, the local government-run radio station,
the provincial office building, banks and police stations.
</P>
<P>
   Idriss said ''joint forces'' -- apparently police and army units
-- enforced calm on the area after two people, including a student,
were killed. He said several people were injured, but was not
specific.
</P>
<P>
   Idriss accused ''instigative sides'' of provoking the violence,
a veiled reference to followers of the Popular National Congress
Party, an opposition group headed by Islamic ideologue Hassan
Turabi.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's riots follow last week's unrest in the western city of
al-Fashir where a woman was killed and 16 people were injured,
reportedly over delays in the start of classes.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, five people were injured when hundreds of
students rioted in the eastern city of Port Sudan against an
attempt to require them to pay damage deposits on textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Turabi's PNC issued a statement Sunday saying that 53 of its
members had been arrested following last week's riots in al-Fashir
and Port Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Turabi was widely seen as the driving force behind
President Omar el-Bashir's government. But late last year,
el-Bashir accused Turabi of trying to undermine him. El-Bashir
dissolved Parliament -- stripping Turabi of his powerful position as
speaker -- and imposed a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Sunday, John Garang, leader of Sudan's biggest
rebel group, said he is ready to meet el-Bashir to try to end the
country's 17-year civil war, which has claimed 2 million lives in
fighting and war-related famine.
</P>
<P>
   Garang's comments follow last week's conference in neighboring
Eritrea of the National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella for
Sudanese opposition groups including Garang's Sudan People's
Liberation Army. An alliance statement said a ''political solution
is the best way to end the war.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Bashir said Saturday he was ready to meet with the rebels to
secure an end to the war. He hasn't met Garang since being
installed as president in a 1989 coup.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are fighting for a more fair distribution of national
wealth as well as for an end to what they view as domination of a
varied country by a Muslim and Arabized clique in Khartoum.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sets Olympic Cycling Record  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYNDEY, Australia (AP) -- The medal run is over for Erin
Hartwell, who failed in his bid to become the first American
cyclist to reach the podium at three straight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwell, of Indianapolis, and teammates Derek Bouchard-Hall of
Palo Alto, Calif., Mariano Friedick of Brentwood, Calif., and Tommy
Mulkey of Athens, Ga., placed 10th out of 12 squads in 4,000-meter
team pursuit Monday (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   After winning a bronze medal at the Barcelona Olympics and a
silver in Atlanta in the kilometer time trial, a knee injury forced
Hartwell to switch to team pursuit, an endurance race.
</P>
<P>
   Britain set an Olympic record of 4 minutes, 4.030 seconds in
establishing the fastest qualifying time. There won't be another
medal for Hartwell after the United States was timed in 4:12.494.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he refused an interview request.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got nothing to say,'' Hartwell told a team publicist.
</P>
<P>
   During qualifying for the men's match sprint, Marty Nothstein of
Trexlertown, Pa., had the fastest ride over the 200-meter course.
His time of 10.166 seconds narrowly missed the Olympic record of
10.129.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wanted to get that Olympic record, but the job is
done,'' said Nothstein, a silver medalist at Atlanta. ''I wanted to
qualify first or second, and I did that. I'm riding strong right
now, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Lindenmuth, also of Trexlertown, Pa., qualified eighth in
women's sprint, riding an 11.649. At 21 the youngest woman ever
named to the U.S. Olympic cycling team, she said she expected to do
better when the event continued Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a much better competitor than a time trial rider,''
Lindenmuth said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Lindenmuth's wits are her strength. The match
sprint mixes strategy and speed, with riders jockeying for position
over two laps before a flat-out sprint on the final lap.

<HEADLINE> Service Pays Tribute to Samaranch  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Hundreds of Olympic officials,
dignitaries and friends attended a memorial service for the wife of
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who died shortly after her
husband presided over the opening of the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   An overflow crowd of about 350 people packed St. Patrick's
Catholic Church in downtown Sydney Monday (Sunday night EDT) for
the special Mass in the memory of Maria Teresa Samaranch, who died
Saturday in Barcelona, Spain, at the age of 67.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute service was held in the same church where
Samaranch attended Mass only a week before his wife's death. One of
the priests who co-celebrated the memorial wore white vestments
adorned with the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the front row was Australian swimming icon Dawn
Fraser, whom Samaranch had invited as his personal guest and
stand-in as ''Olympic first lady'' for Friday's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Samaranch was cremated Sunday in Barcelona, where the
family received condolences from Spain's King Juan Carlos and Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, attending his last Olympics as head of the IOC after
20 years in office, left Sydney the morning after the ceremony and
flew home to be at his wife's bedside. But she died while Samaranch
was still in the air, two hours before landing in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a wonderful woman,'' Samaranch told reporters in
Barcelona. ''I not only loved her, I admired her.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said his wife had been ill -- reportedly with cancer --
for several months and he last spoke with her on Sept. 3 before
traveling to Sydney. He said he was notified of her death by
telephone during the flight to Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Following Tuesday's service, IOC officials said Samaranch had
reiterated that he plans to return to Sydney, probably by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under the circumstances, he's doing as well as can be,'' IOC
director general Francois Carrard said. ''He's following up the
progress of the games. He's 100 percent in control of himself and
the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''He confirmed to me he will return. We don't know which day
yet, but there's no doubt in my mind he will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian IOC vice president Kevan Gosper said Samaranch would
benefit emotionally from returning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to have him back,'' he said. ''He's been suffering
with grief for months. This is the place for him now. It will be
good for him and for Sydney 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In Samaranch's absence, the IOC's ranking vice president, Dick
Pound of Canada, has assumed the roles of president.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's service, led by the Rev. Paul Cooney, drew a
high-profile congregation of Australian federal and state
government officials, International Olympic Committee members and
other Olympic delegates from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Australian dignitaries included Governor General William Deane,
New South Wales Premier Bob Carr and Sydney Lord Mayor Frank
Sartor.
</P>
<P>
   Among others attending were Sydney Olympics Minister Michael
Knight, Salt Lake City Olympic organizing chief Mitt Romney and
Athens 2004 leader Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ''My goals keep changing,'' the former North Carolina State star
said. ''It still hasn't sunk in yet. Everything has happened so
quickly in the past few weeks. It's been unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark opened with rounds of 66, 67 and 68 en route to a 15-under
269 total on the Hillcrest Country Club course.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Five Die in Missouri House Fire  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT CHARTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA, Mo. (AP) -- Five young cousins spending the night
together before a birthday party were killed in a late-night house
fire that has shaken this small town's close-knit Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out in a one-story wood-frame home just before
midnight Saturday, possibly sparked by faulty wiring, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Magana, 35, his daughters, Myira, 6, and Annabel, 11, and
their cousins Erica Corona, 8 months, Ana Caren Corona, 2, and
Diana Corona, 6, died in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Ana and her sister Erica were staying with the Maganas while
their parents shopped for presents to celebrate Ana's third
birthday, which would have been Sunday, said Maribel Vargas,
multicultural community resource translator for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Magana's brother, Miguel, escaped the fire, but because he
speaks little English, he ran more than a half-mile to a cluster of
homes where other Hispanics live to call for help, Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who lives next door had already seen the flames and
dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a horrible inferno, with that tin roof pushing
down the flames,'' said Delpha Price, another neighbor. ''There was
nothing anybody could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Renee Dority grabbed a garden hose and tried to fight the fire
until firefighters arrived. She said she heard glass popping
because of the intense heat, but heard no voices.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I kept spraying with the hose to keep the trees in the
front yard from catching fire. I just had to do something,'' Dority
said. ''The bad part of it is, because of the language barrier and
the cultural barrier, they didn't feel they could come over to call
for help from my house.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, members of the Hispanic community visited
Rafael Magana's wife, Blanca, to offer condolences. She was
returning from work in Jefferson City when the fire broke out. Her
son, Rafael Jr., 12, wasn't in the house at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said the fire left the victims' three families each with
one surviving son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just devastated about the loss of these little ones,''
said Mary McGinnis, a friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Hispanic community in California, which has about
3,500 residents, worked with Rafael Magana at a turkey processing
plant owned by Cargill.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Gunmen Kidnap At Least 30  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped at least 30 people Sunday
from two restaurants located in the weekend playground of the
well-to-do outside Colombia's third-largest city in an operation
blamed on leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 armed men, many wearing military-style uniforms and
bulletproof vests, barged into the restaurants in the highlands
outside Cali on Sunday, police said. Gunmen also seized a couple
from a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   The mass kidnapping recalled the abduction on May 30, 1999, by
the National Liberation Army, or ELN, of 150 worshippers at a
Catholic Mass in Cali. All those hostages have since been released.
</P>
<P>
   Police told journalists at the scene of Sunday's kidnapping that
it may have been carried out by the ELN working with members of
Colombia's biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   ''We estimate that about 30 people were taken,'' said Cali
police commander Rafael Pardo. Other police officials put the
number of hostages between 25 and 40.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were snatched from the Cabana Restaurant and the
Embajada de Ginebra restaurant, 10 miles outside Cali. Among those
taken was Alvaro Tenorio, owner of the Embajada de Ginebra, or
Embassy of Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate demands for ransom or claims of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo de Lima and his wife Elena were kidnapped from a nearby
farm. De Lima's brother owns the De Lima Insurance Company, one of
the region's largest, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-takers struck Sunday where many residents of Cali go
to escape the tropical city's sweltering heat for a drive into the
nearby mountains and a Sunday meal. The two restaurants that were
targeted are among many that line the Via Al Mar, or Highway to the
Sea, which meanders toward the Pacific Ocean, 45 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this year, 1,750 people were kidnapped,
according to Free Country Foundation, a private group. The FARC was
responsible for 477 and the ELN 381 of the kidnappings, Free
Country says.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Chief Heads To Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMMED FAROOQ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERAT, Afghanistan (AP) -- The U.N. refugee chief helped hundreds
of Afghan refugees return home Sunday, then made her own journey to
Herat for talks with the ruling Taliban on their poor human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   The 836 refugees, crammed into 50 trucks piled high with
mattresses, wood, clothes and bicycles, left Quetta, in southwest
Pakistan, and traveled rutted roads to Kandahar, in southern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Sadako Ogata, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, watched
as they received travel documents. Each returning refugee family
was given about $90, a sack of wheat and a plastic sheet for
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata said she was encouraged by their determination to rebuild
their lives in war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the refugees do want to go back. I've seen that in
Pakistan,'' said Ogata, who is touring the region to draw attention
to the 2.6 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees poured out of Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion in
1979, numbering more than 6 million in the 1980s. More than half
have returned, but there are still 2.6 million officially
registered in Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata flew to the western Afghan city of Herat and met with the
Taliban, the hard-line Islamic group that has ruled most of
Afghanistan for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban received Ogata warmly and said they were ready for
more refugees to return, UNHCR spokesman Yusuf Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
   Before talks began, Ogata said, ''I will be telling the Taliban
to improve their education facilities and to stop the fighting so
that all these refugees could come back.''
</P>
<P>
   She also planned to raise human rights issues, including the
Taliban's treatment of women. Under the Taliban's extreme brand of
Islamic law, women are barred from most jobs, face great
difficulties in obtaining an education, and are not permitted to
leave their homes without a male relative.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban control more than 90 percent of the country, but
with the economy in ruins, refugees have been slow to return.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Masom, a refugee who returned Sunday, left Afghanistan in
1978 as political turmoil and unrest erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have problems here with water shortages, and there are no
jobs,'' Masom said of life in the Pakistan camps. ''Now that there
is some peace, we have decided to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Though prospects are bleak in Afghanistan, a drought in southern
Pakistan and declining assistance for refugees has encouraged some
to return.
</P>
<P>
   But many more wish to stay in Pakistan. Some pleaded with Ogata
to provide additional help.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Rahim, a leader among the refugees, told Ogata that
children in the camps lacked basic needs such as health care and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like all people, we want to go home, but we can't right now,''
said Rahim. ''If things improve in Afghanistan, we will not stay a
second longer.''

Gordon's 70 Mph Winds Hit Florida
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Gordon plowed into Florida's Gulf
Coast today with winds just below hurricane strength, drenching rain and a storm
surge with waves over 6 feet high. Michael Loehr, operations chief for the State
Emergency Operations Center said there was some flooding in southwest Florida,
but no serious injuries had been reported. Wind gusts of 60 mph were reported in
this rustic fishing town about 100 miles north of Tampa as the storm approached.
Gordon's top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early today to about 70 mph by
late afternoon, just below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.

Koreas Rebuild Cross-Border Railway
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   IMJINGAK, South Korea (AP) -- In the latest sign of improving relations
between North and South Korea, workers began rebuilding a railway line across
the world's most heavily armed border on Monday to connect the two Korean
capitals for the first time in more than 50 years. South Korea's president, Kim
Dae-jung, presided over the groundbreaking ceremony in Imjingak, a village just
south of the Demilitarized Zone that has separated the two Koreas since the 1945

Army: Honorable Discharge for Gay Lawmaker
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) -- Army officials today recommended an honorable
discharge for Reserve Lt. Steve May, an openly gay Arizona lawmaker who the Army
said violated its ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy by acknowledging his
sexuality during a legislative debate. Officials wouldn't disclose why a panel
of three Army colonels recommended an honorable discharge after the Army had
pursued an other-than-honorable, general discharge. Honorable discharges are
typical for soldiers forced to leave the military because of sexual orientation.
May said he still considers himself a member of the reserves.

Central Sudan Riots Kill Two

<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Students and the unemployed rioted Sunday in a
central Sudanese city, burning government buildings and banks during hours of
clashes with security forces that left at least two dead and several injured,
the governor of White Nile state said. The riots started in the city of Kosti,
175 miles south of Khartoum, when students demonstrated against mandatory
military service, Gov. Badawi el-Kheir Idriss told state run television. Then,
he said, scores of the unemployed joined them and began burning government cars,
the local government-run radio station, the provincial office building, banks
and police stations.

Gunmen Kidnap 30 Colombians
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped about 30 people from two restaurants
and a farm outside Colombia's third-largest city on Sunday, and police were
scrambling to try to identify the group responsible. Suspicion immediately fell
on the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a leftist rebel group that has
kidnapped people here before, including dozens of people last year during a
Catholic Mass. But their responsibility could not immediately be confirmed.
Colombia has one of the world's highest kidnapping rates. From the beginning of
the year until July, 1,754 people were abducted in this South American country.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Another record fell at the Olympic pool when
American Tom Malchow led preliminaries of the 200-meter butterfly at 1 minute,
56.25 seconds. Malchow clipped the Olympic mark of 1:56.26 on Monday (Sunday
night EDT). American Mel Stewart set the old record in winning gold at the 1992

   Police and army technical officers answered a report of a blast
just before 2 a.m. at the offices of the organization Loyalist

<HEADLINE> German Champion Suspended 2 Years  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An arbitration panel of track and
field's international governing body has upheld the two-year
suspension of former Olympic 5,000-meter champion Dieter Baumann of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann, who tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone
last Oct. 19 and Nov. 12, had appealed the suspension. He contended
he was the victim of a plot when traces of the drug were found in
toothpaste he supposedly used.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, Baumann offered $130,000 to anyone who could
provide information on who spiked his toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration panel of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation conducted a hearing in Sydney on Saturday. Baumann, 35,
attended the hearing to argue his case and hoped to be reinstated
in time to compete in the Olympic 5,000 preliminaries Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The German Athletic Federation reinstated Baumann on July 13.
The federation's legal committee ruled that there had been
irregularities in the collection and storage of his urine sample.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a brief news release Monday (Sunday night EDT)
announcing its decision, the IAAF said the decision of the German
federation was erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   Under revised IAAF rules, the suspension will be in effect for
two years from the date of his hearing, meaning he will be eligible
again on Sept. 16, 2002, according to IAAF spokesman Georgio
Reineri.
</P>
<P>
   Since Baumann will be 37 by then, the IAAF ruling could
effectively end his career.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF is under pressure to be tough on drugs, especially
after stinging criticism for reducing high jump world record-holder
Javier Sotomayor's cocaine suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF banned Sotomayor for two years, but reduced his
suspension to one year earlier this month, citing ''exceptional
circumstances'' and an exemplary 15-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann, married to former Austrian 1,500-meter runner Isabelle
Baumann, won the 5,000 at the Barcelona Games and was the silver
medalist in that event at the 1988 Seoul Games. He finished fourth
in the 5,000 four years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Baumann became the first European to break 13 minutes
in the 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Money Can't Buy Olympic Re-Entry  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Romania was told it can't buy its way
back into the Olympic weightlifting competition by paying a fine
and having a drug sanction lifted.
</P>
<P>
   IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch said Monday (Sunday night
EDT) there was no way Romania could invoke an International
Weightlifting Federation rule allowing it to pay a $50,000 fine for
readmission to weightlifting events in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, track officials upheld the two-year suspension of
former Olympic 5,000-meter champion Dieter Baumann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann, who tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandralone
last Oct. 19 and Nov. 12, had appealed, arguing that he was the
victim of a plot when traces of the drug were found in toothpaste
he supposedly used.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Romanian weightlifting team was thrown out of the
Sydney Games Sunday after two male lifters tested positive in
out-of-competition tests.
</P>
<P>
   Local media reports Monday said the IWF had reinstated four
Romanians -- three men and a woman -- found to be drug free.
</P>
<P>
   The IWF could not be contacted.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the Olympic weightlifting venue in Darling
Harbor, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said the IWF
was still meeting and had made no decision.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said a female Romanian lifter had been put on the
start list, as a precaution, for Monday's competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federation is meeting to consider the situation, and if
they agree to accept the fine and waive the suspension, then it has
to go to the IOC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traian Ciharean, a bronze medalist at the Barcelona Olympics,
and Adrian Mateas failed tests administered to all 257 Olympic
weightlifters.
</P>
<P>
   IWF rules dictate that if three athletes return positive doping
tests within 12 months, all lifters from that nation are banned
from international competition for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another Romanian lifter tested positive earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian Olympic Committee said in a statement that it was
prepared to pay the $50,000 fine, according to IWF statutes,
instead of having the team suspended.
</P>
<P>
   But Schamasch rejected the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''A fine never has to replace a suspension or sanction,''
Schamasch told a news conference. ''A fine may be applied but
never, ever in substitution to a sports sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schamasch said the IOC ''always respects'' the rulings of the
international federations but in this case, all Romanian
weightlifters would be ejected from the Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very clear -- the national Romanian federation is
suspended, therefore, the full team is suspended,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of nine Olympians have been suspended for drug use found
in pre-games tests, including six banned from the athletes'
village, Schamasch said.
</P>
<P>
   The village was off limits for a weightlifter from Taiwan, an
Iranian boxer, a swimmer from Kazakstan, a weightlifter from Norway
and the two weightlifters from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   The other three, two Egyptian wrestlers and a wrestler from
Morocco, were suspended before they arrived at the village. All
were the result of out-of-competition tests.
</P>
<P>
   Since last April, when it started testing, WADA has caught 20
athletes using banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced that
the Romanian weightlifters and an Iranian boxer had tested positive
for the steroid Nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amateur Boxing Federation identified the
Iranian fighter as Anoushirvan Nourian, who was entered in the
139-pound class.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases were resolved before the games, with athletes either
being removed from their teams or failing to qualify for the
Olympics, WADA spokesman Casey Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   At least four other weightlifters have been tossed out of the
Olympics for failing pre-games drug tests: Stian Grimseth of
Norway, and Chen Po-pu, world champion Chen Jui-lien and Wu Mei-yi
of Taiwan. Also sent home was Taiwan coach Tsai Wen-yee.
</P>
<P>
   Schamasch said the fact that so many weightlifters had been
caught for out-of-competition doping offenses was proof the
international federation was taking a strong stance against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   WADA has conducted more than 2,043 urine tests involving 27
summer sports in 82 nations prior to the games.
</P>
<P>
   IOC medical teams already have conducted 291 urine tests and 189
recently approved tests for EPO in Sydney, with no positive results
so far, Schamasch said. Overall, the IOC expects to conduct 2,000
in-competition tests during the 16-day games at an average cost of
$600 per test.

<HEADLINE> Croatia 3, China 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Barbara Jelic blasted 40 kills as
Croatia handed China its second straight surprising loss, dropping
the 1996 silver medalists to 0-2 in women's Olympic volleyball
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatians have only two real threats on offense, Jelic and
Natasa Leto, but they were more than enough to give the Chinese
fits.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia (2-0) won the first game 25-23, then dropped the second
28-26 before cruising in the final two frames 25-20 and 25-15
Monday (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The shot of the match, replayed over and over on the venue
televisions, was a blast by Leto that drilled Chinese back-row
player Li Yan square on the left cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Croatian blockers Biljana Gligorovic and Beti Rimac stuffed Sun
for the game-winning point.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was potentially devastating for China, which is ranked
fourth in the world and was expected to contend for another podium
finish. Instead, the Chinese looked awful in a 3-1 defeat to the
United States in the opener, and couldn't find any way to stop the
6-foot-4 Jelic.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia barely won the first game and had a great shot at taking
a 2-0 lead when Jelic smashed two straight balls to give her team a
26-25 edge. Needing to win by two, the Chinese reeled off three
straight points, starting with a kill by Sun Yue, after her
teammates saved a shot by Jelic.
</P>
<P>
   A service winner and another kill by Sun handed China the 28-26
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Leto added 16 kills for Croatia, which is making its first
Olympic appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Sun had 15 kills, but failed to convert on her other 24
attempts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Netherlands finally played like a
world power, scoring twice in the fourth quarter to rally past
Australia 5-4 in women's water polo at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch had gotten a medal in every major women's water polo
since 1979, but hadn't done much here -- except a lackluster, 8-6
win over Kazakstan, considered the only team of the six not in the
medals hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But trailing 4-3 at the start of the final period, the
Netherlands got going.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Kuipers swam in alone and tied things at 4. About 30
seconds later, Ellen van Der Weijden-Bast leaped high to tip in a
pass from Edmee Heimstra for the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians, the only team to win their first two games, had
several chances to tie. Goalie Karla Plugge halted a charge by
Australian Naomi Castle. Bridgette Gusterson, the Aussie's leading
scorer, skipped a close shot into the chest of Marjan Op den Velde.
</P>
<P>
   Simone Hankin missed a desperation backhand shot for Australia's
last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Australia both are 2-1. Four of the six teams will
advance to Saturday's medals round.

   The official, whose identified was not released, was taken to

<HEADLINE> Storm Gordon Hits Florida Coast  </HEADLINE>
By DARA KAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Gordon plowed into
Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday with winds just below hurricane
strength, drenching rain and a storm surge with waves over 6 feet
high.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Loehr, operations chief for the State Emergency
Operations Center said there was some flooding in southwest
Florida, but no serious injuries had been reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already gotten calls from Charlotte County saying
they've got houses on the coast where you open the front door the
water's coming in, you open the back door water's going out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts of 60 mph were reported in this rustic fishing town
about 100 miles north of Tampa as the storm approached. Gordon's
top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to about 70 mph,
just below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Florida National Guardsmen were deployed to help in
flooded areas, and schools and roads were closed in several coastal
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing now waves of up to and beyond 6 feet, and the
water is continuing to rise and coming over the road at the docks
area,'' Cedar Key Mayor Heath Davis said as the storm came ashore
about 8:15 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The storm knocked out electricity to much of the city and
pounded the island directly in the path with heavy rain. A
voluntary evacuation had been recommended, but many of town's 800
residents were staying put. Most had weathered hurricanes before,
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m. EDT, Gordon's center was near Cedar Key, still with
70 mph winds. The storm was heading north-northeast at near 12 mph,
a course expected to take it over north Florida and southeastern
Georgia, weakening as it crosses land.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's weakening though the day was due to a combination of
factors, said Hugh Cobb, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane
Center in Miami: ''The circulation center is getting close to land,
plus it's pulling in dry air from the Gulf of Mexico and
southeastern U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a threat of isolated tornadoes, forecasters said.
At least one tornado was reported by Sunday evening, in Palm Beach
County, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy County Sheriff's deputies had ordered non-residents on
Cedar Key to clear out by Sunday afternoon. Two hurricane watchers
from Atlanta had hoped to watch the storm's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been chasing hurricanes for about 15 years,'' said
John Tyler, a pizza delivery man who said he was disappointed by
Gordon's force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real weak,'' he said before the storm made landfall.
''It's too dry and cool to get much stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Others along the coast weren't taking any chances. The Red Cross
reported about 500 people were taking advantage of its shelters
around the state, dozens of flights were canceled at Tampa
International Airport, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball game
with the Oakland A's was called off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, there are a lot of people who just wanted to
leave,'' said Margaret O'Brien-Molina, a Red Cross spokeswoman.
''They wanted to try, but these bands come in again and the trees
start bending and the rain gets really, really stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas and mobile home
parks in Citrus and Taylor counties north of Tampa, and five
counties -- Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Hernando and Pasco --
were under voluntary evacuation. In low-lying Dixie County, just
north of Cedar Key, emergency management director Arthur Bellot
said most of his county's 13,000 residents ''are as ready as they
can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Levy County town of Chiefland, Iva Elbridge, 36, brought
her family to a shelter at Chiefland Elementary School without
complaint, especially after recalling their survival of 1992's
devastating Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went through Andrew when we lived in Cross City -- a tree
went through our house then,'' Elbridge said.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm warning was still in effect for the Florida
Gulf Coast from Anclote Key to St. Marks, and on the Atlantic coast
from Flagler Beach in north Florida, up to Little River Inlet, S.C.
A tropical storm watch also remained in effect north of Little
River Inlet to the North Carolina-Virginia border.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarasota and Pinellas Counties, streets that typically flood
during strong summer thunderstorms were under a few feet of water.
Officials reported four minor car accidents, but no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very wet,'' said Jeff Aaron, a spokesman for Sarasota
County. ''It looks like we're are going to be out of the woods very
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's two largest utilities worked busily Sunday to
restore power to more than 150,000 customers affected by the storm.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Russia coach Yevgeny Gomelsky was livid
after his team's impressive win over Poland but his mood had
nothing to do with the game.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia's opening win over Cuba, point guard Irina Soumnikova
was struck in the face by a Cuban player's elbow that required two
hours of plastic surgery Monday (Sunday EDT), ending the
35-year-old's Olympic career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am totally indignant that this has happened and it is not
the first time it has happened against Cuba,'' he said. ''At the
end of the first half, No. 10, (Maria) Leon, a very experienced
player, on purpose she hit one of our players, hit her in the face
and the referee did not see it. I don't understand. I am training
ladies. This basketball, ladies basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is 35 and this was her fourth and final Olympics and now
it is over. For this to happen it is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials were not available for comment until after the
game against the United States later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Soumnikova also broke her right wrist when she fell after being
struck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank the Australian doctors at the city hospital.
They operated on her face for two hours. They did everything
possible. It was under her eye. We'll find out tonight the
consequences of the trauma she had.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomelsky, who coached the Unified Team to the gold medal in
1992, said his team used Soumnikova's injury as a rallying point
for the 84-46 win over Poland Monday (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to commend them for the way they played,'' said the
brother of Alexander Gomelsky, the Soviet Union's coach in 1988
when it beat the U.S. men in the Olympic semifinals. ''They set a
high moral example.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia (2-0) held Margo Dydek, Poland's 7-foot-2 center who
plays for the WNBA's Utah Starzz, to eight points on 2-of-15
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have to understand that defense will always save you,''
Gomelsky said. ''It will always compensate for your mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Elena Khoudashova had 13 points to lead six Russian players in
double figures and was one of the inside players who forced Dydek
into the poor offensive performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We planned to put great pressure on their center because of
the injury they had but we didn't play well and our center was not
realizing that,'' Poland coach Tomasz Herkt said, referring to
Dydek. ''If we have any dreams of winning games we have to do it
with her. We have no other players like her.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> TV Personality Paula Yates Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- TV personality Paula Yates, girlfriend of the late
INXS singer Michael Hutchence, was found dead at her London home on
Sunday, police said. She was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard said the cause of death was not immediately known,
and that an autopsy would be scheduled. Detective Inspector Mike
Christensen said there were no signs of violence in the house.
</P>
<P>
   He said the body was discovered by a family friend, and an
ambulance and police were called to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was Hutchence's partner from 1994 until November 1997,
when he committed suicide by hanging himself in a hotel room in
Sydney, Australia. She had a daughter with him in 1996, Heavenly
Hiraani Tiger Lily.
</P>
<P>
   News reports in Britain had said Yates was treated for
depression after Hutchence's death.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, Hutchence's father was reported to be ''absolutely
shocked and saddened'' by Yates' death.
</P>
<P>
   Kell Hutchence's wife, Susie Hutchence, said her husband was
''very distressed and very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the surviving members of INXS said: ''Our
thoughts and love are with Tiger and Paula's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates was also the former wife of pop musician Bob Geldof, with
whom she had three children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all so sad,'' Geldof said in a statement. ''The loss
for all the children is insupportable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates was a co-presenter in the 1980s on the music show ''The
Tube.'' She also had appeared on ''The Big Breakfast,'' an offbeat
morning program where she interviewed celebrity guests on a giant
bed.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Folk Singer Dies at 47  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Valeriu Stelian, a folk singer who
inspired anti-communist protesters a decade ago, has died of
cancer, a family friend said Sunday. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Valeriu Stelian died at Bucharest's Fundeni hospital Saturday,
one week after undergoing surgery for cancer, said Sorin Minghiat,
Stelian's flute player.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the 1989 anti-communist uprising, Stelian went
with his guitar to University Square, in downtown Bucharest. There
he sang and played to students who had gathered to protest the
presence of former communists in government, even after the bloody
1989 revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, coal miners descended on Bucharest at the
behest of the government and beat up the students. Six people died
in the melee and the protest harmed Romania's image to such a
degree that many young Romanians emigrated, believing democracy
would never come to this Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh God, come here to see what has become of people,'' went the
lyrics of one of Stelian's songs composed in 1973 and played to
film footage of people who had died during the 1989 anti-communist
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stelian made the headlines again after he was
involved in a car accident where three people died. Charges against
him were dropped, but he was badly affected by the incident,
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Stelian toured the former Soviet Union,
Norway, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, France, England and the United
States. He also set up some recording studios in Romania in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The singer is survived by a wife and child. Funeral plans were
not immediately known.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Makes Splash in Olympic Debut  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- One after another, the flag-emblazoned
spinnakers popped open as they caught the breeze, propelling a
fleet of 49ers downwind on Sydney Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't need a program to figure out where the crews were
from. A Union Jack flew open, followed by the flags of Ukraine,
Poland, Australia and then the Stars and Stripes of the boat crewed
by brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The 49er made a colorful Olympic debut on Monday (Sunday night
EDT), even if the first of three scheduled races was skewed by a
180-degree wind shift.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees finished sixth in the first race in the fleet of 17.
</P>
<P>
   The high-performance 49er -- it's named after its length, 4.99
meters -- was designed four years ago along the lines of the famous
Sydney 18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic 49ers are made more visible with their flag
spinnakers.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers weren't at their wildest because the wind was only
about 6 knots, with gusts to 9 knots. When the wind blows, these
winged skiffs can really move, sometimes reaching 25 knots. The
crew, held by safety lines, prop themselves out over the water to
try to keep the boat level.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees, who each own an Olympic medal, say they wouldn't be
here if not for the wild-and-wooly 49er. Jonathan, 40, won a gold
in the Flying Dutchman in 1984 and Charlie, 38, a bronze in the 470
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees sail the 49er because it keeps them on the edge, and
that's what organizers hope spectators will get to see over the
course of 16 races.
</P>
<P>
   On the first leg into the wind, a green and yellow ferry steamed
past on its way to Manly, with passengers packed along the rail,
getting a free glimpse of the action.
</P>
<P>
   The British skiff opened a huge lead on the upwind first leg,
and held it until getting caught in a wind hole halfway through the
race. The breeze, which had started from the southwest, suddenly
came out of the northeast. That's an indication of how crazy it can
be sailing on the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees made out OK because they were in the middle of the
course when the wind shifted. The first race was won by reigning
world champion Santiago Lopez-Vazquez of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Three other classes scheduled to race Monday, the Soling,
Tornado and windsurfers, were delayed by lack of wind on their
courses, but finally got under way toward mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Getting an Olympic windsurfing medal in Australia would be
especially fitting for American Lanee Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, from Aliso Viejo, Calif., has lived and trained in
Sydney on and off since the 1996 Olympics, when she finished 11th.
She has an Aussie boyfriend and plans to live here for good after
these games, her third for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She's going to have to rally a bit, though. She was in fourth
place after finishing second and fourth in the first two races
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   However, she was disqualified from the first race after a
protest by the Hong Kong sailor. The jury ruled that Butler failed
to keep clear of the Hong Kong board, leading to a collision.
</P>
<P>
   That dropped her to 16th overall. Although each sailor discards
his or her two worst scores after nine races, Butler's
disqualification gives her a little less room for error.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Tornado crew of John Lovell of New Orleans and Charlie
Ogletree of Newport Beach, Calif., finished fifth in the first of
two races to improve to fifth overall.
