<HEADLINE> Iraqi Minister Stresses China's Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Minister of Health Omed
Medhat Mubarak told here today a visiting Chinese trade delegation
that China can and should play a big role in the implementation of
the oil-for-food deal reached by Iraq and the United Nations in
May.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides discussed means of enhancing
trade relations between the two countries and the prospects of
strengthening bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation headed by Shi Weisan, Director General
of the West Asia and Africa Department in the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, has met on separate occasions with
Iraq's ministers of trade, agriculture, transport and
communications and industry and minerals.
</P>
<P>
During his earlier meeting with Iraq's Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh, Shi stressed that the current trip of the Chinese
delegation to Iraq indicates that China supports Iraq in signing
the oil-for-food memorandum of understanding with U.N. so as to
alleviate sufferings of the Iraqi people under six years of
U.N. sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars of oil over six months to buy food and other supplies
for its people.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also explored the possibility of China's export of
badly needed humanitarian supplies to Iraq, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese diplomat said that the visit by the Chinese trade
delegation has achieved positive results. It has laid a good
foundation for China's participation in an early implementation
of the oil-for-food deal and the further development in bilateral
trade relations once the U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
are lifted, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member Chinese trade delegation comprising heads of
six Chinese companies arrived in Baghdad Sunday for a one-week
visit.

<HEADLINE> NP Not Considers Name Change: De Klerk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Party (np) of
South Africa is not considering a name change for the party at
the current stage, NP leader F W de Klerk said today.
</P>
<P>
In his closing address to the party's federal congress in Cape
Town, de Klerk said there was consensus in the party's leadership
that a mere change of name would not really help the NP achieve
its goals.
</P>
<P>
The three-day congress, under the theme of "opposition with a
mission", was the NP's first national meeting since its
withdrawal from the African National Congress (ANC)-led
government of national unity to become an official opposition
party on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The NP, established in July 1914 and exercising apartheid
system since its coming into power in 1948, has long been
considered a traditionally white-only political party.
</P>
<P>
The NP intended to topple the ANC from government in 2004, but
it should also concentrate on the 1999 general election, de
Klerk declared.

<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said at a cabinet meeting here today that he will meet with the
Syrian president and the Palestinian leader in the coming few days
to coordinate stances on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who returned home Friday after ending his four-day
official visit to the United States, was quoted by Information
Minister Safwat el-Sherif as saying that he will brief his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad and President of the Palestinian
Authority Yasser Arafat on his U.S. visit, during which he held
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other senior officials
on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he will also send messages to a number of
Arab leaders and contact Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
as part of Egypt's diplomatic efforts to push forward the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, with an aim of saving the stalled Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations, has frequently held consultations with Arab leaders
since hard-liner Netanyahu was elected prime minister late last
May.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has played an active role in the peace process as a mediator in
talks between the Jewish state and the Arabs, particularly the
Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Affairs,
Employment Creation and Cooperatives Minister Tenjiwe Lesabe said
here today her ministry intends to establish focal points in the
government ministries to tackle gender issues.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop on gender equality held in the capital, Lesabe
said the ministry wants to streamline gender policy by involving
senior government officers in the formulation of policy.
</P>
<P>
She said the ministry has established a task force to come up
with a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action as a follow up to the Beijing World Women's
Conference includes the establishment and formalization of gender
focal points in line with ministries so that these officers in
the government can facilitate the main streaming of gender issues
in the government policies and programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, jointly organized by the Zimbabwe Youth Council
and the Baha'i community, was aimed at educating youth leaders on
gender issues.
</P>
<P>
The Baha'i community is actively involved in community-based
projects that seek to economically empower rural women and
enhance their self-confidence.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Officers Jailed For Torturing Prisoner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Three Palestinian police
officers were sentenced to imprisonment at the State Security
Court in Jericho today, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a sentence, which is not subjet to appeal, Captain Abdul
Hakim Hajjo and Lieutenant Omar Abdullah Qadoumi will be jailed
for 15 years with hard labor, in addition to expulsion from
military service; Sergeant Ahmad Al-Bado will be jailed for 10
years with hard labor in addition to expulsion from military
service.
</P>
<P>
The three officers were charged with torturing prisoner Mahmoud
Jumayyil to death. Mahmoud, 27, was a member of Fatah Hawk
in Nablus. He was arrested on December 5, 1995, and imprisoned
in Jericho Prison and then moved to Junaid Prison near Nablus.
On July 27, Mahmoud was taken from Junaid Prison to Rafidya
Hospital in Nablus due to his critical health condition. Then
he was transferred to Ramallah Hospital and later to Hadassa
Hospital in Jerusalem. He died on Wednesday night. Mahmoud's
father charged that his son died of torture in the prison.
</P>
<P>
In court, the defendants admitted to using force against
Mahmoud, saying that he had attempted to escape.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 furious youths in Nablus participated in
the funeral of Mahmoud Jumayyil Thursday. They shouted abuse at
the police and threw stones at the office of Mayor Ghassan
Shakaa.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat ordered the
authorities concerned to carry out an investigation and punish
those criminals.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Ready for Traffic Cooperation with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has said that it was
preparing its transport sector for increased traffic with Iraq
under the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal, the English-language daily
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hopes that the oil-for-food deal would revive its
stagnant economic sectors, which have suffered a great loss from
the six-year-old U.N. sanctions against Iraq, a main trading
partner of the kingdom before the Gulf crisis in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Nasser Al-Lawzi said that his Iraqi
counterpart assured him in a meeting in Amman last week that the
kingdom would have a pivotal role as a major conduit for its food
purchases under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N.-Iraqi deal, Baghdad would sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to purchase its
badly-needed food and medicines for its people.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's business and industrial community expects the
U.N. deal to double its 220 million dollars worth of current
annual trade with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Jordan's south port of Aqaba has taken a
series of measures to attract Iraqi shipments.
</P>
<P>
He said the Aqaba port authorities have cut its handling
fees for Iraqi-bound traffic and expand land transport capacity
on the 1000-kilometer highway linking Jordan and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the jointly state-owned Iraq-Jordan land transport
company, which handles most of the truck transport between the
two countries, is studying six offers from major world suppliers
for 150 new trucks in a deal estimated between 15-20 million
dollars. It will greatly boost the firm's existing 350 trucks.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympic Games: Plus vs. Minus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Marred by transport glitches, a
disappointing results system and a terrorist bomb attack, the 26th
Olympic Games in Atlanta will be remembered as the world's largest
sports extravaganza drawing a record number of participants and
visitors and involving a record high of revenues.
</P>
<P>
Despite a critical world opinion in the early stages, the Games
have been going on roughly on schedule with some of the
competitions delayed or postponed due to the weather rather than
human errors.
</P>
<P>
Running, jumping, swimming, paddling, riding, shooting,
wrestling, lifting weights with sweat and under great pressure to
the cheering and clapping of enthusiatic crowds, a record 10,750
athletes and their coaches from all parts of the world exerted
themselves to achieve the best possible results in 271 sporting
events under the Olympic motto -- higher, faster and stronger.
</P>
<P>
Joyful over victory or sad over defeat, they spend two weeks on
the sports venues and the Athletes Village, swap competitive
experiences, recall past encounters and make new friends.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, 23 world records have been
revamped as well as dozens of Olympic records and hundreds of
national records in archery, athletics, cycling, shooting,
swimming and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
Many otherwise unknown athletic talents have come to the
limelight or displayed promising potentials, contributing to the
development of human resources in general and sports in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Veterans shine in glamour and glory during the 17-day Games.
More often than not, they pass the Olympic torch onto younger
athletes and new-comers representing the growth and progress of
the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
Security, probably the biggest concern of all before and during
the Games, is generally okay except for the pipe-bomb explosion in
a public park, to the relief of the world sports governing boday
-- International Olympic Committee, and the sports delegations.
This is a big plus to the Games organizers.
</P>
<P>
Olympic old-timers are critical of the problems arising from
the Games vis-a-vis the previous two Olympics, blaming the
organizers for the lack of foresight and alternative plans to cope
with them. Persistent undesirable transport service, occasional
but annoying power blackouts and the failure to provide immediate
event results through a so-called sophisticated computer system
pose a haunting headache to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The presence of so much commercialism in the Games draws the
loudest of criticism. Ubiquitous billboards and a glittering
galaxy of commercial advertisements, vendors and hawkers that dot
approaches to Games venues make people feel like in a country
bazar rather than a sports meet.
</P>
<P>
These drawbacks however pale before what the Games have
achieved and the warmth with which the American people, especially
the Atlantans, have endeavored to make these Games a success,
though far below the best-of-all goal trumpeted by the organizers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs New Pesticide Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed today the legislation regulating pesticide residues in
food, which was expected to make fruit,vegetables and water safer
for all Americans, particularly children.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the bill in an official ceremony this noon after
the House and Senate passed it last week by votes of 417-0 and
97-1, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The president said the new Food Quality Protection Act is the
cornerstone of previous efforts to make sure the food and water
Americans consume is safe.
</P>
<P>
He said that studies show that infants and children are
particularly vulnerable to pesticide residues in the food they eat
because "Chemicals can go a long way in a small body."
</P>
<P>
The president said the bill has the support of farmers, the
food industry, environmentalists and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the new law, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) must examine 9,000 existing pesticides as well as new
ones under development. The EPA must examine one-third of the
existing limits on pesticide residues within three years.
</P>
<P>
The new law is the second major overhaul of food safety
procedures in a month. Clinton announced in early July that the
90-year system of inspecting meat and poultry by sight, smell and
touch will be supplemented with scientific tests to detect
potentially harmful microbes.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Spanish professional cyclist
Miguel Indurain captured the gold medal in men's time trial here
Saturday in the first Olympic Games opened to professional
cyclists.
</P>
<P>
Indurain clocked one hour four minutes and five seconds in the
four-lap, 52.2-kilometer race on the streets of Atlanta suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Indurain is a five-time winner of Tour de France from 1991 to
1995 and gold medalist in men's time trial at the 1995 World
Championships in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
His fellow countryman Abraham Olano, who beat Indurain in the
men's road race but lost to Indurain in the men's time trial at
the 1995 World Championships, clocked 1:04:17 to take the silver.
</P>
<P>
Chris Boardman of Britain, a time trial specialist who won the
1994 World Championships, finished in 1:04:36 to receive the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
The three medalists all started in the last group of 10
cyclists, with each setting off one and a half minutes behind the
other.
</P>
<P>
Boardman, gold medalist in men's individual pursuit at the
Barcelona Games, jumped to an early lead with the fastest first

<P>
But Indurain's speed surpassed Boardman's at two and a half
laps. Indurain then accumulated an advantage of 12 seconds before
the last lap and expanded it to 31 seconds at the finish line for

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today criticized the Israeli
cabinet's decision to lift the settlement building freeze imposed
by the previous government, saying that it would adversely affect
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was quoted by the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency as saying that Egypt will contact Israel over the
decision adopted at a weekly cabinet session Friday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet voted unanimously to lift the building restrictions
on construction in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions had been imposed by late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin four years ago to pave the way for peace
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the cabinet's decision, the government will simplify the
procedure for granting permission for construction in the Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, however, did not authorize specific building
projects.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Optimistic Of Economic Sanctions On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian president
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere said today that he was optimistic about
economic sanctions imposed on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of Mwalimu Nyerere
Foundation in Dodoma, Central Tanzania, the former president said
that sanctions had proved to be effective through international
cooperation as was the case during anti-apartheid crusade in
South Africa and decolonization of the then Ian Smith's Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
He was so far impressed by the response after the regional
summit on Burundi which was held in Arusha last Wednesday and
resolved to impose sanctions on Burundi, Nyerere said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, The European Union (EU), Belgium and
France are all in support of the sanctions, according to the
former president. "I hope they are serious on that," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nyerere dismissed an "unfounded non-sense" that
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was sympathetic to Pierre
Buyoya, a Tutsi, who overthrew Hutu President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya on July 25.
</P>
<P>
"We know Museveni, a man who went to school at the University
of Dar es Salaam. He is a radical opponent of injustices -- and
in fact he was rather very aggressive on the Burundi issue," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Basque Separatists Clash With Security Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Clashes took place today between
Basque separatist youths and anti-riot security forces in the
southern French town of Bayonne, Pyrennes-Atlantiques, near the
Franco-Spanish border.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse reported that during the clashes,
separatist youths damaged the fronts of some banks and burned a
national flag of France in front of the mayor's office building of
Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
The youths also threw molotov cocktails and firebombs at the
Security Company of the Republic (CRS) members, who in turn
charged the rioters, said the report without saying if any arrest
has been made.
</P>
<P>
The riot was put under control in the evening by CRS members,
who are deployed now in the area called "Petit Bayonne" where
clashes took place.
</P>
<P>
The riot began when some 500 separatists sighted a previously
unknown photographer among a group of journalists, and seized from
him his camera, two armbands with the letters of "press liaison"
and "police", as well as some cards bearing the name of the
ultrarightist party Front National.
</P>
<P>
When the photographer took refuge with the CRS, the rioters ran
to the center of the town while shouting Basque separatist slogans
in support of the Spanish terrorist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
The rioters also accused security forces of "torturing" three
French Basque separatists arrested on July 23 together with the
number-three of ETA "potato".

You've got to think beyond tribal differences if you are to be

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Ends Visit to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left here
today after a five-hour visit to Syria, during which he held talks
with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to explore ways of reviving
the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad and Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam as well as
Prime Minister Mahmoud Zoubei went to the airport to see the king
off.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources in the Syrian capital, King
Hussein and Al-Assad discussed the latest developments in the
Middle East pace process and ways of improving the
Syrian-Jordanian ties, which were strained after Jordan made peace
with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The sources said King Hussein conveyed to the Syrian president
a verbal message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu on
the possibility of resuming the peace negotiations between Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was reported to have had a secret meeting in
London last week with Natanyahu, but both sides have denied.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's visit to Damascus, the first since 1994, came
two days before a planned visit to Jordan by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled for years over
the issue of Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel
during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said he would not return to Syria the Golan
Heights, while Syria, on its part, insists that there will be no
peace without the full and unconditional return of Golan.
</P>
<P>
Syria also rejected an Israeli proposal to withdraw from a
south Lebanon border enclave in exchange for Syria's help in
disarming the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas.

ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Felix Savon added one gold
medal to Cuba's tally as he beat David Defiagbon of Canada in

<P>
Earlier in the 75kg class final, Ariel Hernandez claimed

<P>
Savon was too strong for Defiagbon to cope with and the bout
turned to be a loopsided one.

<P>
Savon had such an advantage that he threw his punches at will
and forced his Canadian rival into a desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
But Defiagbon managed to hold on to his feet and denied a

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Returns Home from Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein returned here this
evening from Damascus after a five-hour hour visit to Syria where
he held talks with President Hafez al-Assad and explored ways to
revive the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The king told reporters upon arrival that he was content with
the result of his meeting with al-Assad in which they talked about
the Mideast peace process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reviewed cooperation in water and
irrigation domains along with sharing waters of river Yarmuk to
serve the interests of the two countries, according to diplomatic
sources.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first since 1994 when relations were strained
because of Jordan's peace deal with Israel, was of special
significance, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said that he discussed with al-Assad "all the issues"
about the Arab-Israeli conflict. "But I can't and I don't think
its my right to reveal details."
</P>
<P>
The king's talks with al-Assad in Damascus came only two days
before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Jordan,
which has forged good relations with Israel since the two
countries signed a peace treaty in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopia Attaches Importance to Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- As a developing African
country, Ethiopia is in short of scientists and technologists.
More over, the situation is often aggravated by a lack of policy
designed to make the best use of the available skilled manpower.
</P>
<P>
As a major step to develop national science and technology,
the Ethiopian government issued a national policy document at the
end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
As stated in the policy document, the objectives of the policy
are to build national capability to generate, select, import,
develop, disseminate and apply appropriate technologies for the
realization of the country's socio-economic objectives.
</P>
<P>
The objectives also include to rationally conserve and utilize
its natural and manpower resources, to improve and develop the
knowledge, culture and the scientific and technological awareness
of the people of the country.
</P>
<P>
The policy also aims to promote the development of
traditional, new and emerging technologies and to make science
and technology activities more productive, efficient and
development oriented.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government began from 1992 to fund research
activities locally. It was the first in Ethiopian history that
the research activities were funded locally.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government took major step towards
decreasing the country's dependence on foreign fund for research
activities.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated a total of 3.5 million Birr to
support research projects in the past four years. A further one
million Birr is expected for the current budget year beginning
from July 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, national councils for agriculture and environmental
protection, health, industry and natural resources have been
formed among others to select viable research proposals according
to the country's priorities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of professional associations has
been growing from time to time in the country. The establishment
of these associations contributes a lot to the development of
science and technology by bringing professionals together where
they can develop their professions through concentrated efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, there are 51 professional
associations in the country. Of these associations, 11 are
concerned with agriculture, while 15 deal with pure science,
engineering and technology, and eight are geared towards health
sciences.
</P>
<P>
There are also nine associations dwelling on social sciences,
and three on education while five pursuing general issues related
to wildlife, environmental conservation and development.
</P>
<P>
To popularize science and technology among public, a radio
program in science and technology was started in the country.
</P>
<P>
The program, transmitted by Radio Ethiopia weekly in five
major languages of the nation, introduces to the public
scientists and technologists in general and Ethiopian and African
scientists and technologists in particular.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Use Declining In Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the capital of
south China's Guangdong province are smoking fewer cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Some experts attribute this to a recent ban on smoking in
public places, similar to those in other Chinese cities such as
Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 7,879 cases (one case is 50 cartons) were
sold in Guangzhou in June, but retail sales of cigarettes dropped
sharply by 39.66 percent that month compared with June of last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, consumption of fish, prawns, and vegetables
rose. Aquatic product sales went up 55.14 percent, with each
resident consuming five kilograms of fish and prawns every month.
</P>
<P>
The same month they consumed a total of 84,900 tons of
vegetables, an increase of 93.77 percent over the same month last
year, with each person eating more than 500 grams of vegetables
per day.
</P>
<P>
The smoking ban in public places has given local abstainers a
forceful weapon for protecting their right to clean air. It is not
uncommon now to see a smoker just about to light up, somewhere on
the city's streets, when he is greeted with a storm of protest
from passersby.
</P>
<P>
China is said to be the largest tobacco producer and consumer
in the world. The country has more than 350 million smokers, who
consume some 150 billion cigarettes every year, accounting for 30
percent of the world's total.

intra-Afghan rivalries and would like to see all Afghans to get
together to arrive at a durable and peaceful solution of the
long-term problem.
</P>
<P>
Holl, who called on Sheikh here today, said that Pakistan, an
important neighbor of Afghanistan, would be regularly consulted by
him for facilitating a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Sheikh on his peace efforts and the discussions
which he had held with the Afghan leaders during his recent visit
to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Holl, a German diplomat, was appointed as the new UN envoy to

<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,000 geologists from
around the world are in Beijing for the ten-day 30th International
Geological Congress (IGC), exchanging views on the possible origin
of sexuality, the evolution of life, understanding climate changes
from layers of soil built up over hundreds of thousands of years,
or even where underground treasures can be found.
</P>
<P>
The conference is held every four years and is a major event
for the world's geoscientists. Host countries previously supply
about a third of the participants, but this year Chinese
participants account for one-half. Russian scholars make up the
biggest delegation of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Organizing Committee have arranged for four scholars to
deliver specific reports at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Xuchang and Liu Dongsheng, of the Geological Research
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have attracted
attention with two papers, the former's on why the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau is getting higher at a rapid rate, and the latter's on the
impact of the plateau's growth on global environment.
</P>
<P>
There will be 223 seminars on a wide range of topics such as
the earth's environment in its early years, the evolution of
living things, forecasting earthquakes and other disasters,
remote-sensing technology, and dealing with nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,400 geologists will make presentations, and there
is a thick pile of 7,750 extracts, selected from 8,092 papers.
</P>
<P>
"These represent the highest achievements of international
geological circles over the past four years," said Cao Yougong, a
professor with the Academic Committee of the IGC.

SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A pair of embroidered shoes, 207
cm long and 92 cm high, weighing 120 kg, are now on display in
China's largest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The Guiness Book of Records' Shanghai office says that this is

The shoes used two kilograms of linen thread, 11 meters of
silk, 50 meters of shoe cloth, and 25 kilograms of cotton.
</P>
<P>
It took more than three months for four rural women to do the
embroidery and six skilled shoemakers to complete the masterpiece.
</P>

The shoes are presently on display in a local embroidery
museum, the country's first, which is run by Luo Chongqi, a

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tightens Traffic Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will launch a
two-month campaign as from Monday to deal with local traffic jams
and to get its residents and drivers to pay more attention to
traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
Its goal is to make the local traffic flow more orderly, to
target 16 specific traffic violations of both drivers and
operators of non-motorized vehicles, according to the local
traffic administration.
</P>
<P>
Drivers can be cited for using horns too often, parking cars
improperly, installing lights or sirens designed for police use
only, and allowing others to use their driving license.
</P>
<P>
Cyclists can be cited for running red lights, cycling without a
license, and carrying passengers, while pedestrians can be cited
for crossing roads improperly.
</P>
<P>
The traffic clampdown will be carried out mainly at 120
intersections and 255 major roads in urban areas, as well as key
roads in suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
Stalls set up on roadsides have been urged to move to allow
traffic to flow more smoothly and to improve appearances.
</P>
<P>
A total of 404 people were killed in traffic accidents in
Beijing in the first six months of this year, according to the
China Daily, while more than 70,000 new motor vehicles appeared on
local streets during the same period, bringing the total to 1.05
million and putting more pressure on the local traffic
administration.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the increased volume of traffic and the
increasing number of traffic violations are making traffic
congestion worse in the capital.

He said that the environmental thinking has progressed through
a series of stages including legislation, development, awareness
and incentives.
</P>
<P>
"The Environment Ministry is doing concrete jobs in all the

hold a meeting on issues related to the Middle East peace process
here Saturday, Palestinian Permanent Delegate to the Cairo-based
Arab League Mohamed Sobeih said today.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih, also Secretary General of the Palestinian National
Council, was quoted by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency as
saying that the two-day meeting will be chaired by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Executive Committee who are living outside the Palestinian
self-rule territories, including Chairman of the PLO Political
Department Farouk Qaddoumy, will also attend the meeting, Sobeih
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting's agenda will include Israel's decision to lift a
ban on expanding the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank, the Jerusalem issue and the current situation in the
Palestinian self-rule areas, according to Sobeih.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has played an active role in the Mideast peace process as a
mediator between Israel and the Palestinians in their talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has often hosted Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and
meetings convened by PLO officials.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the PLO Executive Committee held its
first meeting since the Palestinian January elections in the
Egyptian resort town of El Arish in north Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will meet with Arafat in Cairo
within the coming few days to brief him on the outcome of his
recent visit to the United states, aiming at coordinating their
stances on the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops to Withdraw From Chechnya in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Most of the remaining Russian
federal troops in Chechnya will pull out of the breakaway Republic
in early September, Chechen head of state Doku Zavgayev said in
the republic's capital Grozny today.
</P>
<P>
But some of them will remain in the war-torn republic in
Northern Caucasus to maintain peace and order, Zavgayev told the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chechen government is now reinforcing its Interior
Ministry and secret service and has begun to establish local
prosecution institutions.
</P>
<P>
In another development today, Itar-Tass said the Russian
delegation led by Minister of Nationalities and Regional Policy
Vyacheslav Mikhailov has so far failed to hold talks with the
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov threatened to hold negotiations with other
influential Chechen opposition forces if the rebels failed to meet
them before August 6.
</P>
<P>
The bloody Chechen conflict broke out in December 1994 when
Moscow sent thousands of troops and tanks into the remote republic
to quash its independence drive.
</P>
<P>
In late May, President Boris Yeltsin ordered the Russian troops
to leave Chechnya as soon as possible in a bid to boost his image
tainted by the prolonged Chechen conflict before the June 16
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the Russian troops began soon after the
announcement of Yeltsin's decree and so far only two regiments of
Russian troops -- one from the Defense Ministry and the other from
the Interior Ministry -- stay in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Two Chinese Electric Buses For Trial Use In Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Two buses that are about a third
cheaper than similar ones on the international market products,
according to the Electric Vehicle Research and Development Center
under the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defense, are to be used in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Two Hong Kong companies, China Power &AMP; Light and Electricity
Advisory Services Co. signed an agreement here today with the
Chinese developer to buy the state-of-the-art electric buses for
trial operation in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 52-seat YW6120DD bus is manufactured by the Chinese
military for civilian use. It has a maximum speed of 90 kph and
can last 160 km on a fully-charged storage battery.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 different technological applications were
developed for the bus, including a powerful driving system and
technology from the US's Northrop Grumman.
</P>
<P>
The world's major auto manufacturers are working on electric
automobiles and buses as possible substitutes for fossil-fuel cars
and buses because of pollution and limited oil resources.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Reform Pays Off in Uganda (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The capital Kampala of Uganda is
truly a construction site to tourists where big buildings are
growing up storey by storey each month and buildings abandoned in
the chaotic days of 1970s and early 1980s are being rehabilitated
and decorated with colored ceramic tiles.
</P>
<P>
In major towns around Kampala such as Mbarara, Jinja and
Entebbe, new buildings have sprung up like mushrooms in recent
years, showing economic prosperity throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
It is a direct result of an economic reform program, a
wide-ranging economic reform package which the Uganda government
launched together with the international monetary fund (IMF) in
1987.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the package, the local currency was
devalued and replaced with a new Shilling, trade in farm produce,
once being monopolized by incompetent and heavily corrupt
state-owned firms, was liberalized and trade in foreign exchange
freed.
</P>
<P>
As the program is being implemented, days of shortages of
essential commodities have gone forever and now competition is
driving goods prices down to the reach of most Ugandans, said
Keith Muhakanizi, economic adviser in the Ministry of Finance
recently.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala, many new markets have cropped up in recent years
along Kampala and Jinja roads, while a project worth 4.7 million
U.S. Dollars to build three modern markets has since this January
been carried out.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, over 2,000 vendors roaming along streets in Kampala
will have their own stalls or shops in the new markets which have
a total area of 16,000 square meters with 2,800 stalls and shops.
</P>
<P>
Now in downtown Kampala and other cities in Uganda, traders
can be seen jostling in selling high-tech audio and visual
equipment, imported trendy fabrics, perfumes and even imported
fruits, vegetables and cars.
</P>
<P>
"However, it was unimaginable ten years ago," one customer
told Xinhua recently at a market in the city center of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform package, the Uganda government decided
in late 1980s to return 600 million U.S. Dollars worth of
properties formerly owned by Asians and confiscated in 1972 by
former president Idi Amin.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Reform Pays Off in Uganda (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by the decision, a
large number of foreign investors have since flocked into Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to the Uganda Investment Authority in charge of
attracting investment, it has since 1991 issued 1,523 licenses to
new enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The investment of licensed projects amounted to 2.5 billion
Dollars. Of this 1.7 billion Dollars have been injected into
working projects, mostly in the fields of manufacturing,
construction and food processing, which have created jobs for
Ugandans and will generate a total of 88,526 jobs.
</P>
<P>
With jobs gained from new investment, more and more Ugandans
now can afford to buy new dresses for their wives and children
and daily necessities for their families.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform package, about 50,000 soldiers out of
100,000 in 1991 will be repatriated this year and thousands of
civil servants in state-owned companies have been sacked in a bid
to reduce red tape and save state cash.
</P>
<P>
As a result the average monthly wage for Ugandan worker has
risen to 120,000 Shillings (120 US Dollars) from less than 20,000
(20 Dollars) five years ago. Besides, labor efficiency has since
improved obviously.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income in Uganda remains low at 230 Dollars, but is
much better than 160 Dollars eight years ago, according to
statistics published recently by the Uganda government.
</P>
<P>
Tight state spending, another measure of economic reform has
compelled inflation rate to drop from three-digit figures in
early 1980s to average 6 percent since 1987.
</P>
<P>
As confidence in the local currency restored, foreign reserves
had risen to 467 million Dollars last year from only 14 million
Dollars in the 1984/85 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the above performance, western donors have since
1988 injected into Uganda's economy 800 million Dollars in aid
yearly.
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors can see with their own eyes that the reform
package, a bitter pill swallowed up by Ugandans nine years ago,
has since brought economic recovery to the country.
</P>
<P>
In short, Uganda has now embarked onto a steady path of
economic recovery and growth.
</P>
<P>
However, economic observers here hold that there is still a
long way for Ugandans to go to see the kind of economy in the
mid-1970s when Uganda had one of strongest economy in east
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Government Pursuing Multi-Pronged Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
pursuing a multi-pronged policy to tackle the acute problem of
unemployment in the country, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking with a delegation of Britain-based Pakistani investors,
Pakistani government consultant Awais Jawaid Bangash said that the
first policy is to solve the problem through economic development
with specific employment generating schemes.
</P>
<P>
The second policy pertains to efforts for reducing population
growth to curtail supply side on the labor market, Bangash said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's present population is estimated at 131.63 million
and its growth rate is 2.9 per cent in the fiscal year 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Bangash said that the third policy is to reduce unemployment
through comprehensive technical and vocational training to enhance
the marketability of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
The government is revamping the educational and training
program aimed at enhancing the literacy rate as well as skill of
the labor force to cater to the needs of the labor market, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has also proposed to launch an
aggressive program for emigration of surplus Pakistani work force.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, it has decide to streamline the export of
manpower and establish high level contracts with friendly
countries in the Middle East as well as the Far East, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1995, about 122,600 Pakistanis went abroad for
employment.
</P>
<P>
Under the directives of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, the government has set up a special Human Resources
Development Committee of the Cabinet to assess the human resources
requirement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Committee is also in charge of formulating policies and
programs for reducing the unemployment rate in the country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that with the efforts made by all walks
of life, the problem of the unemployment will be solved in the
near future.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prefecture May Help Reveal Origin of Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese biologists believe that
Liaoxi Prefecture in northeast China's Liaoning Province may be
the one place that will help reveal the origin of prehistoric
birds.
</P>
<P>
The area is regarded as a treasure-trove of ancient animals,
with large quantities of well-preserved fossils rarely seen in
other parts of the world contained in its substrata.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, biologists have found many fossils of a prehistoric
bird, archeopteryx, but the strata beneath the fossils are those
of marine deposits, indicating that archeopteryx migrated to
Germany from other places.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the terrestrial strata in Liaoxi Prefecture
contain large quantities of archeopteryx fossils which belonged to
the middle or later years of the Jurassic period.
</P>
<P>
The China Geological Museum has 14 archeopteryx fossils that
belonged to the later Jurassic period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese biologists have also found fossils which are believed
to be those of birds dating back 160 million years, the earliest
bird to have been found.

<HEADLINE> Central, Western China To Become More Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging a growing
number of foreign-funded projects, as its industrial policy, to be
developed in central and western regions, which are rich in labor
and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
These remarks come from Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman for the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, who says that China
will give priority to the development of resources and
infrastructure projects, and to expanding investment in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that some labor-intensive projects in
coastal areas be shifted to central and western China, and that
profits from coastal areas be invested in these areas, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, he added, the central and
western regions increased their use of foreign investment, mainly
in infrastructure, basic industries and labor- and
resources-intensive projects.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that China hopes that overseas investors will be more
active in doing business in those regions and says that he
believes they may be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that investment in capital construction and
technological renovation had a 15.16 percent year-on-year increase
in the central regions and a 13.41 percent in the western parts,
compared with the 6.85 percent increase in the east.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since the 1980s that inland areas have
come out on top in investment.
</P>
<P>
China has been placing greater importance on its central and
western parts and on making these areas more accessible to the
outside world and launched a massive campaign last year to improve
the imbalance in regional development. A series of policies were
worked out in favor of inland regions, where economic growth has
long lagged behind that of eastern coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Real Estate Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest financial
center, Shanghai, is looking for ways, starting with its newly
developed Pudong Area, to breath new lease of life into its real
estate market.
</P>
<P>
One of a series of measures developed is to allow individual
people or Chinese firms to apply for residence cards when they
invest a certain amount of money in real estate.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will include purchasers of housing in
the group of Chinese firms, enterprises, government and
non-government organizations, and others with identity cards. Also
included are Chinese studying or working overseas who do not have
long-term residence permits, and joint-ventures that intend to
purchase residences for employees.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises or government organizations from other parts of the
country can also apply for residence cards.
</P>
<P>
To encourage individuals to buy houses, the municipality cut
taxes on real estate deals by 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 750,000 sq.m. of commercial housing and 220,000
sq.m. of office housing in the Pudong area are planned to be sold
in the first group of commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
The area will provide consultancies, taxation, financial
insurance, transfer of title, and other related services for
housing purchases for the customers.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China and the Municipal Public Housing Fund Center will provide
one and a half billion yuan in loans to support Shanghai residents
to buy housing in urban areas and spur the growth of the real
estate market.

<HEADLINE> Water Resource Controls In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's major cities have been
urged to improve the management and controls on water resources so
as to help ease the country's water shortages and reduce water
wastage.
</P>
<P>
Places where water controls are not in place will speed up
centralization of controls as soon as possible, Zhu Dengquan,
vice-minister of water resources, explained at a national
conference on water permits today.
</P>
<P>
After three years of work, 730,000 units and individuals in
China have permits that allow access to water and account for 80
percent of the total water consumption in the country, according
to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that there has been a unification of water
resource controls, which is an advance in the water resources
management system, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is poor in water resources, ranking 109th in the world,
and some 300 of its 600-plus cities are short of water, which
holds up the nation's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the country passed its first water law and the Chinese
government issued a series of regulations on water permits that
required those who want access to water supplies to apply for
permits.
</P>
<P>
So far, 90 percent of the country's 600-plus cities have
implemented the water permit system, but there are still over 60
big and medium-sized cities that are failing to comply and their
water resources are controlled by various departments, which
aggravates the shortage, waste, and pollution problem, Zhu said,
adding that this situation must be changed quickly.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Scientists Extract Milk from Melon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the College of
Medicine, University of Lagos, and the Nigerian Institute of
Medical Research have developed milk and yoghurt from melon seed,
the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Melon is used traditionally in the preparation of highly
relished vegetable soup in Nigeria and is reputed to be rich in
protein.
</P>
<P>
The new project, designed to expand the uses of melon, will
provide cheap protein for people especially now that the price of
cow milk is beyond the reach of many Nigerians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although melon is available in abundance in Nigeria, its use
has been restricted to soup alone and some local cake, resulting
in under untilization. And Nigerians are noted for consumption of
staple foods such as grains and tubers which are low in protein.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, who are able to stimulate the
milk and yoghurt from melon seeds through high biochemical
process, the crude protein content of melon varies from 28-35
percent and is of high quality, being rich in almost all
essential amino acids.
</P>
<P>
The oil from the seed is also adequate in essential fatty
acids, the value of which ranges from 51-67 percent.
</P>
<P>
They said the taste evaluation of both products show they
would be generally accepted as milk and yoghurt substitutes with
desirable body and texture.

JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Two Islamic militants escaped
today from the Eshmoret jail at Beit Lid in northwest of Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the Israeli Public Security
Ministry, the two prisoners escaped by digging a 10-meter
underground tunnel under the prison, and their escape was
discovered this morning.
</P>
<P>
The two men were reportedly members of the Islamic Jihad

sentence for killing an Arab resident in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have set up roadblocks, conducting a
widespread searching for the two fugitives with the help of
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani has appointed a
commission of inquiry, headed by ex-prison commissioner Shaul
Levy, to investigate into the case.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Aidid's Faction Busy in Choosing Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The faction of late General
Farah Aidid is now busy in choosing a successor to Aidid and has
no time to pay attention to the peace appeal made by Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto recently.
</P>
<P>
The leadership council of late Aidid's government said it only
decided to continue Aidid's policy, Radio South Mogadishu today
quoted the government's foreign minister General Jama Mohamed
Ghalib as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib also urged foreign countries to refrain from meddling
in "Somalia's internal affairs". Aidid's supporters consider the
United States and the United Nations as their no. 1 enemy while
the European Union as the second.
</P>
<P>
General Ghalib said they would fill the vacant position
according to the transitional charter of their government within
seven days.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to name who may replace general Aidid, and
also declined to make comment on which clan the new successor
will come from.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the radios of the two main rival factions opposing
Aidid had declared unilateral cease-fire and called on Aidid's
supporters to come to the negotiation table for the common good
of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in Mogadishu consider that Aidid's
supporters are going ahead to nominate Aidid's successor even
though serious misunderstanding is being reported from the indoor
meetings Aidid's Habar Gidir clan are holding in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A source said that Hussein Mohamed Farah, a son of late Aidid,
is about to be nominated, while other sources said Aidid's
political advisor Mohamed Garah Jumale will be the successor.
Whoever he is, the name of the successor will come out on the
screen within the forthcoming 48 hours, they asserted.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu remains extremely calm for the third day today after
the death of general Aidid. There are no sporadic shootings even
across the green lines that divide the militiamen of the opposing
factions in Medina and Bosnia vicinity of Osman Atto's men. The
business centers are all open even though there are not many
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
However, people are very much worried about what will happen
next and a lot are seen standing in groups on the sidewalks
gossiping at the latest developments in the country.

 rejected the appeal by Yigal Amir on his life sentence for
murdering former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel ruled that there was no doubt that
Amir murdered Rabin in what they described as "a villainous
act."
</P>
<P>
Amir did not appear at the court, but he wrote a letter
to the judges saying he was on hunger strike over the
prison condition and going to the court would be too
"taxing" for him.
</P>
<P>
On November 4 last year, Amir fired three bullets at Rabin
when he left a mass peace rally in Tel Aviv. Rabin died soon
after he was sent to hospital, and one of his body guards was
hurt.
</P>
<P>
Amir, who confessed he killed Rabin to stop the peace process
that handed over land to the Palestinians, was sentenced to life
imprisonment plus six years early this year by the Tel Aviv
District Court for murdering Rabin and injuring his body guard.
</P>
<P>
However, the lawyers for Amir appealed the sentence, arguing
that Amir was probably not the only one who shot at Rabin,
and he should be convicted of manslaughter rather than murder.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also tried to convince the judges that Amir
did not have criminal intent, because he did not go through
a normal decision-making process and never weighed relevant
factors, such as harm to his family, the sacrifice of his
own future.
</P>
<P>
Another argument put forward by the defense lawyers was that
Amir only intended to paralyze Rabin, so he shot at Rabin's back
rather than his head.
</P>
<P>
However, the judges pointed out that the defense lawyers in
the original court hearing did not even suggest the possibility
of another attacker. And, in the majority of Amir's several
statements, he clearly confessed that he did intend to kill
Rabin.

<HEADLINE> EU, Croats Fail to Reach Agreement on Mostar Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the
Bosnian Croats failed to reach an agreement Saturday during their
negotiations on ending the boycott of the Mostar city council.
</P>
<P>
Dragan Gasic, spokesman for the EU administration in Mostar,
said that without a way to solve the Mostar problem, the EU would
decide to withdraw from the divided city at its meeting in
Brussels, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Croats have refused to accept the results of the June 30
elections sponsored by the EU, in which they lost to the Muslim
side, and boycotted the newly-elected city council, saying that
there were "irregularities" in overseas polling stations where
most of the voters were Muslim refugees.
</P>
<P>
The EU threatened to pull out of Mostar and stop all its
reconstruction projects there if the Croats did not end their
boycott by the midnight of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The EU has administered Mostar for two years, trying to reunify
and rebuild it since it was split in half by the 1993-1994
Croat-Muslim war.

<HEADLINE> 30th International Geological Congress Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The 30th International Geological
Congress (IGC), the largest scientific conference to be held in
China, opened at the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng, who is honorary president of the 30th IGC,
delivered a speech at the opening ceremony to welcome geologists
from all over the world to the conference, saying that it will be
"an important milestone in the development of the geosciences."
</P>
<P>
Li commended the hard work of geologists throughout history,
especially during the past century, and noted that the geologists
have made tremendous leaps forward in man's understanding of the
earth.
</P>
<P>
Geology is a basic science that is closely linked to the
development of resources and protection of the environment, Li
noted, and said that the conference has drawn the attention not
only of scientists worldwide but also of people from all walks of
life.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also attaches great importance to
geology. With the rapid growth of its economy, China has become a
major producer and consumer of mineral products, and China's
economic growth will mean a greater demand for mineral resources,
which in turn will result in increased exploration and mineral
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
W.S. Fyfe, president of the International Union of Geological
Sciences, said that knowledge from the Earth Sciences must be
integrated into all technological planning in the decades ahead,
to avoid environmental and economic disasters.
</P>
<P>
"We need new systems and new technology to use our energy,
water, soil, and mineral resources more more rationally and
effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese leaders present were Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Wen
Jiabao, Song Jian, Luo Gan, and Zhu Guangya. Beijing mayor Li
Qiyan said the city will do its best to accommodate the delegates.
</P>
<P>
The IGC is 118 years old and is a major event for the world's
geoscientists. The 30th session has attracted more than 6,000
participants from 120 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Song Ruixiang, president of the Organizing Committee, said that
the current congress has set continental geology as its main
theme, with emphasis placed on geo-tectonics and tectonic
evolution, mineral and energy resources, environmental protection,
and geological hazard reduction.
</P>
<P>
Song, who is minister of Geology and Mineral Resources, said
that the organizing committee has had more than 8,100 papers
submitted.
</P>
<P>
During the ten-day conference, there will be 71 talks on
special subjects, 152 scientific discussions, and 78 field trips
to be arranged.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Green Tea Effective on Lowering Cholesterol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese green tea has a
positive effect in controlling cholesterol and is a key to the
prevention of heart disease, according to a study of the
University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Studies on rats at the University's pharmacology department
showed that green tea had an active lipid-lowering ingredient
which reduced cholesterol levels by about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
A researcher of the department said catechin, a group of
compounds contained in the tea leaves, lowered the absorption of
cholesterol while promoting its excretion.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that the effects of catechin in reducing
the cholesterol level were better than commonly used drugs.
</P>
<P>
The researcher said that the fat from meat, seafood and egg
yolk tended to raise the cholesterol level in the blood and liver,
and that too much cholesterol in the blood could cause heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
The researcher found that non-fermented green tea was most
effective because catechin would be destroyed during fermentation
of the tea leaves.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Trams Company Plans Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Tramways Limited, the
sole tram company in the territory, is planning to open new tram
lines to meet the growing needs of commuters.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager of the company, Frankie Yick
Chi-ming, the proposed tram line expansion includes a line from
Star Ferry to southern beaches on Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
He said tram lovers could one day be riding from the Star Ferry
to the southern beaches in air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
Electric trams have been operating on Hong Kong Island since
1904 and now it has over 160 trams moving on 13 kilometers of
double track along the north shore of the Island and three
kilometers of single track around Happy Valley.
</P>
<P>
Yick said reclamation was moving the waterfront further away
from Central and Wan Chai, so commuters needed an extended tram
line or an entirely new line.
</P>
<P>
He said it will be a good opportunity for his company to
introduce new air-conditioned trams in the commercial and
sightseeing areas planned on the reclaimed land.
</P>
<P>
According to Yick, Hongkong tramways would also update its
existing seven sub-stations and build two more to ensure
sufficient power for the new lines.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Adopts New Measures to Limit Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has adopted new measures to
limit the flow of guest workers into the kingdom in a
bid to easing the high unemployment in the country, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign residents have so far this year increased
from 250,000 in 1995 to approximately 300,000, of whom nearly
30,000 are unemployed but continue to reside in the country, the
kingdom's sole English-language daily Jordan Times said, citing
figures from the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry took the decision last week to work out a new
integrated plan to better control the local labor market. Under
the plan, the Ministry of Interior has been requested to
circulate strict instructions to border police stations.
</P>
<P>
Before stamping passports of foreigners entering the country,
border officers are now required to check for specific details
concerning the workers' employers, the place of residence and
the date and number of the approval letter from the Ministry
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
Visiting non-Jordanians will have their passports stamped upon
entry with a phrase refusing them any work opportunity, and
visitors will have to inform border officers of their residence
address during their stay, which, was aimed at ensuring that
visitors do not stay beyond the approved period and offenders
will be dispelled from the country and not allowed reentry.
</P>
<P>
The plan reaffirms the need for implementing a 1996 law
prohibiting guest workers from employment in certain trades and
provides for intensive inspection campaigns to ensure that
employers comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that it is a new move by the Jordanian
authorities to control the flow of foreign workers into the
kingdom after the failure of restrictive measures taken last
year.
</P>
<P>
The government demanded last year that foreign workers in the
kingdom get their work permission from departments concerned or
leave the country within three months.
</P>
<P>
The foreign laborers without work permission, who were
classified by the government as "illegal workers," were mainly
from Egypt and Syria and employed in the trades which were
despised by Jordanians for its "long work hour and low pay."
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian authorities blamed them for the increasingly
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment stands at 15 percent according to official
figures, but analysts here believe that the actual number would
be more than 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Report: Vegetables May Reduce Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Initial animal studies at
Israel's Haifa Technion University indicate that eating
cruciferous vegetables can significantly reduce the risk of
contracting breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
According to Focus, the university's newsletter, animals, which
were injected with a powerful carcinogenic substance plus a
metabolic derivative of vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower,
broccoli, Brussels sprouts, radishes and mustard, lowered the risks
of getting cancer.
</P>
<P>
"The studies indicate that certain components of this family
of plants have a significant effect on suppressing development of
cancer cells," said Shmuel Yannai, a professor in the Food
Engineering and Biotechnology Department of the university.
</P>
<P>
However, Yannai, who is working with other experts on this
subject from major universities and institutes in Israel, said
that there is still no approval for injecting this material into
humans.
</P>
<P>
Epidemiologists have noticed that the breast-cancer rate among
women in western Germany is much higher than that among women in
eastern Germany and other eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
The difference, they said, can not be attributed to genetic
factors, because the west and east Germany was separated only for
a few decades.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that there was a major dietary difference in
western and eastern Germany. Since the east Germany lacks fruits
and most vegetables, the main component of the east Germans'
diet was cabbage, which is still very cheap and plentiful there.
</P>
<P>
Yannai, who remains cautious, said that "the results are only
partial, and we have not succeeded in proving them conclusively."
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," he said, "they are encouraging, and I hope
that in the near future, cruciferous vegetables will replace
medicine in the pharmacy."

<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Union of
Geological Science (IUGS), established in March, 1961, is a
non-governmental and non-profit international academic
organization.
</P>
<P>
It works for promoting world-wide cooperation in the research,
education and publicity of geological science.
</P>
<P>
Member states and regions are asked to appoint certain
organizations and institutions as representatives to join IUGS,

IUGS has 100 state members, 12 special committees and 35
independent subordinate associations. Its activities cover a wide
range of subjects, making it one of the most authoritative
academic organizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
There is a very close relationship between IUGS and the
International Geological Congress (IGC), as it was IGC that first
raised the topic and made the last decision on the establishment
of IUGS.
</P>
<P>
Regulations, of both IUGS and IGC, provide that IUGS should
assist the work of IGC, while IGC should accept guidance and
financial aid from IUGS.

<HEADLINE> Aidid's Faction Busy in Choosing Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The faction of late General
Farah Aidid is now busy in choosing a successor to Aidid and has
no time to pay attention to the peace appeal made by Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto recently.
</P>
<P>
The leadership council of late Aidid's government said it only
decided to continue Aidid's policy, Radio South Mogadishu today
quoted the government's foreign minister General Jama Mohamed
Ghalib as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib also urged foreign countries to refrain from meddling
in "Somalia's internal affairs". Aidid's supporters consider the
United States and the United Nations as their no. 1 enemy while
the European Union as the second.
</P>
<P>
General Ghalib said they would fill the vacant position
according to the transitional charter of their government within
seven days.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to name who may replace general Aidid, and
also declined to make comment on which clan the new successor
will come from.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the radios of the two main rival factions opposing
Aidid had declared unilateral cease-fire and called on Aidid's
supporters to come to the negotiation table for the common good
of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in Mogadishu consider that Aidid's
supporters are going ahead to nominate Aidid's successor even
though serious misunderstanding is being reported from the indoor
meetings Aidid's Habar Gidir clan are holding in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A source said that Hussein Mohamed Farah, a son of late Aidid,
is about to be nominated, while other sources said Aidid's
political advisor Mohamed Garah Jumale will be the successor.
Whoever he is, the name of the successor will come out on the
screen within the forthcoming 48 hours, they asserted.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu remains extremely calm for the third day today after
the death of general Aidid. There are no sporadic shootings even
across the green lines that divide the militiamen of the opposing
factions in Medina and Bosnia vicinity of Osman Atto's men. The
business centers are all open even though there are not many
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
However, people are very much worried about what will happen
next and a lot are seen standing in groups on the sidewalks
gossiping at the latest developments in the country.

<HEADLINE> Former Burundi Ruling Party Leader Castigates New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, 4 (Xinhua) -- The President of the former
ruling party in Burundi, the Front Pour la Democratie au Burundi
(FRODEBU), Minani Jean, has vehemently castigated the new Burundi
strongman, retired Major Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
He described major Buyoya as a killer, a man with no vision
and likened him to dictator Iddi Amin of Uganda, according to
local press today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in dar es Salaam on Saturday at
the Burundi Embassy, Minani Jean said Buyoya would never bring
peace to the war torn country except wanton killings and untold
sufferings to the Burundi people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he praised the east and central African heads of
states for having agreed to impose sanctons against the new
rulers.
</P>
<P>
Jean called upon the international community and peace-loving
forces in the world to exert pressure on Burundi's military
strongman to make him step down in favor of a democratically
elected government.
</P>
<P>
The FRODEBU president, who was a member of Parliament,
minister and Speaker, also called on the international community
to implement the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by the
recent summit of the east and central African states.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on some foreign powers who are against the
imposition of sanctions, he said, "we are aware there are some
who do not like the Arusha resolutions, but the important aspect
of the whole spectre is that east and central African leaders
understand the Burundi situation better then them."
</P>
<P>
Jean said neighboring countries were adversely affected by the
happenings in Burundi and it was for this reason, "we very much
value their timely Arusha resolutions".
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in Burundi, he said since Buyoya took
over on July 25, 1996, civilians had fled the country in the
thousands because of the killings of defenseless people by the
army and militia.
</P>
<P>
"Major Buyoya and his henchmen will not bring development,
peace or justice, but will only perpetuate the killings of
defenseless Burundians," he complained.
</P>
<P>
Jean said the sanctions imposed would bite very hard on the
military rulers and not the ordinary Burundians because they have
enough food.
</P>
<P>
The FRODEBU president revealed that his party would be forced
to take up arms against the junta if killings continued. However,
he said they would prefer using democratic and peaceful means to
replace Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
On the merger between Burundi and one of the neighboring
countries, he said, "I do not see why we cannot merge with a
neighbor." He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the FRODEBU leader briefed newsmen on what has been
happening in Burundi since the country gained its independence.
He said it was a history of killings and tortures. "I call upon
the international community to help stop these killings once and
for all for the good of mankind," he said soothingly.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference he was flanked by the Burundi Charge
de Affairs, Anselme Bankambona.

<HEADLINE> Power Supply Restored to Peninsula Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Power supply was fully
restored to Peninsula Malaysia by 11:00 am (0300 GMT) today after
a blackout which lasted more than 12 hours, crippling the whole
West Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The senior manager in charge of power supply of the National
Energy Corporation, Yusoff Ibrahim, told a news conference that
power was restored in stages when power stations in the peninsula
were reconnected to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
The major power failure which hit the peninsula yesterday
afternoon was caused by a fault at the Sultan Ismail Power Station
at Paka on the East Coast of West Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The blackout which affected all types of household and business
activities and traffic flows in the peninsula was the second major
power failure to hit Peninsula Malaysia since 1992 when a major
power failure caused by a lightning strike lasted 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Yusoff said a preliminary report on the cause of the blackout
would be handed over to Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and
Posts Leo Moggie later today.

<HEADLINE> Israel Worries about West Bank Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli defense
establishment is worried about the violence in the West Bank,
following clashes between the residents and Palestinian police in
the past few days, Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed and 15 others injured Friday when
Palestinian police guarding the Tulkarm jail in the West Bank
clashed with stone-throwing protesters who demanded the release
of Hamas prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Hamas claimed Ibrahim Hadayeh, a Hamas protester, was killed by
the Palestinian police during a peaceful demonstration, while
Palestinian Radio said that Hadayeh was shot dead by armed Hamas
activists.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in the Palestinian streets was very tense after
Wednesday night's death of Mahmoud Jumayal, a Fatah activist, who
was reportedly tortured to death in a Palestinian jail.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, more than 2,000 Palestinian youth accompanied the
body of Jumayal to its burial site in the West Bank town of
Nablus, shouting abuses at police, and some of them threw stones
and burned tires.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security forces are more concerned that the
violence may spread to other Palestinian towns in the West Bank
after Hamas called for an "intifada" (uprising) against the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army commanders in the West Bank have been ordered to
beef up their troops, but not to interfere with the troubles
among the Palestinians, according the Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops were also instructed to help the
Palestinian police to treat the wounded people, but to let the
Palestinian police themselves deal with any violent
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The army had already declared Nablus and Tulkarm closed
military zones immediately after the violence broke out, barring
Israelis from entering the two West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residents in Tulkarm said that the Palestinian
police Friday imposed a curfew in the town, the first time the PNA
threw a curfew on a Palestinian town.
</P>
<P>
Israel had handed over Nablus and Turkarm, as well as Jenin,
Kalkilya, Ramallah and Bethlehem in the West Bank to the PNA by
the end of last year, in accordance with the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli security source told Israel Radio that
Israel's interest is stability in the Palestinian autonomous
areas and the continuation of the rule of PNA President Yasser
Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Fund for Peasants to Be Pooled in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An investment fund for small
scale farmers has been lined up by the Peasant Farmers Union of
Zambia (PFUZ) to back them so that they can stand on their own in
hard times which have hit the farming sector.
</P>
<P>
The ''Sunday Times of Zambia'' paper today quoted PFUZ
President Patrick Kaeka as saying that an account has already
been opened at the Zambia National Commercial Bank for the fund
which is scheduled to be officially launched on August 20.
</P>
<P>
Kaeka said the fund is also designed to facilitate the desire
of the small scale farmers or peasants to enhance their financial
base by acquiring shares in Lima bank.
</P>
<P>
By so doing, Kaeka noted, the farmers will help solve the
bank's persistent problems of loans recovery since they will be
duty-bound to honor their commitments unlike the case now when
there is so much defaulting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Frederick Chiluba said on Saturday that
the Zambian farming community should change its attitude toward
the agricultural sector credit system and treat it as real
business.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the 70th Zambia agricultural and commercial
show in Lusaka, Chiluba said although the government has over the
years invested heavily in the credit system as one way of
boosting the sector, its efforts have largely been characterized
by poor loans recovery.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, Chiluba said, the government has lost
heavily and some credit institutions have even collapsed.
</P>
<P>
''If agriculture has to be transformed then our attitudes to
it have to be business like, credit repayment is a business
action,'' Chiluba noted.

the peace agreement with the MORO National Liberation Front, has
assured that the move does not involve amendments to the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star:
</P>
<P>
-- Rampaging waters destroyed a 50-meter portion of the
megadike near Pampanga town, San Fernando province, Saturday

</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer:

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands Evidence from US on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian newspaper today
attacked U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry for his "baseless
accusation" against Iran for an alleged terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
English daily "Iran News" said in its editorial that it
is really surprising that a high-ranking official of a country points
the finger at Iran accusing it of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on who could be involved in the June 25
bombing in Saudi Arabia, William Perry said Friday "possibly
Iran." The White House believes "terrorists" who bombed the Khobar
Towers in Dhahran, which killed 19 Americans, were "trained at a
camp in Tehran."
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities believe that the United States is
accelerating its terrorist charges against Iran to justify a
military operation against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Iran's permanent mission at the United Nations, in a
statement issued late Friday, accused Washington of trying "to
make political gains" from the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper editorial said "the best response to the U.S.
rhetoric is 'shut up or put up. We are asking the U.S. to
shut up because enough is enough."
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. can present documentation in support of its
accusations, it should do so or shut up," it added.
</P>
<P>
As far as the American military adventurism against Iran is
concerned, the daily noted, such a move will not be the
first and of course not the last.
</P>
<P>
"No one knows better than the United States the might of the
Islamic combatants. If they
have forgotten, we would like to remind them that each and
every Iranian knows how to defend every inch of his or her
motherland," the editorial concluded.

BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China is one of the few countries
which boasts vast reserve of mineral resources with relatively
complete species in the world.
</P>
<P>
The country has discovered 168 kinds of mineral resources, with
the deposits of 151 resources having been proved.
</P>
<P>
The value of latent mineral resources in China ranks third in
the world after the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
China has verified the reserves of seven fuel minerals, 54
metal minerals and 87 non-metal minerals. The prospective reserve
of petroleum is 94 billion tons and that of natural gas is 43
trillion cubic meters. The coal reserve at layers 100 meters below
the ground surface is 2.3 trillion tons. The proved reserve of
oil, gas and coal is only 17 percent, 2.2 percent and two percent,

<HEADLINE> Hamas Calls for Uprising against PNA, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Israeli Islamic
Resistance Movement, or Hamas, has called for an uprising against
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel following a
recent wave of violence in the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, in a statement issued Saturday, denounced PNA
President Yasser Arafat as "a collaborator" who worked together
with the Israeli government. It declared the "beginning of a
popular intifada against the authority which sold itself to the
occupier."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after a Hamas protester, Ibrahim
Hadayeh, was shot dead by Palestinian police as they tried to
disperse hundreds of stone-throwing protesters outside the Tulkarm
jail.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was called to protest the tortured death of
Fatah activist Mahmoud Jumayal by the Palestinian police last
week.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, hundreds of Hamas supporters rushed the prison
compound demanding the release of all Hamas prisoners, many of
them believed to be on hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
About 15 people were injured by bullets and stones when the
Palestinian police guarding the jail clashed with the
stone-throwing protesters. Dozens of prisoners escaped during the
violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Hamas called on its armed wing Izzadine Hassim, which was
responsible for a series of suicide bombings from late February to
early March which killed 58 people inside Israel, to "strike
Zionist targets in response to the crimes of Arafat's regime and
its oppressive militia."
</P>
<P>
"We in the Hamas movement, believe in the right of the people
to resist its tormentors and to break the chains that the
Zionists and their collaborators use to shackle them under
national slogans and the building of an independent state," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in the Palestinian streets has been very tense
after the Wednesday night's death of Jumayal and the pictures of
his clearly tortured body were made public.
</P>
<P>
The PNA acted quickly to punish the three policemen
responsible for the death of Jumayal as they were sentenced Friday
night to 10-15 years of imprisonment by a military court in
Jericho. But this failed to calm the anger of the Palestinian
radicals.
</P>
<P>
Hamas appears to be aiming to undermine Arafat's rule and
jeopardize the peace process by calling for attacks on Israeli
targets in response to acts by the Palestinian police.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense
Forces (UPDF) have since late July rescued over 30 people
abducted by the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) from
Kitgum and Gulu districts in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted an army source in the north

Kitgum district have been handed over to the local government
office concerned for clearance to be reunited with their families.
</P>
<P>
Most of the abductees are young children who were abducted by
the rebels on their way to school, said the report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Background: International Geological Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Geological
Congress (IGC) is a time-honored, massive and multi-subject
academic organ and a grand high-level gathering of geologists the
world over.
</P>
<P>
The first International Geological Congress was held in Paris
in 1878 and later convened in every three or four years except
longer intervals during the first and second World Wars. A total
of 29 meetings were held in the years ending 1992.
</P>
<P>
China applied as IGC host since 1984 and had its wish fulfilled
for holding the 30th congress in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the IGC is to promote the research and development
of basic and applied geological issues and provide an opportunity
for the academic, scientific and information exchanges and a
chance for field study.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 topics were raised for discussion in each of the
past 29 sessions, reflecting new research results through holding
300 seminars, lectures, films, exhibitions and field surveys.
</P>
<P>
The International Union of Geological Science and its
subordinate organizations as well as other world geological bodies
also held their own meetings during the IGC.
</P>
<P>
The 30th IGC, to be opened in Beijing later today, is the last
session in this century. It will reflect the most brilliant
achievements of the 20th century and study new challenges and
opportunities, laying a solid foundation for the geological
development in the 21th century.

<HEADLINE> India To Host International Meeting on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- India will host an
international meeting on water and sanitation from September 9 to
13 as part of its efforts to improve water supply and sanitation
in the country, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting, the theme of which is "reaching
the unreached challenges for the 21st century," will discuss such
issues as water supply, low-cost sanitation, collection and
treatment of waste water, ground water development and solid waste
management in low income and middle income countries.
</P>
<P>
India has the highest coverage for water supply in South Asia,
but because of its huge population, the absolute number of
unserved people is so large that the rural areas alone account for
60 percent of the unserved population of the region, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sanitation, 78 percent of the unserved population
of South Asia is in rural India.
</P>
<P>
India's unserved population for water supply accounts for 13
percent of the global total and it represents an enormous 43
percent of the global unserved population for sanitation. In
India, those who have the least access to safe water supply are
those living in urban slums or in remote rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 foreign delegates are expected to attend the coming
meeting. Previous meetings have been held in Africa and Asia every
year and they have brought together specialists from all parts of
the world to share their experiences in water and sanitation, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Individual Income Tax Up in first Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Individual income tax revenue in
the first half of this year soared 57.1 percent to hit 8.66
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Based on that growth rate, an official from the State
Administration of Taxation predicted this year's yield will
surpass 18 billion yuan, raising the ratio of individual income
tax revenue among industrial and commercial tax levies to about
2.9 percent from the previous year's 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top eight payers of private income tax are Guangdong
Province, Beijing and Shanghai municipalities, and Liaoning,
Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Officials ascribed the noticeable growth to intensified
taxation management.
</P>
<P>
Despite the big increase, officials noted that serious tax
evasion is still a hurdle and urged greater efforts to eliminate
tax evaders and increase the State's revenue.
</P>
<P>
The most high-income earners have a weak sense of individual
income tax and their income is difficult for taxation institutions
to check, said an Official.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Judge Upholds Arrest Warrant for Priebke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Rome appeals court on Saturday
approved an arrest warrant for former Nazi officer Erich Priebke,
as Germany is working to have him extradited for trial there.
</P>
<P>
Appeals Court Judge Tommaso Figliuzzi, after a three-hour
session, upheld that Priebke should remain behind bars.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, accused of taking part in the massacre of 335 Italian
civilians in 1944 in Rome, was returned to jail early on Friday on
a temporary detention order, shortly after he was declared free by
a military court verdict.
</P>
<P>
The military court cited mitigating circumstances and a 30-year
statute of limitations to rule on Thursday that while Priebke was
guilty of multiple murder he could no longer be punished.
</P>
<P>
The verdict touched off an explosion of wrath immediately
throughout Italy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany announced that it will seek for Priebke's
extradition for trial there, which gave Italy a reason to keep
Priebke from going free.
</P>
<P>
The former SS captain was being jailed in Rome's Regina Coeli
prison, the very jail that held some of the civilians he massacred
more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Priebke will be questioned on Tuesday, the Italian news agency
AGI reported, describing the step as a formality connected to the
new arrest.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-eight rebels of the
suicide brigade of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) have
surrendered to the Uganda People's Defense Force (UPDF) at
Koboko, northwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said other rebels of the WNBF
have allegedly accepted to return to settle in their homeland
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Presidential advisor on military affairs in the north Major
General Salim Saleh was quoted as saying that the rebels were
surrendering in "good faith".
</P>
<P>
He said, "we are going to see that they are resettled very
quickly."
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted commander of the rebel suicide brigade
Saidi Ile as accusing WNBF commander Jama Oris of using them as
mercenaries to fight for the Sudanese army.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we come to raid in Uganda, it is usually on the
orders of the Sudanese army," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Jama Oris is no longer a commander but only acting as a
middleman in the deal which we have never benefited from," Ile
said.
</P>
<P>
All the 78 rebels except three returned with arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The three claimed that their rifles were forcefully moved by
some Zairean soldiers from Nyangirya border post.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan government is to
extend minimum export prices for textile products for another four
months, starting August 1.
</P>
<P>
The measure is aimed at protecting the local textile industry.
But while the Textile Industries Association (AIT) has criticized
the extension for being too short, the Chamber of Stores and
Chamber of Apparel have opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations carried out a technical study questioning
the validity of present levels of protection in the textile
sector, the El Ovservador newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
AIT is lobbying for a new protection system for the local
textile industry based on quotas. It also wants more realistic
prices for textiles and wants other products, such as printed
designs, included in the system.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Stores and the Chamber of Apparel opposed the
the extension of the prices. They have presented a technical study
questioning the validity of the present levels of protection in
the textile sector.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Domestic Debt Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's domestic debt has
risen to 860 billion rupees (about 25 billion US dollars) in the
1995-96 fiscal year, or 40 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), official figures show.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures issued by the federal bureau of
statistics, the domestic debt in the last fiscal year increased by
75 billion rupees (2.2 billion dollars) as compared with the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steep rise in Pakistan's domestic debt since
the early 1980s. The debt ratio in GDP has risen from 20 percent
in 1980-81 to 40 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the interest on domestic debt as part of debt
servicing payments also rose during the period, increasing from
3.3 percent of GDP in 1987-88 to 4.4 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The adverse impact of the domestic debt on Pakistan's economy
can be seen from the fact that 56.3 percent of the budgetary
deficit of 108.5 billion rupees (3.1 billion dollars) in 1995-96
alone was financed through domestic non-bank borrowing.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate has ratified
Panamanian Alberto Aleman Zubieta as the new administrator of the
Panama Canal Commission which operates the canal.
</P>
<P>
He will take office on August 18.
</P>
<P>
Aleman Zubieta, an engineer and entrepreneur, is taking over
from Gilberto Gaurdia F., the first Panamanian to occupy the
commission's highest post. He announced last October that he would
resign.
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports have linked Aleman Zubieta, chief
executive of one of Panama's largest construction companies, with
tax evasion, but his appointment was supported by the board of the
Canal Commission, the U.S. government agency running the canal's
operations.
</P>
<P>
Before his appointment, Aleman Zubieta was in charge of a
special panel carrying out an audit of the infrastructure of the
canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
</P>
<P>
Under a treaty signed in 1977 by Panama and the United States,
the commission is a U.S. federal government agency, so the
appointment of its executives and high-ranking officials must be
ratified by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be replaced by a Panamanian institution,
the Panama Canal Authority, in December 31, 1999 when the canal
reverts to Panama.

rebounds in his 26 minutes play, followed by Reggie Miller with
20.

and won the gold medal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavian coach Zelimir Obradovic said:"We came out to show
everybody that Yugoslavia can play great basketball and the entire
world was able to see it." "The Americans played a great game.
This was a very big game for Yugoslavia," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lang Ping, Lone Woman Head Coach in Olympic Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Being a surprise to all, the
Chinese women spikers leapt forward from the bottom of the world's
top eight to take the Olympic silver medal after a hiatus of only
two years.
</P>
<P>
At the Omni Stadium Saturday afternoon, the Chinese witnessed
their national colors to be hoisted, an encouring contrast to the
eighth finish at the world championship two years ago.
</P>
<P>
And more fans may well be shocked that the lost finalists have
been coached by Lang Ping, the only women coach in the Olympic
volleyball tournament.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, once known as "hammer" for her kills, had helped the
Chinese team to win five consecutive world titles in the World
Cup, the Olympics and the world championship from 1981-86.
</P>
<P>
"She is very experienced and more sensitive towards the players
than men coaches," said South Korean coach Kim Cheol-Yong.
</P>
<P>
However, the reason for the Chinese team's renaisance within
two years surely was not due to the feminie gender of the coach.
</P>
<P>
"The most important factors are our fighting spirits, our
solidarity and unity," said Lang Ping after her team won the
silver.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping took the helm of the Chinese national squad in
February, 1995 by interrupting her studies in the United States.
"This is an honor for me to lead this team and I am pappy to be
the coach," Lang said.
</P>
<P>
"Twelve years ago I was a team member, and now I becomes head
coach. That has been a challenge for me.
</P>
<P>
"Without the support of my compatriots, I would not become a
world class player," she said. "Under the recall of my motherland,
I should do my best."
</P>
<P>
From the moment she took over the post, Lang recruited four
Olympic veterans and picked up Li Yan as ace spiker and He Qi as
setter for the new squad.
</P>
<P>
One year later, China surged ahead to become the Asian champion
and finished third at the World Cup last year in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"For the Atalanta Olympic Games, we had a three-sponged project
-- to qualify for the Olympics, to surge into the last four, and
to vie for the medal," said Lang.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Blackout in West Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Peninsula Malaysia was
blacked out last night by a major power failure, crippling the
whole West Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The major power breakdown, starting at about 5:30 pm (0930 GMT)
yesterday, was caused by a line fault of the major Paka power
station on the East Coast of West Malaysia and lasted till
midnight in most parts of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
It was reported today that some parts of the peninsula are
still without electricity. Sources at the Malaysian National
Energy Corporation said the full power supply could be restored by
5:00 pm (0900 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The blackout caused chaos on the roads with massive traffic
jams in the city due to non-functioning traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said today that the city's electric
commuter trains came to a standstill as a result of the power
failure, air passengers were affected with the shut-down of
check-in systems at the Kuala Lumpur international airport and
thousands of weekend shoppers and commuters were stranded because
they were unable to get buses and taxis.
</P>
<P>
The economic loss caused by the blackout has yet to be
estimated.
</P>
<P>
This was the second major power breakdown in Malaysia in as
many years. The first major blackout occurred in September 1992
and was caused by a lightning strike to a grid comprising four
power lines, putting some 15 power stations in the country out of
action.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- World champion Canada beat the
United States to win the men's 4x100-meter relay gold medal here
today in the Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
Paced by newly crowned Olympic 100 meters champion Donova
Bailey, the Canadians clocked 37.69 seconds, the fastest time in
the season.
</P>
<P>
The United States finished second in 38.05 ahead of Brazil's
38.41.
</P>
<P>
After beating the American quartet, Bailey said that the
Canadian team deserved the victory.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who set the world 100m record of 9.84 seconds on his
way for the gold medal, said: "Everybody expected that I would be
on the ropes in the 100 meters, but I beat all them."
</P>
<P>
"Now the U.S. relay team were on their turf and concerned so
much with whether or not Carl Lewis would be in their team that
they had forgot other teams were running too."
</P>
<P>
Michael Marsh, who ran the third leg for the American team,
said: "For so long, Americans have been used to getting the gold
in the relay. But these are years of transition. Nobody has
noticed how the winning margins have been getting smaller and
smaller."

<HEADLINE> Six Towns Flooded as Megadike Collapses in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Rampaging waters burst a 50-meter
portion of the megadike between San Fernando and Bacolor towns in
Pampanga province Saturday afternoon, spilling tons of water into
six towns and sending thousands of residents into panic.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Disaster Coordinating Council (RDCC) said the
floodwaters immediately rose to alarming heights in Bacolor. In a
nearby town, floodwaters rose to neck-high, but no death and
injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The RDCC said the dam gave way probably to the
5.8-Richter-Scale earthquake last Wednesday and the crack caused
by the tremor was worsened by the strong floods from Mountain
Pinatubo.
</P>
<P>
The RDCC and engineers from the Department of Public Works and
Highways seemed helpless to plug the gap, prompting local
officials from the six towns to advise the endangered residents to
get ready for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The RDCC has deployed army trucks and motor boats between the
boundaries of San Fernando and Bacolor for rescue operations.

TOKYO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 people were taken to
hospital with sore eyes and throats after inhaling fumes at a
cinema in central Tokyo, police said.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people were evacuated from the cinema in the
Shibuya area of the capital after fumes appeared near the toilet,
a fire department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the movie-goers were sneezing and coughing but none had
serious symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters quoted one of the sufferers as saying that he felt
a prickling pain in his eyes and nose. But they said there was no
lingering odor in the cinema.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo residents fear any mystery fumes after a sarin nerve gas
attack on the Tokyo subway system in March last year killed 12 and
injured upwards of 5,000 commuters. An unnamed gas released at a
Yokohama railway station injured 51 people a month later.
</P>
<P>
Most of the sufferers of the Yokohama incident complained of

<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- International Amateur Boxing
Association president Anwar Chowdhry said his association is
studying plans to have women boxers in the Olympics by the year
2004.
</P>
<P>
"Women could save the sport," said Chowdhry here on Saturday.
He said at the world championships last year, only several
hundreds of people turned out to see the men's amateur boxing
competition.
</P>
<P>
"Boxing is dying and women will bring back the crowds," added
Chowdhry.
</P>
<P>
He said a special AIBA woman's commission has been set up to
study the plan and will be meeting in Denmark next year.
</P>
<P>
The AIBA president accepts that not every country will accept
women boxers but he says there will be enough to help revitalise
interest in the sport.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why women cannot box. They have the right
to equal opportunity and if they want to box why not? And AIBA
will make sure it is organised properly," said Chowdhry.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Noureddine Morceli won the first
athletics gold medal for Algeria in the men's 1,500 meters here
today at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian, world record holder and world champion, clocked
three minutes 35.78 seconds, ahead of Fermin Cacho of Spain in
3:36.40, and Stephen Kipkorir of Kenya, 3:36.72.
</P>
<P>
Morceli stormed to front two laps to go, chased by Cacho,
Olympic defending champion. Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who
followed Morceli closely, fell on the ground at abut 500 meters
from the finish. The accident almost effected Morceli, and Cacho
had to jump over Guerrouj at the time.
</P>
<P>
Morceli met no challenge in the final lap and cruised home with
meters to spare.
</P>
<P>
After winning the men's 1,500 meters gold medal, he said he was
the happiest man in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
With his right foot blooded over the shoe level, Morceli said:
"Frankly speaking, my first concern was the extend of my injury,
now my doctor confirmed that it isn't a serious one."
</P>
<P>
The world record holder in the men's mile, 1,500 meters, 2,000
meters and 3,000 meters, was very satisfied with his performance.
He said: "I am the happiest man in Atlanta. I achieved my goal,
surprisingly much easier than I had thought before the race."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to dedicate my victory to my country and to my
people," Morceli said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had got more offers to run 5,000 meters in the rest
of the season, "but as so far I have not yet decided but for sure
I will be in Zurich at either the mile or 1,500 meters."

ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- World champion Canada beat the
United States to win the men's 4x100-meter relay gold medal here
Saturday in the Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
Its winning time was 37.69 seconds, the fastest this season and
the sixth best all time.
</P>
<P>
The United States finished second in 38.05 ahead of Brazil's
38.41.
</P>
<P>
Without Carl Lewis, the American team looked less impressive
than the Canada's squad which contained world runner-up Bruny
Surin and Donovan Bailey, the newly Olympic champion who set a
9.84-second world record last week.
</P>
<P>
Jon Drummond failed to give the Americans an early lead and nor
did Tim Harden in the second leg. That doomed the Olympic champion
team's fate.
</P>
<P>
As expected, Surin ran a superb third leg to burst to front.
Bailey exploded with faster speed, never looking back to clock the
fastest time this year.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United States
defeated Sergi Bruguera of Spain and steamy heat to win the men's
singles tennis title of the 26th Olympic Games here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The first seeded American, the only seeded player to reach the
men's singles semi-final, downed the Spaniard 6-2, 6-3 and 6-1.

title in the ATP tour so far in 1996.
</P>
<P>

form in the tennis court, met little resistance from the Spaniard,
who is 69th in the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
After leading the first set at 4-1, Agassi, seventh-ranked,
took a good control of the sixth game, and made Bruguera running
along the base line with strong ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
Leading the game at 30-0, Agassi, who is in his third final
this year, improved the game score at 5-1 with two aces.
</P>

Wimbledon tennis tournament in 1993 and 94, trailed the score at
5-2 before Agassi took the first set with 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera had a slim chance to equalize the score in the second
set after he levelled the game at 2-2. However, the Spainard, who
was sweatering all around in the match, did not continue his pace,
which gave Agassi the opportunity to seal the second set at 6-3.

The third set was a lopsided affair when Agassi used
stroke-charge tactics to take the match at 6-1.

Olympic tennis singles gold medal since Vicent Richards at the
1924 Paris Olympics.

a life time experience."

gold is something you'll never forget," he added.

<HEADLINE> Perry's Hint of Truck Bombers Denounced by Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry has indicated that Iran was possibly behind the June 25
Dhahran truck bombing, but was repudiated on Saturday by Iran as
"prejudicial and irresponsible".
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Friday with National Public Radio, Perry
said Saudi Arabia was close to announcing the findings of
investigation into the explosion that killed 19 American soldiers,
and the sophistication of the blast indicated "an international
terrorist connection".
</P>
<P>
When asked whether it was referring to Iran, Perry said:
"Possibly... We know that Iran is very active in international
terrorism, some of it directed against the United States."
</P>
<P>
He called Iran "the leading candidate" among countries that
would commit the terrorist strike against the United States.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Perry's comment, Iran's news agency TRNA said:
"The prejudicial and irresponsible nature of these charges and
defamatory statements against Iran is crystal clear."
</P>
<P>
Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced his remarks as
"a crude political exploitation", adding: "Iran's strength lies
not in training any terrorist in Iran or supporting international
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Perry said the United States would take "strong action" against
those involved in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"If we have compelling evidence of international sponsorship of
that bombing, we will take strong action," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on what action could be taken, only
saying that the issue was "discussed in general terms" with his
counterparts from Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
He was reported as saying that U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia are
on the highest possible threat alert, with instructions to prepare
as though another terror attack against them was imminent.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Outwit Argentina to Win Olympic Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria outwitted Argentina by
beating an off-side trap for a 3-2 victory in the men's soccer
final at the Olympic Games Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
After scoring two equlisers in the first 80 minutes, the
Nigerian eleven still maintained their stamina and Emmanuel
Amunike beat an off-side trap from a free kick off Victor Ikpeba
for the winner before entering the injury time.
</P>
<P>
Despite their glory moments for the World Cup, the Argentines
still have to prove themselves in the Olympic games wherein the
South American country has only qualified for two of the last nine
Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, champions of the 1995 Pan American Games, was put
ahead by Claudio Lopez with his header in the third minute when he
was caught off-guarded from a left-wing center.
</P>
<P>
With 25 minutes into the game at Sanford Stadium, Georgia, a
Nigerian fast shot bounded off the right post before Argentine
defender rushed to clear off.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Celestine Babayaro swang in his header
between two defenders for the equaliser, his second goal in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, Argentina was awarded a penalty kick five minutes
after the break when forward Ariel Ortega was fouled by Nigerian
defender Taribo West.
</P>
<P>
Then came in Hernan Crespo who scored his six goal in the
Olympic tournament by converting the penalty with ease.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was not intimidated by the South American footers and
fired home the second equaliser through Daniel Amokachi who tabbed
in a pass through two defenders which lobbed over goalie Pablo
Cavallero and netted the far corner.
</P>
<P>
During the injury time, a long-range shot from Nigeria was
barred off the left post by Cavallero.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Brazil outscored Portugal with five goals against
nil to get the bronze medal in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic Says Bosnian Serb Entity Must Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic said today the Serb entity must go on existing
after the September elections in Bosnia and the country must be
prevented from becoming a unitary state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to representatives of parties which will run in the
upcoming elections at a meeting in northwestern Serb city Banja
Luka, Plavsic said the elections should be held in a democratic
and civilized atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
It was necessary to secure conditions for all parties to
present their programs and candidates in the manner they wished,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, convened by Plavsic, was attended by
representatives of 16 parties. The ruling Muslim Democratic Action
Party (SDA) was the only party which did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The acting Serb president said the seven Serb tickets for the
house of representatives of the Bosnian parliament threatened to
undermine the unity of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"It is absurd to have the Croatian Democratic Union and the SDA
participate in the elections in Republika Srpska, but provisions
of the Dayton agreement must be respected and there will be no
backing out," Plavsic said.

</P>
<P>
The third set was a thriller with the two teams tying the
score at 8-8, 10-10, 14-14, 15-15, 16-16. A unanswered spike by
Cubans enabled them to took the set 17-16.

ATLANTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United States
defeated Sergi Bruguera of Spain and steamy heat to win the men's
singles tennis title here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The first seeded American, the only seeded player to reach the
men's singles semi-final, downed the Spaniard 6-2, 6-3 and 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The victory is his best tournament showing since winning his
32nd career singles title earlier this year at Key Biscayne, the
only title in the ATP tour so far in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the final match for the gold, Agassi, who is recovering his
form on the tennis court, met little resistance from the Spaniard,
who is 69th in the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
After leading the first set at 4-1, Agassi, seventh-ranked,
took a good control of the sixth game, and made Bruguera running
along the base line with strong ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
Leading the game at 30-0, Agassi, who is in his third final
this year, improved the game score at 5-1 with two aces.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of service game, Bruguera, who won the
Wimbledon tennis tournament in 1993 and 94, trailed the score at
5-2 before Agassi took the first set with 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera had a slim chance to equalize the score in the second
set after he levelled the game at 2-2. However, the Spainard, who
was sweatering all around in the match, didn't continue his pace,
which gave Agassi opportunities to seal the second set at 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The third set was a lopsided affair when Agassi used
stroke-charge tactics to take the match 6-1.
</P>
<P>
In the play-off for the bronze medal, Leander Paes of India
came from behind to beat Fernando Meligeni of Brazil 3-6, 6-2,
6-4.
