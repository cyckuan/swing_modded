<HEADLINE> 5 Palestinians Killed in Clashes with Israeli Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Five Palestinians were killed and about
800 others injured during violent clashes with Israeli forces in
the West Bank on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure of Palestinians who have killed since last Monday
rose to six and that of the injured exceeded 1,000, the Palestinian
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said a Palestinian policeman was killed in a shoot-
out with Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Ramallah while two
Palestinian teenagers were shot dead by the Israeli soldiers in
Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 Palestinians were wounded when Israeli forces fired
rubber bullets and tear-gas to stop the massive demonstrations
across the West Bank cities and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Monday's demonstrations marked the day of the Nakba, or
catastrophe, the anniversary of the creation of Israel 52 years
ago. Among the wounded are six Palestinian policemen who
exchanged fire with Israeli forces and injured two officers in
Jenin, north the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of injured showed 350 in Ramallah, 70 in Tolkarm, 80
in Bethlehem, 45 in Jenin, and 40 in Gaza, according to Palestinian
medical sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Jewish settler who was driving a car in Qalqilya
run down two Palestinian children, aged eight and six respectively.
The two brothers were killed on the spot and Israeli police have
started an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Since last Monday, the Palestinians have been staging large-
scale demonstrations in solidarity with the detainees in Israeli
jails. Some of the detainees staged a hunger strike to demand their
release.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday some 750 Palestinian detainees clashed with Israeli
forces and about 100 of them were injured.

<HEADLINE> More Refugees Expected to Enter Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's refugee population
could double within the next 12 months as more Angolans fled civil
war and crossed in neighboring countries, South African Press
Association reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, which shares its northern border with Angola, already
shelters 11,000 refugees, most of whom are Angolans.
</P>
<P>
Addressing media on Monday at Namibia's largest refugee camp,
200 kilometers north of the capital Windhoek, Deputy Permanent
Secretary of Namibian Home Affairs Department Isak Goagaseb said
at least 4,000 more refugees will seek refuge in his country by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The stream is expected to continue thereafter, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department's top refugee official Julia Taft on
Monday has handed over some 780 tons of maize, cooking oil and
dried fish to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees officials in
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The food aid is expected to cover all current food requirements
for Namibia's refugee population.
</P>
<P>
However, Taft warned that Angola's estimated 1.3 million
internally displaced people are still facing severe deprivation
with as many as 300, 000 people in urgent need of food aid.

LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians have been urged to
encourage the inflows of the foreign investment and to reject the
thought of likening the current privatization exercise by the
government to neo-colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Director-general of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Ndi
Okereke- Onyiuke told a seminar here Monday that such thinking was
a distraction from the government's investment efforts.
</P>
<P>
She said the participation of foreign investors in the on-going
 privatization exercise did not amount to neo-colonialism, but was
an opportunity to inject new funds and high technology into the
management of ailing state-owned companies.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African Medical
Association (SAMA) warned on Monday that it did not condone
corrupt medical practices, but said the majority of South African
doctors are ethical.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of the medical profession and service
providers are proud ethical practitioners who are committed to
uplifting the standards of our health care system in both the
public and private sectors," SAMA chief executive Percy Mahlati
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on media reports that doctors usually are
paid millions in kickbacks each year.
</P>
<P>
Mahlati said no one could compel another to participate in acts
of corruption unless they were susceptible to it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was the responsibility of the medical
profession, patients, health care funding organizations, the
government, service providers and the media to keep the industry
clean.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Minister Sees No Need for Oil Output Increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Petroleum and
Mineral Resources Ali Al-N'aimi said Tuesday that he saw no need to
hold discussions on a fresh hike of oil production of Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
"The current state of the international oil markets does not
justify any discussions on a production hike at the next OPEC
ministerial meeting due on June 21," Al-N'aimi said after an
environmental conference that started in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh Tuesday, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-N'aimi said he had agreed at a recent meeting with his
Mexican and Venezuelan counterparts, Luis Tellez and Ali Rodriguez
Araque, that there is no need for a fresh production increase.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after their meeting in Mexico last
Wednesday, the three ministers expressed the belief that there is
no need for a new decision to raise oil output, but they agreed to
follow the market conditions and to act whenever needed.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers agreed in their last meeting in Vienna in
March to increase output by about 1.7 million barrels per day to
bring down world oil prices, soaring at a nine-year high of over 30
U.S. dollars per barrel in late February and early March.
</P>
<P>
If adherence to production quotas proved satisfactory, crude
prices are expected to remain within the 22-28 U.S. dollar price
band OPEC set as an ideal range.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil producer and exporter.
Its minister said that OPEC compliance with the March agreement is
85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Gets Big Loan for Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Tuesday obtained a loan of
35 million Kuwaiti dinars (115 million U.S. dollars) to build a dam
near the Yarmouk River to alleviate its acute water shortage in
summer.
</P>
<P>
The big loan was extended by the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development (AFESD). An acquisition agreement
was signed here by Jordanian Minister of Planning Talib Rifai and
visiting AFESD Director Abdul Hamad.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Jordan will repay the loan within 16 years
with a six year grace period and yearly interests of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The loan would be channelled into the Wadi (Unification) Dam
near the Yarmouk river close to the Jordanian-Syrian border to be
inaugurated by September this year.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will cost 210 million dollars. The rest of the
financing will be patched up by government financial appropriations
and loans from commercial banks based in the desert kingdom,
Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The dam will give shape to a reservoir with a designed capacity
of 2.25 million cubic meters. The reservoir will be used to impound
flood waters from the river during rainy seasons in winter for
consumption in summer.
</P>
<P>
A typical Mediterranean climate makes the northern and western
parts of the kingdom hot and dry in summer, mild and rainy in
winter.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Calls for Combating Oil Discharges in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Saudi official on
Tuesday called on Gulf countries to join hands in working out a
solution to illegal oil discharges in the Gulf waters by oil
tankers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of an environmental conference in
the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Minister of Petroleum and Minister
Resources Ali Al-N'aimi said that protecting the environment is an
international concern and requires cooperation from national,
regional and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
He proposed closer cooperation between Saudi Arabia's Regional
Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment (EOPME)
and the Gulf Arab nations, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Al-N'aimi said Saudi Arabia was keen to protect environmental
safety of the Gulf and Red Sea, especially from the dangers of
illegal waste discharges.
</P>
<P>
He said the Saudi petroleum industry has contributed to shield
the marine environment in the Gulf and Red Sea through safety
measures, early warning systems against possible leakage and
advanced methods to control and contain any pollution.
</P>
<P>
Oil discharges have been on the increase, posing a serious
threat to Gulf ecology and environment.

<HEADLINE> South-South Cooperation, An Innovative Approach to Meeting Health and Development Challenges of Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation among developing
countries for exchange of successful experiences on reproductive
health and population is cost-effective, attuned to cultural and
social conditions, Anwarul Chowdhury, the permanent representative
of Bangladesh to the United Nations, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South-South cooperation is producing positive results,
Chowdhury said. He made the statement at the launching of a new
book, entitled "South to South: Developing Countries Working
Together on Population and Development."
</P>
<P>
The South-South approach to sharing expertise in capacity
building, research and information is becoming increasingly
accepted, he said. However, donors and policy-makers have had
little access to concrete information about the issues and
opportunities it presents.
</P>
<P>
"This book is the first to really provide our community with
practical information on key elements of South-to-South
cooperation," Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
The concept of South-to-South collaboration is deceptively
simple: share and extend ideas that have worked so that more
people benefit.

Over the past 20 years, several developing countries have made
significant progress in providing family planning and reproductive
health services. Through a combination of political commitment,
financial and human capital, countries as diverse as Bangladesh,
Mexico, Tunisia and Kenya have successfully addressed complex
health and population challenges through these programs.
</P>
<P>
Today, increasing numbers of men and women in these countries
have what they need to make informed choices about their health
and families and are able to avail of the services needed.
</P>
<P>
Many of the case studies in the book are drawn from the
experiences of the countries from the Partners in Population and
Development, which represents an alliance of developing countries
established specifically to realize the concepts of South-South
collaboration elaborated in the Cairo Program of Action, endorsed
by more than 180 nations at the 1994 United Nations International
Conference on Population and Development (ICPD).

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Meet Creditors for Brady Debt Renegotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the case of the Brady debt, Ecaudor's government intends for
a change of new bonds for former ones, with a discount in the
debt's volume and respite in cash desk flow.
</P>
<P>
Ecaudor's total external debt reached 16 billion U.S. dollars,
of which 5.9 billion correspond to Brady bonds and 500 million to
eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
For Ecuador, it could obtain some percentage in debt reduction,
but if interests go up, the flux isn't repaired. Therefore, for
Ecuador, what's important is to pay less for debt interests, or
reduce ash box flow.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Searches for Brady Debt Renegotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- An Ecuadorian governmental delegation
will meet Tuesday in New York with 2,500 creditors in order to
renegotiate external debt in Brady bonds and eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Brady debt, Ecaudor's government means for a
change of roles, that is, new bonds for former ones, with a
discount in the debt's volume and respite in cash desk flow.
</P>
<P>
The total of Ecaudor's external debt comes to 16 billion
dollars, of which 5.9 billion correspond to Brady bonds and 500
million to eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
For Ecuador, it could obtain some percentage in debt reduction,
but if interests go up, the flux isn't repaired. Therefore, for
Ecuador what's important is to pay less for debt interests, that's
to say, reduce cash box flow.
</P>
<P>
For ex-Finance Minister, Cesar Robalino, the achieving of a
reasonable discount for Ecuador is important, as the rate between
external debt and the country's Gross Domestic Product is of 137
percent.
</P>
<P>
He considered the government can take advantage of the low
income per head Ecuadorians get (915 dollars) in order to
sensitize creditors and have them accept Ecuador's proposal.

<P>
MEXICO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dominican Republic's
presidential elections ran smoothly Tuesday with a great
participation as it is shown by the long queues in the 11,000
election booths around the country.
</P>
<P>
A comunique originated in the Caribbean country and released in
Mexico City says that in many locations in the country, the
presence of the elections police force has not been needed. The
booths were set up in public schools.
</P>
<P>
This happens because many people, despite being in a week day,
took their time to cast their ballots and to start this way a
series of changes the country requires.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in some sites at the capital, the judges of the
electoral colleges made a call on the Central Electoral Assembly (
CEA) to send a group of police for possible hot spots at the helm
of the process.
</P>
<P>
Also, news releases from many Dominican radio stations
underscore the order prevailing in the northern part of Santiago
de Caballeros, some 166 kilometer far from the capital, where
women go in great numbers to cast their ballots, and no adverse
incident has been registered.
</P>
<P>
Finally, many radio programs' conductors made a call on the
audience to participate in this process and not to get around this
important civic action.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Opens New Office in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations delegation arrived
here Tuesday to formally open the U.N. Office in Angola (UNOA),
the new U.N. mission in the war-torn southwest African country, an
official with the government's news department told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The delegation headed by Ibrahim Gambari, under secretary-
general of the U.N. for Political Affairs, came to Angola at the
invitation of the Angolan government, which refused in March 1999
to prolong the mandate of the former U.N. Observer Mission in
Angola (MONUA).
</P>
<P>
During a five-day visit to Angola, the U.N. officials will have
talks with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Foreign
Minister Joao Miranda.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement between the U.N. and the Angolan
government, UNOA is made up of 30 U.N. officers, who will help the
Angolan government coordinate humanitarian aid programs, reinforce
the institutional capacity within the framework of human rights,
assess the country's current political situation.
</P>
<P>
UNOA was created in October 1999, six months after the
1,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission was withdrawn from the
country in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Gambari will also meet with Speaker of the Angolan National
Assembly Roberto de Almeida, Defense Minister Kundi Payhama, other
government officials, members of parliament and representatives of
non-governmental organizations operating in Angola.

BAGHDAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A number of cultural relics have
been unearthed in the Al-Hurreia region near the Samara city, about
120 kilometers north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, a report said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The excavation included pottery, gold coins, ancient maps and
saddles, the report quoted a source at the Directorate General
Antiquities subordinate to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and
Information as saying.
</P>
<P>
The relics also included ruins of the Abbaside era more than 800
years ago, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, a country with long-standing ancient civilization, often
reports archaeological discoveries.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, an Iraqi archaeological team found a number of
ancient graves at Al-Musaihley village in the northern Neiveva
province.
</P>
<P>
However, the decade-long United Nations sanctions, in place
since 1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, have taken a toll
on Iraq's archaeology. Severe shortages of fund and rampant
smuggling of relics have plagued the country for years since.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Biggest Mutual Investment Fund Faces Massive Cash Redemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The local branches of Romania's
biggest mutual fund - the FNI National Investment Fund - have been
virtually assailed in the past week by the shareholders, who
demand a redemption of their stocks.
</P>
<P>
The Bucharest-based newspapers said that the panic was prompted
by a rumor that spread rapidly among the shareholders, who rushed
to stand in a queue to withdraw their money from the FNI, despite
being aware that this was a mere rumor.
</P>
<P>
The FNI managers, in repeated interviews carried by the media
these days, assured the shareholders that the fund was able to
meet all the demands for the redemption of shares, by the deadline
stipulated in the agreement. The managers also appealed for calm,
insisting that there was no reason for panic as far as the fund
management was concerned.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, in cities across the country long queues were
formed by the FNI shareholders, who said they wanted to reverse
their decision of withdrawing the money; the move signals that
calm is returning into the market.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts, however, caution over the Romanian depositors'
vulnerability to rumors, underscoring that confidence in the
values of a democratic society should continue to be nurtured
carefully by the Romanian rulers.

PARIS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday called for the establishment of an international rule of
law over internet, which he said is faced with criminal activities
ranging from false credit card to pornography.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with officials attending a Group of Eight

that on the internet, both freedom of expression and the right to
security of persons and properties should be equally protected.
</P>
<P>
``The cyber-criminals are real criminals,'' he said, citing
false bank credit cards, the use of internet by mafias, pimps,
pedophilia criminals and terrorists and the spread of computer
virus to sabotage computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that national governments and parliaments should
adopt laws on cybersecurity while different countries should
harmonize their legislations in this field.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during its European Union rotating presidency
in the latter half this year, France will ask the European

<HEADLINE> Romania: Monetary Evolutions Favorable to Macro-Economic Stabilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Monetary evolutions during the
first four months of this year created favorable prerequisites for
the macro-economic stability in Romania, governor of the Romania's
Central Bank (BNR), Emil Iota Ghizari, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the interest on the inter-banking markets, during
March-April of this year were scoring a descending trend, after
they had been reaching high levels, the BNR chief said.
</P>
<P>
The descending tendency of the interests was due to the
increasing of the liquidities level on the market and the
deminishing of the expected inflation.
</P>
<P>
Although the inflation rate during the first four months of the
year was rather high, it does not much differ from the estimated
evolutions aimed at reaching a 27 percent level, this year, Iota
Ghizari added.

PARIS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday hailed a decision by

He also described the British decision to use Meteor missiles --
built by the Franco-British company Matra-BAe -- as one which will
reinforce the inter-operational capability of European combat
aircraft and a ``federal-style program for the missile industry''
of Europe.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Raises Key Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve on
Tuesday raised its federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other on overnight loans, by one-half percentage point,
the biggest increase in five years, in an effort to slow the red-
hot economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate was raised from 6 percent to 6.5 percent,
the highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
The Fed also raised its discount rate, the interest that the
Fed charges to make direct loans to banks, by half a percentage
point to 6 percent from 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door meeting, the Fed's Federal Open Market
Committee said in a statement that it "believes the risks are
weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened
inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the rapidly growing economy "could foster
inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
outstanding performance."
</P>
<P>
The Fed's half-point increase in the funds rate was expected to
be quickly followed by announcements from commercial banks that
they were boosting their prime lending rate by a similar half-
point, from the current 9 percent to 9.50 percent, the highest
level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
The prime rate is a key benchmark for millions of loans, from
home equity and credit card balances to short-term loans for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's decision marked the sixth time since last June that
the central bank has boosted the funds rate in an effort to slow
the speeding economy and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
Many economists had expected the bolder one-half point move,
believing that the central bank wanted to demonstrate that it was
prepared to move more aggressively to dampen an economy that is
still growing at an exceptionally rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
The booming economy, which grew at a sizzling rate of 5.4
percent in the first three months of 2000, has pushed the nation's
unemployment rate below 4 percent for the first time in 30 years.
Economists view such developments as signs that demand is having
trouble keeping up with supply, sowing the seeds of inflation.

<P>
BRUSSELS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A 16th body was found on Tuesday
from the Enschede debris left by a fireworks warehouse explosion
that also injured 629 people.
</P>
<P>
Teams of specialists expected to find more bodies as initial
estimate put the death toll at 20 at least. Of the injured, 39
still remain in hospitals while six under intensive cares.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok announced the set-up of an
investigation commission to probe into the cause of the
devastating explosion that took place late on Saturday afternoon
in eastern Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 bodies found so far only three were identified.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for after the
fireworks warehouse explosion. Town officials said on Tuesday
that the number of the unaccounted for appeared to be between 200
and 400 but that they could have been staying with relatives and
friends after the explosion ruined their homes.
</P>
<P>
The officials appealed to the unaccounted for people to
register with the town officials as soon as they could.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers worked through Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to try to
find more bodies and possible clues to the cause of the explosion..
</P>
<P>
Residents of Enschede saw late Saturday afternoon a small
explosion that set off a fire on the warehouse. The bursting of
hundreds of fireworks then triggered the second explosion that
caused the most destruction of the residential area around.
</P>
<P>
Four of the firemen fighting the fire were killed by the second
blast.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Publishes N.Irish Policing Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland Secretary will
make the final decision on the title of the province's new police
service, according to the Northern Ireland Police Bill published
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The issue of changing the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC) has been threatening the government's plans to restore
devolution to Northern Ireland by May 22.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) has made retaining
the RUC name a precondition to re-entering the suspended power-
sharing executive and he has been trying to gain assurances from
the government that it would not be changed.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Police Bill stated that until a final
decision is made on the name, it will be known as "the Police
Service".
</P>
<P>
But the force will continue to be known as the RUC until
September 2001.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bill's provision, delaying the final decision on
the new title, may not be enough to reassure unionists that a
return to devolved government would not spell the end of the RUC.
</P>
<P>
The government published the bill on reforming the Protestant-
dominated RUC just days before a key meeting of the pro-British
UUP that could make or break the latest peace effort.
</P>
<P>
The UUP will decide on Saturday whether to go back into the
home-rule government with Catholics. Insiders say there is a split
in the party, which voted in March for a motion tying any return
to government to keeping the RUC's name and symbols.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to UUP leader David Trimble, Mandelson said the
decision would be his but confirmed the service would no longer be
known as the RUC when the first recruits selected under the new
arrangements begin training in the Autumn of 2001.
</P>
<P>
An independent report published in 1999 by former Hong Kong
governor Chris Patten recommended the RUC be renamed the Police
Service of Northern Ireland and have its distinctive cap badge
changed in order to make it a force with cross-community support
and encourage Catholic recruits.
</P>
<P>
The bill stated that the force should make sure half its
appointments were Catholic.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Lifts Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government on Tuesday
 increased the prices of refined fuel for the third time this
year.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy
announced a hike of between 5.5 and 19.8 percent in the prices of
fuel, taking effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
The highest increase is for kerosene, which now costs 3,990
meticals a litre (at current exchange rates, 15,100 meticals to
one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
Diesel now costs 7,000 meticals a litre, an increase of 12
percent, while motorists will have to pay an extra 15.1 percent
for their petrol, which rises from 8,040 to 9,320 meticals a
litre.
</P>
<P>
The rise for jet fuel is 9.9 percent from 4,612 to 5,070
meticals a litre.
</P>
<P>
These prices are to be charged in and around the country's main
ports, where the fuels are imported. Elsewhere in the country,
suppliers are allowed to increase the prices to take account of
transport costs.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's statement, the new prices are a
consequence of price increases for petroleum products on the
international market, and the devaluation of the metical.
</P>
<P>
Since the last rise in fuel prices in mid March, the metical
has devalued by 8.7 percent against U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Britain Discuss S. Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar held talks with visiting British Chief of Defense Staff
General Charles Guthrie on the crisis in Sierra Leone Tuesday in
the capital Abuja, a source here said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said after the talks that Nigeria was ready to send
more troops to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the
war-torn west African country on conditions that the U.N. would
foot the bills.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie came to Nigeria, following his earlier visit to Sierra
Leone, for talks with the Nigerian government in a bid to boost
the troubled U.N. peace-keeping mission in Sierra Leone, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is widely believed to be a leading power nation in
maintaining the peace and stability in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-led-and-commanded West African intervention force,
known as ECOMOG, has played an important role in successfully
restoring Sierra Leone' s elected President Tejan Kabbah ousted by
the Revolutionary United Front led by Foday Sankoh in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG was replaced by the U.N. peacekeepers earlier this
year to undertake the responsibility of the peacekeeping mission
in Sierra Leone under the Lome Peace Accord signed by Kabbah and
Sankoh in Togo's capital Lome last year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria still has four battalions of troops serving in the U.N.
 peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Urges Israelis, Palestinians to Remain Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross resumed Tuesday his mediation in the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks, urging both sides to remain calm and move
the peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Ross held two hours of talks with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah earlier Tuesday and is
scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The leadership on both sides should take measures to bring the
situation back to normal as soon as possible and pool their efforts
to move the peace talks forward, Ross was quoted by Israel Radio as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ross resumed his mediation a day after the deadly gun battles in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip between the Palestinians and Israeli
troops, which brought the two sides to the brink of a full-scale
conflict.
</P>
<P>
At least four Palestinians were killed and some 320 Palestinians
and 15 Israeli soldiers were injured in the worst bloodshed between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinians took to the streets on Monday to mark
the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe used by Palestinians to
describe Israel's declaration of independence 52 years ago, which
had forced thousands of Palestinians to leave their home-land.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Palestinians continue their clashes with the
Israeli troops in various parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
but the clashes were much less intense than those on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to the region Monday evening from Stockholm,
Sweden, where he attended a secret Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Ross could call the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiators to sit together this time to continue their final-
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo has submitted his
resignation to Arafat due to the secret Stockholm talks which was
held without his knowledge and Arafat so far has not decided who
could lead the Palestinian delegation to the talks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Dismantles Outposts Along Lebanon Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers Tuesday
dismantled several outposts on the Lebanese side of the
international border between the two countries, an Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) statement confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there are reports that Israeli troops from six outposts
had loaded hundreds of military trucks with their personal
belongings, furniture, and generators and drove to their new
positions on the Israeli side of the border. However, the IDF
statement did not reveal the exact number of the outposts being
evacuated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the soldiers also began the operation to remove the
mines they had laid in some regions in the so-called security zone
in south Lebanon, according to the IDF sources.
</P>
<P>
These moves, local analysts believe, were another signal that
the IDF is stepping up its efforts to prepare for the planned
pullback from south Lebanon, which is due to be finished by July.
</P>
<P>
The pullback plan was approved by Israeli cabinet in March on
the basis of recommendations by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
who wants to end Israel's occupation in south Lebanon within his
term of office due to mounting Israeli casualties in the buffer
zone and growing international pressure.
</P>
<P>
To internationally legalize its withdrawal, Israel hopes to wrap
the redeployment into the mandate of United Nations Resolutions 425
and 426, which is the major topic of the talks between Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
in New York in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Under this framework, Israel should evacuate every outposts and
military strongpoints on the Lebanese soil and withdraw to the 1923
international border exactly.
</P>
<P>
The IDF launched preparations for the withdrawal, such as
pulling its heavy weapons out of the zone, long before Barak
announces the exact date of the redeployment, in order to be able
to carry out the pullback on short notice.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Israel troops had transferred several
outposts to the control of Israeli-backed proxy militia South
Lebanon Army, which itself had abandoned some outposts at the same
time.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Discussion on Swapping Properties Between Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou said Tuesday that the government rejects any discussion
on the exchange of properties between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities of the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Papapetrou said the
government has made it absolutely clear that it has no intention of
legalizing in any way the fait accompli the 1974 Turkish invasion
created.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou's remark came after calls by Turkey to implement a
policy of swapping properties between the Greek Cypriot refugees,
now living in the southern government-controlled area of the
island, and the Turkish Cypriot refugees residing in the northern
area.
</P>
<P>
The two communities have been living apart since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Since then the United Nations has been trying for decades to
bring the two communities back together in a bizonal, bicommunal
federation formula, but no significant achievements have been
scored so far.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two sides have held two rounds of U.N.-
sponsored indirect talks, in New York last December and in Geneva
in February, with an aim to prepare the ground for substantive
talks which may lead to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides have outlined their positions on
the four core issues the U.N. has identified, namely security,
constitution, property and territory. The next round of talks is
expected to start at the end of June in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the Cyprus government "does not intend to
legalize by any means the results of the Turkish invasion and
occupation."
</P>
<P>
"We shall go to the talks to discuss the substance of the
solution, the parameters of a settlement and the return of the
refugees," he said, adding "we are not going to talks to discuss
exchange of properties."

<HEADLINE> 6 Injured in U.S., British Air Strikes: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Monday's air strikes by U.S. and
British warplanes in northern and southern Iraq injured six people,
including one child, an Iraqi military spokesman announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the spokesman said that at 18:20 (1420 GMT) on Monday, eight
formations of U.S. and British planes made 16 sorties over the
northern provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil.
</P>
<P>
The war planes bombed civilian and service installations,
leading to the injury of two people, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 22:30 (1830 GMT) on the same day,
nine formations of U.S. and British jets made 26 armed sorties from
bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, bombing civilian targets in the
southern provinces and wounding four people, including a child.
</P>
<P>
Iraq air defenses opened fire on the planes, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that nearly 300 civilians have been killed and 860
others injured in U.S. and British air raids since December 1998,
when the U.S. and Britain launched the Operation Desert Fox air
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes have been enforcing the two no-fly zones
in northern and southern Iraq they imposed in the wake of the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq never recognizes the air exclusion zones and has challenged
the planes by targeting the U.S. and British aircraft with surface-
to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Joins Regional Power Grid Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Tuesday became the sixth
country to join a multi-million-dollar program for a regional
electric power grid in the Middle East, which already embraces
Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon`s entry was approved here at the end of a two-day
meeting attended by energy and electricity ministers and power
company officials from the five member countries as well as Lebanon
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed on Libya's participation in the
project after completing necessary legal and technical procedures.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting was Abdel Latif Hamad,
representative and director of the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development (AFESD), a major sponsor for the
program which had provided some 600 million dollars for the
regional power grid.
</P>
<P>
The regional power grid was initiated a decade ago to reduce
costs, increase efficiency, reliability and capability of the power
industries of member countries.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Jordanian Minister of Energy and
Mineral Resources Wael Sabri said the seven countries will soon
launch a technological-economic feasibility study on the
establishment of a "coordination control center" for the project.
</P>
<P>
Future plans of the project included enlarging the power grid to
link it with Europe through Turkey in the north and Morocco in the
west, he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only the power networks of Jordan and Egypt had been
actually integrated under the program.
</P>
<P>
Sabri said that Jordan and Syria were expected to soon finalize
the electrical links while work was expected to begin on a similar
project to connect Syria with Turkey.

UNITED NATIONS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A special meeting on
security and development in the Central African Republic (CAR)
Tuesday began at the U.N. Headquarters in New York to mobilize
donor assistance in support of the Government's program to
restructure the armed forces, and demobilize and reintegrate
retired military personnel in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deputy secretary-general, Louise Frechette, opened
the two-day meeting, co-sponsored by the United Nations and the
Permanent Mission of Germany. The prime minister of CAR, Anicet-
George Dologuele, led the government delegation.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the president of the U.N. Security Council,
Wang Yingfan of China, voiced a welcome to the upcoming meeting,
saying that the Council members "underlined the need to
consolidate the progress made in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Given that security-related programs must be anchored within
the Government's overall social and economic strategy, the meeting
will also focus on its most critical aspects, which also require
the attention and support of the international community, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is organized in close collaboration with
the Government of CAR, the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and the
Bretton Woods Institutions, will bring together interested Member
States, the Organization of the African Unity, the European
Commission, the International Organization of la Francophonie,
regional and international financial institutions, international
non-governmental organizations, as well as relevant U.N.
departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, Wang said that the Council
members welcomed the special meeting, Adding that "the members
wished to express their gratitude for the cosponsorship given by
the government of Germany, and welcomed the active participation
of UNDP, the institutions of Bretton Woods and other U.N. agencies
in the preparation of this meeting."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council stressed the importance of this
meeting to support the proposed reforms planned by CAR in the
fields of security and development," the statement said. "They
underlined the need to consolidate the progress made in the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Security Council has officially
ended the U.N. peacekeeping operations in CAR and established a
new support office to help the government consolidate peace.
</P>
<P>
Mutinous soldiers have staged three major rebellions since
1996 against President Ange-Felix Patasse, whose election in 1993
ended more than a decade of army rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, some 1,350 U.N. peacekeeping troops replaced French
soldiers helping to enforce a peace agreement between political
and ethnic opponents in the country.

<HEADLINE> France Deplores Death of Palestinians in West Bank Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- France expressed on Tuesday its deep
regret about the death of five Palestinians in the clashes with
Israeli forces in the West Bank on Monday, and appealed to the two
sides to exercise the greatest restraint.
</P>
<P>
``We deplore the death of several Palestinians in the West Bank
as well as hundreds of injured,'' said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
Five Palestinians were killed and 400 people injured in the
confrontation between Palestinian demonstrators, including
Palestinian police, and Israeli security forces on Monday, which
fell on the anniversary of the day of ``Naqba'' marking the
expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland following the
creation of the state of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also demonstrated to pressure the Israeli
authorities to release some 1,650 prisoners still remaining in
Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
As for the transfer by Israel of three villages near Jerusalem
to Palestinian rule, which also took place on Monday, the French
spokeswoman said that Israel has much more to do, especially
fulfilling the third phase of pullout from the Palestinian
territories as it promised to do in an agreement signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
``We welcome each progress in the peace process... but there
remains much to do, notably the third re-deployment of the Israeli
army and the talks concerning the final status of the Palestinian
territories,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Sergeyev: ABM in Asia-Pacific to Have Negative C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Tuesday that the deployment of an anti-ballistic
missile system in the Asia-Pacific would most negatively affect
the world situation.
</P>
<P>
"The decision the U.S. president plans to make this summer on
starting ABM deployment could prove to be a turning point in the
development of the military strategic situation in the Asian
Pacific and the whole world," Sergeyev said at the start of a
meeting here with his South Korean counterpart, Cho Song-Tae.
</P>
<P>
"If this happens, it will greatly influence stability around
the world and naturally in Northeastern Asia. The main conclusion
is that this will lead to a new spiral of the arms race," the
Interfax news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the results of Russian studies show that the
danger of so-called "rough states" effecting intercontinental
ballistic missile strikes against the U.S., which Washington
presents as an original reason for the deployment of a national
ABM system, "is not seen in reality."
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that the further development of relations with
Seoul is "a priority in Russian foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
"We approach the Republic of Korea as an influential and
responsible neighboring power and our partner in the Asian Pacific
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The processes unfolding today in Asia are turning this region
into one of the most important political and economic centers in
the contemporary world. We have every reason to say that the
development of the situation in that region will largely determine
the future of the entire international community in the 21st
century," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
Cho, who is here on an official visit, said that Russia faces a
"bright future" in the 21st century under the leadership of the "
fair and hugely energetic" new president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed to set up a hot line between their two
ministries and exchange navy port calls and to increase the number
of South Korean officers receiving training in Russia, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev also accepted an invitation to pay an official visit
to Seoul early next year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says UNMOT a Successful Story of Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said on
Tuesday that the U.N. Mission of Observers in Tajikistan(UNMOT)
had completed its mandate and it was a successful story in the
history of its peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, U.N. Special Representative for
Tajikistan, Ivo Petrov, said there were three main reasons which
contributed to the success.
</P>
<P>
"First is the U.N. involvement at the very early stage of the
civil war in Tajikistan," Petrov said.
</P>
<P>
"Then the contributions of the neighboring states who all made
attempts, offered good offices, offered their capitals for
meetings of the Tajik warring parties, who made everything
possible to bring the warring parties closer together," Petrov
said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest reason for the success were the efforts made by
the two Tajik warring parties themselves, the Government of
Tajikistan and the United Tajik Opposition who reached a peace
agreement after the four-year negotiations, which was signed in
1997 in Moscow, he added.
</P>
<P>
UNMOT, which finished its mandate Monday, was set up in 1994
to assist the Joint Commission, composed of representatives of
Tajik Government and of the United Tajik Opposition, to monitor
the implementation of the Agreement on a Temporary Ceasefire and
the Cessation of Other Hostile Acts on the Tajik-Afghan Borders
and within the Country for the Duration of the Talks.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the United Nations Security Council expanded its
mandate to assist the implementation of the 1997 General Agreement
on the Establishment of peace and National Accord in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has the intention to set up
a post-conflict peace-building office of the United Nations in
Tajikistan after the UNMOT finishes its mandate in order to
consolidate peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Warns Against Pullout from Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cohen said the number of troops in Bosnia has been reduced and
a similar reduction of troops in Kosovo in the future, but it's
going to take "a concerted effort."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that if "an artificial deadline" is set, it
would lead to "a severe strain within the alliance itself," Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States were to mandate an artificial deadline
for our departure, then I suspect that other members of NATO will
do the same and that you will see the return to the kind of
conflict we witnessed last year," Cohen said, referring to NATO's
78-day bombing campaign over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would call into question NATO's viability under
these circumstances," he added at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Clinton had not indicated to him whether he would
veto a legislation of 4.7 billion U.S. dollars emergency defense
funds, which also requires Congress' consent to keep U.S. troops
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I do know that there is strong opposition in the White House
but I haven't had a chance to speak directly with the president,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate this week is debating an 8.6 billion dollars measure
financing military construction in the coming fiscal year, which
also carries 4.7 billion dollars for U.S. operations in Kosovo,
anti-drug efforts in Colombia and other defense programs that
lawmakers have labeled an emergency.

<P>
MOGADISHU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rain recently hit central
and southern Somalia, where the scourge of an earlier drought had
hardly left local residents memory.
</P>
<P>
Floods caused by continuous rain had already broken many river
banks in the regions, submerging nearby villages and washing away
livestock and plants, said an official of the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
At least tens of thousands of people had been displaced by the
floods and were left in an destitute plight of lack of food and
clean water, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some local elders also expressed concern over the large numbers
of people already fallen for Malaria since the rains have begun
some two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The repercussions of the heavy rains in Lower and Middle
Shabelleh regions are even falling onto the capital which depends
on the areas for food and vegetable supplies.
</P>
<P>
The meat price in the capital, for example, has doubled due to
the disaster.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has welcomed the release of 139 of the 500 hostages held by the
rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba further said Zambians should all pray and continue to
believe that all the soldiers would come safely one day.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in Lusaka on Tuesday before he
left for Mauritius to attend the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zambian government has not yet been given the names
and number of the freed Zambian soldiers but will release the
names of the freed soldiers as they come to reduce the tension and
anxiety among their families in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He has described the current situation in Sierra Leone, where
more than 300 United Nations peacekeepers, most of them Zambians,
are being held hostage by rebels in that country, as a shame to
west Africa and Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The president said Africa must be embarrassed and ashamed that
such an incident was allowed to occur.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops were sent to Sierra Leone not to go and
fight but to maintain the much-needed peace in the region and that
it was sad for the rebels to hold them hostage.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was need for the U.N. to assess the
situation in a particular country critically before sending in
peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Sportsmen Join Fighting Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican health authorities
have expressed satisfaction with the results obtained by the "play
safe" project aimed to recruit sports people into the fight
against the lethal disease AIDS and HIV virus that causes it.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Noticias" daily Tuesday, the project targets
sports people in particular since they travel frequently within
the country and abroad, and so are more exposed to risk of
infection.
</P>
<P>
The initiative consists of training athletes in matters related
to HIV/ AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and
distributing pamphlets in sports circles containing advice on how
to prevent and fight these diseases.
</P>
<P>
A Health Ministry report said that 640 people, including
players, coaches, referees and others involved in sports were
trained between November 1999 and May 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the project distributed about 400,000
condoms and 50,000 pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities are concerned over the spread of STD,
and particularly HIV/AIDS, saying that at least 700 new cases of
HIV infection occur every day in the country, and that about 14
percent of Mozambicans are already infected with HIV.

TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 185 anti-drug forces were
killed in last Iranian calendar year in clashes with drug
traffickers, bringing the total number since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution to 3,000, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on

</P>
<P>
Reza Sarami, director general of the statistics office of the

</P>
<P>
He said there are about 800,000 drug-users in the country.
</P>

The official complained that the 1,975-kilometer eastern borders
with Afghanistan and Pakistan are a route for drug smuggling.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Ratify Rome Statute for Forming ICC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Chief Justice Latifur
Rahman said here Tuesday that Bangladesh would ratify the Rome
Statute to set up an international criminal court (ICC) for
establishing international rule of law in the global perspective.
</P>
<P>
"The International Court will be established after 60 member
states of the United Nations ratify the proposal for setting up of
a permanent International Criminal Court," the chief justice said
while inaugurating a national conference on "International
Criminal Court and Ratification by Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
Rahman said that in the past a good number of atrocities took
place in Vietnam, Cambodia and other places where neither the
national system nor the world community was able to bring to
justice those responsible for crimes of genocide, crimes against
humanity and serious violations of humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
He said it is "indeed gratifying" to note that at last the
international community has recognized the importance of setting
up of a permanent international criminal court to bring those
criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
The ICC would be an independent tribunal at Hague in the
Netherlands with the jurisdiction of genocide, aggression war
crimes and crimes against humanity, the chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
The International Law Commission adopted the Rome Statute for
establishing the ICC on July 17, 1998. A total of 96 countries
have already signed the treaty for setting up the ICC, while only
nine countries have so far ratified it.

<HEADLINE> Denmark See Off Malaysia to Advance into Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Denmark entered their third
consecutive semi-finals of the Thomas Cup men's team badminton
championships at the expense of hosts Malaysia, who lost 4-1 on
Tuesday at the packed Putra Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, who lost 3-2 to Malaysia in the semi-finals of the
1998 edition in Hong Kong, China, set up a meeting with Indonesia,
who cracked down China 4-1 to wrap up Group B.
</P>
<P>
China take on South Korea, who topped Group A with a 4-1 win
over India, in the semi-finals, which start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's other actions, England defeated Sweden 4-1 but
neither made the next round.
</P>
<P>
World number one player Peter Gade Christensen kept his clean
record in the men's team championships with a 15-7, 15-6 win over
Wong Choong Hann.
</P>
<P>
But Malaysia, who faced a do-or-die campaign on the witness of
13,000 home crowds, pulled level after Lee Wang Wah and Choong Tan
Fook edged off Martin Lundgaard Hansen and Lars Paaske, 15-12, 15-
10 on the first doubles.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen struggled to keep his
temper before pulling back from the brink of second loss to oust
Ong Ewe Hock, 17-14, 15-12, which served as the crucial point for
Danes' victory.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, gold medal winner of the Atlanta Olympic Games in
1996, almost surrendered a 14-11 lead in the first set when he
argued with line referees for a controversial ruling.
</P>
<P>
But the 34-year-old Dane controlled his manners to score three
points in a row after Ong caught up at 14-14.
</P>
<P>
"My win was crucial for our going through," Hoyer-Larsen said.
"If I lost the first set and the game, it would be very difficult
for the doubles."
</P>
<P>
In the decisive second doubles, Jesper Larsen and Jens Eriksen
held off big challenge from Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock,
winning 15-8, 8-15, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad with the impressive performances of our players,
" said Denmark's manager Thomas Lund. "They showed they have the
ability to handle the nerves and pressure. It's very important
for our semi-final clash with Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
China rested their first singles player Xian Xuanze and former
world champion Sun Jun in the preliminary round tie against
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"China didn't field their first choice players, we were lucky
to top the group," said Indonesia's coach Sumaryono Hadi Nasri. "
Maybe they saved their best players for the finals.
</P>
<P>
"There is no team who have the best players on both the singles
and doubles," said Nasri. "China's doubles may not as good as
their singles, but it doesn't mean they are not dangerous. Besides,
they haven't used the world champion Sun Jun yet."
</P>
<P>
Nasri said there is no difference for Indonesia to face Denmark
or South Korea in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"We felt confident that we're the best team in the event."
</P>
<P>
Chinese chief coach Li Yongbo denied saving strength for the
following games.
</P>
<P>
"Today's lineup is the best we have, but the results made no
difference to us for the semi-finals rivals," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li showed he was very confident for the semi-final tie against
South Korea. "Wait for the best in the semi-finals," he pledged.
</P>
<P>
South Korean manager Kwon Seung Taik said the doubles could
promise two points for South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident with my two doubles pair. They will take two
points from China, no problem for that. But if we want to win the
semi-finals, we must take the second or third singles games."

<HEADLINE> China to Use New Input System for Fifth Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China will use the high-speed
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to conduct its fifth
census which will begin on November 1.
</P>
<P>
The new system, provided by the Ziguang Group affiliated with
Qinghua University, consists of 421 scanners and software.
</P>
<P>
It will take the system about six months to complete the entire
country's 410 million survey forms with an margin error below 0.
056 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an agreement-signing ceremony on using the new
system, Lu Chunheng, deputy director of the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS), said the OCR system will greatly reduce the
workload, increase efficiency, minimize the margin of error, and
ensure accuracy in conducting the census.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first time China has used its own world-class
technology to conduct the largest census in the world," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, China's previous four population censuses
mainly used a manual input system which was time-consuming and had
a wider margin of error.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the fourth census conducted in 1990 took 10
months during which over 9,000 workers had to type figures into
computers.
</P>
<P>
The fifth national census this November is expected to record
changes that have taken place in China's population size,
structure, distribution, quality, environment, and other
demographic information about the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
China has conducted national censuses in 1953, 1964, 1982 and
1990 since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.
</P>
<P>
China had a population of 1.236 billion at the end of 1997,
according to the NBS, and its population is growing by 13 to 15
million a year. The country aims to maintain its population below
1.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Confirms Acquisition of Thai Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) confirmed Tuesday that it has
reached an agreement in principle on acquiring 75 percent of the
issued shares of Bangkok Metropolitan Bank (BMB).
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, which will involve 36.6 billion baht (940
million U.S. dollars), represents a premium of approximately 96
percent per share.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of
Thailand's minister of finance and the execution of definitive
agreements, said HSBC in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
After assuming the management of BMB, HSBC will reorganize BMB'
s capital structure to ensure an appropriate level of capital.
</P>
<P>
Expected capital after reorganization will be approximately 10
billion baht ( 257 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Financial Institutions Development Fund of Thailand will
enter into a loss sharing and yield maintenance arrangement with
HSBC in relation to a substantial proportion of the asset base.
</P>
<P>
HSBC is the oldest foreign bank in Thailand, having established
operations in the country in 1888.
</P>
<P>
"HSBC believes its strong capital base, management expertise
and e-business development capability, combined with BMB's
established branch network, will provide a sound base upon which
to develop BMB's core retail and commercial banking businesses,"
said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
BMB, established in 1950 as the 12th commercial bank in
Thailand, is the eighth largest bank in Thailand with 180 branches.
Its total assets and deposits totaled 4 billion U.S. dollars and 3.
9 billion U.S. dollars, respectively, as of the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Register More International Domains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that Chinese
companies have registered more than 150,000 international Internet
domain sites.
</P>
<P>
Experts note this indicated that more and more firms are ready
for cut-throat international competition.
</P>
<P>
The total number of domain names of Chinese organizations,
including those under .net and .org, have reached more than 180,
000, according to the statistics from China Xinnet, which recently
obtained a certificate to provide top domain registration service.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese firms realized the importance of their domain
names, but only registered them under the China domain, ending
with ".cn," according to the experts. Sometimes when a company
enters the world market they find that their domain name has been
stolen by others.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai are listed as the top three
places in the country in the number of registered international
domains, according to China Xinnet.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, nearly 20 percent of the domains are
owned by the computer industry itself, and nearly half of them are
registered in the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Israel Transfers Lebanon Post to SLA Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army Tuesday transferred an
outpost in south Lebanon to its local militia ally ahead of a
planned Israeli troop withdrawal by July, Middle East Report said.
</P>
<P>
The Rotem outpost, in the western sector of Israel's occupation
zone, was handed over to the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia "to
enable SLA soldiers to better defend the area close to their
village," the army said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, An Nahar Newspaper said that United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan has made two requirements before the Israeli
withdrawal: that the South Lebanon Army be disarmed and disbanded,
and that Israel release some 120 Lebanese inmates in Khiam prison.
</P>
<P>
However, local radios reported that Israel's Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh said Monday that the SLA might not be
disbanded after all. "A security vacuum will occur after the
Israeli withdrawal. If no side is available to fill this vacuum,
Israel may opt to let the SLA fill it."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has vowed to withdraw its
troops from the swamp of south Lebanon where Israel has lost
hundreds of soldiers since its occupation in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol the 15-kilometer deep zone Israel has set up in south
Lebanon since 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since
been leading a war of attrition to oust the Israeli forces and the
SLA.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah leaders have warned of a bloody revenge to the SLA
militiamen, whom they terms as traitors, after the Israeli pullout.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Chief: No Support for Karen Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai military has never
supported any armed Karen groups fighting with the Yangon troops
along the border, Commander in Chief of the Royal Thai Army
Surayudh Chulanont affirmed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted Surayudh as saying that the
Thai government's stance of not supporting any ethnic Karen groups
along the border has never changed, and that the Thai military has
strictly observed the policy.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had only given shelters to ethnic immigrants fleeing
fighting from the Myanmese side, he added.
</P>
<P>
Surayudh's remarks followed alleged reports of the Myanmese
authorities that the Thai military had given support to some armed
Karen groups along the border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Banyat
Bantadtan told TNA that relations between the Thai and Myanmese
governments are sound despite some border problems.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that international problems are sensitive and
should be addressed carefully through negotiations and peaceful
means.

<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) - Visiting Bhutanese Foreign Minister
Lyonpo Jigmi Y. Thinley Tuesday expressed the hope that people-to-
people contact between Bhutan and Bangladesh could be facilitated
through the introduction of direct bus service between Thimpu and
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for direct bus service between the two capitals
will be taken up when the representatives of the two countries
sign a new trade agreement to replace the existing one which will
expire in next September.
</P>
<P>
Thinley, who arrived here Saturday on a five-day visit, held
official talks with his counterpart Abdus Samad Azad and called on
both President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Tuesday
morning, the Bhutanese foreign minister appreciated Bangladesh for
its active role in favor of the least-developed countries at
various international forums.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the extensive trade between the two
countries would be further expanded and the existing trade
agreement would be renewed.
</P>
<P>
Describing the visit as "fruitful, productive and satisfying,"
Thinley said there is a great potential to raise the level of
cooperation between the two countries through greater interactions
of people and increased economic and commercial contacts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Unchanged in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices held steady
in April as energy prices posted their fist decline in almost a
year, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The flat reading in the Consumer Price Index, the most closely-
watched inflation gauge, followed increases of 0.5 percent and 0.7
percent in February and March, respectively. The last time the CPI
was unchanged was in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation rose 0.2 percent in April, only half the
previous month's increase.
</P>
<P>
The report came just minutes before Federal Reserve
policymakers were due to start a closed-door meeting, at which
analysts widely expect them to raise the key federal funds
overnight bank lending rate by half a percentage point, following
five quarter-percentage point moves in the rate over the past 10
months.
</P>
<P>
The most recent reading on inflation at the consumer level
reflected falling prices for energy, transportation and clothing,
which helped offset rising prices for tobacco products,
prescription drugs and cars.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 4.3 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for all of 1999.
The pickup in this year's prices, particularly in February and
March, came from rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
In April, however, energy prices fell 1.9 percent, the largest
decline since a 2.2 percent drop in May 1997. Increased crude-oil
production accounted for the decline. It was the first decline in
energy costs since last June.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting lower fuel costs, transportation prices declined by
0.7 percent in April, the best showing since May 1997, after
having risen sharply in the prior two months. Airline fares fell
by 0.5 percent, the largest decline since January.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, meanwhile, in April rose a slim 0.1 percent for
the second month in a row.Tobacco products including cigarettes,
grew by a whopping 4.4 percent, the largest increase since
September 1999. Companies have raised cigarette prices to pay
settlement costs for tobacco lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, housing construction rose a solid 2.8
percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 1.66 million,
the Commerce Department said. Most of the strength came from
builders beginning work on condominiums, apartments and other
multifamily housing, but starts of single-family homes also ticked
up, suggesting that rising interest rates haven't sidelined demand.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Carry Out Land Redistribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is setting up a fund
to enable it to expropriate white-owned farms for redistribution
to landless blacks, Secretary-General of the ruling South West
Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) Hifikepunye Pohamba told the
Parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pohamba said the government will pay "just compensation" to the
white farmers during the redistribution process as stipulated in
Namibia's constitution, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during a debate on an amendment of the
Agricultural Land Reform Act which will set up a Land Acquisition
and Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the fund must be created because of
"the reluctance by the majority of persons who belonged to the
advantaged class during colonial rule to sell part of their land
to the state on the basis of "willing seller, willing buyer".
</P>
<P>
Pohamba urged the Ministry of Lands to "start looking around
with a view to earmarking suitable land areas for expropriation".
</P>
<P>
However, the government's commitment to paying for land has
been challenged by a rare dissenting voice in the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
SWAPO backbencher Ponhele Ya France said: "We have delayed for
too long in resolving this burning issue of land and I assure you
what is happening in Zimbabwe will inevitably happen here."
</P>
<P>
Some 36.2 million hectares or 44 percent of land in Namibia
belong to around 4,000 farmers, most of whom are white. Close to 1
million black people have access to only 33.5 million hectares or
41 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous people were forced off the country's prime farming
land during the German colonial period from 1884 to 1915 and by
the South African-installed authority which ruled from 1915 to the
country's independence in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola to Invest $200 Million in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- American Soft drink giant
Coca-Cola company is to invest 1.4 billion rand (200 million U.S.
dollars) to expand its business in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The company's Chief Executive Officer Douglas Daft said in
Pretoria on Tuesday that the investment is part of the 7 billion
rand (about 1 billion dollars) investment package the company
intends to bring in over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The new investment will be used to build new bottling and
canning plants, new production lines and launch new soft-drink
brands, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very optimistic about this country's future and its
economic development," said Daft after meeting South African
President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Daft, who is also the global chairman of Coca-Cola, paid
tribute to Mbeki for his efforts to restore and sustain economic
and political stability in Africa, especially southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is Coca-Cola's eighth largest market among some
200 countries the company is currently operating in.
</P>
<P>
The investments elsewhere on the continent will, among other
countries, see two more bottling plants being set up in Angola and
a third in Mozambique, he said.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola is now one of the leading private investors on
African continent. It has invested about 600 million dollars in
the sub-Saharan Africa since 1995 and 170 million dollars in South
Africa alone in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Implement Poverty Alleviation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government is
going to commit about 59 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 73.75
million U.S. dollars) to poverty alleviation programs to be
implemented through a proposed poverty eradication fund initiative
in the next four years, newspapers here reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of a general assembly of
grass-root people's organizations in Dar es Salaam on Monday,
President Benjamin Mkapa said his government is negotiating with
the World Bank on the establishment of the Tanzania Social Action
Fund (TASAF) before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
It will fund programs on education, health, water and rural
roads and is also expected to provide jobs to many people,
consequently reducing unemployment in the country, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan and its performance satisfied the World Bank
officials who came last month for the reappraisal of a pilot
project in seven regions of Tanzanian mainland.
</P>
<P>
If approved, said Mkapa, over 81 percent of the money will come
from the World Bank, 5 percent from the government and 14 percent
from the people.
</P>
<P>
This amount of money would be enough for 42 districts which
would be selected basing on conditions acceptable to the Bretton
Woods institution and the government, he told participants at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The main target of TASAF is to reach all poorest regions in the
country, he explained, saying that it is a catalyst in the war
against poverty.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister's "Divine Land" Remarks Widely Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
on Tuesday drew outrage from the opposition parties and
disapproval from within his own cabinet one day after he said
people should recognize that Japan is a divine land with the
emperor at its center.
</P>
<P>
Japanese opposition party leaders said the remarks run counter
to the principles of democracy and the separation of politics from
religion expressed in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some cabinet members also questioned the comments,
saying Mori should be more careful about what he says.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is a divine country centering on the emperor. We have
been working for 30 years to have people firmly acknowledge that,"
Mori told a meeting of pro-Shinto Diet (parliament) members Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party
of Japan (DPJ), said early Tuesday that the comments deny the
ideas in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The impact this will have on other countries, especially Asian
countries, is extremely serious. We must topple the cabinet over
this remark, which denies the Constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said that if Mori had made
the comments, he should be more careful about what he says in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Defense Agency head Tsutomu Kawara also said Mori
should be more careful.
</P>
<P>
"There are people who are criticizing the comments. This is an
issue that should be dealt with carefully. He should be more
prudent," Kawara said.
</P>
<P>
Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, took on a nationalist
color before and during World War II. It was Japan's official
religion when its troops invaded Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Mori's comments were believed to have been targeted at
religious bodies in an effort to win them over before the general
election of the House of Representatives, expected to be held June
25, political sources said.

<HEADLINE> Most S.Korea Exports Compete Directly Against Japanese Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan are competing
fiercely in international markets, with 67 percent of South Korean
exports competing directly against Japanese products.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 67 percent of South Korean products, only eight
percent are seen superior to those from Japan while 27 percent of
the latter's goods are favored over those from the former,
according to a report issued by the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
When considering that only 10 percent of South Korean products
compete against Chinese goods and 22 percent of Chinese items
against South Korean goods, the competition between South Korea
and Japan is very fierce.
</P>
<P>
South Korean goods compete against Japanese products in a wide
range of markets, including electronics, automobiles, shipbuilding,
steel, machinery, chemicals and even fabrics.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that with superiority for some electronic
parts and components, including dynamic random access memory chips,
and fabrics, most South Korean products are inferior to Japanese
ones, making it difficult for South Korean companies to increase
their international market share.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports from Japan to South Korea are four times
exports from South Korea to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 20.2 percent of South Korea's imports were from
Japan while the island country's 5.1 percent of imports were from
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of South Korean imports from Japan has been
decreasing from 24.1 percent in 1995, but still remains very high
while South Korean items are still struggling hard in the Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade deficit with Japan reached 8.3 billion U.
S. dollars last year and 2.9 billion in the first three months
this year alone, indicating that the trade gap between the two
nations is expected to grow as the South Korean economy remains
vibrant with strong exports.
</P>
<P>
South Korean companies have to improve their competitiveness
against Japanese firms if they are to expand their international
market share, the report pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM: No Isolation of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said Tuesday that Moscow wants Yugoslavia reinstated in
international organizations and a dialogue between Belgrade and
the international community resumed.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's participation is essential to stability and
security in the Balkans, Ivanov said at a press conference after
talks here with his Yugoslav counterpart, Zivadin Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow wants to build long-term strategic relations
with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
On the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Ivanov said that "respect
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and
working out with Belgrade a broad status of autonomy for Kosovo
within Yugoslavia are of principal importance for Russia."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov voiced Russia's objection to revision of the Dayton
accords on peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia. He said a
Belgrade delegation must attend the ministerial meeting of
signatory countries to the accords to be held in Brussels at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever tries to obstruct Yugoslavia's participation (in that
meeting) will inflict damage on the realization of the Dayton
accords, with all the resulting consequences," the Interfax news
agency quoted the Russian minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, who arrived here Monday on a two-day working visit,
said relations with Russia are of strategic significance for
Yugoslavia in terms of the interests of the two countries and the
stabilization of the situation in Southeastern Europe and on the
entire European continent.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Relaxing Controls on Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China should actively pursue the
goal of adopting interest rates set by market forces rather than
by the government, Director General of the Monetary Policy
Committee of the People's Bank of China Xie Ping said here today.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Chinese central bank's think-tank told the
China Financial Industry Reforms International Summit 2000 that
the country should lift controls on currency market rates first,
then lending rates, and finally deposit rates.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give any specific timetable for achieving
these goals.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's currency policy should take interest rates
as intermediary objective and inflation rates as the final goal.
</P>
<P>
China has already relaxed controls on the prices of almost all
commodities and services in a bid to build a market economy, but
has yet to lift control on interest rates. Interest rates for
loans and bank deposits are now set by the central bank rather
than by supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that China should reform the currency market by
establishing a unified and flexible market with high efficiency
and handling capacity.
</P>
<P>
New channels through which the central bank handles base
currency will be explored for the purpose of enhancing financial
liquidity, according to Xie.

helping China's poverty-reduction efforts in the new century.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to finding new avenues and instruments to
make an impact and look forward to working closely with the
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peter H. Sullivan, vice president of the Asia Development Bank
(ADB), said that China's success in reducing poverty is among the
best in Asia, and the country can take pride in having reduced the
number of absolute poor from 250 million in 1978 to around 34
million today. Other countries also have much to learn from China,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will intensify its cooperation with China in the area
of poverty reduction, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China is developing its poverty reduction strategy for
the next 20 years, a strategy that will provide a framework in
which the ADB and other international agencies can join forces to
help fight against poverty.

Sullivan said the ADB believes that its hard money can be used
to help China fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the ADB will shift two-thirds of its lending
to the poorer central and west China provinces for infrastructure
construction, which is essential for creating the conditions
necessary to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
"The ADB is also trying to develop special mechanisms to allow
us to work more closely with China in the area of poverty
reduction," Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
Next week, the ADB's board of directors will approve the Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction, which contains 90 million U.S. dollars,
and he said that although the plan for how to use this fund has
not been worked out, it is certain that part of it will be used in
China.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said the ADB has initiated discussions with China and
Harvard University on establishing a joint rural poverty reduction
research center in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
This center would allow international and domestic experts to
learn from, and expand on, an ongoing ADB-funded pilot project,
and engage in other priority research needs on rural poverty in
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, resident representative of UN Development
Program in China, said that China worked out a national proverty
reduction plan in 1994, and with this initiative, provided a model
for developing countries and, in fact, the world at large.
</P>
<P>
This international conference comes at a critical point in the
world's campaign against poverty, and one of its important tasks
is to assess the trends and characteristics of poverty in China
today so that "we can contribute to the identification of the key
issues and strategies for China's new Poverty Reduction Plan for
the coming two decades," she said.

not to include in the agenda of the assembly the proposal by a

<HEADLINE> One Million Hectares of Wasteland Reclaimed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China has reclaimed one million
hectares of industrial and mining wasteland during the past five
decades, Vice-Minister of Land Resources Lu Xinshe said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the International Symposium on Land
Reclamation which opened here today, Lu said 70 percent of the
reclaimed land has been used for farming and the rest for non-
agricultural construction or other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the accumulated wasteland in China totals 13.3 million
hectares, mainly a by-product of the country's construction of
highways, railways, and water conservancy projects, as well as
mining and brick-making.
</P>
<P>
The amount of mining wasteland alone is increasing by nearly 50,
000 hectares a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said China will invest more to reclaim the existing
industrial and mining wasteland as part of its efforts to improve
the ecological environment and promote sustainable land use.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 land reclamation experts from 16 countries, including
China, the United States, Britain, and Brazil, attended the three-
day meeting hosted by the China Land Society.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 artists will display their
works at Beijing's Baoguo Temple on May 18 to raise money for
planting trees over a 666-hectare area in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The idea for the tree-planting project started with a few
artists in Beijing who were concerned about the local environment
following the recent sandstorms that blasted the city. One of the
organizers of the event is Qinghua University associate professor
Li Yan, who is the son of China's late famous painter Li Kuchan.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 70 works have been contributed by Beijing
painters and calligraphers.
</P>

The money raised by selling paintings and works of calligraphy
will be collected by the China Youth Development Foundation and
will be used to plant and maintain the trees.

<HEADLINE> "Che Guevara" in Beijing Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Che Guevara, the Latin America
revolutionary and hero who fought against imperialism, stepped
into a small theater in Beijing recently, and attracted an
audience that already knows him or is eager to know him.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangtian, one of the authors of the play "Che Guevara"
said that his play is not a biography but a kind of reflection of
the real life based on an understanding of a historic figure.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also called this play "people's play," indicating that
popular methods have been used in the music and dance, which are
welcomed by most audiences.
</P>
<P>
Audience do not actually see Guevara during the two-hour play,
and all they learn about the hero is through an actor's voice.
</P>
<P>
Guevara and Fidel Castro liberated Cuba after four years of
fighting, and Guevara, at the age of 33, became the youngest
political leader, revolutionary, and diplomat of the world. He
gave up this high position in Cuba to become a guerrilla fighter
in Bolivia, where he was killed by the Bolivian military.
</P>
<P>
The play expresses the pursuit of an ideal, which is reflected
in this foreign communist who fought against imperialism and
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Hong, the play's production manager, noted that "Che
Guevara" has played 40 times in Beijing and has attracted more
than 10,000 people. He said he hopes the play will be staged in
Guevara's hometown some day.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Daily Publisher Summoned to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The publisher of another Iranian
reformist daily Bahar (Spring) was summoned to court on Tuesday,
hours after the closure of the 18th daily Hammihan (Countrymen).
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Justice Department announced that Bahar's Managing
Director Saeed Pourazizi was summoned to the court following a
complaint lodged by the prosecutor with the department.
</P>
<P>
The department said Pourazizi was accused of spreading lies and
affronts, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bahar hit the stand late last month after the Iranian judiciary
ordered a wholesale closure of 17 newspapers and journals, 16 of
which were mouthpieces of the reformist allies of President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The closure deprived the reformists of a voice in the May 5
runoffs of the February parliamentary elections, in which the
conservatives suffered a humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
The pro-reformist daily Hammihan (Countrymen) published by
former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi was ordered to close
down on Tuesday morning for 17 cases of violation of the press law.
</P>
<P>
The charges leveled against the daily include "spread of false
reports" against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the
basij (volunteers), the security forces, the judiciary, the Majlis
(parliament) and the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's paper was also accused of "creating division among
the officials of the sacred system of the Islamic republic."
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, secretary general of the centralist Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI), was sentenced to jail on
graft charges last year, but was pardoned by the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on January 25.
</P>
<P>
Hammihan and Bahar became the favorite reformist newspapers of
the Iranian people following the large-scale crackdown by the
powerful conservatives, who dominate most of the sensitive organs
such as the judiciary and the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Frees 9 Foreign Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Nine foreign journalists rounded up
by a Muslim rebel group and turned over to the Abu Sayyaf
terrorist group which holds the 21 hostages seized earlier in
Malaysia, were released safely Tuesday, the Philippine News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The nine journalists said they were divested of their media
paraphernalia and personal belongings, including their wrist
watches, sun glasses, still and moving cameras and cash.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted the Philippine military authorities as
saying that the foreign journalists were missing as they left for
the hinterlands Sulu last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Narrating how they were taken by the rebel group, Frank
Beruyyer, a reporter of Agence France Presse (AFP), was quoted as
saying they were seized by the lost command while "on our way to
the mountain, trekking toward the Abu Sayyaf turf."
</P>
<P>
Beruyyer said they were taken by the lost command rebel group
to their lair and were later "turned over to the Abu Sayyaf holing
21 Sipadan hostages."
</P>
<P>
The AFP reporter described the Abu Sayyaf lair as "a very
strange place with all the armed Abu Sayyaf group around and we
never knew who they were."
</P>
<P>
Beruyyer said they manifested their desire to take with them
the two sick hostages, but the Abu Sayyaf refused. A
representative of the rebel group said the hostages can be
released only after a negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The capture of the journalists also proved a blessing for the
21 hostages, who were able to contact their respective families
through a cellular phone one of the captured journalists had
hidden.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages were happy to have communicated with their
families and some relatives.

MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to hasten the safe release
of 21 hostages, mostly foreigners, in the southern Philippine
province of Sulu, President Joseph Estrada has reconstituted the
team tasked to negotiate with the Abu Sayyaf rebel group,
Philippine News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Estrada signed Monday an order, where he cited
"an urgent need to create a new panel" to address the situation

presidential assistant for economic affairs and chairman of the
presidential committee on flagship projects.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Gain, Lose From Floating Ringgit: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The anticipated floating of ringgit
will have both positive and negative effects on the Thai economy,
the Thai Farmers Bank Research Center said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok-based research center was quoted by Thailand News
Agency as saying in its latest report that the expectedly stronger
ringgit would help boost not only Thai exports to the Malaysian
market, but also local tourism businesses, particularly in
provinces adjacent to the Malaysian border.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is now Thailand's largest tourism market, with over
one million tourists visiting Thailand each year, or about 14
percent of total foreign arrivals in Bangkok in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the anticipated floating ringgit will also help lift
the international confidence in the Malaysian economy, possibly
leading to more foreign investment in the country rather than in
its neighboring economies including Thailand, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's strengthened economy is pressing the government to
soon lift its capital control policy, implemented over the past
two years to shield the country from the regional economic turmoil
and to protect the ringgit from falling to be a victim of foreign
speculators.
</P>
<P>
The tight capital control policy with low-level interest rates
has led to a steady improvement of the Malaysian economy, with the
ringgit being maintained at 3.8 ringgit a dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysian currency is now considered weaker than
it should be and was expected to appreciate by 10 to 15 percent
soon, to touch the level of 3.2 to 3.4 ringgit a dollar.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Unemployment Rate High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment rate in South
Africa has reached to the critical proportion of nearly 40 percent
and this is totally unacceptable, Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening debate in the National Council of Provinces on his
department's budget vote, Erwin said although the exact level of
joblessness in the country is the subject of some debate, the
government's priority now is to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said since 1994 the South African government has made some
very important strategic choices in an effort to restructure the
economy, during which more job losses occurred as inefficient
enterprises and sector declined.
</P>
<P>
However, Erwin pointed out "this is not automatically a good
thing. Where it is designed just to cut wages we would argue it is
a short-sighted approach because what is happening in the world
today is not increased production on the basis of unskilled
low-paid workers, but increased production on the basis of
well-paid skilled workers".
</P>
<P>
Erwin said South Africa's employment situation is undergoing
deep structural change and new sectors and geographic areas of the
economy will receive priority.
</P>
<P>
Services, information technology, agro-industry and tourism are
expected to become important employment growth sectors, he
predicted.

JOHANNESBURG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in
South Africa might be much worse than what had been estimated, a
new study by South African Institute of Race Relations warned on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study predicted that about six million people in the
country will be HIV-positive by the end of this year, in stead of
2005, formerly predicted by the Health Ministry last month.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 percent of the country's population of 43.32 million
will be HIV- positive by 2006, and 250,000 South Africans are
expected to die from the deadly disease this year, said the study.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the disease will increase by 180 percent
annually over the next five years, with an expected annual death
toll of 700,000 by 2015.
</P>
<P>
The country's Gross Domestic Product is expected to see a
annual decline of 3.1 percent between 2006 and 2010 due to the
disease, warned the study.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Pyongyang Agree to Meet Again Preparing Inter-Korean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Seoul and Pyongyang Tuesday agreed to
hold their fifth preparatory talks Thursday for the inter-Korean
summit scheduled to open in Pyongyang on June 12-14.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's expert-level meeting held in the Unification House
on the northern part of the truce village of Panmunjom which
focused on the summit's protocol and security, delegates from
Seoul proposed that a 60-member security team with security-
related equipment be allowed to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed to make decisions on the matters when
Seoul's initial team makes a visit to Pyongyang, said South Korean
official.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which have held four preparatory meetings, will
meet at 10.a.m local time on the southern side of the truce
village for the fifth round of preparatory talks.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining issue that stands in the way of hammering
out a deal is the size of the South Korean press corps going to
Pyongyang to cover the summit, with Pyongyang insisting that
Seoul's proposed number of 80 members be halved.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have reportedly narrowed their differences on the
size of the press corps and there is a high possibility that two
sides will sign an accord on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington to Investigate Bomb Damage to SKorean Villagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The investigation will be conducted on May 18-20 to find
whether there were casualties or property damages from dropping of
six bombs by a plane of United States Forces Korea (USFK) on drill
on May 8 this year in Maehyang-ri of Hwansong town in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member investigation team will consist of South Korean
officials from the Defense and Justice Ministries, police and
local governments, villagers and USFK officials.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the U.S. have reached an agreement on the
comprehensive measures after their talks began late last week in
the wake of the bombing incident.
</P>
<P>
On May 8, one of three U.S. A-10 aircraft which were en route
from Osan Air Base to a training range near Kunsan, dropped six
bombs due to engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
The bombs allegedly caused explosions that injured seven
residents, shattered windows and damaged the walls and roofs of
some 170 homes. But, the USFK denied that villagers were wounded
by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Washington also agreed to come up with measures aimed
at improving the way drills are conducted on the firing range in
such a direction as to ensure the safety of villagers and minimize
the noise problem.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean ministry also said it will press ahead with a
plan to relocate villagers in Maehyang-ri more aggressively to
resolve problems arising from the existence of the training range
there.
</P>
<P>
"We will relocate about 238 households in Maehyang-ri, located
near the range, as soon as the villagers agree on the relocation,"
Major General Lee Kwang-kil of the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reached an agreement on the relocation with
residents in January 1997 but the agreement broke down due to
dissent opinions among the villagers. About 65 billion won (some
60 million U.S.dollars) is needed to relocate all the 238
households.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a USFK spokesman denied press reports that
the A-10 bomber dropped bombs made from armor-piercing depleted
uranium on the firing range on May 8.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the dropped bombs were MK-82 bullets. The U.S. Air
Force has never used depleted uranium shells in South Korea," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The depleted uranium shell, often called the "silver bullet,"
can pierce the toughest armored vehicles. Its shrapnel is
allegedly radioactive and leaves a potential heavy metal problem.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Inflation Rises to 3 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's inflation rate rose to 3
percent in April, up from 2.6 percent in March, the Office of
National Statistics (ONS) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's favored measure of inflation, so-
called underlying inflation, which excludes the cost of mortgage
interest payments, fell to a record low of 1.9 percent since
records began over 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cuts in the cost of water and sewerage services imposed by the
industry regulator, along with easing motoring costs after the
jump in oil prices earlier in the year, helped to offset upward
pressures, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that underlying inflation is well below the
government's target of 2.5 percent suggests that the Bank of
England's tough interest rate policy is having an effect and that
it may not have to raise rates further.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that domestic inflationary pressures aren't
strong, but much of underperformance has been due to the strength
of sterling. If that abates or goes into reverse, then Britain
will have a bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has made
it clear that it would be wrong to target the pound-euro exchange
rate, although the bank takes into account the level of sterling
in its interest rate deliberations.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England has an even inflation target, which means
it must ensure that inflation does not fall too low as well as
rise too high.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government is
working on policies to encourage local people to work in western
China, said an official with the city's personnel bureau.
</P>
<P>
The city will adopt a series of preferential policies to

according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Anyone willing to work in the western region will have the
option of returning to his or her former job in Beijing after
three years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
And those who go will be at the top of the list for promotions,
and will get an attractive salary, with bonuses going to people
making outstanding contributions to progress in science and
technology and to local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will establish a special office to send professionals
from all circles of life, including young graduates as well as

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's securities regulatory
authorities should put more emphasis on supervision, leaving
corporate affairs to the listed companies themselves, according to
one senior official.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC)was quoted in today's "China Securities" as
saying that regulatory bodies should strengthen their supervision
work to promote the standard operations of listed companies,
enhance transparency, and help develop external supervisory
systems.

The authorities should act more like a "referee," Zhou said,
adding that it is inappropriate for the government to exert
influence in corporate affairs such as use of funds and operations.
</P>
<P>
Fan Fuchun, vice chairman of CSRC, also urged local branches of
the commission to step up supervision on information disclosure of
listed firms in a bid to ward off risks and maintain the stability

Wu said that the reform measure of capital fund supplement will
include forming a regular supplement channel and improving the
level of capital adequacy.
</P>
<P>
She said that the country will reform the reserve withdrawing
system for loan losses and the system of writing off bad debts.
The move is aimed to give commercial banks more incentives to put
aside adequate reserve funds for loan losses and greater power to
write off bad loans.
</P>
<P>
The country will also encourage innovations and vigorously
develop intermediary financial services in a move to increase
revenue sources and spread risks.
</P>
<P>
She noted that opening to the outside world is a basic policy
of China. China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
will accelerate the pace of opening of the country's financial
industry, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the process of opening the financial
industry to foreign investors depends on the demands of China's
economic development, progress of financial reform, development of
the financial market and regulatory power of the financial sector.
Whether or not China joins the WTO, the country will continue to
open further to the outside world according to its own timetable.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 87 foreign financial institutions and group
corporations from 22 countries and regions in the world had set up
182 operating entities in China. In addition, 166 foreign banks
from 38 countries and regions have set up 248 representative
offices in the country. Branches of foreign banks had 31.8 billion
U.S. dollars-worth of assets in China, accounting for less than
two percent of the total assets of financial institutions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks had lent 21.8 billion U.S. dollars in China,
accounting for about one-fifth of the country's total foreign

China will also properly handle the balancing acts of defusing
financial risks and maintaining stability of the Chinese currency,
and preventing financial risks and promoting economic growth.

policy and improve its pre-emptive capacity in a timely fashion;
it will establish an interest rate system driven by market forces
and centered around the bench mark of the interest rate of the
central bank; and it will coordinate fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>

essentially solving the problem of food and clothing for the rural
poor, reaching the goal set by the government in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only a great event in the history of the Chinese

"The most important experience of the success in poverty
reduction is that China has always stuck to the principle of
reducing poverty by development," he said.
</P>
<P>
By development, it means that the country centers on economic
construction, helps poor areas to develop local resources,
develops the market economy and improves local production and
living conditions to strengthen the capability of poor people to
get themselves out of poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
visiting Philippine President Joseph Estrada held talks at the
Great Hall of the People here today, and Jiang put forward four
specific proposals on the direction for the future development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
First, both countries should deepen their mutual trust, and
promote the growth of a healthy relationship. China and the
Philippines are friendly neighbors, and their peoples are like
relatives, Jiang said, expressing the hope that the two nations
will be good neighbors, good friends, and good partners forever.
</P>
<P>
Second, they should deepen cooperation and further consolidate
the foundation of bilateral ties. China and the Philippines should
carry out overall cooperation, especially in the economic and
trade sector, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Third, both countries should properly handle existing problems
in the spirit of seeking truth from facts. The issue concerning
the South China Sea is one left over by history, which can not be
settled immediately, he noted. China advocates the peaceful
settlement of disputes through negotiations among the parties
concerned in accordance with universally recognized principles of
international law and modern maritime law, including the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
This fully demonstrates China's sincere wish to safeguard
regional peace, stability and bilateral relations, Jiang said,
stressing that the most practical measure for settling the issue
is to put aside disputes and seek common development.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the two countries should offer mutual support in order
to safeguard their common interest in international affairs. Jiang
pointed out that China and the Philippines share many common
interests in reinforcing regional cooperation and establishing a
new international political and economic order, especially in the
UN, the WTO, and the APEC, where, in informal meetings of east
Asian leaders, they enjoy a broad cooperative foundation and can
reinforce communication and coordination.

Estrada said that during his stay in Beijing, the two sides
will sign a joint statement on bilateral cooperation oriented
towards the 21st century, as well as other documents which will be
milestones in the history of Philippine-Chinese relations, and set
the direction for the development of these relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Philippine-Chinese relations are very important,
and the Philippine people will hold many activities to celebrate
the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties
between the Philippines and China.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his hope that cooperation with China will be to
strengthened in regional and international affairs, and said that
the Philippines understands China's stance in the human rights
commission of the United Nations, and firmly supports China's
efforts to enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said China's entry into the WTO will help develop Philippine-
Chinese trade and economic cooperation, and safeguard the
interests of the developing countries as well.
</P>
<P>
On the South China Sea issue, Estrada said that the Philippine
side agrees with China's view that the differences over territory
and sea area should be resolved through peaceful means, and that
this difference should not influence the development of bilateral
relations, and should be resolved through consultations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, representatives of the two countries signed
five documents, including a joint statement on the framework for
cooperation between the governments of China and the Philippines
in the 21st century, a protocol on the twelfth session of the
joint commission of scientific and technological cooperation, a
program for cultural cooperation agreement from 2000 to 2001, an
exchange of notes on the building of a Chinese agriculture center

other agricultural areas.

Jiang said China and the Philippines are close neighbors, and
friendship between their two peoples can be traced back to ancient
times. During the 25 years since the establishment of diplomatic
relations, bilateral ties have witnessed smooth growth, and
development has been registered in cooperation in the political,
economic, and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
During president Estrada's current visit, the two countries
will issue a joint statement on the framework of bilateral
cooperation in the 21st century, which will actively define future
bilateral ties and map out cooperation in all fields. This is a
sign of further deepening of relations between the two countries,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The president also expressed appreciation over the Philippine
government's pursuit of the One-China policy. The Chinese
government's policy on the Taiwan issue is "peaceful reunification,
and one country, two systems," he said, and China has continued
its unremitting efforts to seek peaceful reunification.

<HEADLINE> Pro-reformist Daily Closed Down in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary on
Tuesday closed down another pro-reformist daily Hammihan
(Countrymen), bringing the number of papers closed recently to 18.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Justice Department said in a statement that the
daily, published by former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi,
was ordered to halt publication as it has been charged with 17
cases of violation of the press law, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The charges leveled against the daily include "spread of false
reports" against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the
basij (volunteers), the security forces, the judiciary, the Majlis
(parliament) and the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The paper was also accused of "creating division among the
officials of the sacred system of the Islamic republic."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian judiciary last month ordered a wholesale closure of
17 newspapers and journals, 16 of which were mouthpieces of the
reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The closure deprived the reformists of a voice in the May 5
runoffs of the February parliamentary elections, in which the
conservatives suffered a humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, secretary general of the centralist Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI), was sentenced to jail on
graft charges last year, but pardoned by supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on January 25.

<HEADLINE> Former TNI Chief to Resign From Cabinet Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian Military (TNI)
Chief Gen. (ret) Wiranto said here Tuesday he will formally resign
from his cabinet post as Coordinating Minister for Politics and
Security Affairs and will support a thorough investigation into
human rights abuse in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"To clear the way for investigation into human rights abuse in
East Timor, I decide to formally resign from my cabinet post as
Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Affairs and I will
soon appear before President Abdurrahman Wahid," Wiranto told a
press conference after being questioned by prosecutors at the
Attorney General Office.
</P>
<P>
"He is grilled by prosecutors as a witness in an alleged human
rights abuse in the breakaway province of East Timor in 1999. He
is questioned as he was a TNI Chief when violence was taking place
there," Adnan Buyung Nasution, a member of the TNI Legal Defender
Team, told reporters after the questioning.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was suspended from his duties by President Wahid in
February this year on the charges of his involvement in the human
rights abuse in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto arrived at the AGO at about 09;00 a.m. local time and
underwent investigation for about 7 hours.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to appear again for further investigation next
Tuesday "because prosecutors still need information from him,"
Nasution added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wiranto also said that with his resignation from his
cabinet post investigation into human right abuse in East Timor
could be carried out in a fair way.
</P>
<P>
"And hopefully, the real truth (about what happened in East
Timor) can be uncovered, based on the principle of law and human
rights value. Nothing left to be hidden (during the investigation
process)," Wiranto added.
</P>
<P>
Beside Wiranto, the AGO has also questioned some civilian and
military officials to uncover what the National Commission on
Human Rights (Komnas HAM) called as a crime against humanity in
East Timor in which hundreds of people were reportedly killed last
year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Expands Spending for Arms Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's defense spending this
year would expand by about one fourth to 880 million U.S. dollars
due to emergency shopping of arms to fight Tamil Tiger rebels in
the north of the country, a senior minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget for 2000 was previously set at 52.4 billion
rupees (703 million dollars), about five percent of gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told a news conference
that Sri Lanka had held talks on arms purchases with seven
countries earlier this month as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) stepped up its offensive in the northern Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
But he did not reveal what deals had been struck.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said some of the arms which the government had
decided to buy were arriving already, though he declined to be
specific.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the government said it planned to issue some 10
billion rupees (134 million dollars) worth of additional treasury
bills this year and raise the national security levy by one
percentage point to 6.5 percent, fetching an additional 2.5
billion rupees (33.6 million dollars) for the war chest.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, the government announced that it has raised the
taxes on cigarettes and liquor to bring in 1.5 billion rupees (20
million dollars) to fund the ongoing war against LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka already uses several Israeli-built Kfir fighter jets
in its war against the LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for a
separate homeland for the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983 and have stepped up their offensive since April
this year.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports have said more Kfir ground attack fighters
are expected to be delivered following the restoration of
diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Israel, which were
formalized in New York on Monday.

With the Sri Lankan army reinforcing Jaffna town with more
troops and weapons, the LTTE had shifted its focus away from the
town and directed its attacks on the settlements north of the town.
</P>
<P>
But there were reports Tuesday of a fresh offensive on Jaffna
town, which had been largely peaceful for three days.
</P>
<P>
After asserting Monday that the intensity of the LTTE attacks
had drastically come down due to successful air strikes pounding
rebel positions, the government Tuesday said its troops had pulled
back to "prepared positions" northeast of Jaffna town due to heavy
artillery and mortar attacks by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
LTTE guerrillas launched fresh attacks on the troops around
1800 hours Monday first at Thananakilappu sector, north of Jaffna
town which was one of the places, where the rebels first mounted
the attacks on May 10, a government press release said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Underground Sea Found in West Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A massive underground sea has been
discovered below the parched West Australian outback, Australian
Associated Press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sea is big enough to supply Perth, the state capital of the
Western Australia, with water for the next 4,000 years, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the biggest continent in the world and the Western
Australia is the driest part of the continent.
</P>
<P>
AAP quoted a spokesman from mining company Anaconda Nickel Ltd,
which searched for the sea, as saying that the underground water
is estimated to be the equivalent of 4,200 Sydney harbors and
extended 700 km by 200 km ranging between 50 and 2,000 meter deep
with an estimated total surface area of 200,000 sq. km.
</P>
<P>
The water would be drinkable after processing and more likely
to be used by mines and farms.
</P>
<P>
The company began drilling the resource only a month ago
following a study last year investigating the possibility of
underground water reserves.
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of mines in the area that haven't been able to
go ahead because they haven't had water to do it.

BRUSSELS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people are still
unaccounted for after a fireworks warehouse explosion last
Saturday at the Dutch town of Enschede.

Enschede officials said on Tuesday that the number of the

<HEADLINE> Four Ancient Cultural Remains Unearthed In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Four ancient cultural remains
dated back to 2000 B.C. have been unearthed in a large-scale
archaeological excavation at So Kwun Wat in Hong Kong, a cultural
services spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sites belong to four different cultural phases between Late
Neolithic period (c. 2000 BC) and Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644).
Jointly conducted by the Hong Kong Leisure and Cultural Services
Department and Beijing University, the archaeological excavation
has started since early March this year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the department said that the archaeological
team which comprised over 10 professional archaeologists had
excavated an area of more than 600 square meters so far and rich
cultural remains were found.
</P>
<P>
"The most spectacular findings made in this excavation should
be the discovery of more than 60 bronze Wuzhu coins inside a pit
within the Han cultural layer," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This is ranked as one of the most important discoveries of Han
cultural remains in the archaeological history of Hong Kong, after
the discovery of the Eastern Han Dynasty brick tomb at Lei Cheng
Uk village in 1955 and the excavation of a rich Han Dynasty
cultural layer at Tung Wan Tsai, Ma Wan in 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Late Neolithic activity floor, there are a number of
firing hearths as suggested by the circular arrangement of some
burnt stones and the distribution of the ash-darkened sand. The
excavation of a number of potholes in the vicinity of the hearths
suggested the presence of Neolithic house structures.
</P>
<P>
Large quantity of pottery shreds and a few pieces of complete
pottery ware are scattered on the activity floor. The pottery ware,
including cauldrons, pots and basins, are mostly stamped with cord
and other geometric patterns on their surface, which is a
distinctive features of Late Neolithic pottery in South China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that careful post-excavation analysis of
these findings would produce useful information on the settlement
and living pattern of the local Neolithic folks.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that two pits were found in the Han cultural
layer. A pottery jar stamped with lattice and seal pattern was
unearthed from one pit while the other pit yielded more than 60
bronze Wuzhu coins and fragments of hemp and bamboo mat as well.
</P>
<P>
"These rare artifacts are of high significance for the study of
the history of Hong Kong during the Han Dynasty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Down to the Song and Ming dynasties, the So Kwun Wat site was
used as a burial ground. Seventeen burials have been unearthed so
far. The Song burials are all orientated in a northwest-southeast
direction with the head pointing towards northwest. The Ming
burials are in a northeast-southwest direction with the head
pointing towards northeast.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that all burials have burial pits with
traces of wooden coffin and coffin nails. The skeletons are,
however, mostly decay and only fragments of skull, long bones and
several teeth were found.
</P>
<P>
Among the Song burials, five of them yielded two or three
pieces of roof tile at the position of the head. Other burial
objects include iron dagger, iron scissors, iron sickle, bronze
ring and cash coins. The coins can be found both inside and on top
of the coffins. A pair of glazed pottery jars with porcelain bowl
as the cover was placed at the rear end of the burial pits.
</P>
<P>
"Since rice gains were found inside one of the jar, study of
these gains would provide interesting information on the
agricultural development of Hong Kong during the Song Dynasty,"
said the spokesman.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China is devising its poverty-
reduction strategy for the first 20 years of the 21st century and
will focus energy and resources on the western areas where most of
China's remaining poor people live, Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said
here today.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China will set and revise 2,500
industrial standards for agriculture in the coming five years,
according Vice-Minister of Agriculture Liu Jian.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, China will have new technical standards for
agricultural production and marketing, assessment of the quality
of agricultural products, development of high-quality agricultural
products and imports and exports of agricultural products, the
official said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The standards will be in line with both China's domestic
situation and international practice, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"This will sharpen the competitive edge of China's agricultural
products in the world market after the country joins the World
Trade Organization and increase farmers' income," he said.
</P>
<P>
The standards will cover the sectors of planting, breeding,
fishery, environmental protection in rural areas, the beverage
industry, township enterprises and protection of new plant species.
</P>
<P>
Liu blamed the low-quality agricultural products in China for
the lack of an efficient quality standard system, although the
country has already set more than national 300 standards, over 900
professional standards and 15,000 local standards for the
agricultural sector.

<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of non-government run
schools in China reached 45,000 in 1999, accounting for 5.2
percent of all the country's schools, an official with the
Ministry of Education disclosed recently.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Youth Daily" said that non-government schools
now have 5.73 million students, or 2.35 percent of country's
students.
</P>
<P>
China also now has 1,240 non-government universities, with 1.18
million students. Most of the non-government high schools and
universities are located in the country's economically advanced
areas including Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang and Liaoning
provinces, while the non-government schools at the nine-year
compulsory education level are concentrated in the country's more
economically retarded areas such as Hebei, Anhui and Henan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Problems still exist in non-government schools, says the
official, adding that few of these schools have full-time teachers,
many lack proper funding, and they still require new laws and
regulations, according to the paper.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Trademark Bureau under the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce announced here
today it has canceled the trademark "PDA" registered by a local
company in Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital of Hebei in north
China.
</P>
<P>
"PDA" is short for personal digital aide, an electronic memo
pad which is widely sold on the market and is generically referred
to as "PDA", and therefore cannot be registered as a trademark,
according to an official from the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Fulande Business Development Company, former owner of the
trademark, registered the label in 1997, and since has sued a Hong
Kong-based firm for copyright infringement for printing "PDA" on a
personal digital aide.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong company, which suffered financial losses in the
lawsuit, later appealed to the administration. After an
investigation, the administration canceled the trademark.
</P>
<P>
China manufactured 3.5 million PDAs last year and the output
goes up by 30 percent annually, according to official statistics.

year for illegal activities involving land use, doubling the
figure of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ministry suggested that 507 local officials be
given administrative sanctions for their land-use offenses; so far,
385 of them have received administrative discipline of various
kinds.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have stepped up efforts to combat illegal use
of land across the country, while the public has become more aware
of the importance of protecting land resources, said an official
with the law enforcement inspection bureau of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He blamed some local officials for misunderstanding the
relationship between economic development and legal use of land.
</P>
<P>
Many illegal land-use activities involved local governments, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 168,000 illegal land-use cases were
investigated, involving almost 29,000 hectares of land. The
authorities handled over 150,000 cases, dismantled illegal
buildings with a floor space of 25.65 million square meters, took
over illegal buildings with a floor space of nearly five million
square meters, and collected 550 million yuan in fines from the
officials responsible.

<HEADLINE> Israel Transfers Outpost to SLA Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army Tuesday transferred
an outpost in south Lebanon to its local militia ally ahead of a
planned Israeli troop withdrawal by July.
</P>
<P>
The Rotem outpost, in the western sector of the Israeli-occupied
security zone in south Lebanon, was handed over to the South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia "to enable SLA soldiers to better defend
the area close to their village," said the army in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al Nahar newspaper said U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has drawn up two priorities before the Israeli withdrawal,
namely, the disarmament and disbandment of the SLA militia and the
release by Israel of some 120 Lebanese prisoners in the Khiam
prison.
</P>
<P>
However, local radio reports said Israeli Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh said Monday the SLA might not be disbanded
after all.
</P>
<P>
"A security vacuum will occur after the Israeli withdrawal. If
no side is available to fill this vacuum, Israel may opt to let the
SLA fill it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced to withdraw from the border strip in south
Lebanon by July, thus ending its 22-year-long occupation there.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli forces and their
allies SLA from the country.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and trained by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol the 15-kilometer-deep zone which it carved out in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its north from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Flies to Mauritius for Regional Group Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
flew to Port Louis, Mauritius, on Tuesday at the head of his
country's delegation to meetings of the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Moussa will represent President Hosni Mubarak at the fifth
three-day summit of the COMESA on Wednesday, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported, adding he will take part in ministerial
meetings prior to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming COMESA summit is important as it will prepare
for an extraordinary summit on October 31, in which a free trade
area will be declared among the group's members, the news agency
quoted Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ali Hassan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has 21 members with 380 million people and a combined
gross domestic product of 165 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. Inter-
COMESA trade stood at 2.5 billion dollars that year, compared to
834 million dollars in 1985. It is expected to reach 4 billion
dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's summit will look into different aspects of the
group's economic situation, including trade, investment, customs,
infrastructure, communications, and maritime, air and land
transportation, Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said upon departure that during his trip, he will convey
Mubarak's greetings to Mauritian President Cassam Uteem and deliver
a message from Mubarak to Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam.
</P>
<P>
Egypt joined the COMESA in 1998. It will host a summit of the
group in 2001, according to the news agency.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Cambodia to Continue Reform Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government has to make
more efforts to continue its reform process though it has made
some progress, the new IMF resident representative to Cambodia
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his first meeting with the media since he took office
several months ago, Mario De Zamaroczy briefed the reporters on
the development of the progress in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He said since the office was established here, especially after
the general election in 1998, the IMF office conceded that
Cambodia has made much progress in general reform, such as in
forestry sector,military demobilization, corruption and poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
The government already started the pilot demobilization in four
provinces recently and some 31,500 soldiers will be retired by the
end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
"But what we are still concern right now is the poverty
reduction,"he said, asking the Cambodian government to make more
efforts to continue to improve it and implement all the reform
smoothly. At the same time, he said that Cambodia needs to take
critical actions to enhance the banking system and to fight
against the money laundry.
</P>
<P>
He believed Cambodian government will get a proper amount of
aid at the forthcoming annual conference of aid donors in Paris in
which Cambodia will request some 500 million U.S. dollar for next
year.
</P>
<P>
Mario De Zamaroczy also said that the IMF was not happy with
the illegal logging in 1997, but now "the situation is much better
compared with that of 1997 and 1998." However, he urged Cambodia
to adopt forestry law to ban the illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
IMF first opened its office in Cambodia in 1994, but it was
closed in July 1997 when factional fighting was erupted in Phnom
Penh. And it reopened in October 27, 1999.

hit by the market's recent weakness, saw some recovery and the

<HEADLINE> Environmental Security A National Mission: Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have to balance progress and consumption with conservation
of forces," Vajpayee said inaugurating a two-day conference of
state environment and forest ministers.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the devastation wrought by the drought in several
parts of the country this year and the super-cyclone that ravaged
the eastern coastal state of Orissa last October, Vajpayee said
these natural calamities resulted from flawed development
strategies that, in the name of development and modernity, had
destroyed traditional life-sustaining structures and systems for
short-term gains, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of environmental conservation is brought home
with unerring effect every time we face a calamity or natural
disaster," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though government had been trying to synergize economic
development with environmental resources, a lot more needed to be
done with people's participation, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is only when we give people a direct stake in protecting
the environment -- be it watershed management, forest conservation
or pollution control -- that they will become active partners of
Government," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Telecom Records Bigger Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Telecommunication
Company Limited (PTCL) recorded an increase of 46.5 percent in pre-
tax profit in the nine months of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to information gathered from the Karachi Stock
Exchange, the PTCL's profit before tax mounted to 17.93 billion
rupees (3,381 million U.S. dollars) in July-March from the 12.24
billion rupees (2,309 million dollars) for the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Total revenue of the company, which owns all the telecom
business in Pakistan, during the period stood at 42.91 billion
rupees (8,096 million dollars) as compared with 37.96 billion
rupees (7,162 million dollars) a year ago, showing an improvement
of 13.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The performance was especially encouraging, the company said,
as there was a further 15 percent cut in long distance charges
during the period.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth in total revenue was offset by the increase
in operating cost of 4.8 percent due to normal inflationary
factors.

<HEADLINE> Oil Import Bill Doubles in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's expenditure on
petroleum imports in the first 10 months of the current fiscal
year almost doubled to reach 2.17 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Pakistan's Federal Bureau of
Statistics Tuesday, import value of crude oil and petroleum
products during July-April was 93.3 percent higher than that of
the corresponding period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Oil imports accounted for 26.1 percent of the country's total
import in the first 10 months the current fiscal year, while the
figure was only 15.0 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The sharp expansion of import value is attributed not only to
an 11.6 percent increase in volume of imported petroleum, but also
to the rapidly-rallying oil prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Although the import of crude oil is shown to have decreased by
3.2 percent in volume, the import bill went up by 85.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a conventional oil importer, Pakistan relies on foreign oil
to bridge the gap between its stagnant petroleum output and its
increasing oil consumption.

<HEADLINE> Fresh fighting Erupts in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Fresh intense fighting between
Tamil Tiger rebels and Sri Lankan troops has erupted and continued
until early on Tuesday in the northern Jaffna peninsula after a
three-day lull, a government statement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched
an attack Monday evening on army positions about four kilometers
southeast of Jaffna city, the government's Special Media
Information Center said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
At least 46 combatants - 40 rebels and six government soldiers -
have been killed in the fighting, said the statement, adding that
the rebels fired a barrage of artillery and mortar fire at
government troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, fighting for a separate homeland for the Tamil
minority in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, began a
lightning advance on Jaffna on April 22 after overrunning the key
Elephant Pass causeway that links the northern peninsula with the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The military situation had been quiet since last Friday after
LTTE positions were subdued by a series of air raids, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE radio said a new offensive had begun and called on
civilians to move out of Jaffna city. The rebels claimed they are
on the edges of Jaffna, the center of Tamil culture, which the
army captured in 1995 after it had been under LTTE control for
nearly five years.

ROME, May 16 (Xinhua) -- AC Milan vice president Adriano
Galliai confirmed on Tuesday that German international striker
Oliver Bierhoff will be staying with the club next season.

There had been widespread speculation that Bierhoff, who will
lead Germany's attack in the Euro 2000 finals in June,would be
sold by Milan after a largely disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
"Oliver is a key member of the squad here at Milan and he must
stay calm and focused. Galliai said. "I told him to his face

<HEADLINE> Tung Extends Appointment of Secretary for Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
Tuesday said that he had invited Miss Elise Leung to stay on as
the Secretary for Justice for another two years until June 2002.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that following the reunification, the successful
implementation of 'One Country, Two Systems' and Hong Kong's
ability to maintain the rule of law are being recognized both in
Hong Kong and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he said, under the new constitutional framework, to
maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and to implement 'One
Country, Two Systems', the job of the Secretary for Justice is a
highly sensitive and challenging one.
</P>
<P>
"As my principal legal adviser, the Secretary for Justice has
provided very important legal advice on a wide range of issues, in
particular in connection with the Basic Law and the relationship
between the Mainland legal system and the Hong Kong legal system,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung added that the Secretary for Justice has provided
excellent leadership in guiding the Department of Justice to
firmly protect the rule of law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In both respects, the Secretary for Justice has performed very
well. "My colleagues and I, and Members of the Executive Council,
are delighted that the Secretary for Justice can continue to serve
Hong Kong together with us in the days and years ahead, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The current appointment of the Secretary for Justice expires on
June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Miss Elise Leung also told a media session Tuesday that she was
honored by the invitation of the Chief Executive for her to stay
on as the Secretary for Justice for another two years until June
2002.
</P>
<P>
"As a person born and brought up in Hong Kong, I feel the
obligation to serve the community," Leung said. "So when Tung
asked me to stay on for another two more years, I am pleased to
accept."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank members of the Executive and Legislative
Councils and the administration, particularly my colleagues of the
Department of Justice and the public, for their encouragement and
support during the past three years, and I believe I can count on
them for their continued support," Leung said.

<HEADLINE> HK Unveils New Blueprint for Railway Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A new blueprint for railway
development for Hong Kong up to 2016, "Railway Development
Strategy 2000", was unveiled here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that Hong Kong will continue to
invest to expand the railway network after the six railway lines
now under way are completed in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Strategy maps out a blueprint for planning and
implementing the next phase of railway expansion program for
completion between 2008 and 2016.
</P>
<P>
This will help provide the Hong Kong public with convenient
access to the railway system and much faster and reliable travel
throughout Hong Kong, reducing their reliance on road-based
transport, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The railway expansion program will increase the current railway
network by at least 70 percent to over 250 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the residents and 80 percent of the
employment will then be within walking distance from the railway
stations. The rail share in the public transport patronage will
increase to about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investment in this new phase of railway expansion amounts to
some 80 billion HK dollars (about 10 billion U.S. dollars) to 100
billion HK dollars (12.8 billion U.S. dollars) at today's prices,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Not Qualified to Participate in WHO Activities: Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- As a province of China, Taiwan is
not qualified to participate in World Health Organization (WHO)
activities, nor is it in any position to attend the World Health
Assembly (WHA) in whatever name, a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the remark at a regular press
conference in response to a question requesting comment on the
53rd WHA's rejection of the request by Honduras and some other
countries of making a supplementary item on the Assembly's agenda
their proposal of "inviting the Republic of China (Taiwan) to
attend the WHA as an observer".
</P>
<P>
Zhang said on May 15, the 53rd WHA decided by consensus not to
include in the agenda of the assembly the proposal by a small
number of countries like Honduras of "inviting the Republic of
China (Taiwan) to attend the World Health Session as an observer",
which once again frustrated the attempt by the Taiwan authorities
to get into the WHO.
</P>
<P>
WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations, Zhang said.
Only sovereign states are entitled to become its members and to
participate in its activities. As a province of China, Taiwan is
not qualified to participate in WHO activities, nor is it in any
position to attend the WHA in whatever name, she said.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the proposal of "inviting the Republic of China
(Taiwan) to attend the WHA" is an attempt to create in the world "
two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", she said.
</P>
<P>
This has violated the relevant resolutions of the United
Nations General Assembly or the WHA and basic norms governing
international laws, the spokeswoman said. The Chinese Government
and people are firmly opposed to this.
</P>
<P>
The question of Taiwan is an internal affair of China, Zhang
said. No foreign countries have the right to interfere, said Zhang.
The Chinese Government resolutely opposes political activities by
any person to split the motherland under the pretext of public
health and other issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the just cause of the Chinese Government
and people of safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial
integrity will continue to enjoy understanding and support of
countries and peoples in the world that uphold justice," Zhang
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Crude Oil Imports Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's crude oil imports in the
first four months of the year more than doubled the figure for the
same period of 1999, according to the General Administration of
Customs.
</P>
<P>
China imported a total of 22.72 million tons of crude oil
between January and April, up 120 percent from the same period
last year. The imports cost China 4.33 billion U.S. dollars, up
360 percent, due to the price rise of crude oil in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China imported 5.36 million tons of refined oil
products, down 22.1 percent. But the expenditure for the imports
grew 35.4 percent, to 980 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The amount of imported liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) reached 1.
56 million tons, down nine percent. The cost was 460 million U.S.
dollars, up 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rose markedly since early last year, from about 10 U.
S. dollars per barrel in January last year to the highest level of
34 U.S. dollars per barrel this year -- the record figure in the
past ten years.
</P>
<P>
As a leading oil producer, China has ranked fifth in the world
in the past 13 years in terms of oil output. But it became a net
oil importer in 1993, and imported about 40 million tons of crude
oil last year.
</P>
<P>
China produced 160 million tons of crude oil in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's New Leader Urged to Recognize One-China Principle (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency published a
commentary today making it clear that the new leader of Taiwan
must recognize the One-China principle if tensions are to be eased
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, titled "The Only Way-Out for Relaxing the Cross-
Straits Ties," stresses that the One-Chine principle must be
followed in dealing with cross-straits affairs, particularly the
cross-straits talks before the reunification, insisting that there
is only one China in the world, and that China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
The One-China principle was shaped out of the struggles of the
Chinese people to protect national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The retreat of the Kuomintang Regime to Taiwan in 1949 didn't
change the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and
that the recent change of Taiwan's leader in no way means that the
One-China principle can be denied or that Taiwan independence can
be advocated.
</P>
<P>
No one should attempt to deny the truth that Taiwan is a sacred
and inalienable part of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The One-China principle is a political reality of the cross-
straits relations, which has been widely recognized by the
international community. The ultimate goal for developing the
cross-straits ties and holding cross-straits talks is the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Without the recognition of the One-China principle, cross-
straits negotiations are pointless, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's New Leader Urged to Recognize One-China Principle (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary reiterates the mainland's stance that everything
is negotiable within the framework of the One-China principle.
</P>
<P>
If the new leader of Taiwan is truly concerned about the fate
of the 23 million people in Taiwan, he should recognize the One-
China principle, because denial of the principle and advocacy for
Taiwan independence will end in catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The commentary criticizes separatists like Lee Teng-hui and
Annette Lu for their venomous reaction to the call for adherence
to the One-China principle, and for lying to the Chinese people
about the situation.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has never called Taiwan a "renegade province" and
has repeatedly stressed that the cross-straits negotiation will
not be one between the central government and a local government,
it will be an equal negotiation under the One-China principle.
</P>
<P>
The One-China principle is the force behind the decades-long
peace across the straits, the booming cross-straits exchanges in
the past ten years, and the talks between the mainland's
Association for the Relations across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan
's Straits Exchange Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that the One-China principle has once
clearly recognized by the Taiwan authorities and the evidence is
that this principle was clearly written in a document on the
reunification of the motherland by the Taiwan Authorities in
November 1991. Therefore, the commentary says, the One-China
principle is not imposed on the Taiwan authorities by the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Aliens with Filipino Lineage Urged for Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of Immigration
Tuesday urged foreigners whose fathers or mothers are Filipinos to
immediately secure a certificate of recognition as Filipinos from
the bureau so they may enjoy the benefits and privileges of
Philippine citizenship without losing their foreign nationality.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Commissioner Rufus Rodriguez said not too many
aliens with Filipino lineage are aware that the Constitution now
recognizes them as Filipinos, regardless of their birthplace or
foreign citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said this principle was laid down by the Supreme
Court in its 1999 decision, which ruled that some foreigners may
acquire dual citizenship by reason of their birth to a Filipino
father or mother.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez explained that unlike the 1935 Constitution which
granted Philippine citizenship only to persons born to Filipino
fathers, both the 1973 and 1987 charters define a Filipino citizen
as those whose father or mother is a Filipino at the time of their
birth.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the 1935 charter "discriminated" against
persons with Filipino mothers as they were then required or given
the option to elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching 21 years
of age.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he understood why foreigners with Filipino roots
were hesitant to apply for recognition as Filipinos because of
their unfounded fears that they might lose their foreign
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
He assured them that they will remain foreign citizenship,
since their being Filipinos is a result of their involuntary act.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Parliamentary Election Set For June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe
Monday slated the country's new parliamentary elections for June
24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
The proclamation, published in a government gazette, ended
months of speculation that the polls may be further put off.
</P>
<P>
The elections are to choose 120 parliamentarians, who together
with eight provincial governors, 10 chiefs and 12 non-constituency
parliament members appointed by the president, will constitute the
southern African country's new parliament.
</P>
<P>
The real fight in the coming polls is expected to be between
the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
(ZANU-PF) and labour-backed Movement for Democratic Change (MDC),
said analysts.
</P>
<P>
There are about 30 political parties in the country. More than
five million people out of its population of 12.5 million have
registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
The ZANU-PF currently has 147 of the 150 seats of the
parliament, which has a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
The run-up to the elections has seen an increase of violence
between the ruling party and opposition supporters. At least 19
people have been reportedly killed in the clashes around the
polls, and between the white farmers and back peasants.
</P>
<P>
International observers had started arriving in the country on
Monday for the pre-election monitoring exercises, reports said.

<P>
Nigeria-led-and-commanded ECOMOG, replaced by the United
Nations peacekeeping forces earlier this year under the 1999 Lome
Peace Accord, has played a leading role in restoring the Kabbah
government outed by the Revolutionary United Front(RUF) rebels led
by Foday Sankoh in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming meeting came after the decision by the
emergency ECOWAS' s mini-summit over Sierra Leone last week in
Abuja, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Liberia, Mali
and Nigeria, members of the Joint Implementation committee for the
Lome Peace Accord, were directed by the summit to convene the
proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone has caught the attention of international
community in the past two weeks since the early May abduction of
about 500 UN peacekeepers by the RUF rebels.

<HEADLINE> Former Olympian Says Gosper Blows Chance to Head IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Kevan Gosper's Torch relay
controversy has demolished Australia's chance to head the
International Olympic Committee, former Olympic marathoner Rob de
Castella wrote Tuesday in his weekly newspaper column in the
Canberra Times.
</P>
<P>
De Castella, the former world record holder in the marathon,
said Gosper, the current IOC vice-president, had shown a lack of
judgment in allowing his daughter Sophie to become the first
Australian to run with the Olympic torch in Greece, rather than
Melbourne schoolgirl Yianna Souleles.
</P>
<P>
He said Gosper had thrown away one of the most important
opportunities provided by the Sydney Olympics by demonstrating he
was too flawed to take over from Juan Antonio Samaranch as IOC
president.
</P>
<P>
"The worst outcome of this is that we have lost the best chance
we had of seeing an Australian head the IOC," said de Castella,
winner of the 1986 Boston Marathon,
</P>
<P>
Gosper was among the favorites to replace Samaranch provided he
could survive the IOC inquiry into irregularities in the Salt Lake
City's Winter Games bid. Gosper was cleared Monday of any
impropriety.
</P>
<P>
"No longer _ the events of the past few days have demonstrated
quite clearly that Gosper is flawed," de Castella said.
</P>
<P>
"He has faults which might be forgiven in a lesser official,
but not in one who bids for the most important position in world
sport."

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Check Up on Law on Rural Industries in Eastern Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of legislators from the
National People's Congress (NPC) are spending a week in eastern
Zhejiang Province to see first-hand how well the Law on Township
Enterprises is working.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, led by Yang Zhenhuai, a member of the NPC
Standing Committee and vice-chairman of the NPC committee of
agriculture and rural affairs, want to know if the operations of
village-based industries have indeed been standardized and if the
sector is developing in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such group sent by the NPC Standing Committee
to review the enforcement of the law since it was put into effect
on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Deputy governor Zhang Mengjin today briefed the group on the
implementation of the law in Zhejiang, and also explained his
position on the revision of the law.
</P>
<P>
The province has 1.03 million township companies, with fixed
assets totaling 497.7 billion yuan. They employ 8.13 million, or
39 percent of the province's rural labor force.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, rural enterprises in Zhejiang led the country in
totals for gross product, sales, profits and taxes. Rural
industries contributed 84 percent of the province's entire
industrial economy and over 60 percent of the income of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers get nearly 50 percent of their earnings from
these enterprises. By the end of 1999, 96 percent of local
township factories had been turned into joint stock companies.
</P>
<P>
Local economists here praise local township industries for
their efforts to integrate the modern corporate system with their
old-fashioned practices, for emphasizing the role of technology,
and for stressing quality control in production.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have developed rapidly in the past 20
years, especially since the law was adopted three year ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had about 20.71 million township
enterprises, with more than 127 million employees, and the rural
firms accounted for almost one-third of the country's total gross
domestic product for 1999.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Save Valuable Relics From Drowning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Culture Minister Istemihan
Talay has authorized archaeologists to conduct an emergency
excavation in Belkis Zeugma, a Roman Ruin in southern Gaziantep
called a "second Pompeii."
</P>
<P>
The area, rich in cultural heritage and located near the
Euphrates River, will be soon flooded as the Birecik Dam, part of
the government's ambitious plans to generate electric power and
irrigate vast areas of dry land, has been constructed across the
river.
</P>
<P>
Talay said that excavation works will now start in Belkis
Zeugma, the ancient city and legion base of Rome, adding highly
valuable mosaics, archive records and the statue of Mars, the God
of war, have already been found in preliminary digging.
</P>
<P>
There were more historical pieces in the second and third layers
of the dam. Talay said that "not only the areas where the water of
the Birecik Dam will rise but also the predetermined areas in and
around Belkis Zeugma will have to be excavated and presented to the
world."
</P>
<P>
The pieces dug out in Belkis Zeugma will be moved to Gaziantep
and reconstructed there. "These pieces will be exhibited in
Gaziantep. A building being constructed near the archaeological
museum of Gaziantep will be completed immediately and turned into a
Mosaic museum," Talay said.
</P>
<P>
He described the archaeological works made in Belkis Zeugma as
only the tip of an iceberg, saying that further excavation works
will reveal a rich civilization.
</P>
<P>
The pieces, stolen from the same area currently on display in
the U.S. Houston Museum, will be returned to Turkey at the end of
June, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the site of numerous ancient Greek and Roman cities,
boasts of antiquities that are among the finest and most abundant
in the world.

<HEADLINE> Tung Extends Appointment of Secretary for Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
Tuesday said that he had invited Miss Elise Leung to stay on as
the Secretary for Justice for another two years until June 2002.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that following the reunification, the successful
implementation of 'One Country, Two Systems' and our ability to
maintain the rule of law are being recognized both in Hong Kong
and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he said, under the new constitutional framework, to
maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and to implement 'One
Country, Two Systems', the job of the Secretary for Justice is a
highly sensitive and challenging one.
</P>
<P>
"As my principal legal adviser, the Secretary for Justice has
provided very important legal advice on a wide range of issues, in
particular in connection with the Basic Law and the relationship
between the Mainland legal system and the Hong Kong legal system,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung added that the Secretary for Justice has provided
excellent leadership in guiding the Department of Justice to
firmly protect the rule of law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In both respects, the Secretary for Justice has performed very
well. "My colleagues and I, and Members of the Executive Council,
are delighted that the Secretary for Justice can continue to serve
Hong Kong together with us in the days and years ahead, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The current appointment of the Secretary for Justice expires on
June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Miss Elise Leung also told a media session Tuesday that she was
honored by the invitation of the Chief Executive for her to stay
on as the Secretary for Justice for another two years until June
2002.
</P>
<P>
"As a person born and brought up in Hong Kong, I feel the
obligation to serve the community," Leung said. "So when Tung
asked me to stay on for another two more years, I am pleased to
accept."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank members of the Executive and Legislative
Councils and the administration, particularly my colleagues of the
Department of Justice and the public, for their encouragement and
support during the past three years, and I believe I can count on
them for their continued support," Leung said.

Malaysia would have 3.91 million Internet users by 2004, out of
which 1.6 million users are expected to be potential purchasers

confidence in the increased usage of the Internet for business
purpose in line with the progress made in the Internet security
technology as well as the continued support from the government
towards the use of Internet,she said.
</P>
<P>
Internet users are estimated to stand at 1.89 million for 2000.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Tory Party Cuts Labor's Lead in Opinion Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labour Party's lead
over the opposition Conservatives has fallen to just seven
percentage points -- the smallest since the general election in
1997, according to an ICM poll for The Guardian newspaper
published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll results put Labour support down four percentage points
at 41 percent, the Tories up two at 34 and the Liberal Democrats
up three on 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ICM poll also shows that most of the cabinet big-hitters
have suffered sharp falls in their popularity in the last month.
</P>
<P>
The poll is the third one in a week to register a sharp drop in
Labour's support in the wake of the local election losses and the
election of Ken Livngstone as the mayor of London.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe that Conservative leader William
Hague's tough talks on asylum and law and order lie behind
Labour's drop in the polls.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the four years of "flatlinging" during
which the Tories' poll rating has wavered only a point or two
around the 30 percent mark may be over.

Jiangsu. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
A master of Russian, English, Japanese and French, he
translated a number of foreign literary works into Chinese, mostly
Russian masterpieces such as poem collections of Alexander Pushkin
and Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky.

He won the Pushkin Prize, Russia's top literature award named
after Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in 1987 and was given a
friendship medal by the Russian government in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The translator donated his private collection of 20,000 books
to the Nanjing Library. With the premium from the Jiangsu
government, he established one of China's two translation
foundations in 1987.
</P>
<P>
He asked his wife, Liang Peilan, to donate his body to a

CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's Food Industries Chamber urged the government to levy
more duties on the processed agricultural products imported from
Europe before signing the Egyptian-European partnership agreement.
Chief of the Chamber Balygh Sabry said the Egyptian products will
not get benefit from that agreement, on the contrary, the European
side is still levying more duties on the Egyptian foodstuffs in a
way that gives the European products more competitiveness in the
Egyptian market.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Health and Population Ismail Sallam said
his ministry will not increase the insulin price. He warned
pharmacists against raising its price and promised to reconsider
the ministry's plan for distribution.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The first exhibition of Egyptian Coptic antiquities opened in
Paris on Monday. Held at the Arab World Institute in Paris, the
exhibition comprises 320 pieces of antiquities tracing the life of
Copts in Egypt since the Roman era and up to the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Monday praised
Israel's decision to hand over three Arab villages close to
Jerusalem to Palestinian control, but said it will be unwise to
consider this as a last step on the Israeli side. "This positive
step should be followed by more confidence-building measures to
restore momentum to the peace process which is affected by every
delay," he said, adding that the issue of Jerusalem is yet to be
settled through negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sees Huge Distribution Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey ranks the fifth in the list of
countries with the most unequal income distribution in the world.
A World Bank report indicates that Turkey has the highest
percentage of unequal income distribution after Brazil, South
Africa, Chile and Mexico. In other words, Turkey has the worst
income distribution in Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Brazil, a country with the richest 20 percent of
the population earning 64.2 percent of total national income and
the poorest 20 percent claiming only 2.5 percent of the total
income, the report said, Turkey is actually not very different from
the largest South American state.
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, the richest 20 percent make 54.9 percent of the total
income and the poorest make a mere 4.9 percent of income, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Bank deposits are another indication of the large gap between
Turkey's rich and poor. A total of 76.7 percent of all savings
deposited in banks are owned by 2.9 percent of bank customers.
</P>
<P>
Inequality between regions is a striking factor in income
distribution differences. Fifty percent of all the savings in
Turkey are deposited in the northwestern Marmara region. If
Turkey's other more wealthy Aegean and northern central Anatolian
regions are included, this increases to 83.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has a land-mass of nearly 780,000 square
kilometers with a population of 65 million, has been listed as the
16th biggest economy among the more than 180 countries in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Veterans Leader Urges to End Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Leader of Zimbabwe's war
veterans Chenjerai Hunzvi Monday urged the white farmers and
former freedom fighters to work together to end the violence over
land disputes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing war veterans and some villagers, Hunzvi said "it is
wrong for anyone to think that only the whites are being affected
by the violence. It is affecting the blacks as well."
</P>
<P>
He blasted the foreign media, at the headquarters of the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) in the
country's capital Harare, for painting a one-sided picture in
favor of the whites.
</P>
<P>
He said there were 10 people had also been beaten up by the
white farmers.
</P>
<P>
"If the whites attack us, we retaliate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have since this February occupied
about 1, 000 white farms, causing violence around the country.
Several white farmers have been killed and many injured in the
violence.
</P>
<P>
But delegates of the two sides have been touring all invaded
farms throughout the country recently to seek an end to the
violence.

<HEADLINE> Mobiles to Overtake Fixed Phones in Africa: Kenyan Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Mobiles will overtake fixed phone
lines as Africa's major telecommunication tools within the coming
five years, a senior African Telecommunications Union (ATU)
official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation Tuesday quoted ATU Secretary-General Jan Mutai
as saying that African mobile networks were progressively making
up the core of the communications network as the charges fell,
forcing fixed lines to become a "value added services" network.
</P>
<P>
"With reduced mobile tariffs, people are migrating in large
numbers from fixed telecom providers who only connect places.
Thus it will not be long, say three to five years, before mobile
lines overtake fixed lines," Mutai said Monday here shortly after
the 10th Telecoms 2000 East Africa Exhibition held between May 10
to 13.
</P>
<P>
"The focus on Africa is to work on the mobile industry and
attract more investment. If we were planning our future in
Africa, it should be mobile. It will be cheaper for everybody,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
African Telecommunications Union is a partnership between
African governments and the information and communications
technology industry. It was set up by the Organization of African
Unity in 1977 as a specialized agency to develop
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Just two percent of Africans have phones. About 60 billion U.S.
dollars would be required to add the extra 60 million lines
needed to bring that level up to the global average of 10
percent, according to the telecommunications union.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Journalist Pleads Guilty to Rwandan Genocide Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) - A Belgian-born journalist and
broadcaster of Rwandan Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines
George Ruggiu has pleaded guilty to two counts of genocide charges
after the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)
accepted his change of plea. According to a press release reached
here on Tuesday from the ICTR, which is based in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha, Ruggiu is accused of direct and public
incitement and crimes against humanity through his radio
broadcasts in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The first count charges him with directly and publicly inciting
the killing and causing of serious bodily and mental harm to
members of the Tutsi population with the intention of destroying
them in whole or in part.
</P>
<P>
The second count charges him with crimes against humanity for
having persecuted Tutsis, moderate Hutus and Belgians on political
and racial grounds.
</P>
<P>
He has pleaded not guilty to the same charges when he made his
initial appearance before the tribunal in October, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Following the plea and briefs by the Prosecution and Defense,
the trial chamber ruled that judgement will be delivered on 1,
June 2000. The 43-year-old Ruggiu asked for forgiveness and
pardon and promised to cooperate with the tribunal, saying he is
ready to testify on the horrors of genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte asked the chamber to impose a
sentence of 20 years in prison to the accused.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiu becomes the first accused to change his plea to guilty
and the third to plead guilty before the tribunal after the former
Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda and militiaman Omar Serushago
who were sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 years in prison
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In the worst violence to grip the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
nearly four years, at least four Palestinians were killed Monday
and more than 320 were injured in protests marking the Naqba
(Catastrophe).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five IDF soldiers and border policemen suffered
gunshot wounds in exchanges of fire with Palestinian police, while
another nine Israeli security personnel were wounded by stones and
firebombs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expressed concern about the unrest, with State
Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said it is clear Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat is facing "difficulties" in containing
disorder, but that his commitment to making peace is still strong.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Arafat Monday night
to inform him of the Knesset vote approving the transfer of three
villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem to full Palestinian control
and also to ask him to restrain his men, a Palestinian official
said.
</P>
<P>
Barak insisted the Palestinian National Authority take all
necessary steps to thwart such street violence and bloodletting,
saying that such a situation is untenable and should no recur under
any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Naqba protest marches were initially organized by several
Palestinian factions, with Arafat's Fatah movement taking the lead.
Israeli officials suggested that Arafat had intended nothing more
than a warning to Israel that delays in reaching a peace treaty are
dangerous, and that the demonstrations had spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Knesset (Parliament) Monday approved the transfer of
three Arab villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem - Abu Dis,
Azariya, and Swahara - to full Palestinian control. The vote was 56
to 48, with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
But Barak had to lean on support from the liberal Shinui Party
and from Arab parties that are not part of his coalition to pass
the measure. This was because opposition parties were joined by
parliamentarians from the National Religious party who voted
against the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak, however, announced that the handover will not be
implemented until there is a full investigation of the
circumstances that led to the outbreak of what has been the worst
violence in years in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A rally against the handover of the villages surrounding
Jerusalem to full Palestinian control attracted some 70,000 people
to Jerusalem's Zion Square Monday night, filling the streets in the
center of town.
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours after the Knesset authorized the withdrawal,
Likud head Ariel Sharon and Knesset members from nearly all the
parties in the opposition arrived in the square to demand support
for a nationwide campaign to try to prevent further withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time since the (1967) Six Day War that a
foreign army has reached the gates of Jerusalem, and this time it
had been brought there on a red carpet by a Jewish government in
Jerusalem," Sharon said to a crowd.

<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) - Globe Telecom has earmarked at least
27.3 million U.S. dollars this year for Philippines' Northern
Luzon to strengthen its digital leadership for its digital
cellular mobile service, a move that will greatly enhance the

</P>
<P>
Globe, a transnational cellular phone service giant, despite
having over 700,000 fixed telephone lines installed in different
parts of the country, only has barely 150,000 subscribers due to
poor economic conditions which make the service less affordable,
especially to the masses.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to continue its aggressive expansion pace
with heavy investments in mobile telecom equipment such as various
computerplatform that could provide additional value-added
services for the benefit of Globe's subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Globe is set to increase the number of telephone
switches to 17 from six to avoid network congestion as well as
almost double the number of cell sites from 650 last year to over
1,000 by yearend to ensure that calls could be sent and received
at least in major areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Funding will be generated internally and will be sourced from
suppliers credit, foreign and local loans.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't to Ensure No Harassment From MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government wants to
make sure the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) does not harass
government troops once it agrees with the MILF's offer of a
ceasefire,a senior military official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
National Secretary Orlando Mercado gave this reason in a radio
speech for the government's thorough study of the ceasefire
proposal.
</P>
<P>
"There are bunkers an trenches in the area that must be removed.
If the MILF retreat by a kilometer, they could still use the
trenches to harass our troops," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He said the MILF must provide details of its military actions,
as its initial ceasefire offer was not clear.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the MILF offered to move back from the highway in
exchange for a ceasefire from the government, but the government
response was cautious
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Mercado said the government troops' operations
to clear the Narciso Ramos Highway of MILF checkpoints will
continue.
</P>
<P>
"The operations will continue. You must remember that when the
MILF first called for a ceasefire, we told them to lay down their
arms and release their hostages," Mercado said.

<HEADLINE> Live Telecast of Operations Controversial in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The live telecast of surgical
operations, unheard of in China until recently, has stirred
controversy in Shanghai, China's leading industrial and commercial
city.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by local media shows that 39 percent
of the 500 respondents were against the practice, another 26
percent suggested that operations be videotaped for reference
purposes only, while the rest were in favor of the idea.
</P>
<P>
Gao Jigang, who watched his wife's three-hour operation on the
hospital's in-house TV, described the experience as "mental
torment," saying that it is unnecessary to broadcast surgery on TV.
</P>
<P>
Wu Mingxiang, a patient who has undergone several operations,
said that live telecast of operations violates the patients' right
to privacy.
</P>
<P>
A medical worker who opposes the live telecasts said that they
put undue pressure on the surgeons, adding that family members of
the patient may feel even more anxious if they see the operation
in progress.
</P>
<P>
Those who advocate videotaping operations for reference said it
would be best if medical personnel simply provided updates on the
progress of the surgery, rather than filming it live.
</P>
<P>
However, those who liked the idea said that live telecasts may
spur surgeons to do their best work and may also help spread
medical knowledge to the public.
</P>
<P>
They added that live telecasts should first be approved by the
patient and his or her family members and only be open to
specified viewers.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of hospitals in China have been televising
operations to help inform the public of medical techniques.
</P>
<P>
In a recent development, the Beijing Anzhen Hospital, which is
famous for its cardiovascular surgeries, aired live on the
Internet a heart bypass operation and a cardiac valve replacement
surgery performed on the same patient.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that live telecast of operations opens to public
scrutiny the quality of service in Chinese hospitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the early granting of Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) status by U.S. Congress to China "is conducive to
the healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations, as well as to the
growth of bilateral trade and the increase of U.S. investment in
China."
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in his meeting with Alexander Meigs Haig
Jr., former U.S. secretary of state and now senior consultant of
the U.S.-based United Technologies Corporation (UTC), and George
David, UTC's chairman and chief executive officer, as well as
other UTC executives.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for the efforts made by Haig
and UTC in promoting the China-U.S. relations. "A healthy and
stable China-U.S. relationship is in the fundamental interests of
the two peoples, and conducive to the peace and stability not only
in Asia-Pacific region but also in the whole world," Jiang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also reiterated Chinese government's principled stance of
"peaceful reunification," and "one country, two systems" on
resolving the Taiwan issue. The Chinese president also urged the U.
S. side to honor "with concrete actions" the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and relevant commitments the U.S. government has made.
</P>
<P>
Haig, who has visited China more than a dozen of times since
1972, said that he supports China's entry into the World Trade
Organization and granting China the PNTR status. He said he would
continue his efforts for the growth of China-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
Haig is here as guest of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries.

<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will display
its trove of newly-discovered relics during annual World Museum
Day, which falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has two million ancient artifacts resting in 112
museums -- more relics and museums than any other city in China,
results of a six-year survey show.
</P>
<P>
Among the items are a 2.25-meter stone gate from the Eastern
Han Dynasty (25-220 A.D.) and a 2.2-meter stone statue made more
than 1,600 years ago. Both pieces are in the Beijing Museum of
Stone Carvings.
</P>
<P>
Museums mushrooming all over Beijing have become both study
centers and tourist attractions, drawing more than 30 million
visitors annually -- fully one-fourth of all museum patrons
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In addition to some famous, comprehensive spots such as the
Palace Museum inside the Forbidden City, many museums specialize
on individual categories such as ancient coins and rare stones.
</P>
<P>
On World Museum Day, local residents can visit more than 300
exhibitions and participate in a series of symposiums on the
history of Beijing, protection of the ancient city and traditional
culture, said today's China Youth Daily.

<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- As part of its package of non-wage
benefits for workers, the Philippine government is pursuing a two-
pronged health plan that would ensure workers and their families
of quality health care, Philippine News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted President Joseph Estrada as saying earlier
that this two-pronged plan involves the setting up of health
facilities and mode drugstores that sell medicines at affordable
prices.
</P>
<P>
"We are setting up additional health facilities nationwide,
including health centers and district hospitals in different
municipalities to address the health needs of our workers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, the president unwrapped a package of non-wage
benefits for workers as his gift to the labor sector on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the president's non-wage benefits are packages
that provide workers with better terms for housing, livelihood
programs and health services.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also announced a scholarship package that would
guarantee the education of the workers' children.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the president ordered the Estrada Trust Fund to set
aside 100 million pesos (2.5 million U.S. dollars) as financial
assistance to initiatives by workers' groups and cooperatives.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: COMESA Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Currently, the sub-regional economic organization has 21
members: Angola, Burundi, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles, the Sudan,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
COMESA covers an area of 12.88 million square kilometers with a
 population of about 380 million.
</P>
<P>
The regional body had a total of gross domestic product (GDP)
of 155 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and the 1998 GDP was estimated
at 165 billion U.S. dollars, representing the nominal growth of
4.5 percent in 1997 and 3. 14 percent in 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's total exports in 1998 was estimated at 23.97 billion
U.S. dollars, with the total imports being 38.83 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Intra-COMESA trade in 1998 was estimated at about 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars, representing a growth rate of 20 percent every year
since the founding of the regional body. The trade with third
countries is growing at about 7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the total external debt of COMESA member states was
estimated at 130 billion U.S. dollars, which constitutes a heavy
burden on the social and economic development in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In the COMESA region, 60 percent of the land area is covered by
rivers and lakes. However, 90 percent of the arable land and 95
percent of the water resources still remains to be economically
exploited.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 4 percent of the energy potential of 700 billion
kilowatts from the numerous rivers and lakes in the region,
including the Congo, the Nile, the Zambezi, the Victoria, the Owen
Falls and Aswan, has been tapped.
</P>
<P>
Besides electricity generation, the water and lake resources
also have enormous potential for exploitation for water transport,
irrigation and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with huge mineral wealth, including 300 billion tons of
 phosphate, 105 billion tons of iron ore, 200 billion tons of
petroleum and large proven deposits of gas, uranium, nickel,
copper and cobalt, the region has a vast potential for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Songosongo gas reservoir in Tanzania, if fully
 exploited, can provide enough gas to meet the needs of the whole
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The enormous mineral potential can also be used to support
large-scale industries such as steel mills, fertilizer plants and
other factories to boost regional economy.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most attractive destinations for tourists, the
region boasts of many natural and man-made wonders of the world.
</P>
<P>
Just as Kenyan Minister Nicholas Biwott once said, the
resources and heritage in the region offer a diverse package for
tourist industry, with a guided tour of the ancient Egyptian
pyramids, a cruise down the Nile, a safari in the Masai Mara and
Serengenti game reserve bordering Kenya and Tanzania, a view of
the Gorillas in the lush Ruwenzori in Uganda and a visit to the
magnificent Victoria falls in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Overall Cancer Rates Drop in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The overall rates of incidence
of cancer as well as deaths from the disease declined between 1990
and 1997 in the United States, according to a report released on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, published in the May 15th issue of the journal
Cancer, was jointly conducted by scientists from the National
Cancer Institute (NCI), the American Cancer Society, the North
American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
</P>
<P>
The majority of the top 10 cancer sites showed declines from
1990 to 1997, said the scientists from the NCI, NAACCR and CDC
after analyzing cancer data between 1973 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Men showed declines in all sites combined, lung, colon/rectum,
prostate, pancreas, stomach and brain, while women experienced
declines in all sites combined, colon/rectum, breast, leukemia,
stomach and ovaries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The four leading cancer incidence and mortality sites in the U.
S. consisted of lung, prostate, female breast and colon/rectum,
according to the report. These four cancers accounted for more
than 50 percent of the cancer deaths in the U.S., it noted.
</P>
<P>
Except for the site of female breast, blacks had higher rates
of incidence than other races for all of these sites, and they
also had higher mortality rates from these cancers, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Although whites had lower incidence and mortality rates of
cancer than blacks for many sites, the report found that whites
had higher rates than Hispanics, Asian, Pacific Islanders and
American Indians/Alaska Natives.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drops Saccharin From Cancer List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal government
Monday dropped saccharin, an artificial sweetener, from its list
of cancer-causing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences (NIEHS) said Monday that new studies show "no clear
association" between saccharin and human cancer.
</P>
<P>
"Two decades ago, when saccharin was shown to produce bladder
tumors in rats, it was a prudent, protective step to consider the
sweetener to be a likely human carcinogen," said Dr. Kenneth Olden,
director of the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program.
</P>
<P>
Studies now show that laboratory rat bladder tumors once linked
to saccharin are known to be "not relevant to the human situation,
" Olden said, adding that decades of man-made saccharin use "
strengthen our confidence."
</P>
<P>
The action follows three years of new studies and scientific
reviews about the effects of saccharin, said the announcement,
which came with the release of the Ninth National Toxicology
Report on Carcinogens, an every-other-year listing of chemicals
that the federal agency believes cause, or possibly cause, cancer.
</P>
<P>
The report contains a total of 218 cancer-causing substances.
</P>
<P>
Formal additions to the list of "known human carcinogens"
include environmental tobacco smoke, directly inhaled tobacco
smoke, smokeless tobacco (such as snuff), alcoholic beverages, six
industrial chemicals and dyes.
</P>
<P>
Seven chemicals, including diesel exhaust particulates, were
added to the list of substances "reasonably anticipated to be
human carcinogens."

<HEADLINE> Business Skills Training Enjoys Big Market in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 15 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. corporations pay for
their employees to broaden their skills set, training vendors have
a lucrative opportunity to increase their revenues, the
International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S. market research firm,
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IDC estimates that U.S. corporate business skills training
market will more than double from 7.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1999
to almost 16.9 billion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The effects of a tight labor market, robust economy, and
dramatic improvements in technology, specifically technology-
delivered training, are combining to produce tremendous market
opportunity for business skills training providers, said the IDC.
</P>
<P>
The IDC holds that financial services, manufacturing,
professional services, retail and wholesale distribution,
transportation, communications and utilities industries are
attractive targets in particular for business skills training
providers.
</P>
<P>
But training vendors will need to make their content available
via Internet-enabled learning or e-learning, which can include
content delivery in multiple formats, management of the learning
experience and a networked community of learners, content
developers and experts, it pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China reached an agreement with
Norway on an environmental cooperation project Monday, Bringing
the Sino-foreign bilateral projects in environmental protection to
a total of fifteen this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, China had signed more than 30 bilateral
agreements or memorandum on environment protection with 27
countries, and agreements in the field of nuclear safety with more
than ten countries, according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The prevention of industrial pollution is one of the key areas
in the international cooperation, the paper quoted an official
from the State Environmental Protection Administration as saying.
China has introduced several groups of foreign fund and advanced
technology to promote the control on water pollution, sulfur
dioxide, exhausts of urban automobiles, and the construction of
environmental information system.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 cities will purchase whole sets of urban
atmospheric autonomous monitoring equipment, using money provided
by a Sino-U.S. environment cooperation project.
</P>
<P>
China has also strengthened international cooperation in the
protection of ecological environment. Last year, the Chinese and
Canadian governments launched a natural ecological protection
project in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to protect the
biological diversity. The project, which will be completed within
three years, will cost a total of five million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Milk Drinking Advocated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A representative of China's dairy
industry has urged countrymen to increase the consumption of milk
products for the sake of health.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huaibao, director-general of the council of the China
Dairy Industry Association (CDIA), said the drinking of more milk
by youngsters is vital to the improvement of overall health
conditions of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"Milk and Health of Young People" is the theme of today's
International Milk Day, which was launched by an international
federation of dairy industry in Germany in 1961, according to a "
Beijing Youth Daily" report.
</P>
<P>
But the annual event drew attention from Chinese only from last
year when ministries of health and agriculture reached an
agreement on developing the dairy industry while promoting milk
consumption.
</P>
<P>
At present, Chinese people still drink less milk than alcohol.
A CDIA report last year revealed that eight million tons of
spirits is produced in the country each year, compared with 7.4
million tons of milk.
</P>
<P>
On average Chinese consumes six kilograms of dairy products a
year, compared with 92.2 kg of the world's average, said Jiang
Jianping, vice chairman of the National Committee of Food and
Nutrition Counselings.
</P>
<P>
About half of the country's milk output is consumed by people
in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, said the CDIA report.

<HEADLINE> Smuggled Medicines Flood Bangladeshi Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Smuggled medicines from various
countries have become a potential threat to the existence of
domestic pharmaceutical industries, The New Nation newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to knowledgeable sources, smuggled medicines, worth
about 4 billion taka (77 million U.S. dollars), flood into
Bangladesh every year from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand
and Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
They said smuggled medicines which are cheaper than home
products are openly sold in city markets through unauthorized
medicine shops, adding that many of these medicines are either
spurious or sub-standard.
</P>
<P>
The number of unlicensed medicine shops, according to a rough
estimate, exceeds 70,000 as against the legal drug shops of nearly
30,000.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of proper surveillance and absence of a regular
vigilance system by the Department of Drug Administration, opening
of new medicine shops without obtaining drug licenses is going on
unabated.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Medical Industry Committee has said that only
119 of the over 200 pharmaceutical industries in the country
obtained membership.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that many of those non-members are producing sub-
standard medicines, carrying imprints and brand names of big
companies. Due to unknown reasons, the authorities never take any
action against them, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Ask Taliban to Extradite Fugitives: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
prepared a list of the Pakistanis, who after committing crimes
have taken refuge in Afghanistan, for visiting Afghan Taliban
Interior Minister Mulla Abdur Razaq Akhund, the Nation newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have collected information about the Pakistanis who have
taken shelter in Afghanistan. These people are involved in
criminal activities, especially terrorism and sectarian violence,"
a senior Pakistani official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the list would be provided to the Taliban minister who
would be asked to extradite these people to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also collected sufficient information about the
camps in Afghanistan where the Pakistanis, involved in terrorist
activities and sectarian violence, get training, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The extradition of Pakistani fugitives is believed to be one of
the issues to be discussed during the talks between Akhund and
Pakistani Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider that began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban minister, who is heading a eight-member
delegation on his five-day visit to Pakistan, has dismissed the
reports that Pakistani criminals had taken shelter in his country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the issues related to terrorism, repatriation of
Afghan refugees and Afghan transit trade are also expected to be
on the agenda of the talks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Govt, Opposition Fail to Agree on Poll Chief By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The government's initiative to bring
the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to a
dialogue table to reach a consensus on the appointment of a new
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) has finally failed due to the
changed attitude of Leader of the Opposition in Parliament and BNP
Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister S A M S Kibria Monday told BNP negotiator
Saifur Rahman that "there is no longer any scope for dialogue with
the opposition for nomination of a new CEC."
</P>
<P>
Kibria blamed Khaleda Zia for "destroying the atmosphere for a
dialogue" by making a public statement that she wanted the
appointment of a new CEC only after the government handed over
power to a caretaker administration.
</P>
<P>
Kibria then announced:" The prime minister (Sheikh Hasina)
would now nominate a CEC as per constitutional provisions."
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the leaders of the National Socialist
Party Monday, Hasina made it clear that her government is not a
caretaker government but an elected government of the people.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Khaleda asked the government not to look for a new
CEC but to resign immediately to pave the way for the appointment
of the CEC by a caretaker administration acceptable to all
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big public meeting at Kurigram, 400 kilometers
northwest of Dhaka, the opposition leader said that with the
resignation of CEC Abu Hena at the height of the demand of the
opposition alliance, it is proved that all elections held under
Abu Hena were not neutral.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda called on the people to further intensify the on-going
movement and expedite the fall of the government to end what she
said "autocratic rule, ruling party-sponsored terrorism, economic
mismanagement and corruption."
</P>
<P>
The crisis over the appointment of a new CEC arose following
the resignation of Abu Hena on May 8.
</P>
<P>
After his resignation, the initiative for discussion on the
appointment of a new CEC came from Hasina, who invited Khaleda for
talks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
They had exchanged four letters, which however produced no
positive result. Alongside the official communication, Kibria and
Saifur Rahman were trying to reach a consensus on the issue
through talks at the second layer of leaderships of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Teas Enjoy Indian Concession Despite Proposed Duty Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan teas will continue to
enjoy a 50 percent duty concession on the Indian customs duty
despite plans by India to more than double the prevailing duty,
the official Daily News Tuesday quoted diplomats as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Finance Ministry recently proposed a drastic
increase in the customs duty on tea "from the prevailing rate of
15 percent to the highest slab of 35 percent," the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commission (Embassy) officials in Colombo were
quoted as saying that the increase was in response to repeated
demands by the Indian tea trade for an increase in duty to prevent
cheap imported tea from flooding the market and to arrest the
falling Indian tea prices.
</P>
<P>
Under the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement, India has allowed
the import of 15 million kilograms of Sri Lankan teas a year with
customs duty at 7.5 percent. But this year's quota will be 11.25
million kilograms as exports started only from April.
</P>
<P>
Indian tea prices have been tumbling in recent weeks because of
market perceptions that cheap foreign teas will be available in
the India market as quantitative restrictions are to be removed
next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian High Commission officials said that until the
Indian Finance Ministry proposal is formally ratified by the
Indian Parliament, the basic import duty will remain at 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bad Loans Continue to Drop for 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of bad loans at banks
and finance companies in Thailand continued to drop in March, the
10 consecutive month-on-month decline, the Thai central bank said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bad loans fell to 37.2 percent of total loans at the end of
March, down from 38.1 percent in February, according to a
statement from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The pace of decline in bad loans will accelerate in the next
few months as the central bank plans to introduce new guidelines
to encourage more debt restructuring," said a central bank
director.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts pointed out that the current number of
bad loans still remains high enough to impede Thailand's effort to
clear its banking system.
</P>
<P>
While bad loans are declining in number as more companies
restructure their debt with creditors, new bad loans are emerging.
</P>
<P>
The statement from the central bank showed that in March, fresh
bad loans of 32.1 billion baht (900 million U.S. dollars) had
crept into the financial system.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine May Attend Peace-Keeping in Nagorno-Karabakh: FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine would like to join any peace-
keeping troops in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh area when there is
such a force, local press reports on Monday quoted Ukrainian
Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk as saying.
</P>
<P>
When meeting his visiting Azeri counterpart Vilayat Guliyev
here, Tarasyuk said the Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe (OSCE) and the related sides should determine the
necessity of peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk said that Ukraine will deal with the Nagorno-Karabakh
dispute according to the position of the United Nations and the
OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is an enclave in Azerbaijan populated mostly
by Armenians. Both Azerbaijan and Armenia claim sovereignty over
it, which led to an armed clash in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two foreign ministers also discussed
cooperation between the two countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and the possibility of setting up a free
trade area similar to the GUAM Group, which consists of Georgia,
Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma received Guliyev on Monday
and he expressed thanks for Azerbaijan's help in the Ukraine
agricultural field.
</P>
<P>
Guliyev, who arrived in Kiev Sunday, is the first Azeri foreign
minister to visit the Ukraine after its independence. He will
leave for Poland Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Stresses Importance of Legal System Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"China has done a large amount of work in recent years in
strengthening legal construction and has written 'governing
country according to law' into the Constitution and has formulated
initially a fundamental framework of socialist legal system," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noted that legal construction, similar to
the construction of democratic politics, is a goal, a means and a
procedure, which should go through a historic process of
continuous improvement along with economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Added up by the destruction of the "Cultural Revolution" and
the limitation of the backwardness of economic and cultural
development, the legal consciousness of the Chinese people is
still rather weak, Li said, adding that such phenomena as
replacing laws with officials' remarks and power happen from time
to time in the country.
</P>
<P>
Li reaffirmed that China will be built into a genuine
socialist country of legal administration through deepening
reforms and pushing forward democratic and legal construction.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Miguilena said that Venezuela has paid great
attention to the valuable experience of China in reforms and legal
construction.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here on Sunday evening for a two-day official
visit to Venezuela, also met with Vice President of Venezuela
Isaias Rodriguez on the same day, and the two leaders exchanged
views on how to boost economic and trade cooperation between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Seized in Myanmar's Kachin State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities seized 46,640
tablets of stimulant drugs last month in the country's northern
Kachin state, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was jointly made by the local intelligence unit and
the police force when they searched a house in Phakant township of
the state on April 28.
</P>
<P>
The seizure also included a jeep without license used in drug
trafficking, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Punishment is being given to four local drug traffickers
involved in the case, under the country's Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Law, the report added.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1999, Myanmar authorities
confiscated 28.75 million tablets of stimulant drugs in the
country along with 1,447.55 kilos of opium and 272.94 kilos of
heroin.
</P>
<P>
Since stimulant drugs were first found trafficked in Myanmar in
1996, the authorities have seized a total of 55.89 million tablets
of such drugs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that there were 86,537 narcotic drug

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Rules Out Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank, Bank
Indonesia, has ruled out any plans to raise interest rates or
engage in massive U.S. dollar-selling in an attempt to rescue the
ailing rupiah, national newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia deputy governor Miranda S. Goeltom said such
monetary measures would be meaningless because the main elements
behind the plunge in the value of the rupiah against the U.S.
dollar were "nonmonetary factors."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever monetary policies we can take such as increasing
interest rates or selling dollars will not be more effective than
eliminating the nonmonetary factors," she was quoted by the
newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Goeltom said she hoped there were efforts aimed at eliminating
them.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very dangerous if the nonmonetary factors
depreciated the rupiah too long because it would form a perception
that the trend is permanent while the fact is that it is only
temporary," she said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has continued to drop since early this month,
closing on Monday at 8,525 to 8,545 rupiah to the U.S. dollar,
compared to 8,380 rupiah late on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Goeltom said Bank Indonesia should not be carried away when the
market panicked because it would only cause the market to panic
even more.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remain calm and cautious, study the problem. In our
view, many nonmonetary factors are behind it," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted dealers as saying that domestic
political and economic uncertainty as well as plans by the U.S.
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates on Tuesday continued to
put pressure on the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate of the one-month Bank Indonesia promissory
note is currently at 10.91 percent. Some advisers said the central
bank should raise domestic interest rates to about 15 percent to
help strengthen and stabilize the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Goeltom said that even if the U.S. Federal Reserve did raise
its interest rates by 50 basis points, the central bank would not
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the important thing was to eliminate the
domestic political and economic uncertainty.

<HEADLINE> Poland on Highest Alert against Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A persistent drought and high
temperatures have caused an unusually high number of forest fires
in Poland, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Poland said last month's temperature, which reached levels of 4.
4 degrees centigrade higher than average, and several weeks of
extreme drought, reduced soil humidity in some forest areas to
zero.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show for the first two weeks of May, Poland had it
that the number of forest fires reported daily were 200, and last
Sunday recorded the worst day with 334 forest fires.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a total of 2,000 hectares of forest in Poland were
burned down by 3,500 forest fires in the first two weeks of May,
breaking the record of 2,106 set in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have placed the highest alert on half of the
country's forests and denied access to all tourists.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Economy Recovers Rapidly: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso described on Monday his country's macroeconomic
achievements as a victory.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which has seen an economic recession since the 1997
Asian crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crunch, has recovered
more quickly than other countries which also found it necessary to
devalue their currencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation regarding external accounts is currently in good
condition due to the expansion of exports, mainly in manufacturing,
and the decline in imports, Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
The country's total debt will decline throughout the year, in
part from the sale of government assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil received 90 billion U.S. dollars in investments during
the last five years, which enabled the country to better weather
turbulence in outside markets, "Because investments were long term
rather than speculative."
</P>
<P>
Brazil's economy is predicted to grow by 4 percent this year
compared with last year's, which remained near zero. Inflation is
expected to fall to 6 percent from about 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lower debt payments and strong foreign investments this year
will give Brazil a balance of payments surplus of 10 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade is also expected to generate a surplus of 5
billion dollars in 2000.

ZAGREB, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation
exported 131 million U.S. dollars' worth of goods during the first
quarter this year, up 41 percent from the same period last year,
the BHPRESS news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in exports, the federation suffered a
trade deficit of 407 million dollars in the three-month period, as
its import amounted to 538 million dollars, a rise of 8.7 percent
from a year ago, the news agency quoted figures from the
federation's statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federation's industrial output in April went up
by 3.8 percent from March and 6.4 percent from the same month last
year. The output, however, was equivalent to only 33.2 percent of
the average monthly industrial production before the 3.5 year
Bosnia war that started in April 1992.

WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Press International (
UPI) has been sold to News World Communications Inc., which will
continue to operate the news service as an independent news
organization, the companies announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 93-year-old news agency was sold by Worldwide News Inc., a
consortium of Saudi Arabian investors that had bought it in 1992
for about 4 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, News World Communications Inc. owns all the
major assets of UPI including its name and trademark, said Arnaud
de Borchgrave, who will remain UPI's chief executive officer. He
did not disclose the terms of the sale, but said the deal was
completed late Monday.
</P>
<P>
News World Communications, which owns The Washington Times and
other news outlets worldwide, said it would use the deal to
further develop UPI's new focus on providing news to Internet
sites and such services as video streaming. It also plans to boost
UPI's operation with new technologies and distribution practices.
</P>
<P>
UPI was sold in 1982 by the Scripps family. Before the current
deal, it went through two bankruptcy reorganizations and four
owners, the latest Worldwide News Inc.
</P>
<P>
The company got out of the broadcast news business last August.
It sold its contracts to provide news to more than 400 radio and
television stations to The Associated Press.

<P>
JI'NAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- World record holder and world
champion Chen Yan faltered in her specialty with a distant fifth
place finishing at the Chinese Olympic selection trails, and she
is now in doubt whether she can be selected in the Chinese Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
Chen clocked four minutes and 51.53 seconds in the 400 meters
individual medley, far away from the pace setter Liu Yin in 4:43.
17 and Zhou Yafei at 4:46.85.
</P>
<P>
Chen set the world record of 4 minutes 34.79 seconds at the
Chinese National Games in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We hope she can find her form in Sydney, but I am not sure,"
her coach Han Bingyan said. "We will wait for the outcome of the
selection, and then decide what to do next."
</P>
<P>
Chen, 19, has been plagued by stomach problems for years since
1998 after she crowned twice in both the 400m medley and 400m
freestyle at the World Swimming Championships in Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Chen competed in Asian Championships last month and won the
400m medley title in 4:46.09.

Though her result is 5 seconds slower than that in Asian
championships, Chen said: "According to my training, the result is
all right to me."

Han echoed:" The most important thing for her is to get
recovered."

WUHAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province has
issued a ban on logging in its primeval forest area called
Shennongjia, one third of which has already been demarcated as a
state-level nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Shengnongjia has a forest coverage rate of more than 70
percent and is known as a gene bank of various species with its
almost intact ecological conditions and rich resources including
more than 2,400 plants, 570 animals, 2,000 herbs and 800 flowers.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the issuance of the logging ban, the provincial
government launched a project in April aimed at dealing a hard
blow on destructive activities such as rampant exploitation of
forest resources and paving the way for the implementation of the
logging ban, according to the Provincial Deputy Governor Jia
Tianzeng.
</P>
<P>
The province also allocated about ten million yuan (about 1.2

<HEADLINE> Toshiba Under Fire for "Discrimination" Against Chinese Consumers ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese national, local as well as
on-line news media have been wedging a week-long battle against
Japanese electronic firm Toshiba, which refused to compensate
Chinese consumers as it did in the United States for a disk drive
flaw in its laptop computers that could cause data losses.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily (Overseas Edition), China Daily, China Youth
Daily, Beijing Daily and web edition of Xinhua News Agency all
splashed lengthy articles today to slash Toshiba for its no-
address policy toward Chinese users over its laptop glitch.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily said in a bold headline article that Toshiba
is "weird" to say that its compensation to US customers is to
avoid damage to its image if the case goes to court, while
refusing to reimburse Chinese buyers.
</P>
<P>
The China Daily quoted Toshiba as saying that they would not
compensate Chinese users as they had in the US because China does
not have as stringent consumer protection laws as the United
States.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing-based news website, 21DNN, broke the story on May 8,
and the news soon spread nationwide via the Internet. The China
News Service, Beijing TV and popular websites including Sohu.com,
Sina.com, Netease.com and eLong.com.cn have all covered this "

Lin Xiaobing, with Toshiba China, said in an interview with
China Youth Daily, that Toshiba denied that the "floppy disk
controller constitutes a problem or defect in Toshiba notebook" on
its US website, adding that "Toshiba is not aware of the instance
in which one of our users has experienced data loss or data
corruption."
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid possible lawsuits in the United States,
Toshiba agreed to compensate 1.05 billion US dollars to some 500,
000 consumers there.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the compensation is focused on US market and is
not a global-wide measure.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that Toshiba fears that "theoretically, the
computer bug could lead to data loss."
</P>
<P>
Law professor Dong Ansheng at Beijing's China People's
University said that according to Chinese law, producers have to
compensate consumers who can prove that damage has occurred when
using a product.
</P>
<P>
To date no cases of Chinese users losing data from their
Toshiba laptops has been reported.
</P>
<P>
But some people viewed the case from a different angle.
</P>
<P>
"Toshiba placed the news on a very prominent position on its US
website with a detailed compensation notice, while on its China
website there is only a vague announcement on the issue with just
a few words explaining the technical setback," said a report from
21DNN.

Resolution 1244 on Kosovo, which calls for a lasting peace in the
region, said reports reaching here from the Macedonian capital of
Skopje.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, Boris Trajkovski and his visiting Bulgarian
counterpart Peter Stoyanov said they are strongly opposed to the
violence in Kosovo and support efforts to facilitate the return of
non-Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, adopted on June 10 last year, demands full
respect for Yugoslav sovereignty and territorial integrity, the
full disarmament and disbanding of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and
the guarantee of security and safety for all ethnic groups in the
Serbian province. Violence, however, has marred its implementation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders agreed that their bilateral
cooperation should focus on economic, cultural and agricultural
areas, and on joint efforts in combating organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Nine bilateral cooperation accords and protocols were also
signed on the first day of Stoyanov's two-day visit Monday.

<HEADLINE> China's PC Sales Account For One-third of Asia-Pacific Market: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's personal computer(PC)
makers sold 1.37 million units in the first quarter this year,
accounting for 32.4 percent of the Asia-Pacific market, according
to an International Data Corp report.
</P>
<P>
"Government support has driven growth largely in key Asian
markets of China and South Korea. And this support has contributed
to the Asian-Pacific's sustained growth," Davina Yeo, senior
analyst at IDC Asia-Pacific, was quoted by today's China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
For the sixth consecutive quarter, region-wide PC markets grew
to new heights in the January-March period. PCs sold in the region
amounted to 4.24 million in the first quarter, surging 43 percent
on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Sales by China's leading PC producer Legend Group, the top
seller in the fourth quarter last year, were surpassed by Samsung
of the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Although Legend grew 122 percent over late 1999, unit shipments
dipped two percent to 360,600 for an 8.5-percent market share.
</P>
<P>
Samsung, now No.1 in the region, owes its success to its "
Academy Campaign," a program targeting at higher PC ownership
among students, according to IDC.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Needs Fund to Upgrade Highway Systems in Information Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To meet the challenges and competing in a global economy, said
the Road Information Program (TRIP), the United States needs an
additional 36 billion U.S. dollars a year at the federal, state
and local levels to relieve congestion, reduce traffic fatalities,
improve road and bridge conditions and maximize economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
The country's growing traffic congestion is making it
increasingly difficult for goods and services to be delivered on
time, TRIP said. One of the major reasons for worsening congestion,
according to the research group, is that between 1970 and 1998,
highway travel in the United States increased by 137 percent, and
population increased by 32 percent but new road mileage increased
by only five percent.
</P>
<P>
"We need about 36 billion dollars in additional funding every
year to provide the kind of system that will help ensure that
goods and services ordered over the Internet will make it to
consumers," TRIP said.
</P>
<P>
A report being released this week by the U.S. Department of
Transportation says the nation should be investing about 94
billion dollars annually in road and bridge construction at the
federal, state and local level, according to TRIP. But the Federal
Highway Administration estimates that total highway construction
expenditures in 2000 by all levels of government will be only 58
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to TRIP, for each one billion dollars spent on
highway construction, 42,100 jobs are generated annually. And
every dollar invested in the highway system yields 2.6 dollars in
economic benefits in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Driving on roads in need of repair costs American motorists 23
billion dollars a year in extra vehicle repairs and operating
costs -- 126 dollars per motorist. Traffic congestion costs
American motorists 72 billion dollars a year in wasted time and
fuel costs.

within one year.
</P>
<P>
A senior Air Force officer said the training is aimed at "

offensive capability."
</P>
<P>
During the training courses, the officers will study modern
air combat theory, development trends in modern fighter aircraft,
weaponry for modern air combat, equipment for high-tech warfare,
and command automation devices.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that PLA Air Force has entered a new phase of
development with high-tech equipment and weapons, and Air Force
officers at various levels are required to upgrade their knowledge
and improve their capacity to master high-tech armament.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lazio Celebrates Financial Rewards After League Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Soccer club Lazio Monday began
celebrating the financial rewards of having scooped the Italian
league title for the second time in its history, as shares in the
team soared and offers from would-be sponsors began flooding in.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, which snatched the title from Juventus Sunday at the end
of a nail-biting day of play, saw its shares leap 18.71 percent on
the Milan bourse today, to 7.74 Euros, an increase of 25 percent
over Friday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the previous session, the club was worth 277
million Euros but that figure jumped to 323.4 million Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial experts estimated that the club's victory
would bring in at least an extra 52 million Euros from a variety
of sources ranging from contracts with sponsors, advertising, the
increase in sales of club articles such as T-shirts, caps and the
like, the boost in the number of season tickets and profits from
the team's participation in the Champion's League.
</P>
<P>
The man responsible for the club's business relations,
Giancarlo Guerra, said that the coffers were already about to
start ringing with the 1,550,000 Euros to be awarded to it by its
sponsors Cirio and Puma.
</P>
<P>
Guerra said that Lazio would receive a further 23,240,600 euros
over the next three years from its new sponsor, Siemens.
</P>
<P>
He said that the team's participation in the Champion's League
would yield about 10,300,000 Euros, while profits from advertising
rights and royalties would jump by 15-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Lazio's profile has been growing over the past few years and
now, after winning the league, it is worth even more. Our fans
will consume more and our bargaining powers are stronger," Guerra
said.
</P>
<P>
Lazio's wealthy president Sergio Cragnotti indicated his
intentions of building up a new soccer power base.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees that Lazio has deserved this victory, because
it wasn't an improvised win. It was the fruit of a long run-up
which began four or five years ago. This is the crowning of our
project and of our important organizational capabilities,"
Cragnotti told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lazio's coach, Swedish Goran Eriksson, delivered the same line,
saying that: "We are already working for next year. This team's
strength is its composition and its many champion players. The
main aim now is to become even stronger next season."
</P>
<P>
Lazio won its only other championship title in 1974, and this
season it battled its way forward in true style, managing to
whittle away the nine-point advantage which Juventus enjoyed just
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory was a combination of Lazio's 3-0 thrashing of
Reggina, which lifted its points to 72, and Juventus's subsequent
and unexpected 1-0 beating by Perugia, which left it with 71
points.

<HEADLINE> Politicians Take on Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Scottish parliamentarians have
attacked plans for American controversial boxer Mike Tyson to
travel to Glasgow for a high-profile fight.
</P>
<P>
Two motions criticising the move have been lodged in the
Scottish Parliament, one from a Labour MSP and another from a
Nationalist member.
</P>
<P>
A decision is expected imminently on whether Tyson, who has a
rape conviction dating from 1992, is to be allowed to come to
Scotland to fight Lou Savarese.
</P>
<P>
Hampden Park and Celtic's Parkhead are said to be vying to
stage the fight, due to be held next month, and the company
involved, Sports Network, expects a decision this week.
</P>
<P>
Labour MSP Hugh Henry, whose critical motion is being backed by
four other Labour MSPs, said: "I would urge the Scottish Football
Association not to allow a facility which is supported by public
money to be used for the promotion of a man with such a dubious
character and criminal record of violence against women.
</P>
<P>
"I would also urge Celtic football club, which has always
declared its commitment to social justice, not to allow its
facilities to be used for the promotion of such an individual."
</P>
<P>
Tyson was given special dispensation in January by Home
Secretary Jack Straw to be allowed into the country to fight
Julius Francis in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Henry, MSP for Paisley South, said: "I understand that
immigration laws in this country ban foreign nationals who have
criminal convictions of more than a year from entering the country.
Mike Tyson clearly falls into that category."
</P>
<P>
His motion calls on the SFA and Celtic to say their facilities
will not be available for the event, and for Mr Straw to use his
powers to prevent the boxer from making financial gain in the UK.
</P>
<P>
A similar motion from Dorothy-Grace Elder, SNP MSP for Glasgow
region, voiced "outrage" at the prospect of Hampden Park being
used as a showcase for Tyson, and attacks the previous decision of
Mr Straw to allow him entry to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Barmby Gets Euro 2000 Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nick Barmby, who plays for English
premier league club Everton, could be in line for a surprise role
in England's Euro 2000 campaign after he was named in Kevin Keegan
's preliminary squad.
</P>
<P>
The Everton star has been rewarded for some impressive recent
form by being included in the 28-man party for the up-coming
friendlies against Brazil, Ukraine and Malta.
</P>
<P>
Robbie Fowler was also named in the squad, despite missing most
of the season through injury.
</P>
<P>
And there was good news for Fowler's 19-year-old Liverpool team-
mate Steven Gerrard and Aston Villa goalkeeper David James.
</P>
<P>
But there was no place in the 28-man party for Chelsea left-
back Graeme Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
Keegan had indicated before Monday's announcement of the squad
that he wanted to give both Le Saux and Fowler the maximum time in
which to prove their fitness for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Le Saux has not played since suffering an ankle injury last
October and Keegan said: "He has just started light training and
it's impossible for him to get ready for a major championship."
</P>
<P>
For Fowler, there was a late glimmer of hope: "It does not
worry me he hasn't played too many games as long as he shows the
appetite and fitness in training," Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
Two other fringe players - Coventry's Steve Froggatt and Trevor
Sinclair of West Ham - have also been told they will not be going
to the championships.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who must whittle his squad down to 22 by June 1,
revealed that he had picked such a large group because he was
concerned about further injuries.
</P>
<P>
He said: "One of the reasons it's a squad of 28 is four Arsenal
players are playing in the UEFA Cup final, three players in the FA
Cup final, and (Ipswich goalkeeper) Richard Wright involved in at
least one play-off game.
</P>
<P>
"Gareth Barry and Frank Lampard could get a call-up if we do
have injuries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Barmby was one of the surprise inclusions and Keegan
revealed that he was asked to keep an eye on him after a tip-off
by Everton chairman Bill Kenwright.
</P>
<P>
"He's been picked for the form he's in - it's as simple as that.
His form throughout the season has been very consistent. I have
been watching him three times in the last six weeks - at the
request of his chairman Mr Kenwright - and his form has been very
good," said the manager.
</P>
<P>
James' impressive displays this season for Aston Villa earned
him a call-up and Keegan admitted he could make the final 22 ahead
of Ipswich Town's Richard Wright in the event of an injury to
Seaman or Nigel Martyn.
</P>
<P>
Which forwards will miss out on the finals will be one of the
main talking points over the build-up to Keegan's final squad
selection, but for now he says he is keeping all his options open.
</P>
<P>
"I've got six forwards and one has to go which is tough because
they all deserve to play," he said. "Two also have to go from
midfield and two from defence."

<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Tenth-seeded Jennifer Capriati, who
has just come back from a seven-week injury lay-off, crashed to a
first round defeat in the Italian Open here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Capriati fell 6-3, 7-5 to world number 31 Anne-Gaelle Sidot of
France in her first appearance since March, when she suffered an
Achilles tendon injury shortly after the Miami Open.

Sidot's compatriot and 12th seed Amelie Mauresmo, a
semifinalist here a year ago, swept past Spain's Gala Leon Garcia
6-1, 6-3 to reach the second round.

<P>
But Nathalie Dechy, another Frenchwoman, was one of three seeds
to fall on the opening day, losing 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 to Australia's

</P>
<P>
Capriati and Croatia's Silvija Talaja were the other seeds to
lose. Talaja, seeded 16, lost 6-2, 6-3 to Colombian qualifier
Fabiola Zuluaga.
</P>
<P>
World number one Lindsay Davenport of the United States had a
bye and was due to play Russia's Elena Dementieva in the second
round on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Venus Williams was scheduled to play either
Spain's Magui Serni or American Chanda Rubin in her second round
match on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Angelopoulos-Daskalaki Optimistic Over Athens 2004 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The new Athens 2004 Olympic Games
Organizing Committee chief Yianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki expressed
her belief Monday that Greece would realize its goal of organizing
a perfect Olympic Games in 2004 through hard work.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined that with the assistance of responsible
ministers, the government and the organizing committee, we will
reach our goal," she said in her first statement after officially
assuming the post of Athens 2004 Olympics president.
</P>
<P>
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who spearheaded Athens' campaign to
host the 2004 Olympics, said after a high-level govenrment meeting
focusing on all-important 2004 Olympics preparation that they must
work hard.
</P>
<P>
"During this phase, it is important that we work and not talk,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) last month voiced its
dissatisfaction over the delays made by Athens in several areas of
Olympic preparations, but the IOC has hailed the replacement by
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki of Panayiotis Thomopoulos as Athens 2004
Games chief.
</P>
<P>
The IOC's Coordinating Committee has received assurances that
the law governing Athens 2004 will be amended and that the
bureaucratic delays hindering the hiring of personnel will be
bypassed.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has set a 100-day deadline for the Athens Games
organizers to tackle certain pending issues and implement basic
programs.

WUHAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, one of China's hottest cities
in summer, had a temperature of 36.1 degrees Centigrade on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was the hottest day in mid-May in 50 years, according to
local meteorologists.

"We didn't expect hot weather to come so early this year,"
said a bus driver named Wang.

On downtown streets, people were wearing shorts and sandals

Air conditioners and refrigerators sold very well for two days,
and one supermarket sold over one million yuan worth of air
conditioners on Sunday alone, a shop assistant said.
</P>
<P>
Since summer came to the city on May 2, Wuhan, known as one of
the four stoves in China, has had an extremely dry atmosphere and
little rainfall. Meteorologists attribute the abnormal weather to
the La Nina phenomena.

Weather forecasts say temperatures today and tomorrow will

between  Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In response to the resumption of the fighting last Friday, the
U.N. Security Council demanded in a resolution that Ethiopia and
Eritrea cease fire immediately and resume peace talks, noting it
would meet again on Monday to take immediate steps to ensure
compliance with this resolution if hostilities continue.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian News Agency quoted Seyoum as saying Monday it was
surprising that the Security Council, which used to support a
country's right to reverse an aggression by force, came up with
such an unfair demand.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum made the remarks in an interview with the Voice of
America last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the council's demand that the two warring countries
should return to negotiations without any precondition was not the
concern of Ethiopia as it has set no precondition in the peace
process over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The council should rather warn Eritrea to go back to round
table talks without preconditions, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has not closed the door for peace, he said, adding it
is still ready to negotiate if Eritrea abandons its
preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Defense Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Minister of Defense Jose
Antonio Alvarado said Tuesday that he resigned Monday to his post
because of doubts regarding his nationality.
</P>
<P>
As local radio stations reported, Minister Alvarado has
American nationality, but negotiated in the last decade with
Nicaragua's former government for his Nicaraguan nationality to be
restored.
</P>
<P>
Alvarado met Tuesday with President of the Nicaraguan Center of
Human Rights (CENIDH) Vilma Nunez to ask for support.
</P>
<P>
Nunez explained to the press that Alvarado received Tuesday
morning a resolution from the Interior Ministry to recover his
Nicaraguan nationality.
</P>
<P>
However, a resolution broadcast in 1990 by the General
Direction of Migration and Alien Status granted Nicaraguan
nationality for recovery to Alvarado, said Nunez.
</P>
<P>
She said that Nicaragua's Constitution establishes that
Nicaraguan nationality is never lost, therefore it isn't necessary
to recover nationality.
</P>
<P>
Alvarado criticized recently corruption acts of Aleman's
government, and declared in public that he is opposed to convoking
a constituent before the 2001 presidential elections, a proposal
made known by Alvarado in January.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Sharply Despite Higher Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose sharply in
a relief rally Tuesday despite the Federal Reserve's decision to
raise interest rates again in an effort to cool off the hot U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 126.79 or 1.19
percent at 10,934.57 and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index rose 109.92 or 3 percent at 3,717.57.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 13.68 at 1,466.04.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve announced its decision to raise rates by a
half percentage point to 6.50 percent, the steepest increase in
five year. The rate hike marked the sixth time since last June as
a preemptive move to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as investors snapped stocks in a hope that
the rate increase would be the last this year. But analysts
expected a further move at the Federal Reserve's next meeting on
June 28.
</P>
<P>
The government's Consumer Price Index in April also convinced
investors that the Federal Reserve would not have to raise rates
again. The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the CPI held
steady in April, indicating a success in fighting inflation.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks regained the leader of the market. Hewlett-
Packard led the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
IBM and Intel also rose. But rate-sensitive stocks such as
American Express and Citigroup fell.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.05 at 658.83 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 7.62 at 505.43. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 4.95 at 940.60.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,655 up, 1,306 down and 475
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 945.94 million shares from 845.81
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Online Grocery Market Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 16 (Xinhua) -- From less than 200 million U.S.
dollars last year, U.S. online grocery spending will top 8.8
billion dollars in 2004, according to a research released Tuesday
by market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
IDC said that online grocers will have to overcome many
obstacles as the market grows. "Substantial capital costs are
required to reach customers, consumer acceptance still remains a
major barrier to growth, product margins are low, and competition
is everywhere," the research firm said.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, to penetrate a new market, some online
grocers will spend more than 25 million dollars, and that cost
does not include customer acquisition. Most of the expense is
related to building fulfillment centers. Existing grocery stores
will have just as difficult a time getting into online business as
the online pure-play start-ups.
</P>
<P>
Some investments will pay off in large ways, IDC found. "The
fundamental value proposition of the online grocery business model
-- we do what you don't want to, and cheap -- will resonate with
busy suburban families," IDC said. "As a result, profitability
will eventually be achieved, particularly in older markets."
</P>
<P>
IDC expects prepared foods and convenience services to be big
growth areas in online grocery spending. While online spending for
traditional groceries will also increase, its market share will
decrease from 92 percent in 1999 to less than 70 percent in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The large capital investment required for traditional groceries
will encourage online grocers to expand their product selection
into high-margin categories, IDC said, listing health and beauty
products, pet supplies, household cleaners, dry cleaning, video
rental and prepared foods.
</P>
<P>
An earlier study by Internet-enabled marketing research
provider Greenfield Online found that buying groceries on a Web
site does not appear to be catching on. The biggest problems
facing online grocers appear to be awareness and visibility.
Almost half of 1,700 respondents do not know if an online grocer
provides home delivery in their area. The primary activities
conducted by visitors of online grocery sites were price shopping,
accessing coupons and researching weekly specials.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's New President Stresses Law, Secularism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new president, Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, emphasized in his first speech after swearing-in ceremony
Tuesday that he would make great efforts to solidify the state of
law and abide by secularist principles of the republic.
</P>
<P>
Addressing law-makers immediately after taking presidential oath
in the Grand National Assembly (Parliament) in the afternoon,
Sezer, a reformist chief justice of the Constitutional Court,
declared that Turkey should stop procedures resembling "police
state" policies.
</P>
<P>
The judge-turned president said that a bright future for the
country could only be established with full implementation of the
norms and supremacy of the state's law, underlining the principle
that no one and no establishment could be above the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that supremacy of the law from top to toe, in all state
mechanism, was necessary, adding that the greatest social
catastrophe, if ever, would be the loss of trust in law and
justice.
</P>
<P>
As president of the overwhelmingly Muslim-populated and
constitutionally secular country, Sezer pledged to protect its
secular system.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of secularism will be protected without any
concession and with determination," Sezer announced, adding that
secularism constitutes the cornerstone of democracy and that
without secularism, there could be no freedom or democracy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that freedom of conscience and belief were
guaranteed by the secular principles of the state. "State and
society cannot be organized along the rules of religion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the issue of foreign policy, the new president noted
that the principles established decades ago by Abdullah Ataturk,
founder of the Republic of Turkey, remain valid today.
</P>
<P>
Sezer went on to say that Turkey's accession to the European
Union and the attainment of European standards in all areas,
continue to be one of his prominent goals.
</P>
<P>
Aged 58, Sezer was elected Turkey's 10th president on May 3. He
is the first ever head of state who does not come from either of
the two power camps of Turkey, the Parliament or army ranks, in the
country's 76-year history.
</P>
<P>
He took over the presidency from his 76-year-old predecessor,
Suleyman Demirel, in a grand handing-over ceremony held at the
Presidential Palace Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Peru Seizes Large Quantity of Smuggled Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian authorities seized 1.174
million US dollars in contraband products during the first quarter
of the year, said Tuesday the Anti -Smuggling Commission (ACC) at
Lima.
</P>
<P>
According to this government organization, customs personnel
participated in 786 interventions in the cities of Tumbes, lying
in the border with Ecuador, Tacna and Puno, in the border with
Chile and Bolivia, and in many other border regions with Colombia
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
ACC said that during the police operatives automobile
accessories, electric appliances, lacquers -whisky in particular-,
propane, shoes and clothing, and so forth, were seized.
</P>
<P>
According to this organization, the most affected area is the
city of Tumbes where over half a million US dollars worth of
products were seized.
</P>
<P>
"This amount is double the one recorded during the first
quarter of last year, when 252,000 dollars worth of products were
seized", it says.
</P>
<P>
But this problems happens not only at Tumbes, in Tacna, 295,000
dollars in smuggled products were seized, while in Puno the
contraband products amounted to 149,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the border zones with Colombia and Brazil, an active illegal
trade takes place as well, with products illegally entering from
these countries, but at a less degree.
</P>
<P>
ACC said that Peru losses more than 700 million dollars each
year for tax evasion in products being smuggled into the country.

<P>
Orellana considered positive the meeting of vice foreign

<HEADLINE> Special Meeting on CAR Ends at U.N. Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A two-day special meeting on
security and development in the Central African Republic (CAR)
ended Tuesday at the U.N. Headquarters in New York with the
announcement of donations to strengthen security and development
in the African country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened here Monday, was intended to
mobilize donor assistance in support of the Government's program
to restructure the armed forces, and demobilize and reintegrate
retired military personnel in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deputy Secretary-General, Louise Frechette, opened
the two-day meeting Monday, which was cosponsored by the United
Nations, Germany and the United Nations Development Program. The
prime minister of CAR, Anicet-George Dologuele, led the government
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting included "the detailed discussion by the
Government of the Central African Republic on its plans to
restructure its defense and security forces, and to alleviate
poverty," Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said at a press
conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, donors took the occasion to announce pledges in
excess of 33 million (U.S.) dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dologuele is scheduled to meet with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday afternoon, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the president of the U.N. Security Council,
Wang Yingfan of China, voiced a welcome to the upcoming meeting,
saying that the Council members "underlined the need to
consolidate the progress made in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Given that security-related programs must be anchored within
the Government's overall social and economic strategy, the meeting
will also focus on its most critical aspects, which also require
the attention and support of the international community, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
This integrated approach to security and development is in
line with the report of the U.N. Secretary-General on the causes
of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable
development in Africa, presented to the Security Council and the
General Assembly over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is organized in close collaboration with
the Government of CAR, the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and the
Bretton Woods Institutions, will bring together interested Member
States, the Organization of the African Unity, the European
Commission, the International Organization of la Francophonie,
regional and international financial institutions, international
nongovernmental organizations, as well as relevant U.N.
departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, Wang said that the Council
members welcomed the special meeting, saying that "the members
wished to express their gratitude for the cosponsorship given by
the government of Germany, and welcomed the active participation
of UNDP, the institutions of Bretton Woods and other U.N. agencies
in the preparation of this meeting."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council stressed the importance of this
meeting to support the proposed reforms planned by CAR in the
fields of security and development," the statement said. "They
underlined the need to consolidate the progress made in the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Security Council has officially
ended the U.N. peacekeeping operations in CAR and established a
new support office to help the government consolidate peace.
</P>
<P>
Mutinous soldiers have staged three major rebellions since
1996 against President Ange-Felix Patasse, whose election in 1993
ended more than a decade of army rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, some 1,350 U.N. peacekeeping troops replaced French
soldiers helping to enforce a peace agreement between political
and ethnic opponents in the country.

<HEADLINE> Possible Alliances in Dominican Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The seven candidates of the
Dominican parties participating in Tuesday's elections are
planning to make alliances with other political institutions along
this process, with side comments which say that none of them will
win.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts are afraid that at the end of Tuesday's
process, none of the candidates will reach the 50 percent of the
votes plus one, required to become president, which means that
there would be a second round on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Santo Domingo said that Dominicans
remember that four years ago, current President Leonel Fernandez
came into power due to a political arrangement with the
conservative leader, Joaquin Balaguer.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican Liberation's Party (PLD) candidate to the
presidency, Danilo Medina, being second in most electoral opinion
polls, does not rule out forming possible alliances right after
learning of the first voting results.
</P>
<P>
The other candidate with possibilities is the Dominican
Revolutionary Party (PRD)'s social-democrat, Hipolito Mejia.
</P>
<P>
The political arena's rules say that should Mejia and Medina
become candidates for the second round to take place on June 30,
then Balaguer's support for any of them would be decisive, as it
happened in 1994's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Thousands gathered before dawn at more than 11,400 polling
stations to choose among free-market advocate Danilo Medina of the
governing Dominican Liberation Party, left-leaning populist
Hipolito Mejia of the Dominican Revolutionary Party and 93-year-
old Joaquin Balaguer of the Social Christian Revolutionary Party,
who is seeking an eighth term as president.
</P>
<P>
Polls suggested Mejia could get 40 to 50 percent of the vote,
more than the other candidates, but probably not enough to prevent
a run-off election on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.3 million Dominicans were registered to vote. Results
were expected Wednesday.

In this event, issues like illegal crops plantation, and
environment in areas under guerrilla control, were going to be

The 54 years old woman peasant was killed by the Front 11 of

the moment police tried to remove the bomb from her neck.
</P>
<P>
This happened at Chiquinquiro, close to the capital, and also

AFBF President Bob Stallman, at a press conference here, urged
Congress to pass the trade bill, saying passage of the legislation
will create increased global economic prosperity and trade
liberalization for both China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means
Committee are expected to vote on the measure this week. The full
House is expected to vote on the measure in the week of May 22
while the Senate will follow suit in early June.
</P>
<P>
Stallman said that the bilateral trade agreement reached last
year between China and the United States was a "win-win" situation
for both countries, especially America's farmers and ranchers
whose "economic well being depends upon increased access to
foreign markets."
</P>
<P>
"China is broadly recognized as the most important growth
market for U.S. agricultural exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the total
value of U.S. exports of wheat, rice, corn, cotton, soybeans and
soybeans products would increase by 1.6 billion dollars in 2005
when the agreement is fully implemented. The average annual value
of U.S. exports from 2000 to 2009 would increase by 1.5 billion

program for coffee retentions so as to obtain an increase of
international prices to over 110 U.S. dollars per 46 kilogram sack.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is priced at 94.50 dollars per 46 kilo sack, with a
lowering tendency following its recoil last Friday of 4.20 dollars
on the New York market.
</P>
<P>
This meeting in Britain's capital is divided into two parts,
explained Rojas. First, the International Coffee Organization (ICO)
meets, bringing together producers and consumers, and on the 19th,
the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), to which
Brazil and Colombia belong, as main producers.
</P>
<P>
To the meeting in London certain countries that don't belong to
the ACPC will attend, like Mexico and Vietnam, the latter having
changed into an important world producer, at the same time as
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The ACPC is looking for a mechanism allowing the control of
coffee offer on world markets and to control the fall in grain
prices that have come about in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The retention system that will be studied in London is based on
price stripes. Following one stage, a return of 10 to 15 percent
of the harvest is retained. It's hoped these amounts are
negotiated by producing countries at this meeting.

<HEADLINE> French Judge Interviews Rwandan Genocide Suspects on Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A French anti-terrorism judge
Tuesday started a closed-door interview of seven selected Rwandan
genocide suspects believed to be involved in the shooting down of
former Rwandan President's plane which triggered the 100-day
massacre in 1994.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time such special interview has been granted
to find the truth of the shooting down of the plane over Kigali on
April 6, 1994 as it was approaching to touchdown.
</P>
<P>
The plane was carrying the then Rwandan President Juvenal
Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart Cyprien Ntaryanira who
were returning from Dar es Salaam after attending a meeting with
the then Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Louis Brugiere has been given special authority last month
by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)
Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte to interview the suspects who are being
held and awaiting their trials in the ICTR prison located in
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The seven suspects to be interviewed include former Director of
 Political Affairs in the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, and Hassan Ngeze, former chief editor of
the extremist Hutu newspaper Kangura.
</P>
<P>
The French judge has also asked to interview former Rwandan
military leaders Aloys Ntabakuze and Augustin Ndindiliyimana,
former Defense Ministry advisor Theoneste Bagosora and former
political leaders Casimir Bizimungu and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.
</P>
<P>
The recorded interviews, under a tight security, are scheduled
to end on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brugiere is investigating the crash on behalf of the families
of the four French crew who also died when the plane was shot
down.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Canadian newspaper leaked a report by a
former U.N. investigator, alleging the plane could have been shot
down by the former rebel movement Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)
led by Paul Kagame who is now President of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
But RPF has maintained its innocence in the issue.
