LATE-INNING LIGHTNING GOES AGAINST THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the Mets had run out of magic tricks or had grown weary
of the drama surrounding their most recent victories. But when
Tuesday night's game with the Astros stretched into the late
innings, and then into extra stanzas, it appeared the stage would
be set for what is becoming routine drama.
</P>
<P>
   There was drama all right, just not the kind the Mets had hoped
for. With Dennis Cook, who had not pitched since Aug. 16, on the
mound for the 10th inning, the Mets gave up four runs. The first
came when Ricky Gutierrez, whom the Mets got to after intentionally
walking Craig Biggio, slapped a single to right field that scored
catcher Tony Eusebio. The next hitter, Jeff Bagwell, slammed a high
fastball on a 3-1 pitch over Roger Cedeno's leap at the fence in
right. On the replay, it looked as if Cedeno had a shot at the
ball, but it dropped into the bullpen and the Mets lost, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat, combined with the Braves' 6-4 victory over
Cincinnati, pushed the Mets to one-and-a-half games back in the
National League East.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, this was an uncharacteristic bullpen blowup.
Earlier in the week, Manager Bobby Valentine said he had been
hesitant to use Cook because he had a cut on the index finger of
his left hand. Tuesday night, in one-third of an inning, Cook gave
up four runs on three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with my finger,'' Cook said. ``I just
didn't get the job done. I'm not going to make excuses. I've been
pretty good this year and tonight I wasn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the home run pitch to Bagwell, up and way, was where he
wanted it since Bagwell is a low-ball hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie might have been rusty; he just hasn't pitched in a
while,'' said Valentine. ``He's a little out of sync but he threw
decent.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the Mets were going to quietly succumb to Mike
Hampton and the Houston Astros, producing no runs and just three
hits in the first six innings. But Mike Piazza belted a 1-1 slider
deep into the stands in left center for his 31st home run of the
year in the seventh inning to tie the score 1-1. Until Cook's
meltdown, the Astros' only run came on a second-inning solo home
run by the former Met Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza's homer did not signal the start of another stirring
Mets rally. In days past, the Mets have seemingly waited for the
most dramatic moment, only to open the floodgates of offense. But
the score was still 1-1 when Turk Wendell relieved Masato Yoshii in
the eighth, and Armando Benitez came in to pitch the ninth inning.
Benitiz walked two, but got out of the inning. The Mets could not
score in the bottom of the ninth off reliever Billy Wagner (3-1),
and so Cook came in.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets struggled all night for offense. Hampton, using a
fastball clocked in the upper reaches of the 80s and his own
athletic defense of his position, retired the first nine batters he
faced before walking Rickey Henderson to lead off the fourth. But
Henderson was erased on a double play. John Olerud then got the
Mets' first hit, a singleto left field. Olerud was left on base as
Mike Piazza grounded into a force play.
</P>
<P>
   The next hit came from Darryl Hamilton in the fifth, a flare
over shortstop Ricky Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' third hit came in the sixth from Yoshii, who was
crafting his own fine night of work.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii is a bubble pitcher, a large question mark in the
rotation when Rick Reed and Bobby Jones come off the disabled list
as expected. Bobby Valentine hasn't discussed what he plans to do
with the wealth of starters, but Yoshii has given Valentine plenty
to ponder. He pitched a complete game in his last start Aug. 18 at
San Diego and made just one glaring error Tuesday night. On his
first pitch of the second inning, he gave Everett a fat pitch to
feast on. Everett belted a home run 459 feet to right field and,
earning the ire of the fans, kissed his fingers and pointed to the
sky several times as he made his way around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was with the Mets from 1995 to 1997, was serenaded
by boos and catcalls during his trot, one boisterous fan even
wondering aloud how Everett's daughter, who was placed in foster
care two years ago while Everett was still with the team, was
doing. Yoshii lasted seven and one-third innings, allowing one run
on five hits, with no walks and five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets briefly threatened in the sixth inning, when Yoshii hit
a leadoff single to left field and Hampton, after retiring
Henderson, walked Edgardo Alfonzo. But that opportunity was
squandered, too, when John Olerud, the hero of the Mets' exuberant
victory in the first game of Sunday's doubleheader against the
Cardinals, grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   After Piazza's home run, Houston put together its own rally in
the eighth, putting runners at first and second with one out. But
Wendell, who pitched in relief in Monday night's game, replaced
Yoshii and got out of the inning. But this would be the rare night
that the Mets' bullpen, the stalwart of the team for much of the
season, would not be able to hold on until the offense could slip
into gear.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY JONES, on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis since
May, will have a magnetic resonance imaging test Wednesday because
he felt soreness in his shoulder after his rehabilitation start
Monday. Jones was examined Tuesday after being concerned that the
stiffness he felt was greater than it should be. ``It's still
achy,'' Jones said. &QL;

CHINESE SET TO PROSECUTE LEADERS OF SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert comment from Falun Gong spokesman as 4th graf after
optional trim, bgng In New York; inserts `groups invoking' in 6th
graf.)  (mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The Chinese authorities announced on Tuesday
that they were preparing to prosecute senior members of Falun Gong,
the spiritual movement that was banned last month after it startled
China's leaders with its ability to organize potent anti-government
protests.
</P>
<P>
   To deliver a strong message that Beijing will tolerate no
protests of any kind, the judicial authorities are now expected to
charge Falun Gong's leaders with subversion and direct that they be
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   An order jointly issued by the Communist Party's Central
Committee and China's Cabinet specified that core members of Falun
Gong must be punished severely, the official New China News Agency
reported on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by President Jiang Zemin, the campaign against Falun
Gong has provided a vehicle for a political crusade that seems
aimed at invigorating the Communist Party's authoritarian
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's strong embrace of Marxist ideology appears to
have renewed the political firepower of security and propaganda
operations, but it seems out of touch with popular concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the explosive role that groups invoking mystical
forces have played in toppling weak authorities at transitional
periods throughout Chinese history, government leaders have
conducted the campaign against Falun Gong with marked thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what many Chinese analysts see as the campaign's overkill
has led them to question whether Jiang is pursuing his own
political objectives as well, using the campaign to extend his
authority at a time when he faces multiple challenges, notably with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's order did not specify how many people would be
prosecuted. But more than 50 leaders are believed to be facing
harsh punishment for leading anti-government protests that the
authorities later described as an attempt to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Official efforts continue to blame the leaders of Falun Gong
while ordinary followers are pardoned and encouraged to disavow the
movement. The order said that only a ``tiny minority'' of Falun
Gong followers would be charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong-based human rights monitor said lawyers in Beijing
had been told to get official permission before taking on cases
involving Falun Gong members, and to report any instances of Falun
Gong members approaching them for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong mixes elements of Buddhism and Taoism with breathing
exercises and meditation. It also preaches frugality and abstinence
from liquor and tobacco as aids to leading a moral life.
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned by wrenching changes in Chinese society, including
unemployment and growing corruption, millions of dispossessed
people yearning for spiritual fulfillment have been drawn to the
movement. Many are retired or unemployed workers who lost their
health benefits and believed Falun Gong's promise that illness
could be avoided or cured through meditation and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the movement by government skeptics provoked
numerous small protests in different parts of China in recent
years. But the movement came to the attention of China's top
leaders on April 25, when more than 10,000 followers surrounded
Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound in central Beijing, to demand
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   That event, expertly organized by Falun Gong leaders, so
frightened China's high officials that they later labeled it an
attempt to overthrow the government. When the authorities formally
banned Falun Gong on July 22, they accused the movement of
corrupting people's minds and sabotaging national stability.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Falun Gong followers were detained as the
government ordered a huge campaign that reached down to every
state-run workplace in the nation and has dominated the nation's
media for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   Although most detainees were let go and sent home within days,
the government has proceeded with a campaign of vilification of Li
Hongzhi, who founded the movement in 1992 and now lives in New
York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Falun Gong supporters in London said on Tuesday that Li had
abandoned plans to attend a movement gathering in Britain this
weekend. Although Britain did not agree to a request from China
that Li be blocked from entering the country, Li has told reporters
in New York that he fears assassination or kidnapping by the
Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   China issued an arrest warrant for Li last month and offered a
$10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. But Interpol
rejected a request from Beijing for help in apprehending Li, saying
the request was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Li has protested that his movement is apolitical and poses no
threat to social stability. But his credibility has been undermined
by his conflicting statements about his role in the April 25
protest, which China accuses him of masterminding.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Tuesday, a Falun Gong spokesman, Zhang Erping,
denounced what he said would be ``show trials'' of the group's
leaders, adding, ``We hope the world will speak out to insure
fairness and a respect for international legal standards as well as
for the right of people to practice their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Communist Party statement said it was necessary to
prosecute harshly anyone who ``plotted from behind the scenes and
deliberately sabotaged social stability.'' At the same time, it
encouraged leading members of the movement to admit their mistakes
and to expose the inner workings of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falun Gong leaders have insisted that the movement has
no formal organization, it was evident from the April 25 protest
that they could mobilize large groups of followers to act in a
disciplined and effective manner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's order did not name any of Falun Gong's top leaders.
But those expected to receive the greatest punishment include Li
Chang, a former deputy director at the Ministry of Public Security,
and Wang Zhiwen, a former Railway Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed to discover that several senior military officers were
also Falun Gong followers, Chinese leaders have conducted a
crackdown in the army to root out any Falun Gong members.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, the authorities also confiscated and
destroyed millions of books, cassette tapes and videos about Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's order advised work teams to treat most Falun Gong
followers as victims who were unaware of the political goals and
motives of the movement's leaders. The same attitude will probably
extend to more than 1,000 government officials who were identified
during the first week of the crackdown as Falun Gong followers and
were detained in Communist Party schools and forced to renounce any
belief in the movement.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's announcement, the campaign is evidently in its
third and final stage.
</P>
<P>
   First the authorities outlawed the movement and accused it of
threatening social stability, illustrating their assertions with
testimony of former adherents who described how harmful it was,
saying it had caused some members to die from refusing medical
treatment and others to commit suicide in fits of delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the authorities expanded their campaign with accounts that
purported to show how Falun Gong was organized for political
purposes, with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the government.
</P>
<P>
   The final stage of the campaign is now expected to publicize the
punishment of the movement's leaders as an example to anyone
considering ways to challenge the authority of the Communist Party.
It is likely to be wrapped up in the coming weeks, before Oct. 1,
when the party is planning a huge celebration of its 50 years in
power.

HORSE RACING'S GRIM REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend of mine, a bullfighting aficionado who wrote an
entertaining book on the subject, maintains that the (begin
ital)toros(end ital) slain in the arenas of Spain with swords
between the shoulder blades are the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   He says 99 percent of the world's bovines are bred to be
slaughtered at an early age for human consumption. Fighting bulls,
on the other hand, are more or less guaranteed of living to age 4,
and they have a chance to achieve glory in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   If the art were abolished _ or so the argument continues _ it's
not as if those bulls would be frolicking in a dewy meadow
somewhere. They'd never have been born in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had to pick a member of the animal kingdom to be, a
fighting bull wouldn't be a bad choice,'' he said. ``You spend all
but the last 15 minutes of your life in incredible luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I buy that line of reasoning. It sounds like
rationalization. What does a bull care if his name's in the paper?
</P>
<P>
   But I think about it every time news like Tuesday's comes
spinning off the racetrack rumor mill.
</P>
<P>
   A record-setting thoroughbred named Mazel Trick broke down in a
morning workout Tuesday at Del Mar. He would have been favored to
win the $1 million Pacific Classic on Sunday, but now his racing
career is over and the severity of the injury to his right front
ankle suggests he's no sure thing to survive the week.
</P>
<P>
   A veterinarian reported that Mazel Trick's progress in the next
couple of days will determine if his future holds a line of
broodmares or a lethal injection. For now he's confined to a
straw-carpeted stall, in a splint and on pain-killers.
</P>
<P>
   Being a fan of horse racing _ as opposed to a pure gambler _
occasionally demands a form of the logical contortion my friend
performs in order to justify his support of a brutal culture.
Unless you regard the horse as nothing more than a piece of
sporting equipment, as disposable as a broken tennis racket, you
must think the risk of injury and death is worth it to the animal,
the price a competitive soul pays for a shot at the history books.
</P>
<P>
   You have to think the real tragedy of Mazel Trick's breakdown is
that the 4-year-old who shattered the 7-furlong record at Hollywood
Park and ran away with the major Pacific Classic prep at Del Mar
never got to prove himself against first-class competition. Or does
that sound like a bunch of bull?
</P>
<P>
   Racing fans have had too much practice at such mental gymnastics
this summer. Charismatic broke down with the world watching him
chase the Triple Crown at Belmont Park in June and was immediately
retired. Victory Gallop, the horse who beat Real Quiet out of the
Triple Crown last year, hurt himself in a race at Saratoga earlier
this month and was retired two weeks ago. Real Quiet himself was
injured in a workout at Santa Anita last week and might not race
again.
</P>
<P>
   The recent injuries to Victory Gallop, Real Quiet and Mazel
Trick have ruined the nationally televised Pacific Classic, which
had shaped up as the race of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Del Mar this season, eight horses have suffered
injuries in races or workouts that called for euthanasia, including
a particularly gory breakdown and fall in a cheap race on Saturday.
We're told eight deaths in five weeks is no more or less than
normal. I'm not sure if that's supposed to be good news or bad.
Particularly since track management spent $600,000 last spring to
rebuild the dirt oval with improved safety in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Del Mar. They seem to have had some criticism
of their racetrack,'' said Elliott Walden, trainer of Victory
Gallop, on the phone from Saratoga. ``But my horse got hurt at
Saratoga and Real Quiet got hurt when he worked at Santa Anita. So
I don't think there's much point to (singling out Del Mar).''
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick's trainer, Hall of Famer Bobby Frankel, didn't blame
the racetrack. He admitted the colt's health had been precarious
since ankle-chip surgery on both ankles last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel believed this was a ``great'' horse _ ``win, lose or
draw'' in the Pacific Classic _ and what-might-have-been will be
his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me this is the best we can do for the horses who
suffer pain or death on the racetrack: recognizing that they are
not a forgettable list of faceless victims but unique tragedies for
an infinite variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest thing I've seen on a racetrack this year happened
far from the racing shrines of Del Mar, Santa Anita and Belmont. It
happened at the Humboldt County Fair in the Victorian town of
Ferndale, a narrow half-mile oval for California's cheapest horses,
the kind of place where you'd expect daily carnage but the action
is normally quite safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the second race of the recent Ferndale season, the leader in
a sprint for $4,000 claiming horses took a bad step in the first
turn, veered to the right and clipped the left hind leg of the
second horse. Both went down.
</P>
<P>
   As the jockeys rolled and got up, not badly hurt, the horses
staggered around, each with a limb dangling. The first was a
7-year-old gelding who'd been through four trainers in his last 10
starts. The second was an 8-year-old gelding who found himself in
the wrong place at the wrong time in his 74th start.
</P>
<P>
   At Ferndale they don't have the screens that major tracks put up
to spare fans a view of injured horses' final moments and to
preserve the horses' dignity. These poor guys took the needle with
the small crowd watching in squeamish silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get used to this aspect of the game,'' a friend, a
major-track publicist on vacation, said sadly to his wife, an
infrequent racegoer.
</P>
<P>
   I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Then we sat down to handicap the third. &QL;

TOM PETTY, HEARTBREAKERS TOO STUBBORN TO BACK DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benmont Tench was all of 12 or 13 when he first encountered
future rock star Tom Petty in 1960s Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an older kid. He had a good haircut and was in a band _
very impressive and very intimidating,'' Tench recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked in a music store where I used to go mess around with
all the instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   The piano-playing Tench also noticed a third kid in the
neighborhood, a guitarist named Mike Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Little did Tench know that the three were destined to become as
close as brothers while traveling the globe, playing music and
making piles of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any brothers, so these literally _ as corny as it
might sound _ are my brothers. We grew up together. We've seen a
lot together. And you become incredibly close,'' says Tench, now
45.
</P>
<P>
   The three, who remain the founding members of Petty's
high-octane band, the Heartbreakers, began their venture after
Campbell and Petty formed a band in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   At age 17, Tench was formally introduced to the pair and began
to sit in with the group, Mudcrutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I quit school because it felt right to play this
music,'' Tench says via phone from his home in Southern
California's San Fernando Valley. ``So, when they said, `We're
going to California,' I went `OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Petty and the Heartbreakers, who are touring North America
through Oct. 16, wasted little time on the West Coast, scoring a
hit with their self-titled 1976 debut album.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades and 15 albums later, the group is still packing
concert halls and creating relevant music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what we've got here is a rock band that's too dumb,
too ornery and too stubborn to give up,'' Tench says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``Every night, you get to go out (onstage), they count
four and you start playing with people that you like. How much
better can it be?''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Tench has earned the reputation as a keyboard
master who, like the talented Campbell, favors a less-is-more
approach to rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   Though his piano and organ work occasionally takes the spotlight
in such classics as ``Refugee'' and ``Don't Do Me Like That'' and
on the new ``Echo'' album, Tench excels at understated lines that
are a bedrock of the Heartbreakers' straight-ahead sound.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Heartbreakers are widely recognized as one of the
most solid outfits performing today, Tench realizes that ``it's
really about the stuff Tom writes and sings.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who penned ``American Girl,'' ``Free Fallin','' ``I
Won't Back Down,'' ``Learning'' ``to Fly'' and a raft of other hits
earned Tench's respect by standing up for his principals.
</P>
<P>
   Tench has watched Petty do battle with record executives over
contracts and too-high album prices and sue a tire company that
tried to use his music in an ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really strong and he's very stubborn, and he's not going
to go away,'' Tench says.
</P>
<P>
   Although he writes songs with two cohorts in Nashville as well,
Tench happily proclaims that ``the band is the most important
thing, far and away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start a band and you all believe in the music and you
all believe in each other, it isn't just some job. It's a pretty
deep thing and it's great.'' &QL;

   In a move that could leave Canada with one major airline, a
Canadian conglomerate, with the help of American Airlines' parent
company, offered $3.8 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt
Tuesday to buy Air Canada and merge it with the rival Canadian
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would significantly alter a slice of the North American
airline business. Travelers on Canadian routes would be left to
deal with a virtual monopoly, especially when flying to
destinations in eastern Canada. And the UAL Corp.'s United Airlines
unit could lose passengers to American, its key rival.

<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday how quickly this megadeal would take
place, if at all. The Canadian conglomerate, the Toronto-based Onex
Corp., said it would pay $5.54 (U.S.) for each Air Canada share, a
23 percent premium, or allow stockholders to swap their holdings
for an equal number of shares in Airco, a subsidiary that Onex had
formed for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The overtures by Onex _ and its chairman Gerald Schwartz, one of
Canada's most active deal makers _ received opposite reactions from
the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada's executives appeared to be surprised, saying in a
statement that the company was aware that an ``unsolicited
below-market offer'' had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Airlines appeared to roll out the red carpet for
Schwartz. The company's board of directors recommended that
shareholders accept Onex's offer of $1.34 or 0.2424 of a share of
Airco's stock for each of their shares. Kevin Benson, the chief
executive of Canadian Airlines, even said in a statement that if
the transaction were completed, it would result in a true national
airline for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enthusiasm from Canadian Airlines, analysts were
confident the deal would hit a few snags. It was not clear Tuesday
how receptive Canadian regulators would be to having one major
carrier, despite the financial woes both airlines have experienced
independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most immediate problem is that Onex's offer is probably
too low,'' said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley.
``Schwartz may have to raise it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forming one airline may be too big a headache even for Schwartz,
who has, among his many properties, major stakes in Sky Chefs, the
airline caterer, and Celestica, which sells automotive products.
Analysts said the new company, to be called Air Canada and
headquartered in Montreal, could face some labor unrest even before
it is formed.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz announced Tuesday that the combined company would
eliminate 5,000 jobs, mainly through attrition. While reductions of
that magnitude may woo analysts and investors, they tend to rile
union bosses, who are especially vocal in the airline industry. Air
Canada's pilots had a strike last year that cost the company some
$130 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger were to go through, the only other significant
airline competitor left in Canada would be Westjet, a 3-year-old
carrier based in Calgary that serves 11 cities in Western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expected troubles with the deal, analysts were
generally hopeful that it would be completed. Air Canada and
Canadian Airlines have wobbled financially for years, leaving some
observers to wonder if both can survive indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this deal happens, I think it's a good thing for Canadian
travelers,'' said Murphy. ``It ensures a strong industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Air Canada ponders Onex's offer, another feud appears to
be heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised AMR for committing $334 million to the proposed
Air Canada deal. AMR owns 33 percent of Canadian Airlines, a
statutory limit. If the deal is completed, Onex will own 31 percent
of the new Air Canada; AMR, 14.9 percent; and the public
shareholders, 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would American manage to protect its Canadian Airlines
investment, but the company could get a huge bonus with the deal.
The airline industry is rapidly dividing up into global alliances,
which allow its members to jointly sell flights and share frequent
flier miles within the group. If the Onex deal is completed, the
new Air Canada is expected to switch from the Star Alliance,
dominated by United and Lufthansa, to Oneworld, the alliance formed
by American and British Airways. The move would enable American to
sell seats on flights to all the new airline's destinations in
Canada, leaving United without a partner there.
</P>
<P>
   United may have other ideas. The company said in a statement
released Tuesday that it ``firmly intended'' to monitor carefully
any developments on Onex's and American's offer to acquire Air
Canada.

USC'S MORTON IRKED BY PENALTIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The defense had another stellar performance and
the offense looked better in USC's second scrimmage Tuesday, but
senior tailback Chad Morton was hardly celebrating on the Coliseum
field.
</P>
<P>
   Morton was upset the offense committed 11 of the Trojans' 15
penalties in the 100-play scrimmage, and planned to call an
offensive-team meeting Tuesday night at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate having these talks, but we're going to have to,''
Morton said. ``It'll be interesting. A lot of people aren't happy.
Linemen, receivers, quarterbacks, running backs. That was a
terrible performance by us penalty-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Morton was disturbed that the Trojans' offense
does not seem to be ahead of the defense, which was a common
assumption heading into training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the same situation as last year,'' Morton said.
``The defense is carrying us and the offense is committing
penalties. It was supposed to be different this year. If we don't
get it right, it will be the same situation as last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense had its moments Tuesday. Specifically, quarterback
Carson Palmer, who seems better than last season. He completed 11
of 14 passes for 133 yards with two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Antoine Harris and a
34-yard scoring pass to Marcell Allmond, who led the Trojans with
50 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan McCullough led the tailbacks with 64 yards in 15 carries,
Morton had 25 yards in six carries and Frank Strong had 21 yards in
seven carries with two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Hackett was pleased with the offense's second effort,
even though he acknowledged it seems to lag behind the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put in the whole offense, you really muddle up the
works,'' Hackett said. ``I would like to be a little further along
than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the defense seems to be better than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about our defense, they play like wild men,''
Hackett said. ``They're always going. Our defense is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on cornerback Kevin Arbet continued to be a pleasant
surprise, deflecting two passes, recording a sack and making five
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The kicking game also improved, with David Bell making 29- and
26-yard field goals and David Newbury making a 46-yard attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Soward sprains knee: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward sprained his
right knee at the beginning of the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to go in and block for Chad,'' Soward said. ``The
coaches said I was too casual the last scrimmage. I don't think
it's swelling. I feel fine. I've never sprained it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux making move: It sounds like freshman cornerback Darrell
Rideaux seems to be challenging Kris Richard for a starting
cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 2 cornerback, Darrell Rideaux, could end up starting
as a freshman,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell out: Junior college transfer Craig Mitchell, a wide
receiver from West Los Angeles College, did not satisfy his summer
academic requirements and will not be admitted to USC. Mitchell's
absence means junior walk-on Matt Nickels becomes USC's sixth
receiver.

WOODWARD SEES ONLY SMOOTH SAILING FOR M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If there is an air of toxicity surrounding the
Mariners, Woody Woodward does not smell it.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the club's vice president of baseball operations said
Tuesday, the torpor surrounding the state of the M's is not a whole
lot different from a what's happening in other towns whose team is
not the Yankees, Mets, Indians or Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it has been that way all around baseball this
year,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm sitting up here in my ivory tower, but I don't sense
a crisis. It's been business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if you look at the Mariners compared with the likes of
the Dodgers, Angels or Orioles, it is easier to understand
Woodward's sense of relative calm.
</P>
<P>
   From where he sits _ be it the ivory tower or the owners' suite
_ it's tough to feel as if the ship is unmoored. At least Woodward
is only responsible for a $53 million payroll underwriting a .500
club and not a budget-busting $68 or $80 million shipwreck, such as
in Los Angeles, Baltimore or Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, questions about accountability persist, as does
speculation about whether the move to the new ballpark will ignite
a fire under Mariners ownership to take more aggressive control of
the club.
</P>
<P>
   A shakeup all along the Mariners food chain is possible _
especially since one major owner, 60-year-old Howard Lincoln, has
announced his impending retirement from Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the heavies in ballpark negotiations, Lincoln is
believed to have an interest in assuming a more active role in the
club's operations.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Woodward is able to refute rumors and beat back
talk of at least some changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous'' was the word Woodward used to describe talk that
Mariners manager Lou Piniella's job is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read in USA Today (and later told of comments from former
Cardinals shortstop and TV analyst Ozzie Smith that Piniella should
be fired) and I think it's nonsense. I don't understand how people
can comment from that far away. Lou is as strong as he's ever been.
The drive is there. He does like to win, but so do all of us,''
Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense that the organization will be very strong and we'll
move in a positive direction for the future. This talk of Lou is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   As for speculation that Mariners chairman and ownership front
man John Ellis is preparing to step down, Woodward said it does not
necessarily mean it is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read John Ellis' comments that he did not intend to go
on forever. But he is highly regarded around baseball for the way
he represents our ownership,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on opening night of Safeco Field last month, baseball
commissioner Bud Selig gave an impassioned vote of confidence for
Ellis and the Mariners owners for their role in saving baseball in
Seattle and for getting the new stadium built _ albeit under
crisis-mode tactics that have alienated many and perhaps
permanently damaged ownerships' standing as the saviors of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But if there are changes in the wings, Woodward is not privy to
information. Still, he does not suspect he and Piniella won't be
around to retool the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   With Piniella signed through 2000 and with the offseason tango
with Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez looming, it may indeed be
an awkward time for a major shakeup, especially if, as Woodward
suggests, the club finally is in position to make free agent
acquisitions and reconfigure for the larger outdoor ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization is in the strongest position it has ever
been in,'' Woodward said. ``We're going to bring in all the scouts,
all the player development people and show them the new stadium and
then send everyone back out into the field with a real positive
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Woodward said scouts are out looking now at teams for
offseason deals, though none are in advance of a possible trade for
Griffey or Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at any deal at this point for Ken Griffey or
Alex Rodriguez. Our objective is to see that they stay here,''
Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   It is partly his job to keep them here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ... strengthen the club for next year. We've got
pieces in place and we're going to add to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said he has not been given a budget for next season.
However, there is reason to consider that payroll could get bumped
up beyond the $53 million Woodward was held to this season.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance for Safeco Field already is past 1 million. In fact,
when the Mariners hit the million mark after just 23 games at
Safeco, they set a major league record.
</P>
<P>
   Although ownership still is asking the Public Facilities
District to divert additional tax revenues to pay for $60 million
of the stadium's $100 million in cost overruns, they will be making
money at Safeco Field _ a point neither Rodriguez's agent nor fans
are willing to let the Mariners forget.
</P>
<P>
   From where Woodward sits, there is still time for him to right
the Mariners ship. At least he's planning on it.

COUNTY OKS BAN ON GUN SALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in a
3-2 vote Tuesday took the first step toward banning sales of guns
and ammunition at the county Fairplex in Pomona and at other county
venues.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came over the protests of a company that operates a gun
show at the Fairplex, vendors at the show and gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will now get into the litigation aspect of this,'' said
Karl Amelang, president of Great Western Shows, Inc., which has put
on the gun show for 31 years, the past 22 at the Fairplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no alternative,'' Amelang said. The ban will
``seriously destroy the Great Western show as it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-times-a-year show is the largest of its kind in the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Gloria
Molina carried the ban against the opposition of Supervisors
Michael D. Antonovich and Don Knabe. A second vote, expected next
week, is needed to fully enact the ban, which will go into effect
30 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rouss, executive director of Jewish Community Centers of
Los Angeles, recalled the Aug. 10 attack on the North Valley Jewish
Community Center in Granada Hills in urging the board to pass the
law. Admitted attacker and white supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow
Jr. reportedly bought one or more firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls had been peppered with bullets,'' Rouss said. ``It's
only by the grace of God no one was killed at the Jewish Community
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Children at the center are still afraid of the ``monster,'' and
they still cringe when helicopters fly over, fearing the
``monster'' is back, Rouss said. ``You have to protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   A succession of gun owners and vendors criticized the law before
the board vote, saying it would only punish many law-abiding gun
show patrons to thwart a tiny percentage of lawbreaking vendors and
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   But the board majority wasn't swayed by ban opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun violence has ravaged this country,'' said Yaroslavsky.
``To sit back and do nothing . . . is to be complicit with what is
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepped-up security at the events put on by Great Western Shows
at the Fairplex in May and July failed to stop illegal activity, he
said. In May, undercover state agents ran out of money buying
illegal weapons at the show and in July federal agents set up a
later off-site purchase of 10 Sten guns and two Browning automatic
rifles, all illegal, from a show vendor, Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion: We cannot adequately police these shows,'' he
said. In expressing support for the ban, Sheriff Lee Baca made a
similar comment, saying ``we have a problem we can't control.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ Over at 23rd and Fifth Avenue, there's a fellow who
wears an old Astros cap who will sell you a watch that looks like a
Rolex but costs just $20.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a finely crafted piece of jewelry he's peddling. It's
fool's gold. Costume jewelry. The slightest bump or drop, the
slightest problem, and springs and sprockets might fly everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This thought comes to mind only because the guys in the Astros
caps at Shea Stadium on Tuesday night seemed on the verge of seeing
the springs and sprockets fly yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure of a good opponent and a loud crowd, the
Astros again were in a familiar, previously unkind situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think that you'll hold your own with the good
clubs,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``Lately, we haven't
done that. That's why it was an important game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Tuesday night's 5-1, 10-inning victory over the Mets
might have been the biggest win of the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros didn't just finally break through against an
upper-echelon team after losing 17 of the previous 21 against the
Braves, Reds, Diamondbacks and these Mets, including Monday night's
3-2 heartbreaker. But they did it in typical Astros style _ coming
up with the key hit in the 10th and exploding for four runs.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with the kind of pitching they've had all season and
the kind of clutch hitting rarely seen of late against good
opponents. And they did it despite having to sprinkle the lineup
card with even more costume jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play in a big series, you certainly don't want to lay
over,'' said first baseman Jeff Bagwell, whose three-run home run
in the 10th sealed the victory after Ricky Gutierrez's game-winning
single scored Tony Eusebio. ``We never laid over in Atlanta, but
we've said it all year: The team you've seen most of the time this
year really hasn't been our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team Dierker trotted out Tuesday was hardly recognizable
compared to the opening-day lineup. The players wore Astros caps,
and certainly there were familiar faces in key spots _ namely the
pitcher's mound, where Mike Hampton was marvelous, and on the right
side of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   But even by 1999's just-tape-it-up-and-play standards, this
Astros team looked like anything but the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers was sent home to Houston earlier in the day to take
a cortisone shot in his lower back. Center fielder Glen Barker was
deemed unfit to contribute because of soreness in his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was news before game time that outfielder Richard
Hidalgo would undergo knee surgery this week and be lost for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the game began with two starters in the outfield _ Lance
Berkman and Daryle Ward _ you never expected to see in the same
outfield this soon in their careers. Rest assured, Ward and Berkman
look like future gamers. But this was a big game at a critical time
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think of ourselves as an offensive club, but we're
just not the same club we were last year,'' Dierker said. ``The
stats really won't show that we've scored a lot of runs. It's just
been so tough keeping guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It got to the point in this one that in the ninth inn

SCHOOL BELIEVES SECURITY COMES FROM CARING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Forget security guards and metal detectors,
students and faculty at St. Genevieve High School in the Panorama
City community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley started the
school year figuring out how to get along with each other better.
</P>
<P>
   Juniors and seniors put away their textbooks to paint welcome
signs, write greeting letters for freshmen and learn friendship
songs _ all building up to a surprise for ninth-graders who start
school Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our version of security,'' said Dan Horn, the school's
new principal. ``I never understood the obsession with metal
detectors. You should be teaching educators and kids how to deal
with rage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of Horn's dramatic departure from the national
preoccupation with metal detectors, surveillance cameras,
identification tags and armed guards aimed at preventing bloodshed
at schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might keep guns out with metal detectors, but you won't
keep the rage out,'' Horn said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two Columbine High School students who attacked their
Littleton, Colo., classmates left notes that detailed their
feelings of alienation. At St. Genevieve, the goal is to make the
school experience inclusive for all students by ``fortifying their
hearts'' and creating a campus that values every student, Horn
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, deeply rooted morale problems seem
to have disappeared, students said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is throwing random insults anymore. We should have
started this way back,'' said 16-year-old Myrel Catbagan. ``On the
first day, I thought it would be another boring, stupid day. But
now I really feel like this is my school.''
</P>
<P>
   The juniors and seniors broke into small groups and talked about
how to deal with problems that can grow into rage and how to treat
every student with dignity and respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about how society creates criminals out of men and
boys because we are taught not to express our feelings,'' said
16-year-old junior Muriel Tovar. ``We're learning how to express
those feelings and listen to other people who need to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Some new St. Genevieve teachers at first were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think the kids would be receptive to opening up and
talking about feelings,'' said world religions teacher Peter
Sabado. ``But I'm very surprised with the unity and character
building that's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabado has always believed that extra security and metal
detectors were just a Band-Aid that does nothing to prevent youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have issues they need to talk about, and they need to
know they can talk to teachers and other students and feel
accepted,'' Sabado said.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Altamira, 16, spent most of Tuesday morning painting
greeting posters for the freshman class, with great anticipation of
a better school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anything like Columbine to happen here,'' she
said. ``I've got a really good feeling about this school this year.
I feel accepted and wanted. I hope we leave a mark that stays
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's atmosphere is vastly different. Students described a
years-long atmosphere of strict discipline and an administration
that didn't seem to respect students, on top of the lure of the
gang and drug culture typical of any urban neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Cisneros said in his freshman year he ``hung out with the
wrong crowd,'' and met some of his classmates by insulting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I changed because I saw I could have so many more
friends if I treated them right, and I found myself opening up,''
Cisneros said. ``But after I changed, the old principal and some of
the teachers kept treating me like a bad kid. No one noticed that I
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros credits Horn with re-creating a positive atmosphere and
making students feel important, accepted and respected _ all this
in the first week of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that stereotype of me is gone and that I'm
accepted,'' Cisneros said. ``It feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is the poster child for what Horn is trying to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``With having these focus groups and being positive, we are
setting a new foundation built on character,'' Horn said. ``When
you put character and issues of human spirit first, the grades,
accomplishments, morale and everything else follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on campus, students and faculty members joined to
build their school anew.
</P>
<P>
   They helped janitors clean closets and throw away years of
debris. Horn, who believes in the therapeutic effects of animals on
humans, brings his dog, Blue, to school with him every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a stray I found at my last school, and I found the kids
loved it when he ran around campus,'' Horn said. ``He's been a hit
here so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rebirth of the campus community is what stands out the
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of threatening us not to be violent or bad, the
teachers are trusting us with everything ... and they keep trusting
us,'' said 16-year-old Monica Monterroza. ``It really makes us want
to be better and do better.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the freshmen arrive Thursday, there will be no hazing,
ignoring or insults. Only greetings with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want all of the students to feel the same way we do. We
want to really welcome the freshmen,'' said 16-year-old Jellyn
Dungo. ``Everything is fresh this year _ new coaches, teachers,
principals _ I never thought there could be such a dramatic change
here.''

INTEREST RATES UP QUARTER POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could soon be paying more to finance a new car, borrow money
for business, take out a home equity loan for your kids' education
or pay for a dream vacation with your credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a
point Tuesday to cool the nation's booming economy. The move, which
was expected, will make it more costly for Americans to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   The hike to 5.25 percent was in the overnight bank lending rate,
also called the federal funds rate. The closely watched number is a
bench mark for interest rates throughout the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase could push a small number of people holding on by
their fingernails over the edge because it will drive up their loan
payments,'' Arizona economist Elliott Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, it won't slam the brakes on the economy.
Instead, it will serve as a tap on those brakes so inflation
doesn't get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Home shoppers shouldn't immediately panic because mortgage rates
are tied more closely to different indicators and have already gone
up in anticipation of this hike.
</P>
<P>
   But a family with $4,000 in credit card debt could easily pay
another $20 a year in interest charges.
</P>
<P>
   People buying new cars could be stuck with rates 0.10 to 0.15 of
a percentage point higher than this week's average of 8.22 percent,
and home equity loans will likely rise almost a quarter of a
percentage point, reaching above 9 percent, according to
Bankrate.Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have any loans with variable rates, you will feel it,''
said John Erickson, president of Consumer Credit Counseling
Services Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the move is good news for savers. Rising rates
typically translate into better yields on savings and certificates
of deposits.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home its efforts to fight inflation, the Fed also
raised the discount rate, the interest that it charges for direct
loans to banks, by a quarter of a point as well.
</P>
<P>
   The discount rate was increased to 4.75 percent, its first hike
since February 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks like Bank One quickly followed the Fed's rate
increases with their own. Many lenders moved their prime rates up
from 8 percent to 8.25 percent on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's boost to rates comes on the heels of a similar increase
on June 30, which was the first such move by the Fed since March
1997.
</P>
<P>
   That hike was made to start slowing the country's growth before
inflation skyrocketed, but seems to have had little effect, thus
precipitating the second increase.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 310,000 jobs were created across the country in July,
many more than economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   During the same time, the average annual earnings of workers
increased 0.5 percent, the biggest gain since January. And new and
existing home sales jumped nationwide and in the Phoenix area
during July to nearly record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Also U.S. car and truck sales rose by 100,000 vehicles, to 17.1
million, during the month.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say much of the Fed's recent hike has already
been built into current rates for cars and home loans.
</P>
<P>
   Even with expected slowing from the rate hikes, the U.S. economy
is still on track to grow 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the nation in growth for the past few years,
metropolitan Phoenix is slightly behind at about 3.5 percent growth
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, that growth, which is keeping unemployment low, is what
worried the Fed enough to raise rates. It didn't want companies
desperate for employees trying to lure them with higher wages that
drive up prices and ultimately bring on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise in rates will cause the economy to slow, but it's
been slowing to more moderate growth for the past six months
anyway,'' said Dan Anderson, research administrator at the Arizona
Department of Economic Security.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the Fed actions will vary by lender.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards and business loans tied to variable rates are
adjusted by lenders at different times during the years. Some banks
and credit card companies adjust monthly, while others pass along
rate increases or cuts only quarterly or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Home mortgage rates have been on a climb for the past six
months, hitting a two-year high of 8 percent earlier this month.
But Monday, they dropped back to about 7.75 percent, despite the
Fed's move on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are still historically low,'' said Jay Butler,
director of Arizona State University's Real Estate Center.
</P>
<P>
   However, he called the recent increases a ``psychological
factor'' that could cause many people to buy before rates go much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area's booming home market has been on notice with
the rise in rates, but it hasn't slowed yet.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter of this year, there were 16,040 sales of
existing homes across the Phoenix area, beating last year's record
pace of 15,075 resales for the same time frame.
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Brown's ``Phoenix Housing'' ``Market Letter'' recently
reported that through May, 15,229 single-family building permits
had been issued. During the same period last year, 15,309 permits
were pulled Valley-wide, and last year set a record with 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When rates rise, it does knock out a sliver of the buyers in
the market,'' said home building analyst David Thikoll with the
Meyers Group.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, as long as jobs keep being created in metro
Phoenix, people will be in the market for homes.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate in the Phoenix area dropped to 3 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Whether interest rates keep moving up depends on what this hike
does to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Fed after the increase might sound like
good news to some consumers worried about their loan payments
taking another jump this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday's increase in the federal funds rate, together with
the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more
generally in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should
markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward,'' the
monetary governing agency stated.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are betting it will be the last interest rate
increase this year because inflation is not out of control. &QL;

Martinez's homer in 11th spoils Rangers' comeback, rookie's debut 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Necessity forced the Rangers to place
left-hander Corey Lee in a position no 24-year-old rookie deserved
to be in his major-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whom the Rangers recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma yesterday
afternoon, surrendered a game-winning, three-run homer to first
baseman Tino Martinez with two outs in the 11th inning of the New
York Yankees' 10-7 victory last night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Lee replaced closer John Wetteland, who pitched two scoreless
innings, and worked himself into trouble by allowing shortstop
Derek Jeter to reach on a one-out walk and surrendering a single to
right fielder Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Lee retired center fielder Bernie Williams for the inning's
second out and came within a strike of escaping the inning
unscathed, but Martinez crushed a 3-2 fastball to deliver the
game-winning blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No choice,'' manager Johnny Oates said of inserting Lee in a
pressure situation against the defending world champions.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees right-hander Ramiro Mendoza (6-7) earned the victory
with two scoreless innings in relief, and closer Mariano Rivera
earned his 36th save with a scoreless 11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was more indicative how our ballgames have gone the
last few years \Ragainst the Yankees\S,'' Rangers left fielder
Rusty Greer said. ``Nip and tuck and well-played, but in the end
they find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that first baseman Lee Stevens, perhaps the Rangers'
unsung hero of this 1999 season, would be the one who rode to the
rescue with his dramatic, two-out at-bat during the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who entered last night's game hitting .228 (21-for-92)
during his past 24 games, crushed a 1-1 curveball from left-hander
Mike Stanton and sent it on a game-tying, 409-foot journey that
presented center fielder Bernie Williams no play.
</P>
<P>
   The solo home run snapped Stanton's streak of 14 scoreless
appearances spanning 14 innings and gave the Rangers an opportunity
for victory in the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin opened the inning with a single off right-hander
Mendoza and advanced 90 feet on the sacrifice bunt by Mark
McLemore. Mendoza recovered, though, and retired catcher Ivan
Rodriguez and Greer without Goodwin advancing to force the game
into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Long before then, though, the Rangers teased the 39,727
spectators at the Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The first inning unfolded unlike it did during the Yankees' 21-3
victory Monday, and Morgan received an ovation from those at The
Ballpark after a 1-2-3 frame that included a strikeout of Jeter,
the Yankees' All-Star shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers responded during the bottom half of the inning with
a four-run outburst against right-hander David Cone, who
surrendered a two-run homer to Greer and a run-scoring double to
Todd Zeile. Stevens also drove in a run with a one-out ground ball
that scored Rafael Palmeiro from third.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, though, squandered that four-run advantage and more
during a sobering second inning that included a three-run homer by
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who gave the the Yankees a 5-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad pitch,'' Oates said. ``You can't throw that pitch
there. That's a night you need four or five shutout innings. You
can't turn right around and give five back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, though, reciprocated by surrendering a rare, leadoff home
run to Goodwin, who lined a 3-1 fastball into the right-field seats
for his second of the season. Cone retired the next two batters,
but Greer reached on a two-out double and scored on the ensuing
single by right fielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   That would be all for Cone, who recorded only five outs during
his shortest appearance since a 1997 start against the Rangers at
The Ballpark. Left-hander Allen Watson replaced Cone and proved
much more effective by pitching 4 1/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan rebounded with scoreless third and fourth innings, but a
leadoff double by Knoblauch in the fifth inning prompted Oates to
turn to his bullpen and summon left-hander Mike Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro retired Jeter for the inning's first out before issuing
a walk to to O'Neill and surrendering consecutive run-scoring
singles to Williams and Martinez, which gave the Yankees' a 7-6
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating when you don't win against anybody,'' Greer
said. ``But we haven't fared well against the Yankees the last two
years, and that can make it even more frustrating.''

MARTINEZ SERVES UP K RATIONS TO TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-TWINS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By LARRY WHITESIDE 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ If Pedro Martinez hasn't got a lot to say about
his life these days, no one should be offended. It simply means he
wants to let his pitching do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night it sent a powerful message: For the rest of
the season, the Red Sox righthander is going to be all business as
he leads his team on the American League wild-card trail. He struck
out 15 batters in a 7-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins before
12,332 at the Metrodome, and when was over, he calmly called it
``just another day at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was electric out there,'' said Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``He had good tempo. Good command. All his pitches were
around the plate. It was a great outing for Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 6-2 loss to Oakland last outing, there was no
telling what was on the mind of the can't-miss Cy Young candidate.
Over the weekend, he decided to keep to himself and ignore the
media herd that is always around him. Tuesday night, he wiped off
the smile that is usually on his face and went after the Twins like
a surgeon. His knife was razor-sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit my spots well,'' he would say. ``I had command of
myself, and I had my good stuff today. Good offense early in the
game and good defense. That's pretty much it _ what we need to win
games.''
</P>
<P>
   In recording his 18th victory of the season, Martinez worked
eight innings and threw 108 pitches. He allowed just four hits and
walked one.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 15 strikeouts came in the sixth inning and resulted
in the batter reaching third. Jacque Jones struck out on a wild
pitch, and when Jason Varitek's throw to first got away down the
right field line, Jones wound up with two extra bases. He soon
scored the Twins' run on a ground out, but no matter. Martinez
struck out two more batters in the inning to make up for the one
that got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out there and do the best I can,'' said Martinez.
``That's what I try to do all the time. It was a normal outing. It
was a great game but so many times in my career I've had many like
that. It's no big deal. Just one game. Now we have to worry about
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the 13th time that Martinez reached double figures in
strikeouts this season, breaking the team record set by Roger
Clemens in 1988. Martinez has struck out 10 or more 41 times in his
career, 21 times in two seasons with the Red Sox. At one point he
struck out seven batters in a row, one short of another Clemens
team record set on the 20-strikeout night of April 29, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Boston started fast, with two runs in the second off Jason Ryan,
who was making his major league debut. In the fifth, a walk to
Nomar Garciaparra and doubles by Mike Stanley and Jason Varitek led
to three more runs. Darren Lewis doubled and scored in the sixth,
and in the eighth, Trot Nixon finished the scoring with his second
home run in as many nights. Donnie Sadler, filling in for John
Valentin at third base, drove in his first two runs of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're swinging a little better,'' said Williams, ``and got
some key hits. Sadler's base hit up the middle in the second was a
big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every win counts,'' said Martinez. ``We're close in the
wild-card race with the other team. Hopefully at the end of the
year we'll be there and someone else will be going home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing the schedule,'' said Williams. ``You don't get
too high if things are going one way for you. You don't get too low
if you run into a barrier. You just keep playing hard out there.
That's the way these kids play. We came off a tough three games in
Texas. We were able to rebound against this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also rebounded. That's the general idea. Tomokazu Okha
pitched the ninth and there were no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to keep me healthy for the rest of the season
and hopefully for the next season,'' said Martinez. ``The game was
one-sided. No need for me to be out there and overdo. I was at my
pitch limit. I think it was the best decision.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Sometimes victories are hidden in the most unlikely
places _ such as the legs of a slow-footed catcher, or maybe even
the bat of a struggling hitter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wherever good fortune chooses to hang out these days is fine
with the Astros, who finally had a few things go their way at the
end of a close game against a good team.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez's 10th-inning single scored Tony Eusebio and
sparked a four-run rally in the Astros' 5-1 victory over the New
York Mets at Shea Stadium on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez is hitting only .200 with two RBIs in nine games since
being activated from the disabled list. That explains why Mets
manager Bobby Valentine instructed reliever Dennis Cook (10-3) to
walk Craig Biggio intentionally after Cook fell behind in the
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to be in that situation,'' Gutierrez said. ``Anyone
would walk Biggio to get to me in that situation, so that's
understandable. But when you've missed as many games (63 because of
injuries) as I have, it's a good feeling to do something to help
the team win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros increased their National League Central lead to 1{
games over Cincinnati, which lost 6-4 at Atlanta. The Mets fell 1{
games behind the Braves in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio started the rally with an end-of-the-bat double to right
field that Astros manager Larry Dierker called a ``reverse
blooper,'' an obvious reference to the previous day when the Mets
won on a similar hit to left.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio legged out a double and, more impressively, advanced to
third base on Russ Johnson's average-depth fly ball to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Russ hit that ball, I was like, `uh-oh,''' Gutierrez
said. ``Subie's baserunning was a big plus in that inning. It seems
like he turns his speed up an extra notch when he needs to. If
Subie doesn't make it to third on that ball, it's a different
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more aware of that than Eusebio, whose pinch-hit
double ended a hitless streak off the bench that had reached six
at-bats. Eusebio had fixed his mind to advance to third base even
before he heard third-base coach Mike Cubbage yelling, ``Come!
Come! Come!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear that very often,'' Eusebio said. ``In that
situation, you have to do anything you can to get a win. I hadn't
played the whole game, so I was fresh. Even if Cubby hadn't said
anything, I was going to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gutierrez drove home Eusebio, Jeff Bagwell all but took
away the possibility of a Mets comeback with a three-run homer to
right field. The home run moved Bagwell ahead of Jose Cruz as the
Astros' all-time RBI leader with 943. Earlier this season, Bagwell
became the club's all-time home-run leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about all those things,'' Bagwell said. ``That's
not my focus. My focus is on helping us win a ballgame. I hope that
wasn't my last RBI for the Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner pitched two scoreless innings to get the win in
relief of Mike Hampton, who by all rights should have at least 19
wins. Instead, he's stuck on 16. Hampton pitched superbly, allowing
one run on five hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   In his last three outings, Hampton has allowed seven earned runs
in 22 innings but has gotten no decision each time. The only run
Hampton allowed Tuesday came on Mike Piazza's solo home run in the
seventh, the catcher's eighth long ball in his last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake to a pretty good hitter, but I was pretty
happy with the way I pitched,'' Hampton said. ``Sometimes you get
the runs, and sometimes you don't. The big thing is that we won the
game. This is a tough team, and we're fortunate to come out of here
with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner (3-1) retired all six batters he faced, two on
strikeouts. The Mets should consider themselves lucky to have
caught Wagner on a night when his good fastball was only about 94
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got tremendous pitching,'' Dierker said. ``Hampton was
really gritty, and Wagner had a little stiffness in his back, so he
wasn't throwing 100 mph. But he was still tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros ran into a hot pitcher in Mets starter Masato Yoshii,
who has a 1.61 ERA in his last three starts. Yoshii held the Astros
to five hits and a run in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't seem to matter how well a pitcher has been
throwing when Carl Everett steps into the batter's box. Accounts of
Everett's exploits are becoming repetitive, but amazing
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   His prodigious second-inning solo home run traveled an estimated
459 feet _ just 43 feet shorter than Mark McGwire's monster shot
Sunday at Shea Stadium. Everett has homered in each of his last
four games, which is one game shy of Cliff Johnson's club record
set in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   What are the odds of Everett tying the record? He has 10 homers
in his last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from me, that's kind of surprising, because I don't
consider myself to be that type of player,'' Everett said. ``But
like I've been saying, I'm not trying to figure out why the home
runs keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros no doubt feel the same way about victories.

RELIEVERS ARE NEEDED MEDICINE, BUT RANGERS MANAGER FLIRTING WITH
OVERDOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ By the end of the second inning last night,
the New York Yankees' icon of perfection, David Cone, had taken his
tired arm to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Promise held the night. Unfortunately, in turn, the Rangers'
Mike Morgan couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when you try to ride the nightly roller
coaster known as the Rangers' starting pitching. Some nights they
take your breath away. Some nights they simply make you scream.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates, alas, doesn't do screams. But he does
appear to shift and squirm a lot. Invariably, he calls the bullpen.
They are the aspirin to Oates' anxious season. They are his version
of dialing 911.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson knows. He was once on the answering end of a lot
of those calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 season, Patterson was the rage of the Rangers'
bullpen. Appearing in 54 games, he worked 71 innings as the
bullpen's right-handed set-up man.
</P>
<P>
   But something was wrong. Something was happening inside
Patterson's arm. He spent 23 days, beginning in late May, on the
disabled list, but he returned and kept pitching. On Sept. 30 of
that year, Patterson underwent surgery to correct a torn labrum and
rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers the Patterson of '97 will tell you that he
hasn't been the same pitcher since.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday, Danny Patterson got a different call.
</P>
<P>
   Optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma, he didn't leave in a blaze of
curses and burning bridges. He did as he was told, just like he did
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case you're keeping score at home, in 1997 Patterson
worked in 54 games. Jeff Zimmerman's relief appearance last night
was his 53rd. Patterson pitched 71 innings two seasons ago;
Zimmerman is pushing 76.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into a bullpen contest with the Yankees these days is
little more than baseball's Russian roulette. They have the
bullets. You only have the aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing to do here is to point the finger at Oates. So,
let's please do.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman is such a fairy-tale story this season, such a raw and
promising talent, that the notion of him ending up with a surgeon's
scar, riding that same bus as Patterson, should scare all Rangers
fans silly.
</P>
<P>
   For Oates, it's a lose-lose situation. He wants to win, and with
a new owner watching him from the front row, Oates probably has to.
</P>
<P>
   So, he tells pitching coach Dick Bosman to pick up the phone.
Zimmerman wears No. 59, but it had just as soon be 911.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, Oates would be like Joe Torre. When the TV
cameras pan to show the Yankees manager in the dugout, Torre often
looks like a foreman scanning the factory. His stomach doesn't
growl, because when you're the Yankees, you can just push another
button.
</P>
<P>
   When the same cameras catch Oates, his mind seems to be
whirring. Plates are spinning. Will Morgan or John Burkett go five
innings tonight _ or just three?
</P>
<P>
   Oates' antidote, of course, is a simple one. Better, more
consistent starting pitching means a less-stressed bullpen. Morgan,
whose hot start has vanished in the rockets' red glare of August,
might be pitching his way out of the major leagues. Last night, he
squandered the home team's four-run first inning and, by the fifth
inning, had blown the lead entirely and was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Let me suggest that any team that can't take advantage of
scoring six runs in the first two innings off David Cone deserves
its extra-innings fate. But there's that roller coaster again.
Oates, surely, would prefer a simple merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   The price of aspirin is a steep one. Danny Patterson, headed for
the minor leagues, can testify to that.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans want to win. The manager has to.

MARTINEZ'S 3-RUN SHOT SPURS YANKS TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Many of the Yankees wore expressions of
regret after Monday night's game against the Texas Rangers,
shrugging smiles. Tino Martinez had four hits and grimaced like
a10-year-old who plugged his big brother in the face with a
snowball. Hey, sorry about that.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry that the Yankees scored 21 runs and the Rangers scored 3;
the 18-run difference was the worst in the history of the Texas
franchise, and 21 runs the most they had ever allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to play when it gets out of hand like that,''
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's awful when that happens. They went out and scored 10
more Tuesday night, Martinez blasting a three-run homer in the 11th
inning for a 10-7 victory. The Yankees (77-48) have won three
straight, and the first two games in this series against Texas, a
team they may face in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 7-6, with two outs in the eighth inning, and
Mike Stanton _ who had not allowed a run this month _ was pitching,
with the closer Mariano Rivera warming up to throw the ninth.
Everything was in order. But Lee Stevens mashed a game-tying home
run, the ball barely clearing the wall in center field; Stanton
turned away and stared off in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramiro Mendoza shut out the Rangers in the 9th and 10th
innings, forcing the Rangers to go to their sixth reliever in the
11th inning _ Corey Lee, a left-hander making his major league
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter walked with one out, Paul O'Neill laced a single,
and after a groundout moved the runners to second and third,
Martinez smashed his home run, his 20th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone lasted just one and two-thirds innings, his shortest
outing of the year. Cone struggled with his command and allowed
four runs in the first inning, and two more in the second inning
before he was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   His fastball again reached 88 miles an hour and Cone threw all
of his breaking pitches, so there isn't really any question of
whether he's healthy. It may be that, at age 36, Cone needs a
little more rest. While pitching with four days' rest this year,
Cone has a 4.46 ERA, far higher than his 1.92 ERA when pitching
with five or more days' rest _ a common thread over the last four
months of the 1998 season, when his ERA with four days' rest was
3.79, and 1.57 when working with five or more days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday night, when Cone was getting blistered, the
Yankees' Joe Torre managed as if he knew his team would come back.
Torre usually positions his infielders in with a runner at third
and fewer than two out in the early innings. But even after the
Yankees fell behind, 3-0, in the first, Torre kept his infielders
back and conceded a run on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees rebounded right away, scoring five runs against
Mike Morgan in the second, the rally capped by Knoblauch's 13th
home run. Allen Watson relieved Cone in the bottom of the second
inning, and while he shut out the Rangers through the sixth inning,
the Yankees added two runs; Bernie Williams and Martinez had
back-to-back run-scoring singles. Texas Manager Johnny Oates, who
used five relievers Monday, went deep into his bullpen again
Tuesday, using six relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton replaced Watson in the seventh, shut out the Rangers in
the seventh and struck out Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile to start
the eighth. But then Steven bashed the home run to center, tying
the game _ the first run allowed by Stanton in 15 appearances. The
Yankees and Rangers played into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Just about every Yankee slump has been cured in these two games.
Girardi had been without a hit in his last 17 at-bats, and in one
game, increased his season's RBI production by 54 percent, moving
from 13 RBI to 20. Scott Brosius had just two hits in his previous
37 at-bats coming into this series, and he had four hits and drove
in seven runs in the first two games. Martinez had been 3 for 21,
and he is 6 for 10 in two games. Afterward, there was much talk _
through the embarrassed grins _ of how helpful Monday's game was
for some of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte hadn't won here ever, compiling a 16.05 ERA, and
within the Yankees' organization there has been great concern that
Pettitte struggles to pitch well in front of the family and friends
who live in this part of the country. But after pitching eight
innings, he finally beat the Rangers in their own ball park. ``It
was nice for him,'' said Girardi, ``because now he can enjoy the
next two days with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi and Kim Girardi, his wife, are expecting the birth of
their first child Thursday, after many years of trying to have
children: Kim Girardi will be admitted to the hospital Wednesday,
and if all goes as expected, she will give birth the next day. Joe
Girardi is flying back to New York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Girardi had been concerned for her husband, who has
struggled offensively; he hadn't had a hit with runners in scoring
position in nearly a month. But even early in the day Monday, the
catcher felt as if good fortune belonged to him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   DEREK JETER, &UR;  &LR; the only Yankee &UR;  &LR; regular who has not hit well in
this series, engaged in a heated shouting match with LARRY YOUNG,
the plate umpire, after Jeter's at-bat in the sixth inning Tuesday
night. Jeter had expressed his displeasure with at least two of
Young's ball-strike interpretations, and after flying out, he and
Young began shouting at each other, and the first-base coach, JOSE
CARDENAL, &UR;  &LR; stepped in between as Jeter moved closer to Young. But
Jeter remained in the game.  &QL;

DONALD E. JOHNSON, 75, HEAD OF VETERANS ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Iowa)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald E. Johnson, who headed the Veterans Administration under
President Richard M. Nixon but resigned under pressure from
Congress and veterans' groups, died on Aug. 10 at a hospital in
Fredericksburg, Va., where he lived. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, said his son, Robert Johnson of
North Myrtle Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   During his five-year tenure at the Veterans Administration, from
1969 to 1974, Johnson, a World War II veteran, was forced to
grapple with budget tightening while the number of veterans was
increasing because of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1974, several members of Congress met at the White
House and urged Nixon to ask for Johnson's resignation. They said
he had mismanaged veterans' health, education and other benefits,
cut payments imprudently to appease the federal Office of
Management and Budget, encouraged employees to contribute to the
president's re-election campaign and loaded his staff with Nixon
campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson defended his record, and some in Congress felt that he
had been made a scapegoat for retrenchment policies imposed by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he resigned shortly after the White House meeting and
shortly before the grievances were to be aired at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   He later served as a deputy assistant secretary at the Commerce
Department and as chief of staff to Sen. Roger W. Jepsen, R-Iowa.
He was executive director of the National Credit Union
Administration from 1985 until he retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Edward Johnson was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on June 5,
1924. He attended Iowa State University. During World War II, he
was a sergeant in the 89th Division of Gen. George S. Patton's
Third Army in Europe. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was appointed as administrator of the Veterans
Administration in 1969, Johnson was a seed and fertilizer dealer in
West Branch, Iowa, and a national commander of the American Legion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Robert, Johnson is survived by his wife, Mary
Jean Johnson; five other sons, Alan, of Portland, Ore., David, of
Ocheyedan, Iowa, Brian, of Adel, Iowa, Kevin, of Des Moines and
Kurt, of Rochester; four daughters, Julie Johnson of Alexandria,
Joan Johnson of Ouray, Colo., Beth Johnson Buck of Fort Collins,
Colo., and Susan Johnson Vega of Milwaukee; 16 grandchildren, and a
great-grandson.

WALKER SAYS SPURS OFFERING TWO-YEAR, $5.6 MILLION PACT 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free agent Samaki Walker, who has spurned offers to re-sign with
the Mavericks, said Tuesday night that he has been offered a
two-year, $5.6 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He is
contemplating whether to accept that or to see if the Washington
Wizards will offer him a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of thinking to do tonight,'' Walker said. ``I
think it will be a heck of an opportunity to play for San Antonio.
They're the defending champions and a contending team that still
has great potential. I think I'll be able to go in and add some
more dimensions to their team.''
</P>
<P>
   The door flew open for Walker to sign with San Antonio on
Tuesday afternoon when Will Perdue told the Spurs he was going to
sign a free-agent contract with the Chicago Bulls. That left the
Spurs scampering for backup help on the front line, which is what
they hope the 6-foot-9, 258-pound Walker can provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to San Antonio, you would imagine I wouldn't be playing
40 minutes a game, and probably not 30 minutes a game,'' Walker
said. ``But they have a tremendous upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Antonio is a team that's definite about trying to make
something happen. They already have one \RNBA\S championship, and
they're definitely a championship potential team again.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Spurs, Walker, who played the previous three years with
the Mavericks, would be a backup power forward. Last year, 6-7
Malik Rose and Perdue shared that role, but now Perdue is off to
Chicago while Rose is expected to play small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Walker also said the Orlando Magic has been discussing a
sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks that would net him a
three-year contract worth nearly $12 million, while the Mavericks
would receive draft choices in return. But Mavericks coach/general
manager Don Nelson, who returned home yesterday from an 18-hour
flight from China, said he doesn't believe the Mavericks will be
involved in any sign-and-trade packages with Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best chance was with Orlando,'' Nelson said. ``And that's
fallen through now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson took exception to Walker saying last week that he will
not play for the Mavericks anymore, mainly because Nelson had made
business issues personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard he's been popping off at the mouth,'' Nelson said.
``But that's his choice \Rto leave the Mavericks\S, isn't it? But
I'm a little surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic coach Doc Rivers informed Walker's agent, Norm Nixon, not
to complete a deal until he gives Rivers an opportunity to make a
counter offer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even as Mitch Richmond was signing his four-year, $40
million free-agent contract with Washington yesterday, he was
singing Walker's praises while hoping the Wizards could find a way
to sign the former Louisville standout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would like to get Samaki Walker,'' Richmond said.
``He's a nice young prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he's going to do. It sounds like he's trying
to explore all opportunities for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker had dinner with Spurs coach/general manager Gregg
Popovich on Monday, and worked out for the team yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had a pretty good workout,'' Walker said. ``I don't
think they'll be calling and saying I was out of shape.''
Trent-Ceballos update Don Nelson would not deny nor confirm whether
he already has a deal with free-agent forward Gary Trent.
</P>
<P>
   But a source close to the situation said Trent will sign a
two-year, $4.2 million contract with the Mavericks this week.
Meanwhile, Nelson plans to talk to Fred Slaughter, the agent for
Cedric Ceballos, today.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos wants a four-year, $16 million deal, while Nelson has
offered a two-year, $8 million contract. Wang's status Despite not
being able to convince Chinese Army officials to release Wang
Zhizhi from his contract so he could play for the Mavericks this
season, Don Nelson hailed his trip to China a successful journey.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson drafted Wang on the second round of the June 30 NBA
Draft. But it is not known when _ if ever _ the 7-1 center will
play for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a chance to think about it, and they'll make a
decision as they go,'' Nelson said. ``But we're not in any hurry.
Whatever they decide, we'll work with them.'' \Ntagtop:Dwain Price,

<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis Ehrenkrantz, who started as a high school English teacher
and became a prominent stockbroker and Wall Street commentator,
died on Sunday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his company said. He was a partner and the
president of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc., a brokerage house he
founded in 1993 with Joan King and Irwin Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 40 years on Wall Street, Ehrenkrantz was a broker,
money manager, executive or partner at nearly a dozen firms. But he
was best known for his market commentary, which he offered on
television and radio; in articles published in Commentary, Forbes
and other magazines; in his own newsletter, the Ehrenkrantz Report,
and in a weekly column that appeared in The New York Post in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists frequently quoted his explanations of why the stock
market had gone up or down on a particular day. Even so, he urged
people to hold stocks as long-term investments and avoid
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenkrantz was born on June 17, 1934, in Newark. He graduated
from New York University in 1952, earned a master's degree in
English from Hunter College and taught at Charles Evans Hughes High
School on 18th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He shifted to Wall Street in the early 1960s, joining Merrill
Lynch. In those early years, he also was the host of a program on
WNYC, the public radio station, in which he interviewed writers and
theater people.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenkrantz is survived by his wife, Eleanor; three sons, Gil of
Bethesda, Md., David of Sharon, Mass., and Miles of Scarsdale; a
daughter, Pam Ehrenkranz Zur, of Stamford, Conn., and nine
grandchildren. &QL;

<P>
   Jack B. Jackson, 83, Ex-Chief at Penney
</P>
<P>
   Jack B. Jackson, a former chief executive of J.C. Penney Co.,
the retailer, died on Aug. 12 in Dallas, the company announced. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson began his 38-year career with Penney while still
attending Austin College in Sherman, Texas, his hometown, and at
one time he worked as a store manager there. Working his way up
through the company's ranks, he was named chief executive and
president in 1972 and held those posts until his retirement in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson earned a reputation as a hard-driving, ambitious
executive who relished trying to beat his superiors into the office
each morning. He is also remembered for focusing the clothing
chain's marketing efforts on women's fashion and for recruiting
women as store managers.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from college, Jackson worked for J.C. Penney
part time while also working as a high school teacher and athletic
director in his hometown. A J.C. Penney store manager later coaxed
Jackson into joining the company full time.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was a member of the United Way and the United Negro
College Fund and was a trustee of Austin College. After he retired,
he raised quarter horses at his ranch in Aubrey, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is survived by his daughter, Jackie Lee Jackson, and two
sons, Joe Monroe Jackson and James Kinsey Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ehrlich, 97, Backer of Kindergarten
</P>
<P>
   Harold Brown Ehrlich, a former Republican assemblyman from
upstate New York whose persistence made kindergarten a fixture in
New York public schools of the 1940s, died Aug. 11 at his
retirement home in Laguna Hills, Calif. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   A Buffalo lawyer, he entered the state Legislature in 1933 and
became the chief Assembly architect of the Ehrlich-Coudert bill,
which recognized a year of kindergarten before first grade as part
of the state's educational system. It had taken several years to
find the money for state support for kindergarten, but Gov. Herbert
H. Lehman signed the bill into law in April 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich was born in McKeesport, Pa., but was brought up in
Buffalo and graduated from the University of Buffalo Law School in
1922. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Western
District of New York from 1928 until his election to the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He left the Legislature at the end of 1944, when Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey appointed him an associate attorney for the state tax
commission in Erie County. He left that position in 1955 to serve
as general counsel and administrative director of the Erie County
Port Authority until 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich's survivors include two daughters, Sue Schwartz of
Rancho Mirage, Calif., and Carol Rae Ehrlich of Albuquerque, N.M.;
six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

U.S. TO ALLOW INMATE TO FINISH TERM IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Justice Department agreed Tuesday to allow a
woman convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in a 1981 triple
murder and armored car robbery to be transferred to Italy to serve
the remaining nine years of her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Silvia Baraldini, 51, is an Italian citizen who was
convicted in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in 1983 on charges
related to her involvement with a group of 1960s-era radicals. The
group engaged in a series of crimes, including a 1981 Brink's
armored car robbery in Rockland County that left a guard and two
police officers dead.
</P>
<P>
   She was also found guilty of involvement in a second armored car
robbery in Danbury, Conn., and of helping Joanne Chesimard, a
former member of a black militant group who was convicted of
killing a New Jersey State Police trooper, escape from a New Jersey
prison in 1979. In all of the cases, Ms. Baraldini was never
convicted of carrying out a violent act herself.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional hearing in U.S. Court in Manhattan that marked
the end of 10 years of negotiations, dozens of American and Italian
supporters of Ms. Baraldini packed the courtroom and cheered her
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baraldini, who has spent 16 years in prison and suffered
uterine cancer, spent several years in a special isolation unit in
a federal prison in Kentucky where her lawyers said she suffered
psychological harm. A judge ruled in 1988 that she was being
unjustly held in the unit because of her political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said she is to serve her sentence in Italy in
a manner ``similar'' to how she would have served it in a U.S.
prison.

DODGERS' JUDD CONTINUES TO MAKE A CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The more the Dodgers try to look past right-hander
Mike Judd, the more reasons he gives them to let him hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Judd, brought up to make a spot start two weeks ago, is still
alive and figures to remain in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson is leaning that way after Judd
allowed two runs in 51/3 innings of a 5-2 victory Tuesday night
against the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium. Judd (2-1) didn't
allow a hit until the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some other guys I'd like to look at, but maybe that
can wait,'' Johnson said. ``We'll just wait (on a decision), but he
kind of deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tops on Johnson's list is Triple-A Albuquerque lefty Jeff
Williams, who has pitched well since moving into the Dukes
rotation. Johnson had it set up so Williams could face the Chicago
Cubs during the upcoming homestand, but Judd's performance probably
earned him that start.
</P>
<P>
   Though Judd had one jam in the fifth, predicated by David
Nilsson's single that fell in front of a non-diving Devon White, he
held his composure and got out of it. The Brewers already had two
runs in and a man on first with none out. The Dodgers' lead was cut
to 3-2. But with two on and one out, Judd got Jeff Cirillo to
ground into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball came out of the lights, so I don't know how I caught
it,'' said Dodgers third baseman Jose Vizcaino, who started the
play. ``It was a big play. One that really helped him. He's a good
pitcher, and he was throwing strikes and getting a lot of ground
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield drove in two runs and Trenidad Hubbard hit his
first homer of the season to support Judd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a team effort and the kid threw the ball well,''
Johnson said. ``He went right after them. That was more like he did
the first time out (against Montreal). He's even quickened up to
the plate. Maybe he's relaxed a little more. His location was
good.''
</P>
<P>
   That Montreal start was supposed to be Judd's first and only.
But he allowed one run through the first six innings before tiring
in the seventh. That bought him a trip to Los Angeles and a start
against Florida. He allowed four runs in six innings in a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say the Dodgers didn't expect even a hint of success for
Judd, but when he was promoted he packed enough clothes for just a
few days. He's been living in a downtown hotel because it didn't
make sense for him to find anything permanent.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the Dodgers elect to keep Judd for another start,
which is now anticipated, he'll probably remain with the
organization for the rest of the season. Rosters expand Sept. 1,
which would be just about when Judd's spot in the rotation would
come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about whether I'm going to be here the next
time,'' Judd said. ``Right now, the pressure isn't really there
because we're not in a race. It's the opportunity I need.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a much different role than Judd had in other stints with
the Dodgers. After starting in the minors, he would go weeks
without pitching out of the bullpen for the Dodgers. And when he
did pitch, he often was lit up.
</P>
<P>
   Judd appeared in seven games last season and had a 15.09 ERA. He
wasn't the picture of success with Albuquerque this season, either.
He had control problems, both in and out of the strike zone. He
walked 47 in 1102/3 innings, and went 8-7 with a 6.67 ERA. But one
thing Judd did better in his last few minor-league starts was keep
the ball down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to going out and pitching that first inning instead
of the 10th, 11th or 12th,'' Judd said. ``I still get nervous,
still have butterflies. After the first couple of innings, I feel
good again and I'm ready to go.''

VIZCAINO IMPRESSES JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ With Adrian Beltre shelved with a bum ankle, Jose
Vizcaino started his third straight game at third Tuesday against
Milwaukee. It's the role manager Davey Johnson envisioned for
Vizcaino back in spring training when he talked about using him as
a utility infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino didn't exactly warm to it at first... or second or
third or shortstop. He wanted to play every day. And he still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got used to it yet,'' Vizcaino said. ``I have to
deal with it, but I haven't got used to it. I feel I can play every
day. I do what I have to do to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is Vizcaino is used to being an everyday player and
he's paid like it. He's making $3 million this season, which made
it tough to trade him in the offseason. But there was another
element. Johnson wanted Vizcaino's versatility in the infield and
the skipper believes Vizcaino has finally bought into being a
utility player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he's been in a lot better frame of mind the last
week or 10 days,'' Johnson said. ``Part of a team's success, any
team's success, is people settling into their roles and being the
best they can be at it to help the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Vizcaino and Mark Grudzielanek battled for the
shortstop's job in spring training, though the contest was weighted
in Grudzielanek's favor. Grudzielanek won the job but found himself
on the bench for extended periods during the early part of the
season while Vizcaino started at short.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Grudzielanek broke his right hand June 1 and missed 28
games, but Vizcaino played poorly and Grudzielanek regained his
spot when he was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have earned an everyday job, but he didn't play well
during that period,'' Johnson said. ``But he's much better ... and
to have the luxury of being able to put a guy in anywhere in the
infield _ and he can switch-hit _ that's a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena's problems: Not only is catcher Angel Pena, the Dodgers'
top prospect and touted as the club's catcher of the future,
serving a seven-game suspension for violating team rules in
Triple-A Albuquerque, but now his September call-up is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who spent three months with the Dodgers, had an MRI
performed on his injured elbow Tuesday and, even upon
reinstatement, is expected to miss a few weeks. Pena was diagnosed
with a strained forearm and is expected to miss ``a couple of
weeks,'' Dodgers trainer Charlie Strasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Runnin' the bases: For the first time since nixing hitting
right-handed, Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley started against a lefty,
Milwaukee's Scott Karl.... Former Dodgers lefty Carlos Perez
allowed two runs on eight hits in seven innings for a 5-4 win for
Triple-A Albuquerque against Vancouver. He struck out one and
walked three to record the win.... The Dodgers' seven stolen bases
Monday against the Brewers was one short of the franchise record.
Brooklyn stole eight on Aug. 22, 1948, against Boston, and Los
Angeles matched it Aug. 24, 1974, against St. Louis.... The Brewers
activated pitcher Hector Ramirez and placed catcher Bobby Hughes
(strained right elbow) on the 15-day disabled list.

ORTIZ IMPRESSIVE, BUT ANGELS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Ramon Ortiz has a future so bright the Angels are
holding their breath, knowing what happens when they express
optimism about someone or something.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortiz, the organization's most prized pitching prospect,
might even be good enough to overcome the hex that Anaheim built.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he allowed a two-run homer to Carlos Delgado in a
5-1 loss to Toronto in front of 21,492 at Edison Field, Ortiz's
second major-league start was still a success.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out eight in seven innings and limited the Blue Jays
to just six hits. Delgado won it in the sixth with his 36th homer,
but Ortiz (1-1) recovered and completed the seventh inning with the
Angels down only 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   His ERA rose from 1.13 to just 1.80. The same could not be said
for the Angels bullpen, who let the game get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored three runs in the eighth off Mike Holtz and
Mark Petkovsek. Shawn Green homered and Willie Greene had a two-run
double to put the game away. Blue Jays starter Pat Hentgen (8-10)
gave up one run and four hits in seven innings to earn the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Angels manager Terry Collins cautioned those
who would listen that Ortiz's first start (1 run, 4 hits, 8 innings
in a 9-2 win over the White Sox last Thursday) was just that _ one
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys in their first start are excited,'' Collins said. ``Let's
see this guy pitch a few more times before we put him in the Hall
of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, Ortiz struck out six and allowed only two
hits. Just one Blue Jays baserunner even got into scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth, the Blue Jays' big sticks finally got to
Ortiz. With two out and nobody on, Green, hitting .316 with 33
homers and 103 RBIs going into the game, singled to center. Next up
was Delgado, who now has 116 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado got a knee-high fastball on a 2-1 count and ripped it
into the right-field seats that gave the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz had only four strikeouts in eight innings in his debut
against the White Sox, but he started Tuesday's game by striking
out the first two batters he faced _ Shannon Stewart and Brian
McRae.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz got two more strikeouts in the second inning and another
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Following a one-out single by Darrin Fletcher in the second,
Ortiz retired nine consecutive batters before Tony Batista reached
on third baseman Troy Glaus' throwing error with one out in the
fifth. But Ortiz responded by retiring the next two hitters and
getting out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Green's two-out double in the first inning, no Blue
Jays baserunner even reached second base until Delgado's homer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Angels offense made it clear that Ortiz wasn't
going to get a lot to work with. The only run the Angels had
through seven innings off Hentgen came on Jim Edmonds' first-inning
homer. It was Edmonds' first home run of the season.

BUSINESSMAN GETS CHARGE FROM JELLY CORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's one of those products that makes closet
inventors hit their head and say, D'oh! Why didn't I think of that?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nostrant did and he's cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   His idea? Extension cords in 17 different colors. No, not
exactly a new computer operating system or biotech-engineered drug.
But his cords satisfy every Martha Stewart wannabe looking for a
way to hide the power cord running to their television.
</P>
<P>
   Got a fuchsia carpet? No problem, Nostrant's got a fuchsia cord.
Not only fuchsia, he's also got canary, powder pink, pewter and
amethyst as well as three Christmas-themed cords. He calls them his
Jelly Cords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a good idea when people said either they've
already seen it out there or why didn't I think of that?,''
Nostrant said.
</P>
<P>
   His company, SNS International in Tarzana, sells them to big
retailers such as Linens 'N Things and Bed Bath and Beyond as well
as scores of smaller stores. The cords are priced from $1.99 to
$2.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tapped into a need where people recognize they want an
attractive living room and they don't want a black extension cord
messing it up,'' said Marilyn Raymond, director of marketing for
New Product Showcase and Learning Center in Ithaca, N.Y., a new
products consulting firm. ``This can be a small addition that
enhances (the home) without being expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to a product's success is for it to be ``truly
innovative and something consumers perceive as a need,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Nostrant got the idea for multicolor cords while on a visit to
China. Nostrant went to an extension-cord factory to research an
idea he had for surge protectors.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched white, beige, green and brown cords being made, he
wondered why extension cords didn't come in other colors. On the
spot, he told the Chinese factory owner that he wanted cords made
in 17 different colors.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Jelly Cords hit the market. In one month, he sold
294,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   Sales this year for his 15-person company should hit $10million.
Last year, SNS International recorded $4 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not from Jelly Cords alone.
</P>
<P>
   His other products include Sheet Snugglers, foam corners that
prevent bed sheets from slipping off; Mattress Mates, a ``T''-shape
foam that turns two twin beds into a king, and Cleanimals, a sort
of Beanie Baby bath toy with puff netting exfoliators.
</P>
<P>
   His kids _ two sons and a daughter _ help him name the animals:
Corkscrew the Pig, Giggles the Goldfish, Hiccup the Hippo, Dimples
the Duck and Clean Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon are Plushlights, plush toy-covered flashlights, and
Fabric Clips, which fasten fabric in place without piercing it.
</P>
<P>
   How does Nostrant come up with his product ideas?
</P>
<P>
   No, he doesn't embark on wilderness retreats to spark his
creativity, neither does he sit and brainstorm with a group of
marketing executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really tell you,'' Nostrant explains. ``It just hits
me.''

   LOS ANGELES -- Labor Day travelers, expected to hit the road in
record numbers, will pay the highest gasoline prices since April,
according to a survey released that says retail gas prices rose 12
cents from July to this month.
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 20, the average price of a gallon of self-serve
regular gasoline in the Southern California region climbed to
$1.514 from $1.393 on July 20. Prices were higher in the suburbs _
$1.54 in Santa Clarita and $1.59 in Ventura, for example _ than in
more urban areas like Van Nuys and Long Beach (both $1.42).
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the three summer holidays traditionally mark a
temporary price surge, since demand for gasoline increases as
people take long weekend trips.
</P>
<P>
   But the Automobile Club of Southern California noted that this
has not been a typical summer, price-wise. So the big jump in the
past 30 days could signal more to come. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're two weeks from Labor Day so we expect prices could go
higher,'' said AAA spokeswoman Carol Thorp on Tuesday. ``But this
has been an odd year.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, gas prices fell, rather than rose, this summer in
conjunction with two big holidays, Memorial Day and July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The average price in the region fell to $1.35 during the July 4
weekend and then began climbing after the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts say conditions in the marketplace suggest
prices probably will fall after Labor Day and could even dip
slightly before Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the California Energy Commission, which tracks
the oil industry, says dynamics in the wholesale market seem to
point to a price drop.
</P>
<P>
   Just when they will fall and how far cannot be predicted,
though, said commission spokeswoman Susan Garfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we've hit the peak and prices are starting to
decline,'' Garfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are already declining for wholesalers. Spot market
prices, what traders pay on a daily basis for huge quantities of
gasoline, hit a recent peak of $1.15 at the beginning of August,
when the auto club noted the high August prices at the retail
level. But by Monday, the spot price had fallen to 80 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield estimated that prices could find their way down to
$1.35 or $1.40 a gallon by Labor Day or shortly there after.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, prices won't likely reach the $1.15 rage they found
themselves in from October 1998 to early this year. Adjusted for
inflation, those were the lowest prices in a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Raw materials, crude oil, cost a lot more now.
</P>
<P>
   During the past six months, prices have jumped from the $9 a
barrel range to more than $20 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Garfield notes, will add about 25 cents to the price
of a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   This month's price fluctuation is just the latest in a year of
extreme changes at gas station pumps across the state.Prices in the
recent past peaked at $1.61 in April, up from $1.19 in January. But
then they fell to $1.35 a gallon in June.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gorrell, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Chevron
Products USA, said accidents at refineries across the state were to
blame for much of the fluctuation, since they limited the state's
supply. And since summer is the driving season, prices rose along
with demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is a very tightly strung market. There is not too
much leeway. If there is a refinery problem, OK, you can still get
away with meeting customers' demand but if there are two refinery
problems you will be in a supply-and-demand mismatch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The refineries are back in operation now. Garfield said the
state's current industry production is about 981,000 barrels of gas
a day, up from the average of 941,000 barrels a day. During the
past six months, production had dipped to about 800,000 barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing at this point is that production levels are
very good so supplies in the marketplace are coming back up,'' she
said.

GREENE'S FUTURE UP IN AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels have made it clear that one of their top
priorities this offseason is solidifying the starting catching
position. So far, the Angels are happy with the progress of
25-year-old Ben Molina, who has played solid defense in 13 games
and is hitting .255 with one homer and nine RBI.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave Todd Greene and Matt Walbeck? Once
touted as their catcher of the future, Greene's future with the
club is in question.
</P>
<P>
   He has caught in only 13 games this season and won't catch
anymore. The Angels are out of the race and Greene's surgically
repaired right shoulder is still an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, making $225,000 this season, is eligible for
arbitration. But he says he doesn't worry about being left out of
the Angels' plans in their search for a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can catch I'm going to fit in somewhere,'' said Greene,
hitting .238 with 14 homers and 36 RBI. ``I don't know what their
plans are here. This year was cut short. We weren't able to find
out if I can catch on an every-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said his first choice is to remain with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a player that comes up through an organization
wants to go elsewhere unless there's a better opportunity
elsewhere,'' Greene said. ``(General manager Bill) Bavasi was the
minor-league coordinator when I first started, (bench coach) Joe
Maddon and (hitting coach) Rod Carew have helped me all through my
career. People like that know me and know what I can do. I'd like
to stay here, but at the same time it's out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck says the catching situation this season has been
``confusing,'' noting that there have been six catchers with the
major-league team this season _ Molina, Greene, Walbeck, Bret
Hemphill, Charlie O'Brien and Steve Decker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to have consistency behind the plate,
not only for the catchers, but for the whole pitching staff,''
Walbeck said. ``It's not my job to complain about it. You play when
you're asked to and you be professional when you're not. But I
absolutely want to start next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn to start: Left-hander Jarrod Washburn will start Friday
in Boston despite two bad starts since his call-up from Triple-A
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought him here to pitch, so we're going to pitch him,''
manager Terry Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels want to get a good look at Washburn in the final
month of the season to determine where he fits in their plans for
next year. But this season has been a tough one for Washburn,
especially considering last season when he went 6-3 with a 4.62 ERA
in 15 games, including 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   This season he had to overcome a strained side muscle and has
struggled with his command.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't pitched a lot this year, but he's going to be a good
pitcher,'' Collins said. ``I think right now it's a physical thing
with him. It's a mechanical thing he's trying to correct. It's not
mental _ this kid's tough, real tough.''

ORTIZ IMPRESSIVE, BUT ANGELS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Ramon Ortiz has a future so bright the Angels are
holding their breath, knowing what happens when they express
optimism about someone or something.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortiz, the organization's most prized pitching prospect,
might even be good enough to overcome the hex that Anaheim built.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he allowed a two-run homer to Carlos Delgado in a
5-1 loss to Toronto in front of 21,492 at Edison Field on Tuesday
night, Ortiz's second major-league start was still a success.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out eight in seven innings and limited the Blue Jays
to just six hits. Delgado won it in the sixth with his 36th homer,
but Ortiz (1-1) recovered and completed the seventh inning with the
Angels down only 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   His ERA rose from 1.13 to just 1.80.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch, he just hit it out,'' Ortiz said of
Delgado's homer. ``It was low and good.... I pitched good. The only
difference from the other (start) was they just had better luck
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Angels manager Terry Collins cautioned that
Ortiz's first start (1 run, 4 hits, 8 innings in a 9-2 win over the
White Sox last Thursday) was just that _ one start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw great,'' Collins said after Tuesday's game. ``It was
very impressive. But he was facing a pretty good lineup. They can
hit with power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored three runs in the eighth off Mike Holtz and
Mark Petkovsek. Shawn Green homered and Willie Greene had a two-run
double to put the game away. Blue Jays starter Pat Hentgen (8-10)
gave up one run and four hits in seven innings to earn the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, Ortiz struck out six and allowed only two
hits. Just one Blue Jays baserunner even got into scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth, the Blue Jays' big sticks finally got to
Ortiz. With two out and nobody on, Green, hitting .316 with 33
homers and 103 RBI entering the game, singled to center. Next up
was Delgado, who now has 116 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado got a knee-high fastball on a 2-1 count and ripped it
into the right-field seats to give the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz had only four strikeouts in eight innings in his debut
against the White Sox, but he started Tuesday's game by striking
out the first two batters he faced _ Shannon Stewart and Brian
McRae.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz got two more strikeouts in the second inning and another
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Following a one-out single by Darrin Fletcher in the second,
Ortiz retired nine consecutive batters before Tony Batista reached
on third baseman Troy Glaus' throwing error with one out in the
fifth. But Ortiz responded by retiring the next two hitters and
getting out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Angels offense made it clear that Ortiz wasn't
going to get a lot to work with. The only run the Angels had
through seven innings off Hentgen came on Jim Edmonds' first-inning
homer. It was Edmonds' first home run of the season.

TOP PITCHER TRANSFERS TO USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark Prior, a freshman All-American pitcher at
Vanderbilt last season, has transferred to USC.
</P>
<P>
   Prior, a 6-foot-5, 220 pound right-hander, will be eligible
immediately, because baseball players are not required to sit out a
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very unusual. I think a lot of college baseball people
are shaking their heads,'' USC coach Mike Gillespie said. ``We
really think he has a chance to be an elite college pitcher. You're
getting a guy that's a proven guy with unusual stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior also pitched for the U.S. national team this summer. His
record at Vanderbilt was not as impressive as his reputation, but
the Commodores were not a highly regarded team. Prior was 4-8 last
season with a 4.59 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   He had 71 strikeouts in 82 1/3 innings and was named to Baseball
America's freshman All-American team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite like he dazzled but he held his own,''
Gillespie said. ``He's not a project. It's a surprise he considered
transferring.''

   CHINA-SECT (Shanghai, China) _ Chinese authorities announced
that they are preparing to prosecute senior members of Falun Gong,
the spiritual movement that was banned last month after it startled
China's leaders with its ability to organize potent anti-government

protests of any kind, the authorities are now expected to charge
Falun Gong's leaders with subversion and direct that they be
sentenced to life in prison. By Seth Faison.

   NAZI-SLAVE-LABOR (Berlin) _ The German government and leading
corporations here have been obliged to abandon a Sept. 1 target
date for a multibillion-dollar settlement with slave laborers and
others forced to work by the Nazis. The date, the 60th anniversary
of Hitler's invasion of Poland and the start of World War II, had
considerable symbolic resonance because many of the forced laborers
were Polish. By Roger Cohen.

<P>
   KAN-EVOLUTION (Topeka, Kan.) _ The decision by the Kansas Board
of Education to delete mention of evolution from the science
textbooks has reignited passions on both sides. For some, the move
finally opens the door to let them teach their own beliefs in
things like ``intelligent design,'' which means a leaf is so
beautifully complex it must have been planned by a high
intelligence. For others, the move is meaningless because it is not
mandatory. Many plan on ignoring the advice of the board and
teaching evolution anyhow. By Jacques Steinberg.

   BERGER-PROFILE (Washington) _ Widely regarded as the president's
closest foreign policy aide, perhaps the most influential national

meet officials who mistakenly told the American pole vaulter Jeff

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On Sunday, the rookie Luke Petitgout was a guard.
On Monday, he was a tackle. Tuesday morning Petitgout was still a
tackle. Tuesday afternoon he was back to guard.
</P>
<P>
   It was not good news that had Petitgout hopping back and forth
on the offensive line. It was another injury to a Giants starter.
</P>
<P>
   Late in Tuesday afternoon's practice, Lance Scott, the team's
starting left guard and its only experienced long snapper, sprained
the medial collateral ligament in his right knee when he went down
in a tangle of 300-pound bdies during a routine half-line drill.
</P>
<P>
   A piercing scream at the end of the play had Scott's teammates
rushing to his side as he lay on the ground grabbing his knee.
After a brief examination by team trainers, Scott left the field on
a golf cart. The Giants said they would not know the severity of
the sprain until Wednesday, although Coach Jim Fassel guessed that
Scott would be out two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Petitgout, the team's first-round draft pick out of Notre Dame
this spring, had been competing for the left guard job with Scott
until Monday, when Fassel announced he was moving Petitgout to
right tackle where he would compete for the starting job with Scott
Gragg. Fassel said he was dissatisfied with Gragg's performance in
the Giants' last preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Petitgout was playing right tackle Tuesday in the same drill
that resulted in Scott's injury. As the trainers began working on
Scott, the Giants moved their practice to the other end of the
field. In the jog from one end of the field to the other, Petitgout
went from tackle back to guard. He immediately began lining up in
Scott's spot with the first unit. And he stayed there until
practiced ended. The competition for Gragg's position appeared to
be over for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance was doing a good job,'' Fassel said. ``Let's just hope
we can get him back in a couple to three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks would keep Scott out of the Giants' opening game
Sept. 12. Scott, 27, has handled all the Giants' long snapping
duties since 1997. He has also started the last 27 games at center,
a post he relinquished when the veteran Giants center Brian
Williams made his comeback this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he currently has three candidates for long snapping
duties: guard Jason Whittle and the tight ends Todd Pollack and
Pete Mitchell. Whittle and Pollack have handled some of the long
snapping late in the Giants' two preseason games this year, but
neither player has done it in a National Football League
regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players involved in the pile of bodies that resulted
in Scott's injury was the rookie defensive tackle Ryan Hale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell when somebody is hurt kind of bad,'' Hale said.
``We know as football players. Lance seemed like he was in a lot of
pain.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST, IN HOLLYWOOD AND THE
HEARTLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans accustomed to getting their information on contentious
public issues from Broadway and Hollywood were probably startled to
learn that, in Kansas at least, creationism was still alive and
kicking. The many people who have been influenced by ``Inherit the
Wind'' in its various treatments must have long since been left
with the impression that William Jennings Bryan, that incarnation
of fundamentalism, had been thoroughly bested by Clarence Darrow,
champion of scientifically certified free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that despite what most of us were taught in
school about evolution, and despite stage, movie and television
versions of the 1925 monkey trial (in which the court actually
sided with the fundamentalists), the dispute has not been resolved,
much less reconciled. Sharp division separates those who are
persuaded by the work of Darwin and his successors and those who
attribute the development of humankind exclusively to the workings
of a higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   The rule in the Kansas schools now is to discourage if not
abolish any mention of evolution from the state's science
curriculum, and there have been efforts elsewhere to institute
equity of sorts between what is generally accepted as science and
what is considered by many as faith.
</P>
<P>
   As Pam Belluck reported in The New York Times, ``Instead of
trying to push creationism onto the curriculum, many creationists
are trying to keep Darwin out of the classroom or insure that if
evolution is taught, it is presented as merely one unproved
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   America's mass-media capitals and other urban centers are
hotbeds of evolutionary doctrine; biblical literalism is more
likely to flourish elsewhere. As presented by the agnostics or
worse who run the studios and write the scripts, true
fundamentalists must feel embattled. Class differences, whether of
education or career or affluence, rear their touchy heads in the
debate over what ought to be taught in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are fundamentalists denied the equal time on screen
that some are now seeking in the schoolroom, but when they are
permitted to appear, it is likely to be in an unflattering light,
for example, as overt racists. Most conspicuously, in movies about
race relations in the South in the 1950s and '60s, the white bigots
are often lumped among the great unwashed, less acquainted with
Darwin than with Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Take as an example ``Ghosts of Mississippi,'' Rob Reiner's 1996
film, which has lately been on the television circuit. The camera
does not let us forget that Byron De La Beckwith, the murderer of
Medgar Evers, flavorsomely played by James Woods, justified his
benighted opinions and brutal instincts with allusions to white
supremacy drawn from the Bible that he carried around like an
advertising placard. The audience is left to assume that the
failure to convict him in his first two trials had something to do
with his juries' spiritual solidarity. Black congregations, even of
a fundamentalist persuasion, typically come off much more favorably
in movies than white ones, but then they are the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the white South's churches did not cover themselves with
glory in the racial confrontations of the 1950s and '60s, and no
one is about to fault the movies or television for being against
bigotry. But critics of Hollywood, including several of the recent
also-rans in the Republican encounter in Iowa who parade their own
religious credentials, find evidence on screen of a pervasive
secularism. And they cannot fail to notice the scorn that the
well-heeled, reasonably well-educated bicoastal elite displays for
those from fundamentalist sects who are commonly portrayed as
rednecks.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal media tend to practice consensus politics. They do
not so much lead public opinion as reinforce the fashions of the
day among a seemingly enlightened viewership, whether it be about
the monkey trial or about Nazis in the period of ``Watch on the
Rhine'' or Communism and Communist hunting at various stages of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Often the drama of ``serious'' movies like ``Ghosts of
Mississippi'' falls short of its social intentions. Like benign
propagandists, producers with an eye on the market find safety in a
purposeful simple-mindedness aimed at an audience that welcomes
assurances of its own virtue. As for religion, whatever the
skepticism among writers and directors, they are not out to offend
any mainstream constituency, but fundamentalist sects evidently do
not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave the Bible-as-truth set? Given the size of
congregations and the popularity of some television preachers,
there are surely enough of them to constitute a considerable
audience, and criticism of evolutionary theory has its articulate
advocates. Yet for those may who do not share their views, their
image is of the intellectually challenged, and for most of the
nation ``Inherit the Wind'' carries the day.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of the fundamentalist cause, it is on the
wrong side of the ideological and class divide. Fundamentalism is
about as likely to receive sympathetic attention from Hollywood as
its proponents are to make the A-list for celebrity dinner parties.
This species just isn't taken seriously where it counts, and so its
periodic assertion of consequence, most recently in Kansas, comes
as a shock to liberal assumptions.

GARCIA EARNS FIRST SHUTOUT; GRIFFEY JOINS EXCLUSIVE HR COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ How does a 22-year-old feel when 42,517 fans stand and
scream his name, over and over, begging for a wave of his hat?
Freddy Garcia pointed to his right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Goosebumps. Thirty minutes after the final pitch of the best
game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like me,'' said the Mariners right-hander. ``I try to do
the best every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he was at his very best. Garcia shut out the
Detroit Tigers, 5-0, striking out 12, walking one and allowing six
hits. It was his first career shutout, and the signature
performance of a brilliant rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was dominating tonight,'' said catcher Dan Wilson. ``That
was the best I've seen his stuff all year. It seemed like every
pitch, his concentration was so good. Really, just an outstanding
game. From beginning to end, Freddy was pretty much in control of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out, one on and two strikes on Damion Easley in the
ninth inning, Garcia dropped his arm angle a bit, which he doesn't
often do. Easley took the two-seam fastball for strike three, and
the Safeco Field crowd began chanting Garcia's first name.
</P>
<P>
   Karim Garcia followed with a sharp single to right, putting
runners at the corners, and manager Lou Piniella came out to the
mound. Piniella was uneasy with Garcia's pitch count, which had
reached 138. He also was wary of Garcia's experience; though
pitching on an extra day's rest, Garcia, as a rookie, has never
pitched through September.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out in the ninth inning, and I was thinking he wanted
to take me out,'' Garcia said. ``He said, `How are you feeling?' I
said, `I'm feeling good.' I'm glad I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch, Garcia got Bill Haselman on a comebacker. He
gloved it, took a moment, and underhanded his toss to Ryan Jackson
at first base for the final out. As he walked off the field to the
cheers, Garcia held his cap high.
</P>
<P>
   The win improved Garcia's record to 13-7, and the 12 strikeouts
matched Paul Abbott's total from Monday night. Before this week,
the Mariners had gone more than a year since a pitcher last
recorded 12 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who threw eight shutout innings, encountered less
trouble than Garcia, who stranded runners at third in the first and
second innings. After retiring 12 hitters in a row, Garcia allowed
two singles and a walk to load the bases in the sixth. With Tom
Davey warming in the bullpen, Garcia faced Easley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of when the tables turned,'' Wilson said. ``He
gave up a couple of base hits and a walk, then he went 2-and-0 on
Easley. I could just see it in his eyes _ he was bearing down out
there. He threw three nasty pitches to Easley, and he was on his
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia, ``He was looking for something off-speed, a
change-up or a curveball. I threw him three fastballs outside, and
he had no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia got all the support he needed in the first inning, when
Alex Rodriguez's bloop single scored the Mariners' first run. That
run was set up by a leadoff walk from Brian Hunter, who emerged
from a 3-for-52 slump with one of his best performances this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who stole his 30th base Tuesday, singled in the third
and fifth and was on base for both of Ken Griffey Jr.'s home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game will drive you crazy if you let it,'' said Hunter,
who was back in the leadoff spot for the first time since Saturday.
``I'm very lucky to have a manager like Lou who still lets me get
in there and get at-bats. I wouldn't have blamed him if he had
taken me out of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hunter on third base and one out in the third, Griffey
muscled a pitch deep to left. Left fielder Luis Polonia gave chase
and leaped, but the ball landed just past his reach, bouncing off
the yellow padding on the top of the fence and into the Tigers
bullpen for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   With that homer, Griffey became the seventh player ever to hit
40 home runs in four consecutive seasons. He joined Hall of Famers
Babe Ruth, Ralph Kiner, Duke Snider, Ernie Banks and Harmon
Killebrew, plus the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire, as the only
players to accomplish the feat.
</P>
<P>
   His 41st homer would come in his next at-bat, to nearly the same
location. With two outs and a runner on in the fifth, Griffey
buried Blair's first pitch deep into the same bullpen, making it
5-0. Of Griffey's home runs, 10 have been to left field, and
Tuesday's game was just the second of his career in which he hit
two homers the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey now has four homers in his last three games _ the same
number of homers he hit in his first 23 games at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's figured out every field,'' Hunter said. ``Safeco
Field's just another one.''

 MCCAIN'S ABORTION STANCE IS ANGERING BOTH SIDES  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful John McCain, reacting to
conservative criticism that he has softened his stand on abortion,
said Tuesday night that he believes the GOP ``must be an
inclusionary party, and we must respect the views of others'' on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the pro-choice community feels that abortion is
a procedure that we would like to eliminate,'' McCain said in an
interview with The Chronicle last night. ``So yes, I want to repeal
Roe vs. Wade, and yes, I am proud of my pro-life voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm trying to get to the point where we join together and
reach a solution to a terrible situation,'' McCain said. ``The
party of Abraham Lincoln is the party of inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, in the midst of a two-week California trip,
made the comments before his address before a sellout crowd of 500
at the World Affairs Council in the Mark Hopkins Inter-Continental
Hotel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been the focus of conservative wrath following
comments made to The Chronicle's editorial board last week about
overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be
repealed because abortion is no longer necessary,'' McCain told The
Chronicle then. ``But certainly in the short term, or even the long
term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would then
force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and
dangerous operations.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, McCain
said he favors the ultimate repeal of Roe vs. Wade, ``but we all
know, and it's obvious, that if we repeal Roe vs. Wade tomorrow,
thousands of young American women would be (undergoing) illegal and
dangerous operations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McCain's campaign released a clarification: ``I have
always believed in the importance of the repeal of Roe vs. Wade,
and as president, I would work toward its repeal. ... But that ...
must take place in conjunction with a sustained effort to reduce
the number of abortions performed in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to work with both pro-life and pro-choice
Americans so that we can eliminate the need for abortions,'' McCain
pledged.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to National Right to Life Committee president
Wanda Franz, McCain wrote, ``I share our common goal of reducing
the staggering number of abortions currently performed in this
country and overturning the Roe vs. Wade decision. I truly hope
this clarifies any ambiguity on my position.''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements kicked up severe criticism from some
Republicans that McCain, considered a plain-spoken maverick,
appeared to be trying to please both sides on an issue that has
been at the top of the political radar in California in recent
elections. ``It's very hard to finesse the issue of abortion, and
Sen. McCain is finding that,'' said Jeff Bell, senior political
consultant for rival GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer. ``He's
got a problem. He has a down-the-line pro-life voting record in
(Congress). ... To say you're going to work with both sides is
easier said than done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer called McCain's statements ``unintelligible,'' and a
spokeswoman for the Steve Forbes campaign accused the Arizona
senator of ``stuttering and stammering'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist George Will was even more blistering: ``How can McCain
square what he told The Chronicle with the answer `yes' that he
gave last year in response to the question, `Do you support the
complete reversal of Roe vs. Wade?' Or with this, from February 25
and July 22, 1998: `I am a lifelong, ardent supporter of unborn
children's right to life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in San Francisco _ where McCain delivered a major
foreign policy address to the World Affairs Council _ the senator
was asked more questions on the abortion issue, and activists on
both sides appeared angered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total flip-flop,'' said Jan Carroll, spokeswoman for
the California Pro-Life Council. ``I'm not sure he knows where he
is on the issue, which is sad, because he has been considered a
pro-life senator for many years, and he has supported a
constitutional amendment to protect unborn children. ... It doesn't
give us much confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Giglio, an active anti-abortion Republican on the Contra
Costa County Central Committee, said McCain appears to be ``trying
to walk the middle road'' on an issue _ and his strategy won't
work. ``He won't win over the moderates, and he'll knock out the
conservatives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Belle Taylor-McGhee, president of the California Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said McCain is ``agreeing with
us that we'll return to the days of back-alley abortions'' should
Roe vs. Wade be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always tried to appear moderate on a number of issues ...
but he's anti-choice,'' she said. ``It's a quagmire for a number of
Republicans who don't want to seem as if they're out of step with
America's pro-choice majority.''

 IMPARTING THE WISDOM OF THE AGED  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're lucky, my friend, to have the only parent in the whole
world who is qualified and willing to do what I'm about to do:
present to you the insights and secrets of successful driving,
distilled from my decades behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing course, by the way, is not available in video
stores or convenience marts.
</P>
<P>
   Now listen carefully: Blah blah blah blah blah-dee-dah,
blah-blah ...
</P>
<P>
   Come on, don't tune me out. This is serious business. I know
you're getting state-required professional training, but I don't
think that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   We train people for six months before we send them to war, but
we train them for about two hours before we send them onto the
highways. Which might explain why in an average year more Americans
die on highways than on battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   To drive a powerful, lethal machine, all you have to do is pass
a test that has questions like:
</P>
<P>
   The steering wheel: a) can be used as a spare tire, b) in the
unlikely event of a water landing, may be used as a flotation
device, c) should be gripped with the left hand in a nonchalant
manner that chicks seem to dig, d) all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   You need a deeper knowledge. That's where I come in.
</P>
<P>
   As you were backing out of the driveway with your trained
professional instructor the other day, your 3-year-old brother's
eyes got wide, and he said, ``Mike can't drive!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' your mom asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too silly!''
</P>
<P>
   Your brother was speaking metaphorically, of course, and isn't
it cute when he does that?
</P>
<P>
   No way you're silly. But to be honest, it is a mild shock to see
you driving a car. Please understand that when a person gets old
(over 20), his or her time-relativity mechanism is shot; it slips
and grabs randomly like a bad transmission. I could swear it wasn't
more than six months ago that I was removing the training wheels
from your bike and watching you wobble down the street.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not get sentimental. There's wisdom to be imparted.
First, my Two Golden Rules. Follow these and everything else will
fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   1. Always signal.
</P>
<P>
   2. Never honk.
</P>
<P>
   This goes way beyond courtesy. These are Zen exercises which
will lead you to a higher spiritual consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   They are also practical rules. Many drivers on the road today
know Morse Code, in which one long beep means: ``Show me your
piece, sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rule: Don't judge other drivers by their appearance or
by their cars. Rather, judge other drivers by their bumper
stickers. Here are some common ones and what they mean:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Honk if you're horny.  &LR; ``I'm a frustrated loser.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I'd rather be sailing.  &LR; ``I'm a frustrated, elitist loser.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Save the whales.  &LR; ``I'm a frustrated loser backing a lost cause
for which you have no empathy, otherwise you'd have the same bumper
sticker and we could trade the secret handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vote yes on Prop. J.  &LR; ``I'm a frustrated loser so delusional
that I believe I can sway political opinion by slapping this
sticker on my loser car.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More than one bumper sticker.  &LR; ``I'm a fanatical loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the more bumper stickers on a car, the worse the
driver.
</P>
<P>
   The booze thing: Drinking and thinking don't mix. Oh, you can
drink and drive. It won't necessarily kill you or people around
you. You can also order blowfish at a truck-stop diner.
</P>
<P>
   Wear sunscreen. Wait, that's someone else's advice-to-youth
column. But in a convertible, wear sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing that I can give driving advice to someone who's
learning, because I never went through that stage myself.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I was a scientific marvel, a genetic freak. I was born
with my driving skills fully developed. Doctors called me a savant
driver. I could parallel park my tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   I had to wait until 16 to drive a car because the DMV rules are
inflexible; they make no allowance for genius. I even had to take
driver's training, like Picasso doing a coloring book.
</P>
<P>
   All I remember about driver's training was that my instructor
was, honest, Mr. Gorie.
</P>
<P>
   I confess, though, that you getting your learner's permit has
improved my driving. In my desire to be a good role model, I'm
shaking off some of those sloppy little bad habits you acquire over
the years _ tailgating, speeding up at yellow lights, passing
gas-tanker trucks on the right on narrow mountain roads at night
with no headlights and a cup of scalding coffee on my lap.
</P>
<P>
   I want you to get it right, because very soon you will have a
license and you won't be needing this old bird, who has come to
enjoy serving as your co-pilot on aimless late-night cruises to
burger joints and record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it will be time for me to get out the crescent wrench and
take the training wheels off the Toyota and watch as you wobble
away down the street.

A LITTLE WHINE WITH MY BOWL OF ICE CREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The TV weather wizards said it would be cooler this week, by
which they meant that there might be a few days when the
temperature didn't hit 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There are parts of the country where a high temperature of 99
degrees signals a killer heat wave. Not here. Meteorologists in
North Texas look at the climatic conditions that produce a sub-100
afternoon and happily pronounce residents of the region to be
beneficiaries of a ``cold front.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. A cold front.
</P>
<P>
   I'd laugh _ if only I had the strength. Unfortunately, the
sweltering days and nights of July and August have left me
listless. They have also left me idea-less, which is why I am
writing about the weather as opposed to some issue of great import.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that real Texans consider me a heat wimp, but there's
nothing I can do about it. If I survive this one, I'll have lived
through 13 summers as a resident of the Lone Star State, and I keep
thinking that one of these years I will finally get used to
summertime in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I never get used to it. In fact, every summer seems worse than
the last one. Rather than increasing my tolerance to the heat, the
accumulation of summers seems to be making me wimpier.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Don Woodard, the Fort Worth
businessman/author/political sage, gets annoyed with me when I
write these columns whining about the heat. Dish up a big bowl of
Blue Bell ice cream and go relax in the shade, he always advises _
and then he reminds me how much I'll appreciate Texas weather next
winter when it's 70 degrees in Fort Worth and the folks up north
are shivering in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   He's right, I know, but thoughts of pleasant Decembers and
Januarys are simply no consolation to me when I'm being microwaved
in August.
</P>
<P>
   The natives never fail to remind me that no complaint about the
heat has any validity around these parts unless the complainer
lived through the summer of 1980, when the mercury soared past 100
early in the season and stayed there until a 99-degree day really
did seem like a cold front.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't live here back then, but I did visit for a few days.
I'm only slightly reluctant to confess that I couldn't wait to get
back to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   That experience didn't stop me from coming back to stay in 1986.
But I moved to Texas in December. Summer seemed a long way off. It
wasn't, of course; in Texas, summer is never a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived for several years in northeastern Pennsylvania _
where 85 degrees is considered unbearably hot _ I was thrown off
stride by my first few summers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. I was thrown off stride by my first 13 summers in
Texas. But I'm absolutely certain that the summer of 2000 will be
the one when I finally learn to cope with Texas heat. I'll bet I
don't even write a column complaining about the temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I've never figured out why the heat bothers me so
much. I grew up in southern Illinois, right across the Mississippi
River from St. Louis, where the summer months regularly bring
temperatures in the mid- to upper 90s _ and occasionally reach
triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Before the St. Louis Cardinals ripped up the artificial turf and
put in natural grass at Busch Memorial Stadium on the riverfront,
the field would get so hot that ballplayers had to insulate their
shoes to keep their feet from burning up.
</P>
<P>
   People used to say that it got so hot you could fry an egg on
the sidewalk _ and I actually saw somebody do it.
</P>
<P>
   And the humidity? That's another story.
</P>
<P>
   So. I'm somewhat baffled by my inability to cope with Texas
summers. Maybe those years in Pennsylvania wrecked my biological
thermometer. Or something.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I realize that there is absolutely nothing I can do
about the summer heat except indulge myself in a bit of mindless
whining and dream about those 70-degree days I'll be enjoying when
my friends in Illinois and Pennsylvania are shivering in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I might dish up a bowl of Blue Bell and relax in the
shade. If I can muster up the strength.

FISHING IN PUERTO RICO'S TROUBLED WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by
arrangement with New York Times Syndicate/Special features. For
purchase information see end of text. 
 By JUAN GONZALEZ 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bullet casings litter the sun-baked beach and the dirt trails
leading into mangled underbrush. Bomb craters dot the landscape,
and the fins of unexploded missiles and shells, some 4 feet high,
shoot up from the soil in a tangled web of metal.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Vieques Island, outpost of American colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Santiago was born and reared on this once-lush island,
which is located off the northeast coast of Puerto Rico. She has
been mayor to the 9,400 inhabitants of Vieques for the past 16
years. But even Santiago had never laid eyes on the easternmost
portion of the 20-mile-long island, called Cayo Yayi, until the
morning of Aug. 13, when she traveled there by fishing boat with a
visiting delegation headed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Cayo Yayi has been off-limits to local residents since the U.S.
Navy took possession of three quarters of Vieques in the early
1940s and turned it into the Western Hemisphere's most important
military target range.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, combat planes and helicopters have bombed and
strafed this end of Vieques with ruthless regularity. Artillery
shells from Navy ships have pulverized its hills, and the Marines
have conducted periodic war games and amphibious landings on its
beaches. Our government even loans Vieques out to the navies of
NATO and Latin America so they can lob their bombs at it. This
multinational assault goes on as often as 200 days of every year.
On rare occasions, it has even included depleted uranium shells and
napalm.
</P>
<P>
   The guys at the Pentagon have rarely given much thought to the
residents of Vieques, all of them U.S. citizens, who must live on a
target range only twice the size of Manhattan. This tiny piece of
real estate, the admirals say, is essential to our national
defense. Throughout all those decades, American journalists who run
around the world reporting human rights abuses have been
scandalously silent about Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and San Juan's new archbishop, Roberto Gonzalez, tried
to pierce that silence with their sudden visit last week. They
hoped to draw outside attention to this flagrant abuse of our own
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what it's like trying to teach with jet fighters
and helicopters buzzing over us all the time, and bombs exploding
in the distance?'' asked Javier Torres, an industrial arts teacher
who joined hundreds of schoolchildren and Vieques residents in
welcoming Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago remembers a particular incident on the night of Oct.,
24, 1993. ``We all heard these loud explosions,'' she told me.
``Every house in the town shook.'' Santiago immediately telephoned
the commander at nearby Roosevelt Roads Naval Base. No one could
tell her what happened. The next day she discovered that a pilot on
a bombing run had missed his target by several miles and dropped
five bombs just outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in 1997, some National Guard troops mistakenly
strafed a school bus and a police car with machine gun bullets.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in either accident, but the people of Vieques
always knew a disaster was bound to happen. It finally did, on
April 19. That's when two Navy pilots practicing for Yugoslavian
war missed their target and hit an observation post with a couple
of 500-pound bombs.
</P>
<P>
   David Sanes Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican security guard, was killed
and four others were wounded. The constant bombing has brought
other woes. The fishing industry in Vieques is a shambles. Some 73
percent of its people live in poverty. The island's pristine
beaches and its spectacular coral reefs have been contaminated, and
its residents suffer from a cancer rate 27 percent higher than the
rest of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Following Sanes' death, Puerto Ricans unleashed 50 years of
pent-up anger at the Navy. First, a group of local fishermen
occupied the hill where he was killed, renamed it Mount David in
his honor, and refused to leave. The fishermen were followed by
pro-Puerto Rican independence activists and union leaders who
occupied others sites. Before long, there were four separate
protest camps on Navy land.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations have forced the Pentagon to suspend further war
games. In the process, every major political and religious leader
in Puerto Rico _ even prostatehood governor Pedro Rossello _ has
called for the Navy to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar prompted President Clinton to appoint a commission,
which will recommend later this month what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans are convinced that white Americans would never
tolerate this kind of callous bombing on their own land. Should the
White House not respond to Puerto Rico's cry, Jackson promised he
will lead massive protests in cities around the country. Along with
Rick Dovalina, president of the League of United Latin American
Citizens, he threatened to turn Vieques into a campaign issues for
the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colonialism is a sin anywhere,'' Jackson told the cheering
fishermen. In the Philippines and in Panama, the people reached a
point where they said, the Navy must leave. Now they are saying it
in Puerto Rico. It is undemocratic of us not to listen.''

NOVEL PROVIDES AMMUNITION FOR HATE 
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by
arrangement with New York Times Syndicate/Special features. For
purchase information see end of text. 
 By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    Several years ago, when Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law
Center initiated a letter-writing campaign to dissuade bookstore
chains and distributors from stocking William Pierce's novel ``The
Turner Diaries,'' much of America thought the KlanWatch founder was
overreacting to the violence of a handful of white supremacists.
 &HT;    Now, with increasing numbers of white males targeting and
gunning down members of minority groups, Dees' failed book-banning
campaign _ although still unreasonable to most Americans, myself
included, on First Amendment grounds _ is not as unpalatable as it
once was.
 &HT;    The reason is that ``The Turner Diaries'' serves as a bible for
killers such as Tim McVeigh and Ben Smith and L.A. day camp
shooting suspect Buford Furrow.
 &HT;    Published in 1978 and set in the 1990s, the novel depicts
Armageddon between select whites and everyone else _ blacks, Jews,
government officials, journalists, cops, military personnel.
 &HT;    At this time, called the ``Day of the Rope,'' tens of thousands
of blacks and Jews are exterminated. This also is when the
``Organization'' eradicates liberalism, feminism and the other isms
of compassion.
 &HT;    Amazingly, very few people besides scholars, terrorism experts
and, of course, white extremists have read ``The Turner Diaries.''
Even more shocking, at least to me, is that so few journalists have
read it.
 &HT;    The following edited excerpts from the novel should give readers
a glimpse of what our home-grown terrorists are reading for
inspiration:
 &HT;    ``Liberalism is an essentially feminine, submissive world view.
Perhaps a better adjective than feminine is infantile. It is the
world view of men who do not have the moral toughness, the
spiritual strength to stand up and do single combat with life, who
cannot adjust to the reality that the world is not a huge,
pink-and-blue, padded nursery in which the lions lie down with the
lambs and everyone lives happily ever after.''
 &HT;    ``One day we will have a truly American press in this country,
but a lot of editors' throats will have to be cut first.''
 &HT;    ```Women's lib' was a form of mass psychosis which broke out
during the last three decades of the Old Era. Women affected by it
denied their femininity and insisted that they were `people,' not
`women.'''
 &HT;    ``There is no way a society based on Aryan values and an Aryan
outlook can evolve peacefully from a society which has succumbed to
Jewish spiritual corruption.''
 &HT;    ``The (Uncle) `Toms' will eventually get their more militant and
resentful brethren back into line, but meanwhile Izzy and Sambo are
really at one another's throats, tooth and nail, and it is a joy to
behold.''
 &HT;    ``The hanging of a few of the worst race-criminals in every
neighborhood in America will help enormously in straightening out
the majority of the population and reorienting their thinking. In
fact, it will not only help, but it is absolutely necessary. The
people require a strong psychological shock to break old habits of
thought.''
 &HT;    ``Talk of `innocents' has no meaning. We must look at our
situation collectively, in a race-wide sense. We must understand
that our race is like a cancer patient undergoing drastic surgery
in order to save his life. There is no sense in asking whether the
tissue being cut out is `innocent' or not. That is no more
reasonable than trying to distinguish the `good' Jews from the bad
ones _ or, as some of our thicker-skulled `good ol' boys' still
insist on trying, separating the `good niggers' from the rest of
their race.''
 &HT;    ``We'll go to the uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the
last of Satan's spawn.''
 &HT;    After the Organization conquers the world with nuclear weapons,
the ``Great One'' hands down a final edict: ``It (is) no longer
sufficient to be merely white; in order to eat one (has) to be
judged the bearer of especially valuable genes.''
 &HT;    After the Oklahoma City bombing, Pierce, aka Andrew Macdonald,
who holds a doctorate in physics and is a former professor in
Oregon, quipped that ``someone may have read` The Turner
Diaries.'''
 &HT;    An understatement, for sure. As head of the Neo-Nazi National
Alliance, the biggest and most active of such groups nationwide,
Pierce invites at least 100 members who possess what he calls
``leadership potential'' to a private workshop each year at the
Hillboro, W.Va., headquarters. There, the future stalwarts, who
mistake paranoia for patriotism, are trained in the civilized art
of hatred.
 &HT;    The main training manual? ``The Turner Diaries.'' Besides these
100 crazies who are required to read the book each year, many
others, such as McVeigh, Smith and Furrow, discover it in their own
way and re-enact its graphic mayhem.

   It was full summer in southern Indiana. Bob Ervin was so hard at
work cobbling together his daughter's playhouse in the back yard
that he didn't notice anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the playhouse and felt fine _ for a week or so. Nine
days later he woke in a sweat. Unable to return to sleep, he got up
at 3 a.m. and turned on the light. The pain in his eyes was so
sharp it felt like a stabbing knife. He flipped the light off and
spent the rest of the night in a feverish sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he went to the family doctor. An examination
revealed a fever of 102. Except for some blood in his urine,
nothing was unusual. The doctor gave him Bactrim, an antibiotic
commonly used to treat urinary infections.
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, Ervin dutifully took the antibiotic, but
the fever never broke. By the end of the week he was tired and
weak; he came to the emergency room with a temperature of 103.5.
The emergency-room physician's examination failed to reveal any
sign of infection, and the chest X-ray was clear. Routine blood
cultures and chemistries were drawn and sent to me in the
hospital's pathology lab.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ervin was sweating so much he was at risk of
dehydration. The emergency-room physician decided to admit him with
the diagnosis ``fever of unknown origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Ervin was admitted, his family doctor visited and
combed his history for a hidden cause one more time. Ervin denied a
host of symptoms: coughing, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain on
urination, recent weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The only new details were vague complaints about discomfort
after eating.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor then reviewed the initial laboratory results. The
routine blood cultures for infections were all negative, but the
blood count didn't look normal. Blood counts tell whether three
types of cells _ white, red and platelets _ are in correct
proportion. Mr. Ervin had low levels of all three, a condition
called pancytopenia. And the levels of his liver enzymes _ which
increase in the case of infection or early liver damage _ were
high. He had anemia, weakness and fever.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to unite as many of the symptoms as possible in a single
diagnosis, the doctor concluded that Ervin's symptoms spelled acute
cholecystitis: an inflamed gallbladder.
</P>
<P>
   The gallbladder, roughly the size of a kiwi fruit, lies just
beneath the liver. Its job is to store bile produced by the liver
and secrete it whenever fat needs to be digested.
</P>
<P>
   When the gallbladder is acutely inflamed, it's usually because
stones _ clumps of fatty material or bile pigment _ have
accumulated inside it.
</P>
<P>
   A patient who has a gallbladder problem will often have fever,
elevated liver enzymes and some discomfort after eating. An
ultrasound of the abdomen revealed signs of gallstones.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Nevins, a surgeon, was called in for a consultation. She
felt that something didn't fit the diagnosis: the pancytopenia.
Problems in the gallbladder aren't associated with drops in blood
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been visiting anywhere?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Colorado. I was hiking last month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you bitten by any animals or bugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few ticks here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean `here and there'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in Indiana, some in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon left the room and came to see me.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks harboring a bacterium called Rickettsia rickettsii
transmit one of the most common tick-borne diseases, Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ervin's signs and symptoms seemed to fit that diagnosis: the
pancytopenia, the fever, the elevated liver enzymes and the tick
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have any spots?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I could see,'' Nevins said.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly scanned the description in the text and found that a
small percentage of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever do
not have spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we confirm it?'' Nevins asked.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the current pathology textbook to see what I could
find on diagnostic tests for the disease. She glanced into the text
I was reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about that one, the one in the next paragraph _
chaffeensis.''
</P>
<P>
   I skimmed the passage. Lone star ticks infected with the
bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis, transmit ehrlichiosis, which was
first diagnosed in humans in 1986. Its full name is human monocytic
ehrlichiosis because the bacterium thrives inside white blood cells
called monocytes.
</P>
<P>
   Since E. chaffeensis doesn't grow in any standard laboratory
media, blood cultures for the infection turn up negative. The
disease usually shows up in middle-aged men with recent tick bites,
and their symptoms are typically fever, pancytopenia, elevated
liver enzymes and photophobia, or extreme light sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   I had heard of ehrlichiosis, but I wasn't aware of cases in
southern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey, it looks like a perfect fit,'' I said. ``Tell him that
tetracycline will probably clear it up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   She headed out to talk with Ervin. Now it was my job to confirm
the diagnosis. First I called a medical microbiologist at Indiana
University. He'd never seen an ehrlichiosis case and suggested I
call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A few phone calls later, I learned of an antibody test that
could identify it. The problem, though, was that it couldn't tell
if the infection was current. I needed something better.
</P>
<P>
   I logged onto the National Library of Medicine's Web site. A
list of 20 articles on ehrlichiosis popped up. One described a new
method of testing for the pathogen's nucleic acid in the patient's
blood. The author was Stephen Dumler, a medical microbiologist at
Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   After a few phone calls, we found out what kind of blood sample
to prepare, drew Mr. Ervin's blood and sent it off to Dumler. Two
days later, he called to confirm that the test had detected the
presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis. We had nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the surgeon had started Mr. Ervin on a weeklong
course of antibiotics. His temperature returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year has passed since Ervin encountered that tick in
the woods of southern Indiana. It is now, once again, full summer
here, but this time we know the beast.

<P>
   It was full summer in southern Indiana. Bob Ervin was so hard at
work cobbling together his daughter's playhouse in the back yard
that he didn't notice anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the playhouse and felt fine _ for a week or so. Nine
days later he woke in a sweat. Unable to return to sleep, he got up
at 3 a.m. and turned on the light. The pain in his eyes was so
sharp it felt like a stabbing knife. He flipped the light off and
spent the rest of the night in a feverish sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he went to the family doctor. An examination
revealed a fever of 102. Except for some blood in his urine,
nothing was unusual. The doctor gave him Bactrim, an antibiotic
commonly used to treat urinary infections.
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, Ervin dutifully took the antibiotic, but
the fever never broke. By the end of the week he was tired and
weak; he came to the emergency room with a temperature of 103.5.
The emergency-room physician's examination failed to reveal any
sign of infection, and the chest X-ray was clear. Routine blood
cultures and chemistries were drawn and sent to me in the
hospital's pathology lab.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ervin was sweating so much he was at risk of
dehydration. The emergency-room physician decided to admit him with
the diagnosis ``fever of unknown origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after Ervin was admitted, his family doctor visited and
combed his history for a hidden cause one more time. Ervin denied a
host of symptoms: coughing, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain on
urination, recent weight loss.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Singing came naturally to the opera mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne,
who made her public debut at a town picnic at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   Her granddaughter Daisy, now just 10 months old, appears to be
even more precocious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I picked her up the other day, I swear I heard her begin
to hum,'' Horne says. ``To test it out, I came in on harmony _ and
she held her pitch. My daughter heard us and nearly passed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after decades of operatic training, Horne is mystified
about what makes it possible for her _ let alone her granddaughter
_ to lift her voice in song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, something's going on down there,'' Horne says,
motioning to her chest. ``But I really don't give it a thought, not
while I'm singing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Horne raises the rafters with a powerhouse aria and Daisy
hums a faint melody, they are each relying on some unusual anatomic
aspects of the throat and mouth that allow humans to transform
lifegiving breath into dynamic sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of music begins with the vocal cords, two skin-covered
flaps of muscle that open and close across the passage to the lungs
and oscillate with a wave motion as air rushes out during
exhalation.
</P>
<P>
   The flaps first appeared some 300 million years ago in the sea
creatures that climbed out of the water onto land and breathed with
lungs rather than through gills.
</P>
<P>
   By quickly closing and opening, the two folds of muscle served
as natural valves, blocking everything but air from entering the
respiratory system and allowing the ejection of phlegm from the
lungs. Otherwise the creatures would have choked to death.
</P>
<P>
   In humans and most of the higher animals, closing off air-filled
lungs with this valve mechanism also stabilizes the body during
muscular exertion, including evacuation of the bowels.
</P>
<P>
   Vocal noisemaking came as something of an evolutionary
afterthought. Eventually, various animals equipped with lungs,
including humans, discovered they could sound warnings or attract
mates by blowing air out and vibrating the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect illustration of what is known as Darwinian
preadaptation,'' says Tecumseh Fitch, a biologist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   One set of human vocal cords looks much like another, except
that men's are slightly bigger than women's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably couldn't tell the difference between Pavarotti
and Mick Jagger by looking at the vocal cords alone,'' says Scott
Kessler, a Manhattan otolaryngologist. For that matter, human vocal
cords closely resemble those of other species.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody did a weird transplant where a singer got a dog's
vocal cords, they could probably do a good job of singing,'' Fitch
says.
</P>
<P>
   In making sound, the vocal cords operate like the open end of a
blown-up balloon, which buzzes rapidly if pulled tight so air can
escape more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Ingo Titze, a physicist at the University of Iowa and director
of the National Center for Voice and Speech, says that air rushing
out of the lungs creates a wave motion in the cords. They slam into
one another, only to blow open again, buffeted by the steady
airflow from the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vibration releases an energy that the human ear and the
brain interpret as sound,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   The sound box in which exhaled air becomes musical notes is the
larynx _ the tip of which forms the Adam's apple _ a cartilaginous
shell that contains and protects the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   In humans, the position of the larynx in the throat is
relatively low, allowing the tongue greater freedom to move and
thus shape sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In dogs, by contrast, the larynx is almost even with the mouth,
severely limiting their ability to control how the bark sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Humans can alter their vocal tone by raising and lowering the
larynx. In addition, trained singers relax and contract muscles
within the larynx in order to produce the resonant waver of
vibrato.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the human vocal instrument consists of the throat,
tongue, mouth, lips and, of course, the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pitch depends on the number of times per second the
vocal cords collide _ ranging from as few as 55 times per second
for a low A sung by a bass, to 1,047 times per second for a
soprano's high C _ the refinement and articulation of the musical
notes take place in the singer's throat and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a trombonist, who pushes the slide out or pushes
it in, making air take a longer or shorter route to get to the
bell, a singer must modulate the passage of breath with a series of
mostly unconscious physical movements. The range of sounds produced
is astounding considering the limited length of the air passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human throat is remarkably short _ just six or seven
inches from the larynx to the lips,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches come from the lips and tongue, which shape
vowels ranging from a mellow U to a sunny E.
</P>
<P>
   Like other instruments, vocal cords can be mistreated and
damaged. Some singers stretch their voices trying to hit high
ranges they weren't born to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Over time this can produce vocal nodes, calluslike knobs that
grow on the vocal cords and prevent them from closing completely
during their oscillation. This condition leads to a raspy, hoarse
voice, even in an 8-year-old songstress struggling to belt out
``Tomorrow'' in Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Blisters, calluses and even hemorrhages affect vocal cords, all
impeding a singer's sound. So the best singers learn to use their
whole bodies to safely summon a precisely controlled flow of air
and to modulate their larynx without straining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor once called me a laryngeal athlete,'' Horne says.
``And it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Singers _ like other athletes _ even find themselves resorting
to drugs to repair the damage brought on by physical stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these people, the show must go on,'' says Kessler,
who tends to some of the most famous throats in the world and
sometimes provides steroids to alleviate hoarseness or other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Singing may come naturally to all humans, but vocal artistry, of
course, is rare and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to that little thing we all call talent,''
Horne says. ``You can't get it, you can't buy it and you can't coax
it. As the song says, `You've either got it _ or you ain't.'''

one another, only to blow open again, buffeted by the steady
airflow from the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vibration releases an energy that the human ear and the
brain interpret as sound,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   The sound box in which exhaled air becomes musical notes is the
larynx _ the tip of which forms the Adam's apple _ a cartilaginous
shell that contains and protects the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   In humans, the position of the larynx in the throat is
relatively low, allowing the tongue greater freedom to move and
thus shape sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In dogs, by contrast, the larynx is almost even with the mouth,
severely limiting their ability to control how the bark sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Humans can alter their vocal tone by raising and lowering the
larynx. In addition, trained singers relax and contract muscles
within the larynx in order to produce the resonant waver of
vibrato.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the human vocal instrument consists of the throat,
tongue, mouth, lips and, of course, the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pitch depends on the number of times per second the
vocal cords collide _ ranging from as few as 55 times per second
for a low A sung by a bass, to 1,047 times per second for a
soprano's high C _ the refinement and articulation of the musical
notes take place in the singer's throat and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a trombonist, who pushes the slide out or pushes
it in, making air take a longer or shorter route to get to the
bell, a singer must modulate the passage of breath with a series of
mostly unconscious physical movements. The range of sounds produced
is astounding considering the limited length of the air passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human throat is remarkably short _ just six or seven
inches from the larynx to the lips,'' Titze says.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches come from the lips and tongue, which shape
vowels ranging from a mellow U to a sunny E.
</P>
<P>
   Like other instruments, vocal cords can be mistreated and
damaged. Some singers stretch their voices trying to hit high
ranges they weren't born to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Over time this can produce vocal nodes, calluslike knobs that
grow on the vocal cords and prevent them from closing completely
during their oscillation. This condition leads to a raspy, hoarse
voice, even in an 8-year-old songstress struggling to belt out
``Tomorrow'' in Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Blisters, calluses and even hemorrhages affect vocal cords, all
impeding a singer's sound. So the best singers learn to use their
whole bodies to safely summon a precisely controlled flow of air
and to modulate their larynx without straining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor once called me a laryngeal athlete,'' Horne says.
``And it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Singers _ like other athletes _ even find themselves resorting
to drugs to repair the damage brought on by physical stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these people, the show must go on,'' says Kessler,
who tends to some of the most famous throats in the world and
sometimes provides steroids to alleviate hoarseness or other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Singing may come naturally to all humans, but vocal artistry, of
course, is rare and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to that little thing we all call talent,''
Horne says. ``You can't get it, you can't buy it and you can't coax
it. As the song says, `You've either got it _ or you ain't.'''

`IN TOO DEEP' STICKS A TOE IN FAMILIAR WATERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Rymer, director of the urban crime drama ``In Too
Deep,'' might not always know what he wants his movie to say, but
he certainly knows how he wants it to look. It's filmed in a hyper
realistic style, with the most striking colors highlighted and the
dreariest made even bleaker. In one memorable scene, lead actor
Omar Epps' brown leather jacket glistens as he stands near an
impossibly blue river, while everything around him looks as stark
as the most depressing November day.
</P>
<P>
   The look is a way of trying to hide things we've often seen
before. To be fair, screenwriters Michael Henry Brown and Paul
Aaron began developing this story _ about a young undercover cop
who begins to identify with his charismatic prey _ seven years ago,
when it would have been a little more fresh. Since then, though,
1992's underrated ``Deep Cover'' and 1997's ``Donnie Brasco,'' not
to mention TV's ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Homicide: Life on the Street,''
have covered much of the same ground.
</P>
<P>
   In ``In Too Deep,'' Epps plays Jeff Cole, a hotshot Cincinnati
undercover cop who convinces his superiors that he's the best man
for a dangerous job, even though he looks like he's barely out of
the police academy. Even after he nearly botches an early
assignment, he manages to get the goods on a drug dealer nicknamed
God (LL Cool J), whose baby face and charitable works belie a
strong sadistic streak.
</P>
<P>
   Cole _ who goes by J. Reid on the streets _ takes to the
undercover role a little too strongly and starts enjoying the bad
life. Predictably enough, a caring superior (indie film
director-actor Stanley Tucci) and a good woman (Nia Long) try to
keep him in check. Despite the sense of deja vu in this tale,
director Rymer gives it an above-average intensity level,
especially in the film's climactic confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Epps, who was so good as a troubled medical student on ``ER,''
seems to have problems finding the right big-screen role. He's been
in more movies this year than Hugh Grant, with his participation
``The Mod Squad'' generally acknowledged as a mistake and his
performance in the likable ``The Wood'' getting lost in aimless
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by Rymer and a reliable supporting cast, Epps almost
carries ``In Too Deep'' but relies too hard on acting crutches that
look like drama-class exercises. When his Cole/J. Reid is
challenged to look tough, he uses a Billy Idol sneer; when
characters begin to suspect Cole's identity, he puts on a dumb
Keanu Reeves grin.
</P>
<P>
   Cool J, who was the best thing in the dumb-but-fun shark drama
``Deep Blue Sea'' (maybe he just likes movies with ``Deep'' in the
title), fares better. He makes a formidable villain, and yet he
convinces you that he could seduce a young and impressionable cop
into his lifestyle. Rymer gives Cool J ample opportunity to
demonstrate his explosiveness, especially in an almost-unwatchable
pool-table torture scene echoing a scene in John Boorman's ``The
General),'' and in a street scene in which he goes after a couple
of recalcitrant underlings.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci, Long and the rest of the supporting cast are stuck in
mostly stock roles, leaving the show pretty much to Rymer, who
doesn't exactly deliver but doesn't exactly disappoint either. He
provides the movie with plenty of mood, laying on the shadow and
giving even the warmest scenes a hazy shade of winter (although the
movie is set in Cincinnati, it was filmed mostly in Toronto). Rymer
has won several filmmaking awards in his native Australia but has
yet to make his U.S. breakthrough. ``In Too Deep's'' story is too
old-hat to be the one, but Rymer's direction sure makes you curious
about what he'll do next.

 &HT;    DNR examines temperature of the Chattahoochee River
 &HT;    By Cheryl Crabb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ State biologists say rising water temperatures
threaten the Chattahoochee River's trout population.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Natural Resources has started testing water
temperatures in the Chattahoochee at seven sites from Buford Dam in
Forsyth County to Peachtree Creek in south Fulton in an attempt to
determine ``how bad the temperature situation is,'' said Lisa
Klein, a fisheries biologist with the DNR's Wildlife Resources
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Trout in the heavily developed stretch of the Chattahoochee
south of Morgan Falls Dam are at greatest risk. Temperatures are
increasing in this area as water heated from parking lots, roads
and other hard surfaces runs off into the river, Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Trout can withstand temperatures in the low 70s, but will die if
the water remains at 77 to 80 degrees for too long. On some days,
the Chattahoochee below Morgan Falls gets that warm. The state will
monitor temperatures through October. Preliminary results are
expected by year end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that we could lose it entirely,'' Klein said
of this part of the fishery.
</P>
<P>
   Water temperatures are less of a concern north of Morgan Falls
Dam. There the problem is dirt washing off from construction sites.
When dirt washes into the river, it covers gravel bars. This
destroys the habitat of aquatic insects and smothers fish eggs.
Without habitat, the insects die _ leaving the fish without
anything to eat. The number of fish that can survive decreases.
</P>
<P>
   The state has started studying growth rates of fish in this area
and will begin testing water quality early next year. It also will
conduct an economic impact study to determine the value of the
fishery, Klein said. Trout anglers in Georgia spend more than $85
million a year, according to 1996 data provided by the state from
the American Sports Fishing Association.
</P>
<P>
   For many adults and children, the Chattahoochee offers an
opportunity to relax and get back to nature without having to
travel to distant mountain streams. Many still consider the
Chattahoochee, which the state began stocking in 1976, Georgia's
premier trout stream. But some fear that the river may no longer be
able to support trout as shopping centers, offices and subdivisions
rapidly spring up along its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Bureau, who has fished the river for two decades and
recently published ``The Anglers Guide to the Chattahoochee
River,'' fears trout fishing may only last another five to seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fragile environment, and it's going to get worse
as development continues,'' said Bureau, a science teacher at Salem
High School in Conyers. ``When the trout go, the river has been
degraded and the quality of life in Atlanta is not what it used to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Development is just one of the issues DNR must tackle to
preserve the Chattahoochee fishery. The department also is arming
itself with data for the interstate water war between Georgia,
Alabama and Florida, Klein said. The states are struggling to
devise a plan for dividing up the waters of the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint basin as part of the negotiations.
Negotiators also must work out a formula to share the waters of the
Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river basin. At stake for Georgia is
enough water to sustain growth in metro Atlanta and most of North
Georgia. The decision over how much water will flow in the
Chattahoochee also could determine whether the fishery survives.
The studies will help the DNR make its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lower half of the river has a lot of problems right now,''
Klein said. ``It's a precarious balance, to say the least, and
we're working very hard to try and preserve it. It's one of those
things where you'll try every angle.''

 &HT;    When motorcycle racers flop, run wherever panic takes you
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLETT, Okla. _ By the time the last checkered flag was thrown
Saturday, I was whipped. There would be no motorcycle racing for
this rookie on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, it would have been different.
</P>
<P>
   But by 5 p.m. my back was killing me. I had a painful crick in
my neck. I was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that my sweat-soaked clothes were merged with red
Oklahoma dirt and a mixture of gasoline, oil and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I pulled a muscle lifting a race bike just like mine
off one of the crash victims late in the day, I had begun to
question the wisdom of my decision to get a motorcycle roadracing
license.
</P>
<P>
   It's common knowledge that people can get hurt racing
motorcycles. There was nothing common about spending a day in the
middle of ``carnage corner'' while motorcycle racers and their
bikes slid, skidded and tumbled around me.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming a fully licensed motorcycle roadracer, newbie
racers have to graduate from a certified motorcycle school with
some track experience. They also have to pass the required tests,
pay their license fees, spend two days working corners during
sanctioned races and successfully complete two races, which means
no crashing.
</P>
<P>
   I spent $1,762 getting my new supersport bike safety wired and
race-prepped for the 400-mile trip to the Hallett Motor Racing
Circuit west of Tulsa. After a day of corner work Saturday, I
planned to run my first race Sunday. It was a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Race tracks have underappreciated people stationed at each turn
known as corner workers. They are in radio contact with someone
known as ``control.''
</P>
<P>
   Corner workers tell ``control'' when crashes, runoffs and
hazards occur within their assigned section of the track. They also
radio in what flags they are showing. Different flags pass along
important information to the racers. It's part of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Corner workers also assist downed riders, summon paramedics and
remove crashed motorcycles and debris from the track and the runoff
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' I said after being told early Saturday morning
where to stand at the crest of a hill outside of a blind left-hand
turn that I figured the riders would be hitting at more than 100
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' asked the longtime race official who I was assisting
in this corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm new to this, but it seems to me that if anyone
loses it in this corner that we are standing right where they will
run off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. They'll come off right at us or to either side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the plan if they come right for us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Run wherever panic takes you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like knowing you are about to be hanged, it tends to concentrate
the mind wonderfully.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was over, our corner station looked like a
motorcycle junkyard with wadded bikes and motorcycle detritus
awaiting retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions, bikes crashed in our corner in pairs, which
complicated the panic escape plan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the riders had something gruesome happen to his right leg
that squirted a lot of blood. He was stabilized and airlifted away
by helicopter. The race never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   When the two experienced emergency medical technicians in the
ambulance assigned to our corner were not treating crashed riders
or hauling them off to parts unknown, they kept asking why people
did this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's fun,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it.''

 &HT;    Love, sweat and cheers
 &HT;    (EDS: With photos.)
 &HT;    By Jay DeFoore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Next Friday is the beginning of the end for
Lauren Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dripping Springs Tigers run onto the field to open
their football season, she and eight of her fellow seniors will
start their last year as high school cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   Her six-year stint leading yells has been a labor of love for
the muscular but petite 17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other girls growing up in Texas, Sterling watched her
dad camp out in front of the TV on Sundays to cheer on the Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd leave church early to see the games if we had to,''
Sterling recalls.
</P>
<P>
   What first caught her attention was not the boys in blue, but
the world-famous Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. As early as age 2,
Sterling dreamed of becoming a cheerleader like them. Scott and
Peggy Sterling bought their daughter pompoms and a skirt so she
could cheer alongside older friends on the high school squad. After
they graduated, Sterling inherited their uniforms and the desire to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   But if her love of cheerleading started with a fascination for
sharp skirts and big, beautiful smiles, that's not what it's about
today.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where conformity rules _ from the matching uniforms
to the perfectly harmonized moves _ Sterling wants you to know that
she is not your typical cheerleader. This is about athletics, not
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like each girl looking exactly the same,'' Sterling
said. ``The uniform is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just her views on the clothes that makes her
different.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not wearing a cheerleader's short skirt and polyester
shirt, Sterling dons a power lifter's garb. She started lifting
weights for sport as a freshman because she and a friend wanted to
prove they could do anything guys do. Now she competes in the sport
associated more with 300-pound men than 115-pound girls.
</P>
<P>
   `` `How much can you bench? How much can you squat?' That's the
first thing guys ask,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   She benches 140 pounds, and squats 235 _ and counting.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent summer afternoon, nearly 500 junior high and high
school cheerleaders spilled out onto the band field at Southwest
Texas State University, singing Britney Spears' ``. . . Baby One
More Time'' and starting water wars from the oversized orange
coolers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the whistle blew, though, the playing stopped. Bodies flew
through the air as girls kicked, flipped, danced and cheered their
way through the complicated stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Sterling shot up from a row of ponytails into a shoulder
stand sequence. Face beaming, arms punctuating her words, she
cheered: ``Tigers. Are you ready? Are you ready to shout it out?
Gooooo Tigers.'' On the count of three she flew into the air, bent
her body and landed safely in a trio of interlocked arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the girls just want to have the look,'' she said.
``They want to have the skirts and look cute. But (cheerleading) is
not about how you look, it's about what you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the importance Dripping Springs puts on cheerleading,
you'd think a girl's popularity would be cemented by making the
cut. But cheerleaders and those who know them insist that isn't the
case. Social factions are the rule within the 12-member squad,
while outside the group girls are stereotyped as slutty and ditzy,
those involved say.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part these girls want to do their job, have fun,
and they're not out there to be in short skirts,'' said Yvonne
Kaatz, who left Austin's Bowie High to coach the Dripping Springs
cheerleaders. ``I do think there's a perception of cheerleaders as
dingy and self-centered, but that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite any disagreements they've had in the past, Sterling _
one of two head cheerleaders on the varsity squad this year _
remains optimistic about the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year by far is going to be the best,'' she said. ``At
camp, we all got along. Once we were done practicing, we would go
back to the dorm, go in one room and we'd turn on the music and
start dancing. We all did it. It wasn't like one or two. Everybody
was doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   That togetherness comes only after years of working together.
Each weekday, the Dripping Springs squad practices for an hour
after school. During the two weeks before the camp in San Marcos,
the girls got up every day at 6 a.m. and practiced until noon. When
you factor in all the games the girls cheer at, it adds up to the
equivalent of a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much of a social life,'' Sterling admits.
</P>
<P>
   Although cheerleading was invented for football, it has gotten
so popular at Dripping Springs that every sport expects the same
attention. Kaatz says the team can't possibly cheer at every
school-sponsored event, so some people automatically get the wrong
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never seems like it's quite enough for everybody,'' Kaatz
explained, ``but if we sat down and listed every single thing these
girls did, people would be amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a ritual soaked with near-religious significance in small
towns across Texas, and Dripping Springs is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday night, everybody goes to the football game,'' says
Sterling's father, Scott, who owns a printing shop in Austin.
``There's not a whole lot of things that draws a community as
diverse as Dripping Springs together, but sports is one of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before the football season kicks off, homemade signs that
pop up in shop windows and front yards will exalt the girls and
their football-payer counterparts. Teen-agers will paint their car
windows with shoe-polished tiger paws, and excitement will fill the
still-sweltering air.
</P>
<P>
   Dripping Springs lies just 30 minutes southwest of downtown
Austin, but it's a world away from the city in most respects. Along
the way, lumber and building supply stores dot the highway and a
sign proudly declares the town ``Gateway to the Hill Country.''
There's not much of a downtown per se; according to the city-limits
sign, only 1,033 people live in town. But scattered around the
hills and canyons in sprawling housing developments are the nearly
10,000 people who make up the Dripping Springs school district and
its fan base.
</P>
<P>
   The town takes its cheerleading so seriously that a few years
back a controversy over it threatened to divide the community.
Disputes over eligibility led one family to threaten to sue the
school, claiming that a girl should not have been allowed to try
out under existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran off our principal, who was an outstanding principal,
over cheerleading,'' Scott Sterling explained. ``It got so bitter,
and the recriminations got so bitter, the principal said that was
one of the major reasons why he left.'' (Former principal Jim
Rosebrock doesn't acknowledge that. He says he left for his current
post with the Belton school district for career advancement.)
</P>
<P>
   Sterling knows she can't be a cheerleader all her life. Most
cheerleaders never cheer after high school. As if to prove the
point, one of Sterling's older friends recently tried out for the
Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, only to be told she wasn't tall enough,
didn't have the right hairstyle and wasn't pretty enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her dancing was great, everything else was great, but she just
didn't have the look,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   She had looked into a cheerleading scholarship at the University
of Texas, but Sterling found that the university offered only a
$100 stipend _ not even enough to fill up a backpack with books. So
now she faces the imminent loss of her first love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss the football games,'' Sterling said. ``It
will be weird watching a game and not being a part of it. But right
now, power lifting is my top priority. I have a better chance (of
continuing) in power lifting than I do in cheerleading.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of winning a power-lifting scholarship, Sterling
decided to become more disciplined. Over the past few summers she
has spent more time in the gym than in front of the TV, and her
parents enlisted a private strength trainer to help her refine her
lifting technique. She even shops for her own groceries, because,
she says, success depends on maintaining a steady weight.
</P>
<P>
   Although six girls competed on the power-lifting team a year
ago, Sterling is the lone female this year. The hassles of
competing in a sport where women are the exception would deter
someone of lesser resolve, but Sterling remains undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power lifting is a pretty new sport on the girls' side,'' she
said. ``I've tried (to recruit new people) but the girls that would
be good at it aren't interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys treat her like any other member of the team, wrapping
her knees before competitions, spotting and giving her support
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're competing as an individual, but it feels like a team,''
Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Training three to five days a week for an hour at a time,
Sterling won first place at the regional tournament and placed
third in the class 4A state competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Attaining her goal of winning at state this year might open some
financial doors at colleges: Although power lifting is not an
official NCAA sport, Louisiana State University and UT have strong
club teams with coaches seasoned in Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of cheerleading camp, the girls stood around
anxiously awaiting the announcement about awards. As a voice on the
loudspeaker called out names of schools and individuals, clusters
of girls erupted in shrieks and giggles. Some ran up to the stage
to get trophies, while others crossed their fingers in hope.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling celebrated with her teammates as the announcement
anointed Dripping Springs winner of the leadership award. She was
also one of a select few to take home a camp all-star trophy.
</P>
<P>
   From the bright-eyed 2-year-old watching the Dallas Cowboy
Cheerleaders to a varsity squad leader, Sterling has come full
circle. Now she's the one inspiring young cheerleaders to put on
the skirts and shake the pompoms. And, perhaps, she can help them
know there's more to the girls on the field than mere sharp skirts
and big smiles. Some of them _ even from small-town Texas _ may be
stronger than you ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to give women more of a chance,'' she
said. ``There are a lot of people who still don't like the idea,
but they'll have to let it grow on them.''

 &HT;    (EDS: Take one of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him: q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a lot of publicity last year about solar storms,
and it was my understanding that a particularly severe one would
occur in November 1999. That's not long off, but I haven't seen
anything more about it. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Solar storms are sudden bursts of charged particles, mostly
protons, sent out from the sun due to sudden changes in its local
magnetic fields. As such, it isn't likely that they could be
predicted months in advance, said J. Scott Shaw of the department
of physics and astronomy at the University of Georgia. You may be
referring instead to the Leonid meteor shower. Meteor showers can
be predicted to some extent, Shaw said, and occur about the same
day each year, such as the perseids shower about every Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw emphasized that meteor showers are cometary debris, not
from the sun. The dust they spread over the solar system hits
Earth's atmosphere and burns up at high altitude, resulting in what
many people call ``shooting stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Colin Powell still involved in the youth project that was
so much in the news a year or two ago? Can you refresh my memory
about the project's goals, and provide a mailing address and
Website, if there is one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Powell is still chairman of America's Promise: The Alliance
for Youth, and continues to actively promote the organization's
aims. Just this month he spoke about it at the National Governor's
Association meeting in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   America's Promise says its goal is to mobilize individuals,
groups and organizations from every part of American life to build
and strengthen the character and competence of all the nation's
young people. It offers five basic ``promises'' to every child in
America: an ongoing relationship with an adult who can be a parent,
mentor, tutor or coach; a safe place with structured activities
during non-school hours; a healthy start; development of marketable
skills through effective education; and an opportunity to give back
through community service.

</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper reported that the U.S. Mint is putting more
pennies into circulation because people appear to be hoarding them.
How much does it cost the Mint to make a penny?
</P>
<P>
   A: Four-fifths of a cent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a videotape available of ``With a Song in My Heart,'' with
actress Susan Hayward playing singer Jane Froman?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1952 movie isn't for sale or rental in a videotape
version, said Debra Dodds of American Movie Classics, because 20th
Century Fox, the studio holding rights to it, hasn't released it on
video. AMC has shown it on TV in the past, but its broadcast rights
expired in October. Dodds said the cable channel is renegotiating
with 20th Century Fox for future broadcast rights, however, so you
might be able to catch it again at some point. She had no specifics
about any timetable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hayward, ``With a Song in My Heart'' featured
Rory Calhoun, David Wayne, Thelma Ritter and Robert Wagner. It told
the poignant story of Froman, who in 1943 was seriously injured in
an airplane crash off Portugal while on a USO tour to entertain
U.S. troops overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly does ``light rail'' mean, and how does it differ
from other rapid rail transit?
</P>
<P>
   A: Light rail is like old-fashioned trolley car lines. It's a
traditionally steel-wheel-on-steel-rail system with an overhead
power source that operates, most often, on an existing right-of-way
such as a street. In other words, it's much like a bus with other
traffic running in front and behind it, and its speed therefore is
limited by how fast the traffic is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rail is traditionally known as a third-rail system. There
are two running rails _ steel wheels on steel rails _ and a third
rail at ground level tht provides the electricity. It must run on
an exclusive right-of-way to prevent any human contact with the
third rail. Of course with an exclusive right-of-way, a heavy rail
line isn't subject to the speed of traffic on the streets, allowing
a more specific operating schedule. With a higher infrastructure
cost and higher-costing vehicles, a heavy rail system is more
expensive than light rail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why was the name of the city in China changed from Peking to
Beijing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Beijing is considered a closer representative of the Chinese
pronunciation. In 1979, the Chinese settled on a system known as
Pinyin romanization to convert Chinese sounds into Roman letters,
resulting in the change to Beijing. Other Chinese names also were
changed. The earlier system, known as Wade-Giles romanization, had
rendered the capital city's name as Peiching. Peking was a variant.
The old spelling still is occasionally seen, and is listed in World
Book Encyclopedia (1999) as an alternate. Most of the American
media, Journal-Constitution included, use the Pinyin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the legal definition of litter include water on roadways
from lawn sprinklers?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Litter is defined by law as (unless otherwise stated) all
sand, gravel, slag, brick bats, rubbish, waste material, tin
can(s), refuse, garbage, trash, dead animals or discarded materials
of every kind and description. Water from an errant sprinkler may
be an annoyance to motorists with clean vehicles when they splash
through it, but no law has been broken.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've started to see CVS pharmacies popping up everywhere, and
I've wondered what the letters stand for. I once heard that it was
Country Value Stores. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's close. The company's first facility opened in Lowell,
Mass., in 1963, under the name Consumer Value Store. It quickly
became known as CVS and operations began expanding dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   CVS merged with Peoples Drug in 1990, and in 1997 CVS Corp.
acquired Revco, making CVS the largest drugstore chain in the
nation based on store count. Then in 1998, CVS acquired Arbor Drugs
to establish the top chain drug retailer based on both store count
and prescriptions dispensed. The Web site for the combined company
says it has 4,100 stores in 25 states and the District of Columbia,
with revenues exceeding $15 billion in 1998. Its headquarters is in
Woonsocket, R.I.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How many days is Congress required to be in session? It's my
understanding that a three-day week is typical.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no set schedule for the number of days a week
lawmakers must meet. But there are some general parameters about
how Congress works. First, you need to know that there are two
sessions in each Congress. A session usually starts on Jan. 3, but
that can change if Jan. 3 falls on a Saturday or Sunday. A session
lasts for about one year, or until both the Senate and the House of
Representatives decide to adjourn finally for that year.
</P>
<P>
   The last four sessions have averaged 319 days apiece. Over that
four-year period, the House met for an average of 139 days in each
session, and the Senate for an average of 159 days per session. But
that doesn't necessarily mean the lawmakers aren't working for
their constituents on other days. On days when no floor meetings
(also called daily sessions) are held, for example, members still
may conduct hearings, district work periods in their local offices,
or engage in official travel. Or, of course, they might be on
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read some time ago that the government of the Philippines
granted medals to U.S. servicemen who participated in the
liberation of the Philippines in World War II. Are these medals
still available?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're no longer being issued. However, if you think you're
eligible for one, you could try working through your senator or
House member. A group of New Jersey veterans was able to obtain
these medals last year through the intervention of Sen. Robert
Torricelli (D-N.J.). Another possibility is to buy one at an outlet
that sells military medals, but they aren't easy to find, now that
they're out-of-issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige award,
which companies used to covet? I haven't seen or heard it mentioned
in some time. Also, can you list past winners?
</P>
<P>
   A: The award, named for the former U.S. secretrary of commerce,
who served from 1981 until his death in a rodeo accident in 1987,
is still ``very much alive, very prestigious and very coveted,''
said Jan Kosko of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. NIST administers the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
Award in a program established by Congress in 1987 to recognize
U.S. companies for their achievements in quality and business
performance, and to raise awareness about excellence as a
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners: 1988, Motorola Inc., Commercial Nuclear Fuel
Division of Westinghouse Electric Corp., and Globe Mettalurgical
Inc.; 1989, Milliken &AMP; Co. and Xerox Corp. Business Products and
Systems; 1990, Cadillac Motor Car Division, IBM Rochester, Federal

</P>
<P>
   This year, 52 organizations applied for the 1999 award. Winners
will be announced in mid-November. Online information:
www.quality.nist.gov/ Q: Q&AMP;A has printed contact information about
the National Rifle Association. I know it's the principal organized
gun advocacy group in the United States. However, we rarely hear
about organizations advocating gun control. Do you know the name
and address of such a group, and how one might make a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several gun control groups. One of the best known
is the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (and its lobbying arm,
Handgun Control Inc.), with Sarah Brady serving as its public chair
and prominent representative. She is the wife of James Brady, who
was shot and severely disabled March 30, 1981, by John Hinckley
Jr., President Reagan's would-be assassin. Donations can be sent to
Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, 1225 Eye St. NW, Suite 1100,
Washington, DC 20005. Information can be obtained online at
www.handguncontrol.org or you can call 202-898-0792.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and its
educational affiliate, the Educational Fund to End Handgun
Violence. Donations can be sent to Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,
1000 16th St. NW, Suite 603, Washington, DC 20036. Its Web site is
www.gunfree.org or you can call 202-530-0340.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the newly merged NationsBank and Bank of
America are No. 1 in the United States and No. 4 in the world in
total deposits. What three banks rank ahead worldwide?
</P>
<P>
   A: American Banker lists these in its Aug. 5 issue, followed by
1998 year-end deposits: No. 1, Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany
($492.2 billion); No. 2, ABN-AMRO Bank NV, Amsterdam, Netherlands
($362.2 billion); and No. 3, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., Tokyo
($358.5 billion). No. 4-ranked Charlotte-based BankAmerica Corp.'s
deposits: $357.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Lilith Fair mentioned that Lilith was the
first wife of Adam. Do you have any more information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lilith, whose name was adopted by the popular music event
geared for women, was a female demon of Jewish folklore. Her name
and personality were derived from the class of Mesopotamian demons
called lilu (feminine lilitu). In rabbinic literature, Lilith is
variously depicted as the mother of Adam's demonic offspring after
his separation from Eve, or as his first wife, who left him because
of their incompatibility. A cult associated with Lilith is believed
to have survived among some Jews as late as the 7th century AD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the folklore, three angels tried in vain to force
Lilith's return. The evil she threatened, especially against
children, was said to be counteracted by the wearing of an amulet
bearing the names of the angels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've researched the origin of the name Scotland Yard but
haven't found any information. Do you know how it came about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It came from the location of the original headquarters of the
London Metropolitan Police. By association, the name is used often
to denote that force.
</P>
<P>
   The New Encyclopedia Britannica explains that the original
headquarters was at 4 Whitehall Place, with an entrance in Great
Scotland Yard. That name came about because it stood on the site of
a medieval palace that had housed members of Scottish royalty when
they came to London on visits. Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins adds that in the years 970 to 1160, the kings of Scotland
were required to go to London once a year to acknowledge their
indebtedness to the rulers of England.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard outgrew its original location, so the headquarters
relocated in 1890 to a new building on the Thames Embankment, at
which time the name changed to New Scotland Yard. In 1967, the
headquarters moved again to still another new building at 10
Broadway, off Victoria Street, but the name remained New Scotland
Yard.

 &HT;    Corkstrew is popping up as a collectible
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For wine drinkers, the efficiency of the
corkscrew is what matters. For people who collect them, it is their
rarity, their age and their novelty.
</P>
<P>
   Like cookie jars and coffee mills, corkscrews have become
collectible. Recently on eBay, the online auction house, 315
corkscrews were listed for sale on a single day. They ranged from a
rosewood, bronze and steel corkscrew circa 1855 for $1,475 to a
brand-new plastic Tupperware Uplifter, which eventually sold for
$10.
</P>
<P>
   For the quirky reasons known best to collectors, some corkscrews
never got a bid at all or languished at garage-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose knowledge of corkscrews is limited to the
utilitarian one in the back of the kitchen drawer, a little
enlightenment: Remember, first, that not everything old is
collectible or valuable.
</P>
<P>
   But some corkscrews, primarily from the last century, bring
``Antiques Road Show'' prices.
</P>
<P>
   One called the ``U-neek'' corkscrew, which looks like something
you'd pass up at a yard sale, sold recently on eBay for $1,009. A
much more elaborate King' Screw Corkscrew, with a bone handle,
brass barrel and built-in brush, sold for $330 and another was
listed for sale priced at $755. A German celluloid folding lady
corkscrew drew eight bidders who escalated offers from $100 to
$400, but that didn't meet the seller's reserve price.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the corkscrews found at most antique shops, malls
or shows. But for collectors whose pockets are not so deep and
whose sights are not so high, there is a wide variety of
collectible _ make that cheaper _ corkscrews to be found with a
little looking. Novelty, promotional and naughty corkscrews show up
at some flea markets and shows priced at $10 and up. Occasionally,
simple 19th-century corkscrews are for sale at the same price or
just a little more. Curiosities such as a tiny corkscrew for
medicine bottles may show up for an equally small price.
</P>
<P>
   Novelty corkscrews usually come cheap. Most anatomically
incorrect figural corkscrews _ and there a lot of them out there _
seem to draw only gag prices. But this month a morbid
corpse-in-a-coffin corkscrew sold for $400 on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors who want to get serious can turn to books. Two
released this year are ``The Ultimate Corkscrew Book,'' a
comprehensive tome that weighs in at close to 5 pounds and sells
for $89.95. It's by collector Don Bull, who also offers a handier
``Bull's Pocket Guide to Corkscrews'' that costs only $17. Ask a
bookstore to order either.
</P>
<P>
   World travelers can check out a French museum dedicated to the
history of the corkscrew, located in Provence at Domaine de la
Citadelle. More than 1,000 corkscrews are on display, some three
centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the old Seagram Museum in Waterloo, Ont., had a
wonderful collection, but when the museum closed four years ago the
collection of spirits and wine-related books, artifacts and
corkscrews was dispersed. The entire corkscrew collection _
hundreds of items _ went to Brock University, where a oenology and
viticulture program is housed in the new Inniskillin Hall. Fifty or
60 of the most unusual corkscrews are on display and larger
displays are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors also can watch for the out-of-print Seagram Museum
poster of corkscrews. One sold recently on eBay for $71.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How many days is Congress required to be in session? It's my
understanding that a three-day week is typical.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no set schedule for the number of days a week
lawmakers must meet. But there are some general parameters about
how Congress works. First, you need to know that there are two
sessions in each Congress. A session usually starts on Jan. 3, but
that can change if Jan. 3 falls on a Saturday or Sunday. A session
lasts for about one year, or until both the Senate and the House of
Representatives decide to adjourn finally for that year.
</P>
<P>
   The last four sessions have averaged 319 days apiece. Over that
four-year period, the House met for an average of 139 days in each
session, and the Senate for an average of 159 days per session. But
that doesn't necessarily mean the lawmakers aren't working for
their constituents on other days. On days when no floor meetings
(also called daily sessions) are held, for example, members still
may conduct hearings, district work periods in their local offices,
or engage in official travel. Or, of course, they might be on
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read some time ago that the government of the Philippines
granted medals to U.S. servicemen who participated in the
liberation of the Philippines in World War II. Are these medals
still available?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're no longer being issued. However, if you think you're
eligible for one, you could try working through your senator or
House member. A group of New Jersey veterans was able to obtain
these medals last year through the intervention of Sen. Robert
Torricelli (D-N.J.). Another possibility is to buy one at an outlet
that sells military medals, but they aren't easy to find, now that
they're out-of-issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige award,
which companies used to covet? I haven't seen or heard it mentioned
in some time. Also, can you list past winners?
</P>
<P>
   A: The award, named for the former U.S. secretrary of commerce,
who served from 1981 until his death in a rodeo accident in 1987,
is still ``very much alive, very prestigious and very coveted,''
said Jan Kosko of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. NIST administers the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
Award in a program established by Congress in 1987 to recognize
U.S. companies for their achievements in quality and business
performance, and to raise awareness about excellence as a
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners: 1988, Motorola Inc., Commercial Nuclear Fuel
Division of Westinghouse Electric Corp., and Globe Mettalurgical
Inc.; 1989, Milliken &AMP; Co. and Xerox Corp. Business Products and
Systems; 1990, Cadillac Motor Car Division, IBM Rochester, Federal
Express Corp., and Wallace Co.; 1991, Solectron Corp., Zytec Corp.,
and Marlow Industries; 1992, AT&AMP;T Network Systems
Group/Transmission Systems Business Unit, Texas Instruments Inc.
Defense Systems &AMP; Electronics Group, AT&AMP;T Universal Card Services,
Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., and Granite Rock Co.; 1993, Eastman
Chemical Co. and Ames Rubber Corp.;
</P>
<P>
   1994, AT&AMP;T Consumer Communications Services, GTE Directories
Corp., and Wainwright Industries; 1995, Armstrong World Industries
Building Products Operation and Corning Telecommunications Products
Division; 1996, ADAC Laboratories, Dana Commercial Credit Corp.,
Custom Research Inc., and Trident Precision Manufacturing; 1997, 3M
Dental Products Division, Merrill Lynch Credit Corp., Solectron,
and Xerox Business Systems; and 1998, Boeing Airlift and Tanker
Programs, Solar Turbines Inc., and Texas Nameplate Co.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 52 organizations applied for the 1999 award. Winners
will be announced in mid-November. Online information:
www.quality.nist.gov/ Q: Q&AMP;A has printed contact information about
the National Rifle Association. I know it's the principal organized
gun advocacy group in the United States. However, we rarely hear
about organizations advocating gun control. Do you know the name
and address of such a group, and how one might make a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several gun control groups. One of the best known
is the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (and its lobbying arm,
Handgun Control Inc.), with Sarah Brady serving as its public chair
and prominent representative. She is the wife of James Brady, who
was shot and severely disabled March 30, 1981, by John Hinckley
Jr., President Reagan's would-be assassin. Donations can be sent to
Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, 1225 Eye St. NW, Suite 1100,
Washington, DC 20005. Information can be obtained online at
www.handguncontrol.org or you can call 202-898-0792.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and its
educational affiliate, the Educational Fund to End Handgun
Violence. Donations can be sent to Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,
1000 16th St. NW, Suite 603, Washington, DC 20036. Its Web site is
www.gunfree.org or you can call 202-530-0340.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the newly merged NationsBank and Bank of
America are No. 1 in the United States and No. 4 in the world in
total deposits. What three banks rank ahead worldwide?
</P>
<P>
   A: American Banker lists these in its Aug. 5 issue, followed by
1998 year-end deposits: No. 1, Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany
($492.2 billion); No. 2, ABN-AMRO Bank NV, Amsterdam, Netherlands
($362.2 billion); and No. 3, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., Tokyo
($358.5 billion). No. 4-ranked Charlotte-based BankAmerica Corp.'s
deposits: $357.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Lilith Fair mentioned that Lilith was the
first wife of Adam. Do you have any more information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lilith, whose name was adopted by the popular music event
geared for women, was a female demon of Jewish folklore. Her name
and personality were derived from the class of Mesopotamian demons
called lilu (feminine lilitu). In rabbinic literature, Lilith is
variously depicted as the mother of Adam's demonic offspring after
his separation from Eve, or as his first wife, who left him because
of their incompatibility. A cult associated with Lilith is believed
to have survived among some Jews as late as the 7th century AD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the folklore, three angels tried in vain to force
Lilith's return. The evil she threatened, especially against
children, was said to be counteracted by the wearing of an amulet
bearing the names of the angels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've researched the origin of the name Scotland Yard but
haven't found any information. Do you know how it came about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It came from the location of the original headquarters of the
London Metropolitan Police. By association, the name is used often
to denote that force.
</P>
<P>
   The New Encyclopedia Britannica explains that the original
headquarters was at 4 Whitehall Place, with an entrance in Great
Scotland Yard. That name came about because it stood on the site of
a medieval palace that had housed members of Scottish royalty when
they came to London on visits. Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins adds that in the years 970 to 1160, the kings of Scotland
were required to go to London once a year to acknowledge their
indebtedness to the rulers of England.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard outgrew its original location, so the headquarters
relocated in 1890 to a new building on the Thames Embankment, at
which time the name changed to New Scotland Yard. In 1967, the
headquarters moved again to still another new building at 10
Broadway, off Victoria Street, but the name remained New Scotland
Yard.

 &HT;    New twists on corkscrew vary widely in price _ and in ease
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos of mentioned corkscrews available.)
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For most wine enthusiasts, the ritual of removing
the cork from a bottle of wine adds something to the mystique of
the moment. The signature ``thwop!'' as the cork slides out . . .
the pouring of the golden-hued liquid _ the clinking of glasses . .
. lights and music down low . . . mmmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: ``Break the neck off that sucker!'' just won't
do. And the screw-cap, though it's probably just as effective at
keeping air out of bottles as compressed tree bark, hasn't caught
on, at least not for the $5-and-up wine bottles. We continue to
embrace the tradition and the mystique that a wine cork represents,
even when it's a pain in the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Risking carpal tunnel inflammation, we decided to take a look at
some of the newest corkscrews on the market to see how they compare
with old favorites and standard-setters of the past and present.
</P>
<P>
   One fact emerges crystal clear: Corkscrews come in all shapes,
sizes, colors and prices. The instrument used to remove wine corks
can set you back anywhere from less than $5 to more than $100. All
will perform the task they're intended to perform, though some take
more practice to master their idiosyncrasies. And what's a few
little floating cork bits in your first glass, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   First, a note about some of the old standbys. The ``waiter's
corkscrew'' _ the fold-up kind with a helix, a lever and a blade to
cut the foil capsule _ has always humbled me. (I was never a
waiter, unless you count my Wendy's career, and I didn't uncork too
many wine bottles in those days.) I can never line it up so that
the lever pushes against the lip of the bottle, so I end up placing
the bottle on the floor, holding it between my feet and pulling up
forcefully. Works, but not, I suspect, how it was intended to.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the device that isn't really a corkscrew at all,
but uses two thin prongs that slide along the sides of the cork
inside of the bottle, allowing the expert user to slide the cork
out without drilling a hole down the middle of it. Sounds good in
theory. The first 50 or so times I tried it, I failed utterly.
Then, out of the blue, I got it to work. And haven't failed since.
Like riding a bike. The key is the rocking motion to fit the prongs
in just so, then the twisting-while-pulling removal. Lot of work,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new corkscrews take almost all the work out of the
process. They're not cheap, but if you've ever gone to battle
against a nasty cork and gotten whipped by it, you know it'd be
nice to have some real ammunition for the next one. Here's a
sampling:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Leverpull from Screwpull ($88 to $138): This is the
Howitzer, the Mercedes, the ultimate corkscrew. It is nothing short
of an engineering marvel. It comes in its own snazzy felt-lined
case with a separate foil cutter and a replacement ``worm'' or
helix. Looks like a cross between a pair of pliers and a staple
gun. There is no twisting involved. Place the device over the
bottle, lift up on a lever, pull it back down, and the cork is
gone. Then the best part: Repeat the movement of the lever, and the
machine takes the cork off the helix for you. Simple, beautiful,
fast _ and expensive. But do some shopping, and you might save a
bundle. This is listed at $137.95 in the Wine Enthusiast catalog
and a local wine shop says that's about their price as well, when
they have the item in stock. Yet, the Wine Club, (800) 966-5432, a
discount wine and accessories shop in California, sells the same
device for $87.99. A salesman said the store sells more Leverpulls
than any other retailer in the country. At that price, I believe
him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Screwpull (regular or pocket, about $24.99 at local wine
shops): My favorite; an old standby that's been around in its
current design for at least a decade. Easy, almost foolproof, the
Teflon-coated helix slides straight and true into the center of the
cork as you twist a handle on top. Continuing to twist in the same
direction gently removes the cork, which you then have to manually
unscrew from the helix. A godsend for those who struggle with the
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   _ Winemaster, from VacuVin ($64.99): This thing's huge, shaped
like a large tulip bloom, with four levers, two on each side. It
has gripping pads that are supposed to lock on the bottle and what
the manufacturer calls a ``self-rotating spiral'' to remove the
cork. Maybe I hadn't mastered the locking grip pads, because when I
tried it, the bottle starting spinning on the countertop as the
spiral tried to enter the cork. And you need two hands to work the
levers, so I couldn't hold the bottle to keep it from spinning. One
plus: The tiny foil-cutter attaches to the top of the corkscrew
ingeniously and works flawlessly. Available through the Sharper
Image mail order at (800) 344-4444 or the ``Wine Enthusiast''
catalog at (800) 558-9288. Cyber-shoppers can check out
www.wineenthusiast.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ CorkPull by OXO ($19.99): A soft, no-slip handle makes this
new product relatively easy to use, though I couldn't master the
built-in foil cutter. Just turn the handle in the same direction
until the cork is removed _ a tiny ``window'' in the side of the
corkscrew allows you to see when the cork is free from the bottle.
The manufacturer's customer information number (800) 545-4411, and
Web site address is www.oxo.com. OXO's local retailers include the
Culinary Company, Dorothy Lane Market locations, the Red Radish and
Stein Mart.
</P>
<P>
   _ Winged Corkscrew by OXO ($5.99): Decent, inexpensive, plastic
version of the heavy-metal winged corkscrew. Availability, see
above.

 &HT;    Nunez expects `nothing but the best' for Horns this year
 &HT;    By Gary Estwick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Rocky Mountains called Ryan Nunez's name in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes now he hadn't answered.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez, projected as the University of Texas' starting split end
this season, committed to the Longhorns in 1996 after a standout
high school career. He abruptly changed his mind about Texas,
though, and signed with Colorado. After an uneventful freshman
season in which he played in all 11 games, he transferred to Texas
and sat out his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In going to Colorado, it's basically something I've tried to
put behind me,'' said Nunez, who sacrificed a year of eligibility
and first played for Texas as a junior last season. ``It's a
mistake I made. It's obvious that I made it because that's why I
came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez, after a self-proclaimed good preseason, is ready to run
past North Carolina State's defensive backs in Texas' football
season opener Saturday night at Royal-Memorial Stadium. He also has
confidence in his teammates. ``We expect nothing but the best from
everybody on the team,'' said Nunez, who excels at running after
catching the ball. ``Everybody on the field has talent or we
wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez played in all 12 games for the Horns last season,
including the Cotton Bowl. He had 18 receptions for 171 yards and
caught a pass in 10 of 12 games. The speedster also returned eight
kickoffs for 102 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez doesn't talk about his reasons for leaving Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He thanks former UT coach John Mackovic for giving him a chance
to return to Texas. ``If it wasn't for him, I'd still be there or
somewhere else,'' Nunez said. ``I just feel so honored to be able
to play for this university going into my senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Colorado, Nunez ranked seventh in the Big 12 in
punt returns (6.4 yards per return) and averaged 26 yards on six
kickoff returns. He was used sparingly at receiver, catching two
passes for 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Nunez tutored under former Longhorns receiver Wane
McGarity, UT's all-time single season leader in receptions (58) and
yards (1,087) who now is a Dallas Cowboys rookie. Nunez said he has
worked to mimic the work ethic of McGarity and junior receiver
Kwame Cavil, UT's all-time leading receiving duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (McGarity's) talents featured different things than I
feature, but I'm still looking to help the team the same way that
he did,'' Nunez said, ``just by making plays, being out there as a
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what combination of receivers the Horns have on the
field, Nunez says the backups need to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need those young players to help our ballclub this year,''
Nunez said. ``When Jamel (Thompson), Montrell (Flowers) and David
are in the game, we shouldn't miss a beat on offense. There
shouldn't be any letdowns and there won't be any letdowns. Two guys
can't play receiver the whole game. It's just not going to happen.
So we need everybody that we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of us comes out and we send another guy in, we don't
want to miss a beat,'' Nunez said. ``Just because he's a
second-team guy, that doesn't mean anything, We're here to win. We
all want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez has not scored a collegiate touchdown. He's itching to get
inend zone this season, but that's not his main objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to press it or try to do anything that's out of
reach,'' Nunez said. ``I'm just going to play hard every play and
every snap. What happens, happens. With the playing time I should
get this year, it should happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Nunez is glad to be out of Colorado and back in Texas:
``I'm over that, I'm through with that, and I'm loving it where I'm
at now.''

 &HT;    Bengals messiah in body of Smith
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ Something magical must be happening to the
Bengals because something mystical already has.
</P>
<P>
   On quarterback Akili Smith's first trip to Cincinnati _ April 9,
1999 _ a tornado struck the city.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived to sign a 7-year, $56 million contract on
Tuesday, rain drenched this sleepy Kentucky town for the first time
since Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals waited 25 days through drought conditions for their
football savior to arrive at training camp. When the big day
finally came, they had to wait some more as lightning delayed the
start of practice by a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sky cried tears of joy when the No. 1 draft pick
finally ended his holdout. Just call this former University of
Oregon touchdown passing machine ``The Rainmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, operating on little sleep and lots of adrenaline, rifled
spirals all over the rain-drenched field at Rawlings Stadium in his
first workout under contract. When he was off target, head coach
Bruce Coslet let him know _ ``High ball! C'mon! Let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith was just glad to get the deal done, strap on his
shoulder pads and join his teammates at Georgetown College.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``it just became instantly exciting'' when agent Leigh
Steinberg approved the contract Monday. ``It was like, wow, the
contract is finally done, my dream has come true, I'm going to the
NFL to be a quarterback and now it's time to live up to my
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to start earning his money by playing against the
Buffalo Bills in the preseason home opener on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, definitely,'' he said. ``Why wait? Let's get out
there and learn on the ropes like Peyton Manning (of the
Indianapolis Colts in 1998) instead of standing on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith knows he's No. 2 behind Jeff Blake, but he doesn't think
like a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go out, continue to work hard and get better
each and every day,'' he said. ``That's all I can ask for. And if
Jeff Blake happens to falter in any type of way, I want to make
sure I'm ready when my name is called to go on the field, and show
the coaching staff and Mr. (Mike) Brown (team president) that I'm
capable of taking this team to a Super Bowl in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl? The Bengals have been to two, losing to the San
Francisco 49ers after the 1981 and '88 seasons, but they haven't
had a winning team since 1990 (9-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope,'' Akili's father, Ray, said, ``is to be in the Super
Bowl in 2003 in San Diego. Just to take it back home and showcase
him to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith slept one hour on the red-eye from San Diego to
Cincinnati, arriving at 5:45 a.m. After another hour and a half of
sleep at an extended-stay hotel, he signed the contract that
included a $10.8 million signing bonus at Spinney Field.
</P>
<P>
   Brown paid no attention to Smith's weariness from jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing Mr. Brown's been talking about is getting me to
Georgetown,'' Smith said. ``He told me earlier: 'We don't care
about your sleep. We don't care about your eat. We want you to go
to practice.' ``
</P>
<P>
   How tough was it to be in San Diego knowing teammates were
sweating out 90-degree heat in Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough because I really wanted to be in camp,'' Smith
said. ``There was a little frustration, but I had confidence in my
attorney (Leigh Steinberg) that he'd get the best deal possible for
me. All I could do was continue to work without the team, study as
much as possible and I did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed a lot and it hurts because I'm a rookie and I want to
get the speed of the game down pat, take some reps and get familiar
with the offense. I got a late start, but I'm still optimistic
about everything I'm capable of doing. Hopefully, I just get the
opportunity to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up for the challenge. I've been up for the challenge all
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said he ``deliberately shielded Akili off from any
history of the Bengals. I didn't explain in great details the
contract problems that we'd had or the unhappiness, because he has
such a refreshing look and great attitude. I didn't want him to be
dragged down by the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Smith _ who works with kids, gang members and ex-cons at the
Triple Crown Youth Coalition in San Diego _ gave Akili one valuable
piece of advice long before his football career went from Lincoln
Academy, the same high school that produced superstar running backs
Terrell Davis and Marcus Allen, to the University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him: 'Don't step up on the field if your mind's not
made up to be a winner,' `` Ray Smith said. ``He's a winner. He has
a burning desire in his heart. It's the difference between a person
who's good and a person who's great.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mind is made up. He's focused on what he wants to get
accomplished. I've never seen anybody as committed to a task as he
is.''

 &HT;    Cowboys' offense flunked summer school
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Troy Aikman had laser surgery on his eyes
this year, a procedure that improved his eyesight to 20/15. One
might think the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys has no problems
with vision.
</P>
<P>
   That has done little to change his often-surly personality. When
a pack of visitors holding notepads and microphones peppered him
with questions about the team's sputtering offense, Aikman brushed
them aside like yesterday's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have never been judged accurately by preseason
nonsense, a fact any football nut memorized long ago, according to
one of the NFL's brightest stars. Why should this year be any
different?
</P>
<P>
   The summer is a time for experimenting with new players, new
schemes, Aikman said. Mistakes in July and August have no relevance
to what will happen during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't spell it out any clearer than that,'' Aikman told a
reporter, apparently agitated by another inquiry about the offense.
``If you don't understand that, you shouldn't be covering the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's classless response is a slap at anyone who has seen the
Cowboys and believes they are not remotely close to being ready for
their Sept. 12 opener in Washington. How dare people judge Dallas
by what they have seen in three preseason games, all losses?
</P>
<P>
   In Aikman's defense, an 0-3 summer record is meaningless. The
Cowboys have not had a winning preseason record since 1989,
Aikman's rookie season. Dallas followed that with a 1-15 record in
the regular season, proving that summer results do not translate
into fall glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were one game away from being preseason champs in '89,''
team owner Jerry Jones recalled. ``And then look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Lombardi Trophy three times in the '90s, it's
easy to understand the team's logic concerning summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   But a winless record is not what concerns anyone who has
witnessed the Cowboys drop the ball this summer. It's one thing to
be 0-3, it's quite another to look dazed and confused in the
process. The first-team offense has yet to look sharp in any
preseason games. This was supposed to be the time the Cowboys
proved they finally had a firm grasp of Coach Chan Gailey's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Is it asking too much of Aikman and Co. to develop a decent
scoring drive? Will Michael Irvin ever become a vital part of the
offense again? If Aikman would not throw so many interceptions into
double coverage, perhaps some of us clueless witnesses would
understand.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is much too ugly for Aikman's eyes. The Cowboys are in
offensive turmoil. They look exactly like the team that averaged 12
points in its last five games last season. A 20-7 loss to Arizona
in the first round of the playoffs was the last pitiful reminder
that the offense needed a tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take 20/20 vision to see that a pretty Cadillac had
trouble under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the summer of '99 was considered so crucial. The
Cowboys were eager to prove that last season's nose dive was not an
omen that a proud dynasty is on life-support.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 days remaining before the real games begin, running back
Chris Warren (groin pull) and receiver Rocket Ismail (shoulder
separation) have yet to make an impact. Fullback Daryl Johnston was
supposed to be phased out of the offensive rotation, but Warren's
injury has forced Johnston to take nearly every snap with the first
team. Rookie lineman Solomon Page, a converted tackle, proved to be
a bust at right guard while replacing injured veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't worked with some of the guys as much as we hoped
to,'' Aikman said. ``(Receiver) James McKnight's (torn knee
ligament) was a big blow to the football team. Rocket's absence has
hindered our development as quarterback and receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   When training camp ends today at Midwestern State, the Cowboys
will have more questions than answers. This is the worst camp they
have had in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The summer progress report is filled with failures and
incompletes. The first-team offense has not been on the field long
enough to gain an identity, much less a touchdown. There is not
enough fresh blood to inspire anyone. The leftovers from the
Arizona playoff game don't look so good seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   If Aikman cannot see this, maybe he needs to go back to
contacts.

   CHEERLEADING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Next Friday is the beginning of
the end for Lauren Sterling. When the Dripping Springs Tigers run
onto the field to open their football season, she and eight of her
fellow seniors will start their last year as high school
cheerleaders. Her six-year stint leading yells has been a labor of
love for the muscular but petite 17-year-old. Like many other girls
growing up in Texas, Sterling watched her dad camp out in front of
the TV on Sundays to cheer on the Dallas Cowboys. If her love of
cheerleading started with a fascination for sharp skirts and big,
beautiful smiles, that's not what it's about today. In a sport
where conformity rules _ from the matching uniforms to the
perfectly harmonized moves _ Sterling wants you to know that she is
not your typical cheerleader. This is about athletics, not
popularity. (DeFoore, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

THORPE BREAKS OWN RECORD IN THE 200-METER FREESTYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ They call him the Thorpedo, and Ian Thorpe
of Australia created another major splash in the Pan-Pacific swim
championships Tuesday night with a world-record performance in the
men's 200-meter freestyle final.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Sydney resident followed up his world record in
the 400-meter freestyle with a time of 1 minute 45.7 seconds. That
broke the mark he set Monday in a semifinal heat by 0.6 second. It
also overwhelmed his compatriot and former world champion Michael
Klim (1:46) and left Thorpe as the swimmer to watch on the road to
the 2000 Olympics, which will be held in the Sydney International
Aquatic Center in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's performance continued the amazing string of world
records being shattered during this initial test of the Olympic
venue. The American Lenny Krayzelburg added the sixth world mark of
the meet by winning the 100-meter backstroke in 53.60 seconds,
breaking the mark of 53.86 set by Jeff Rouse at the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best pool I've ever swum in,'' said Krayzelburg, who
went to the United States with his family from the Soviet Union in
1989, became an American citizen in 1995 and remains one of the
American favorites for gold medals in his stroke next year.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg may add to his record collection Friday night when
he swims the 200-backstroke, which he considers his favorite event.
</P>
<P>
   But for local residents, the lanky 6-foot-6-inch Thorpe has
become almost as large as his size-17 feet. A modest graduate of
suburban pools and Australia's national coaching system, Thorpe's
technique of going very fast very early has turned 200 and
400-meter races into virtual sprints. And it has energized
spectators and a country searching for fresh heroes to challenge
the traditional swim supremacy of American and European men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not get any better than this,'' Thorpe said afterward,
``but I was hurting over the last 50 meters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can stop him at the moment,'' Klim said.
</P>
<P>
   Although not an official Olympic test event, this meet has
provided an indication of what could become a record-setting
festival for the sport next year, with the addition of European and
Chinese competitors.
</P>
<P>
   All Olympic-size pools are 50 meters in length, but they differ
in speed in much he same way as baseball fields have certain
characteristics that lend themselves to power over pitching. This
facility uses anti-wave lane ropes, a level wet deck and water
depth of 10 feet, which reduces the turbulence that often inhibits
swimmers from achieving peak speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The water is also being ozone-treated to improve visibility,
which can assist on turns and provide the psychological impetus
that swimmers feel is critical to the split-second difference in a
world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew it was going to be incredibly quick,'' Thorpe
said of the pool. ``It's an exciting venue to swim at, especially
when the crowd gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   Many swimmers also arrived for this meet in peak condition, a
state of mind that mirrors what they would face around the same
time next year.
</P>
<P>
   The South African breast-stroker Penny Heyns won a gold medal in
the 100-meter event, but failed to improve on her world-record time
in the semifinals.

   CHEERLEADING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Next Friday is the beginning of
the end for Lauren Sterling. When the Dripping Springs Tigers run
onto the field to open their football season, she and eight of her
fellow seniors will start their last year as high school
cheerleaders. Her six-year stint leading yells has been a labor of
love for the muscular but petite 17-year-old. Like many other girls
growing up in Texas, Sterling watched her dad camp out in front of
the TV on Sundays to cheer on the Dallas Cowboys. If her love of
cheerleading started with a fascination for sharp skirts and big,
beautiful smiles, that's not what it's about today. In a sport
where conformity rules _ from the matching uniforms to the
perfectly harmonized moves _ Sterling wants you to know that she is
not your typical cheerleader. This is about athletics, not
popularity. (DeFoore, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

NASA LOOKS TO INFLATABLE MODULE TO INCREASE ASTRONAUTS' LIVING
SPACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ NASA unveiled a strategy Tuesday to triple the size of
the living and recreational accommodations for astronauts assigned
to the international space station if it can find a business
partner by October.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involves commercial development of an inflatable module
called TransHab, which engineers at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston proposed more than two years ago as the living quarters for
Mars-bound astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is eager to use the module on the station, replacing the
original plan for a smaller aluminum cylinder. If successful, the
venture could open the door to further commercial activities aboard
the new orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Space buffs have embraced the use of an inflatable module,
believing it might encourage space tourism or expeditions to the
moon, to an asteroid, or to Mars. But some congressional members
oppose changes that could drive station costs higher. Also, NASA is
vague about the terms of the commercial arrangement it would accept
to overcome the cost and liability issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very complex,'' said Dan Tam, a special assistant to
NASA chief Dan Goldin. ``But if we do it right, we could open a
whole new horizon for commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to change some rules and kick some butt, let's do
it,'' he told about 150 people from the aerospace industry who
gathered Tuesday in south Houston for a three-day forum on space
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   Time is a factor, however. Construction of the $100 billion
international outpost began late last year. The aluminum crew
habitation module is to launch in November 2004, raising the
permanent astronaut complement to seven.
</P>
<P>
   In order to substitute the inflatable module, NASA must have a
business partner by the end of October, said Tam. NASA would invest
no more than $200 million, the cost of completing the aluminum
module.
</P>
<P>
   Though not yet outfitted, the aluminum habitation module is 28
feet long and 14.5 feet in diameter, offering about 4,400 cubic
feet of internal space, for astronaut sleep chambers, a galley,
exercise area, health station, shower and wardroom.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $2.5 million on development, engineers at the
Johnson Space Center have successfully constructed and tested a
prototype of an inflatable that is 36 feet long and 27 feet in
diameter, offering three times the volume, said Donna Fender, the
NASA TransHab project manager.
</P>
<P>
   With the larger volume, the inflatable can be separated into a
three-level structure, allowing the astronauts to outfit the top
floor as an exercise area and health station, the second floor with
bedrooms, and the bottom floor for a large galley and wardroom that
would enable up to a dozen space travelers to dine together or
gather for planning sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ground tests at Johnson last year demonstrated that the
inflatable prototype can be folded into a 27-foot by 14-foot
package for launch by the space shuttle and that it will bear up
under at least two and a half times the normal sea-level air
pressure the astronauts plan to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5-foot thick outer wall of the inflatable is designed like
a bulletproof vest and prevents penetration by a 1-inch projectile
moving at 15,000 mph, surpassing the protection of the aluminum
module. Tests have shown that the fabric module offers superior
radiation protection as well, Fender said.
</P>
<P>
   The TransHab concept also has the endorsement of Shannon Lucid,
the astronaut who holds the U.S. record for time in space, 188
days, established aboard Russia's Mir space station in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The galley, exercise area and sleep quarters were clustered
aboard the Russian outpost, creating clutter and often making it
difficult for even small crews to separate their duties.
</P>
<P>
   Lucid stressed the importance of privacy and pleasant
surroundings for those who will spend three to six months at a time
on the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not have a good place to live, you don't have a
productive crew,'' Lucid said.

BROOKS LABORS AT HIS CRAFT OUTSIDE HOLLYWOOD CIRCLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ As the recent run of movies proves beyond a
doubt, inspiration in Hollywood can really be something that rhymes
with Blair Witch.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks knows that as well as anybody. A pioneering
comedian, occasional actor and filmmaker who takes his sweet time
between self-generated, uncompromisingly personal projects, Brooks
often explores how artists of various stripes fail to connect with
their artistry.
</P>
<P>
   He addresses the subject directly in his latest movie comedy,
``The Muse.'' But it's always been part of his act, not only in
such jobs-for-hire as ``Broadcast News'' and ``I'll Do Anything,''
but in all six of the feature films he's written and directed.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks cast himself as a TV documentary maker in the 1979 ``Real
Life''; as a film editor in 1981's ``Modern Romance'' (``He could
have been a dentist,'' Brooks admits, ``but no one had made a movie
about film editors at the time''); as ad men in ``Lost in America''
(1985), and ``Defending Your Life'' (1991) _ ``I like to do
advertising because a brother's in it,'' he says _ and as writers
in ``Mother'' (1996) and ``The Muse.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll note the length of time between Brooks-generated
projects. For a guy who's often considered the West Coast
equivalent of the prolific Woody Allen, it's a comparatively light
filmography. But even though he plays a Hollywood scripter with a
severe case of writer's block in the new movie, Brooks' limited
output doesn't necessarily represent a case of career reflecting
art.
</P>
<P>
   More like the opposite of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in there, and I'm trying to get them out,'' the
52-year-old Brooks says of the films he creates. ``It's what I want
to say, it's my art form. And by the way, that's the way it should
be, I don't think it's any different than being an artist that
paints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do it because I love it and need to get it out. If
you like it, I'm thrilled. If you don't like it, I can't do much
about that. But if I start fixing it to make you like it, you'll
leave me in one second.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has kept Brooks _ whose smart, low-budget comedies
attract a small, discriminating following of ardent fans _ out of
the Hollywood mainstream for the length of his filmmaking career.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a new situation for his ``Muse'' character, Steven
Phillips, a once Oscar-nominated screenwriter who, in what he
thought was comfortable midlife, suddenly loses his deal at
Paramount over a new script that everyone from sneering young
studio execs to his own agent tells him has no edge.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to maintain the pleasant (if hardly lavish) lifestyle
he's provided for his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) and their two
young daughters, Phillips gets a tip from an outlandishly
successful colleague (Jeff Bridges): Go to Sarah, a gosh-darn muse
descended from the legendary Greek spirits that inspired artists.
</P>
<P>
   That she's a frivolous, high-maintenance, life-upending diva
seems a small, albeit increasingly annoying flaw. After all, the
mega-successful likes of James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Rob
Reiner (all in cameo appearances as themselves) keep coming around
for divine artistic guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, shouldn't anyone who looks like Sharon Stone get
anything she wants, no matter how outlandish? Especially when she's
being so unexpectedly funny about it all? ``Albert Brooks is the
Scorsese of comedy,'' Stone gushed shortly after playing The Muse
last fall. ``He's the smartest, he's the funniest, he gets it, he
is disciplined. I mean, he breaks his back to make these movies.
That's exciting; it was heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like your basic Brooks fan. In fact, Stone was so eager
to work for the comedian that she agreed to appear in the film
after one phone call, before even seeing a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, saying `Are you sure? 'Cause I'm gonna go tell
the studio. You're not going to make a fool out of me?''' Brooks
recalls. ``And she said `Yes, I'll be your Muse.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Brooks cast Stone against her usual hard-edged,
sex-symbol type, he also risked a real life-following-art situation
with the actress, who has her own reputation for not always being
easy to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to sound like these cliche people who always say
so-and-so was wonderful,'' Brooks confesses, ``but I swear to God,
on my life, it was the most opposite of what I thought it was going
to be. I would rank (Stone) in the top 5 percent of people who come
prepared _ with ideas _ of people I've worked with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard about the reputation. But, maybe because she was
new at comedy and needed to trust me, she just was the single most
cooperative person. I was really very, very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to art for art's sake, sort of ... Brooks says that Sarah
represents a kind of superstitious celebrity worship that runs
rampant through Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the movie's themes is that anybody can run this
place,'' Brooks sarcastically notes. ``Also that, more than any
other business, this one runs totally on reputation, and that can
be tarnished in a minute. You can go from king to pauper in 15
seconds. The head of Coca-Cola has to do something very horrible,
like let bottles be poisoned, in order to lose his job. But studio
executives can fall in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a town built on illusion, and one of the
slogans I thought would be good for this movie is, `If you believe
it, it's true.' That's sort of what I've always felt about
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' own belief in comedy as an art form emerged in his early
stand-up work, when he'd appear regularly on ``The Dean Martin
Show'' and Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show.'' A child of show biz _
his father, Harry Einstein, was a radio comedian, and brother Bob
Einstein is better known as his comic daredevil alter ego Super
Dave Osborne _ Brooks wanted to move beyond the simple joke-telling
that marked his father's era of professional humor and still
dominated the field in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   So he worked up more concept-based schtick, much of which _ like
his bad ventriloquist and the elephant trainer who had to do his
act with a last-minute replacement frog _ mercilessly lampooned
tired show-biz conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Brooks disrespected his elders. Not all
of them considered him an upstart, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Jack Benny,'' he happily confesses. ``One time, we
were both on `The Tonight Show.' During the last commercial break,
Jack leaned over to Johnny and said, `Be sure to ask me where I'm
gonna be, will ya?' So when the show came back on, Johnny asked him
where he was going to be performing. And Jack goes, `Never mind
about me; this is the funniest kid I've ever seen.'''
</P>
<P>
   As wonderful as moments like that were, Brooks admits the
stand-up scene, although artistically satisfying, was a lonely
grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such artificial love in this business,'' he says,
sounding like a character from ``The Muse.'' ``After entertaining
5,000 people, going back and sitting in a hotel room alone for the
rest of the night was very depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks recently found a solution to the committed comedian's
isolated existence: He married for the first time 2{ years ago.
Last year, Brooks and his wife Kimberly, who designs Internet Web
sites, welcomed their first son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I highly recommend it,'' he says of family life. ``All of the
good cliches are true.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Brooks has grown into a more mature and settled comic,
what does he think of today's younger crop of jokesters?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're into dirty words, that's what it is,'' Brooks says of
the Adam Sandler-Chris Rock generation. But although they may sound
like it, these are not the words of a grumpy old man. ``Maybe
because, for generations, we've been repressed and not been able to
say those things freely, this generation will blurt it out until
they're tired of it. Then comedy will go on to something else; I
hope that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks doesn't view vulgar comedy's wide popularity today as a
repudiation of the carefully constructed, psychologically based
humor he specializes in. Unlike his alter ego in ``The Muse,'' he
isn't concerned about going out of style _ for one very good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been on the inside so I don't feel like I'm on
the outside,'' Brooks says with a resigned smile. ``People ask me
if I think all of these raunchy comedies are a fall from grace, and
my answer is that I've never been to grace, so I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, I've always felt like an outsider. Even at 25, I
felt uncomfortable talking to studio executives. For me, it's
always been sort of weird and tough. I've never been Hollywood's
darling, so there's no, one day, `Oh my God, I'm not this
anymore.''' &QL;

   KIDS: Donnie Wilson works with the children of deadbeat dads to
make sure their children receive all of the social services they're
entitled to. Wilson, who works for the Jackson County (Mo.)
prosecutor's office, will be at Don Bosco Community Center in
Kansas City on Wednesday to help kids get school supplies. It's a
concrete example of how courts and prosecutors link families with
social services. What's more, the program is expanding to Drug
Court families to prevent those children from becoming criminals.
Studies show $1 spent on social services saves society $7 on
incarceration costs. Prosecutor Bob Beaird says that's a good use

   CHURCH. As new churches sprout across the metro area, Congress
is considering a law that some local leaders fear will curtail
their ability to regulate zoning for religious organizations; the
Religious Liberty Protection Act, intended to protect religious

   CHIEFS. The Jacksonville jinx will end tonight for Chiefs
quarterback Elvis Grbac. In 1997, Grbac missed the Chiefs' trip to
Jacksonville after he suffered a broken clavicle the previous week
against Pittsburgh. The Chiefs lost 24-10. In 1998, Grbac was on
the sidelines, his arm in a sling, a week after he suffered a
separated shoulder in the season opener against Oakland. The Chiefs
lost 21-16. But Grbac has made it through two preseason games
unscathed this year. And while tonight's 7:05 game against the
Jacksonville Jaguars is just an exhibition game, it will be
significant for Grbac and the rest of the Chiefs starters. The game
will serve as a true dress rehearsal for the regular season. Randy
Covitz. 25.

   WWF: Tonight the World Wrestling Federation makes television
history. For the first time in nearly 45 years, a weekly
professional wrestling series will air in prime time on a broadcast
network when ``WWF Smackdown'' debuts tonight on UPN. The series
premiere is an edited version of matches that took place Tuesday
night at Kemper Arena. Pro wrestling has been a staple of cable TV
since the 1980s and has aired in syndication for decades. Going
back even further, it was a Saturday-night staple of the DuMont
network from 1949 to 1955, with famed Chicago announcer Jack
Brickhouse doing the blow-by-blow. But in recent years wrestling's
popularity has soared. Rival leagues WWF and Ted Turner's World
Championship Wrestling, or WCW, have poured money into the sport.
Their cards have become spectacles with pyrotechnic displays,
thundering music, outlandish characters involved in outrageous
``story lines'' and enthusiastic fans who know the stories and
catch phrases of each character. Aaron Barnhart. 27 &QL;

 &HT;    Cyber Spice on kids
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are all so worried about our kids. With so many dangers and
negative influences about, it's hard not to worry. Are we doing all
we can to nurture and protect them? Could we be doing too much?
With changes in our culture hurtling along at breakneck speed
sometimes, it's hard to know just what to do.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, it's wise to stick with what you know and what
you can be certain is true. Seeing that our kids eat well and
develop an appreciation of good food is something that will have a
lasting positive effect. And parents have the opportunity to do
that every day.
</P>
<P>
   One area that presents nutritional and culinary challenges is
packing school lunches. Looming before parents are 180 days (make
tdown the drain and wonders what she can do at this late date.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Of course, no matter how much thought you put into packing
lunch, it may gks or broccoli florets, along with a small container
of salad dressing.
</P>

<P>
   Low-fat potato chips and a small container of fat-free dip.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Now we get to snack packs, those seductively packaged lunch
packs that are currently the rage with kids. They might be
convenient, but get the lowdown by reading

   Hops, as Jim Dorsch tells us in Beer Connoisseur magazine, have
had myriad uses since ancient times, from baking to medicine. But
they are a comparative newcomer to brewing, and the English at
first rejected the plant as ``a pernicious weed.'' Their emphatic
disapproval moved Henry VIII _ whose way of settling matters could
be swift and final _ to ban them from the kingdom. Not until Edward
VI rescinded the edict later in the century did English brewers
gradually come to see hops' value, first as a preservative but
eventually as beer's defining spice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To brew beer without hops,'' Dorsch writes, ``would be like
cooking soup without seasoning. Hop bitterness mitigates the
sweetness of malt. Hop oils give beer flavors and scents redolent
of pine, citrus, flowers and herbs.''
</P>
<P>
   With the craft brewing movement, hops are being rediscovered in
all their variety, from the softly floral notes of the classic Saaz
to the assertive citrus character of Cascade and Centennial hops.
Even the biggest brewers _ who long ago diluted their flagship
beers to the point where neither malt nor hops could be detected _
are catching on. Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Pale Ale is a case in
point, albeit an unadventurous one.
</P>
<P>
   Ales, the family of beers whose heritage reaches back to England
and Belgium, are distinguished from lagers in certain basic ways,
and one of them is the hops. British ales traditionally have used
East Kent Goldings and Fuggles hops to impart the flavor and aroma.
When American craft brewers began to brew assertive ales in the
1980s, they used domestic hops, notably the Cascade, to achieve a
distinctively different, Pacific Northwest character.
</P>
<P>
   But in neither a British nor an American ale would you expect to
find the Saaz hop, the Hallertau or the Tettnang, the so-called
noble hops used in German lagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do lagers tend to be made with ... Hallertau, Saaz,
Tettnang and Spalt, while British ales seem to taste best with
Fuggles or Goldings?'' Dorsch asks. ``It's hard to say. Some
variables can be measured, but in the end it's still a mystery.''
As a rule, German hops are flowery and perfumey, while such
American varieties as Cascade, Centennial and Chinook have a piney
or citrusy character. Different from both the American and German
hops, English Fuggles and East Kent Goldings tend to be herbal and
earthy.
</P>
<P>
   So here is Michelob Pale Ale, brewed from top-fermenting ale
yeast, seasoned not with hops you'd expect, but the hops found in
Czech and German lagers. It's even dry-hopped _ an extra step the
world's largest brewery has undertaken in emulation of smaller
craft breweries _ and the results are, well, not bad. This is
easily the best beer Anheuser-Busch makes.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like damning with faint praise, you need to set
this well-made beer alongside two others that aim for the middle of
the road. I chose Celis' Pale Rider and New Amsterdam India Pale
Ale, beers from well-regarded craft breweries. In the case of
Celis, you even had the authority of Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are honored,'' the label says, ``to bring you Pale Rider,
proudly brewed for Clint Eastwood by his friends at Celis Brewery.
... It's an easy-drinking beer with a deep, rich character and a
spirited nature _ much like the man we're brewing it for.'' (The
label has a rawhide motif, with a mounted cowboy _ maybe it's Clint
_ in an Old West town. The story behind the beer is less romantic.
``There was a person in sales and marketing at Miller (which owns
Celis) who came up with the concept,'' says Lenzie Kinyon, Celis'
plant manager in Austin, Texas. But Miller decided it didn't need a
smaller brand and instead transferred it to Celis. It was primarily
lawyers dealing with lawyers rather than with Eastwood, Kinyon
said.)
</P>
<P>
   Pale Rider is what could be called an extra pale ale, meaning a
pale ale lighter in color and body, with less hop character and
lower alcohol content. If this is Clint's beer, he's mellowed a
bit. Pale Rider is smooth and bland at the same time, with no
particular malt or hop character.
</P>
<P>
   The Michelob Pale Ale, by contrast, is far from being a
hophead's beer, but the dry-hopping with Saaz gives it an aroma a
Bavarian would recognize. The question is whether it's an ale. In a
technical sense, the top-fermenting yeast and warmer fermentation
temperatures make it one. But you expect certain flavor notes from
a pale ale, and they aren't the notes you get from lager hops.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? To a purist it will, and should. There are
qualities of a pale ale the Michelob simply doesn't have, and yet
it's a good beer. Brewing is as much art as science. The best craft
brewers _ John Maier of Rogue, for example _ break stylistic molds.
The irony is that Anheuser-Busch _ intentionally or not _ would
have done so.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees when you set out to do things
differently, and New Amsterdam India Pale Ale is an unfortunate
example. This might be the prettiest bottle on the shelves, wrapped
in blue the color of lapis lazuli. You think it's the bottle that's
blue until you examine it more closely and see that, oh, it's just
paper wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   It's what's inside that counts, of course, and the New Amsterdam
IPA's label promises a beer brewed in ``the British style'' while
also specifying the use of Cascade and Centennial hops. Excuse me?
Nothing says you can't do it, and there is no exact definition for
``the British style.'' But most brewers would tell you it implies
less hoppiness than an American IPA, a different malt/hop profile
and sometimes a lower alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   What's inside that pretty blue wrapping is not recognizably
British in style, and not, in truth, an India Pale Ale. It has
neither the body nor the hoppiness of an IPA, American or British.
The samples I had were slightly oxidized, so it was hard to judge
it fairly. But the Cascades and Centennials gave it some of the hop
character you would expect from an American pale ale, the very
style that Anheuser-Busch adapted by using German hops. Neither
beer is quite what it says it is, but one has better reason to be
satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The painter Pieter Bruegel depicted medieval scenes of brawling
peasants and rustic gastronomy. He is a national hero in Belgium,
his work, as Michael Jackson writes, ``a puzzling marriage of
simplicity and sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   It was for the painter that Bruegel Amber Ale was named, a
Belgian ale that is smooth on the palate, medium-bodied, with a
firm, foamy crown and a slight sweetness. Belgian beers are the
most individualistic in the world, and not everyone takes to them
at first sip. They are not particularly hoppy, especially when
compared with American pale ales. But the yeasts are different, and
those yeasts are at the heart of Belgian brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Bruegel Amber Ale is a delightful introduction to a culinary
culture in which gourmet meals are prepared with beer and consumed
with beer. In the rolling countryside that Bruegel traveled and
sketched for his paintings, beer goes into marinades, stews, sauces
and soups. Trappist monks make beer in monasteries, using recipes
that are centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans will never taste these beers, and Georgia's
antiquated beer laws _ limiting alcohol content to 6 percent by
volume _ prohibit them. Yet these are beers that cost as much as a
bottle of good wine.
</P>
<P>
   Bruegel Amber Ale is not a Chimay or an Orval, beers still made
in abbeys, but it is as mainstream as a Belgian beer gets.
Bruegel's peasants, a leg of roast fowl in one hand and a crock
pitcher in another, could never have afforded a Chimay or an Orval.
But they drank plenty of ales like this one. Those ales couldn't
have been as well-made, and they didn't come in a squat, 11.2-ounce
bottle.

<P>
   Whether you are looking to impress dinner guests or need a quick
weeknight meal, stuffed vegetables will fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure and wash the vegetables and gently hollow them out.
Then, it's good to salt and oil them. Nonstick sprays, especially
some of the new flavored varieties, work very well.
</P>
<P>
   You can stuff vegetables with any number of fillings, including
macaroni and cheese, leftover chili or stew, creamed chicken, tuna
noodle casserole, turkey stuffing, sauteed vegetables or rice
salads. Top off with a little grated mozzarella or Parmesan, and
it's hard to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, we offer these ideas, but consider any of your
favorite stuffings. Chances are they'll look great in a pretty
pepper cup.

   This recipe comes from a new cookbook, ``Cooking Time Is Family
Time'' by Lynn Fredericks (William Morrow, $25). She suggests that
if you have children, get them to help with hollowing out the
vegetables, picking the herbs and stuffing. The combination of
rice, lamb and pine nuts is a nice Mediterranean touch in a classic
meat-stuffed pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4 large red or green bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   with flat bottoms
</P>
<P>
   6 large tomatoes, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   3 fresh rosemary sprigs
</P>
<P>
   3 fresh cilantro sprigs
</P>
<P>
   3 fresh parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup long-grain white rice, uncooked
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean ground beef or lamb
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Slice 1/2 inch off the top of 4 of the tomatoes and all of the
peppers. Hollow the tomatoes with a melon baller or tablespoon and
reserve the fleshy insides and seeds in a bowl. To hollow the
peppers, begin scooping out the seeds and membranes in a similar
fashion, discarding the seeds. Set aside the tomatoes, peppers and
their tops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, put the water in a small pot and bring to a boil.
Chop rosemary, cilantro and parsley leaves and set aside. Dice the
onion and chop garlic and set aside. Pour rice into boiling water,
stir, reduce heat to low, cover and cook until all the water is
absorbed, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Chop remaining 2 tomatoes. Heat a medium skillet over low heat.
Add chopped tomatoes, reserved tomato seeds and membranes. Add
onion and garlic and cook, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add ground
beef and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine cooked rice, cooked meat
mixture, pine nuts and chopped herbs. Mix with hands. If the
mixture seems a little dry, add a bit of water or tomato juice.
Spoon stuffing into hollowed tomatoes and peppers; place reserved
tops on as lids. Place oil and vegetables in a 11-by-9-by-2-inch
baking dish. Bake about 30 minutes. Transfer to individual serving
plates and serve immediately.

   This recipe takes advantage of many convenience items _ canned
green chiles and pimentos, herbed stuffing mix and shredded cheese
_ making it a quick, delicious way to take care of an overabundance
of summer squash.
</P>
<P>
   4 medium zucchini (about 2 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped (about 1/2 cup)

<P>
   1 jar (2 ounces) diced pimentos, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups herb-seasoned stuffing mix (dry)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup shredded mozzarella or Monterey Jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a saucepan, heat 2 inches water
(salted if desired) to boiling. Add zucchini. Return to a boil,
then reduce heat. Cover and simmer just until tender, 8 to 10
minutes; drain. Cool slightly; cut each zucchini lengthwise in
half. Scrape the pulp out of the middle of the zucchini halves,
chop coarsely and set aside. Place zucchini shells, cut side up, in
a 13-by-9-by-2-inch baking dish. Melt the margarine or butter in a
10-inch skillet over medium heat; add onion and cook until tender,
stirring occasionally. Stir in chopped pulp, chiles, pimentos and
stuffing mix. Divide stuffing mixture among zucchini halves.
Sprinkle with cheese. Bake uncovered until hot, 30 to 35 minutes. _

   Eggplants are versatile containers. The more oblong ones can be
cut lengthwise to make boats. The rounder, shorter ones make better
cups. Simply cut off the top quarter. The more you cook the
eggplant, the more it will lose its shape and color, so if
presentation is important, cut about 10 minutes off the final
baking time in this recipe. It will look pretty, but the shell
won't be as tasty.

<P>
   6 small yellow bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound imported tubetti or small pasta shells
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus additional for
oiling baking dish and drizzling on peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 pound tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped

<P>
   Cut the tops off the peppers and remove the cores, seeds and
membranes. Reserve the tops. Cook the tubetti in abundant salted
boiling water until cooked about halfway, or very al dente. Drain
well and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place 3 tablespoons of
oil, tomatoes and garlic in a medium saute pan and cook over high
heat for 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. Let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Toss the cooked pasta in tomato
sauce and add the mint, parsley, 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano
cheese and salt and pepper to taste. Lightly oil a baking dish just
large enough to contain the peppers without crowding them. Lightly
moisten the peppers inside and out with oil and arrange in the
baking dish. Salt the interiors of the peppers. Spoon the
tomato-pasta mixture into the pepper cases. Drizzle peppers with
olive oil and sprinkle with extra grated cheese. Place the reserved
tops on the peppers if desired. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the
peppers are just tender. Serve hot or at room temperature. _ From:

 &HT;    Mom knew best: Pretty, easy-to-fix filled veggies
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Another one of the universal proverbs of mothers is true.
Vegetables are the perfect food.
</P>
<P>
   I'm reminded of this each year about this time, when tomatoes
stand rank and file on my windowsills and squash are scattered
across the kitchen countertops with eggplants and peppers.
</P>
<P>
   What makes all these vegetables perfect is that they come
complete with cooking vessels _ delectable shells just waiting to
cradle stuffings of rice and ground meat, herbed bread crumbs and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The stuffings stay moist in the vegetables, while the flesh
takes on roasted depth. And oh, what a presentation they make. Even
the most resistant will find a stuffed vegetable hard to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really mom-style cooking, especially green peppers
stuffed with ground beef and baked in a red sauce,'' said Heath
Miles, chef of La Tavola, a new Italian restaurant in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Because he wants to take advantage of the seasonal bounty, Miles
is serving small tomatoes stuffed with sauteed eggplant, zucchini
and yellow squash, along with some garlic and red pepper chile
flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Miles said the tomatoes can be served with the skin on, but
quickly blanching and peeling them makes them even better. He
stuffs them with the mixture, tops with a bit of Parmesan cheese,
and then pops them in a hot oven for just a couple of minutes to
warm through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started serving them, people were afraid to eat
them because they were so beautiful,'' said Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed vegetables can also fit in with busy lifestyles. Often
you can pre-bake or blanch the vegetables, make the stuffings, and
then store each separately in the refrigerator for two or three
days. Assemble and bake at will. Or some can be completely
prepared, stored in the freezer, then reheated.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you have your favorites. Inside we offer some new
ideas, like tomatoes stuffed with mini meatloaves or a cooler,
lighter rice and lima bean melange.
</P>
<P>
   For pepper lovers, we offer a stuffing of ground lamb, pine nuts
and rice to give an Egyptian twist. Another idea is to stuff pepper
cups with tomatoey pasta shells and cheese and bake until the
peppers are slightly soft, the pasta shells slightly crunchy.
</P>
<P>
   Inside and out, stuffed vegetables prove Mother really does know
best.
</P>

 &HT;    DUBLIN'S URBAN COWBOYS FIGHTING TO KEEP THEIR HORSES, WAY OF
LIFE
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ On a patch of green beside the dreary gray
Ballymun towers here, horse and rider leap effortlessly over an
obstacle fashioned from a discarded plank resting on two stacks of
old tires.
</P>
<P>
   Cairin McElligott, 15, rides Jasmine bareback with little effort
and much grace. He tugs the reins to turn Jasmine for another
attempt and taps her flanks with the sides of his sneakers. Again,
horse and rider are flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a large van parked on the road by the narrow grassy
strip enjoys a steady flow of people through its side door. It's a
mobile methadone clinic making a stop to serve the heroine addicts
among the vast government housing complex's 20,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people emerging from the van stop to take in the
free display of equestrian skills.
</P>
<P>
   It is a show whose days may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the poor people of Ballymun and other government
housing complexes around Dublin have had their horses. But growing
concern about the welfare of Dublin's urban horses has placed the
Ballymun riders on the road to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of owning a horse and keeping it in a play yard, a
football pitch or in the back garden are over,'' said Maurice
Byrne, the chief inspector for the Dublin Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ``There's no place for it in this
day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vicky McElligott, Cairin's mother, is vowing to fight to
keep the horses at Ballymun.
</P>
<P>
   McElligott admits that this bleak, litter-strewn place is less
than an ideal home for the horses, but she is equally aware of the
ugly realities represented by the methadone van.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses are a way a boy can raise his expectations,'' says
McElligott, the mother of nine. ``Maybe the horses don't keep them
from the selling or using of drugs, but they do give them a focus:
Taking care of an animal as big as a horse is a responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries that horse protection laws passed in recent years on
the national and local level soon will bring an end to ownership by
poor and working-class people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be just for the rich,'' she says.
``Multi-million pounds are spent on those horses. The manure from
those horses is worth more than our horses.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which date to 1996, require horse owners to license
their animals. They make it illegal for anyone under 16 to own a
horse, and authorities can impound horses not kept in stables.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that animal control officers will carry off their horses
at night, Ballymun residents keep vigilant watch over the horses
from the high-rise windows. About 120 horses live in and around
Ballymun, less than half the population of five years ago. Across
Dublin, there may be 3,000 urban horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're illegal, there's no denying that,'' McElligott says,
glancing at the half-dozen horses tethered to stakes in the green
patch. More horses graze on a nearby soccer field, and even more
are kept in a stand of trees near the towers.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the horses at Ballymun varies from well-fed
and groomed _ generally those kept at the stable _ to rangy and
unkempt. Some are shoeless.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The urban horses have received a good deal of attention in the
local and national media and have been portrayed _ some say
romanticized _ in the films ``The Commitments'' and ``Into the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unforgettable scenes in the latter featured a
horse, a small boy and, an erratic elevator servicing one of
Ballymun's towers. ``You're not bringing that in here,'' complains
one of the film's main characters to the boy standing with his
horse. ``The stairs would kill him,'' the boy replies indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   To McElligott, this struggle is more than a battle over the
right to ownership. She depicts it as a battle over culture and her
right to retain her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Horses long have had a special place in the Irish psyche, so it
is not surprising that people held on to them when they began
taking up residence in places such as Ballymun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you. Look at the tower blocks,'' she says. ``Irish
people were never meant to live in the sky. That's half the problem
here.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of staving off official action, the Ballymun residents
have organized the Ballymun Horse Owners Club. Members must
contribute a few pounds and attend meetings, and they board their
horses in a hastily converted pub that lay abandoned for years. The
club has shows and races in which it competes with clubs from other
housing projects. The races often generate kitties of more than
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the former pub, horses poke their heads out through holes
knocked through the cinderblock walls. A cat with a mouse in its
mouth hunts for privacy as chickens and ducks squabble in a corner.
A half-dozen kids between 11 and 15 clean the stall floors, which
are covered with straw and sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Barnes, 36, instructs 11-year-old Brian Boyle on the finer
points of cleaning mud from a shoed hoof. ``Mind the quick,''
Barnes says. ``That's it. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who loves to race his horses, says he's taught himself
how to care for the animals. ``The horse will teach you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, the DSPCA chief inspector, has no doubt that many people
in Ballymun love their horses and do their best for them. However,
he believes the horses in the stable are not representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are horses that are left tethered on a rope in the
football pitch in the open, even in winter,'' he says. ``The boys
ride them bareback, not realizing that this is very painful to the
horse, with the hard seams in their jeans. They will get up in the
morning and ride their horses have dinner and go and ride them
again like the hammers of hell. And then at night others will ride
them too. The horses are exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   McElligott acknowledges that there are problems, but she insists
that people who treat their horses well should not be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she knows that the situation as it is, cannot last.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could come in today and close us down and take the horses
away,'' she says, watching her son and his horse make one more
jump. ``They want to annihilate this way of life.''

 &HT;    100 DAYS AND COUNTING: Vieques bombing protesters await Clinton
panel decision

<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ The protest camp perches on a rocky
hilltop next to the bullet-riddled hulk of an old tank. A Puerto
Rican flag snaps in the stiff August breeze, while far below waves
dapple the azure Caribbean in a panorama that tourists would gladly
pay to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no tourists on this remote tip of Vieques, a small
island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast. The protestors here are
illegally occupying a U.S. Navy bombing range, determined to end
the decades of military activity they say has brought environmental
destruction and hampered economic development on their 20-mile-long
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because this is a form of oppression,'' said Pedro
Zenon, 21, a student who has camped on the remote target zone for
more than 100 days. ``We are tired of the Navy bossing us around.
It's time for all of our island to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides await the recommendation of a Clinton-appointed panel
probing use of the bombing range, due Tuesday(Aug. 31).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle over the Navy's 60-year presence on
Vieques, which the Navy considers essential for combat training,
has become a sore spot in the often-touchy field of U.S.-Puerto
Rico relations. In a rare show of unity, the island's normally
fractious political parties _ who argue endlessly over the
perennial question of statehood _ have joined hands in a call for
the Navy to leave Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy lives by an outdated philosophy,'' said Ruben
Berrios, a member of the Puerto Rican Senate and head of the
Independence Party, who also has logged more than 100 days in the
protest camp. ``They are still living in the image of (Gen.
Douglas) MacArthur the conqueror walking through the waves. That no
longer applies. We are fighting for the right to command our own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has dominated newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico all
summer, ever since a native-born security guard was killed by a
wayward bomb on Vieques in April. Protests in the capital of San
Juan have swelled with thousands of marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The tumult has crossed the Atlantic, too, stirring awareness in
the vibrant Puerto Rican communities in Florida, New York and New
Jersey. A large protest is planned in New York City next month, and
civil rights icon Jesse Jackson has joined the cause, recently
visiting Vieques to pledge support.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has even appeared on the radar screen of U.S.
presidential candidates, with former senator and Democratic hopeful
Bill Bradley calling the Navy's activities ``unacceptable'' during
a recent visit to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner, also has
weighed in on the issue. He has appealed to President Bill Clinton
to look for alternatives that might end the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ perhaps mindful of the large Puerto Rican vote in New
York, where his wife is a likely U.S. Senate candidate _ has
already appointed a commission to investigate. The panel listened
to several days of angry testimony in visits to Puerto Rico and
Vieques, and is scheduled to issue recommendations by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, meanwhile, has responded to the growing protests by
insisting the bombing range on Vieques is unique and irreplaceable,
the only spot in the Atlantic basin where it can conduct full-scale
war games complete with submarines, aircraft carriers, battleships,
landing craft and air power. Even U.S. NATO allies use the practice
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just bombing for the sake of bombing,'' said Navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Garcia. ``We're asking our young men and
women to do very risky jobs, and we need to train them like they
are going to actually fight. Vieques is unique because it's the
only place in the U.S. that we can bring all of the elements of an
integrated battle group together for that training.''
</P>
<P>
   All war-making practice on the island has been suspended since
the security guard was killed, although the Navy is clearly eager
to resume its exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But the protestors are just as adamant. Puerto Rico's Attorney
General, Jose Fuentes Agostini, has hired the Atlanta law firm of
King and Spalding to prepare a lawsuit to block any efforts to
resume the bombing. The suit would be filed should the Clinton
commission recommend re-opening the Vieques range.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico was a much different place in the early 1940s when
the Navy opened its bombing range. After coming under U.S. control
in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the island remained
poverty-stricken for decades, with little political clout in the
U.S., even though its residents were considered American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the crisis-wracked early days of World War II, there was
little protest when the Navy condemned 22,000 of Vieques' 33,000
acres, moving small farmers and sugar cane workers off their land
to the island's center.
</P>
<P>
   But there was resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my grandfather's land and house and paid him $30,''
said Rabames Trinidad, 46, a lifelong resident. ``They came through
with front-end loaders and took it all, scooping up his house and
dumping it on a little cleared spot where he was supposed to move.
He was never the same after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents soon grew accustomed to the sound of Navy planes
droning overhead, followed by the whump of exploding ordnance.
Houses shook and dust from the bombing sometimes filled the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say many residents left, looking for work on Puerto Rico
or in the nearby Virgin Islands. But there were new Navy jobs for
locals as security guards, and there were new island residents _
lots of sailors _ who patronized local bars and restaurants,
creating new economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With these opportunities, however, also came new tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say the sailors sometimes ran wild on leave, carousing,
engaging in drunken brawls, even molesting island women. Although
the Navy long ago moved all but 25 of its personnel off the island,
the resentments still simmer. Even today, signs are posted on the
outskirts of the village of Esperanza, warning the military that
the area is off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the bombing,'' said Trinidad, recalling the
history of tension. ``It's all of this in the past, which we cannot
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Vieques isn't the U.S. military's only possession in Puerto
Rico: the island is also home to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station; the
Army's Fort Buchanan; a Naval security group; a Coast Guard air
station; and two Puerto Rican National Guard facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rest of Puerto Rico has achieved a modest
prosperity in the past three decades, Vieques and its 9,300
residents are struggling to evolve into something more than a
military target range. While their 3.8 million neighbors on the
main island of Puerto Rico have attracted manufacturing firms and
built a bustling tourism industry, Vieques resembles the Caribbean
of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Small farms dot the island's central uplands, livestock
occasionally wandering into the narrow, winding roads. Fisherman
venture out daily from Esperanza, riding the choppy waves in
brightly-colored boats to dive or line-fish for grouper, snapper
and dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Per-capita income is only $3,000 a year, less than half the
figure for the rest of Puerto Rico, and unemployment is nearly 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small but growing tourism industry, with several
guesthouses catering to tourists looking for an alternative to San
Juan's dizzy casinos and discos. A small General Electric plant
employs a few dozen workers, while a government-sponsored resort is
rising on the island's west side.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders want more, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that beach,'' said Jorge Adams, 44, a fisherman and
lifeguard, who recently chauffeured a visitor by boat around part
of the island. ``What big hotel chain wouldn't like to build there?
How many jobs would we have from that? But who wants to come here
and listen to bombs exploding?''
</P>
<P>
   But just getting the Navy to shut down the bombing range and
leave Vieques isn't the islanders' only concern. They also want the
sailors to clean up the environmental damage caused by the bombing
and to help jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental damage is clear _ years of bombing have
devastated the 900-acre target area. Shrapnel, debris, shell
casings and bomb parts litter the landscape, along with the rusty
remains of vehicles used as targets. There are likely unexploded
bombs, along with what the Navy admits is a small number of
armor-piercing bullets tipped with spent uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen claim the bombing has devastated their livelihood,
damaging the coral reefs that harbor fish and help spawn the marine
food-chain.
</P>
<P>
   There is an even more troubling claim.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques is saddled with Puerto Rico's highest rate of cancer _
27 percent greater than any other Puerto Rican town, according to
government statistics. Residents blame the bombing, and want
reparations for the illnesses. The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry is looking into the allegations, although its
report may take many months to compile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vieques' residents wait patiently, enjoying the
temporary bombing halt, hoping it soon will be made permanent. If
the Navy refuses to leave, they vow the protest camps on the
bombing range _ already in place for more than three months _ will
grow. Any attempts to remove the protesters by force will only
bring more Navy opponents, they promise, along with a new round of
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has the last word,'' said fisherman Jose Anibal
Guerra, 54. ``I think he is going to tell them they have to go. If
he lets them stay, there will be more protests and fights. The Navy
has to leave Vieques. They have become our enemy.''

   To McElligott, this struggle is more than a battle over the
right to ownership. She depicts it as a battle over culture and her
right to retain her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Horses long have had a special place in the Irish psyche, so it
is not surprising that people held on to them when they began
taking up residence in places such as Ballymun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you. Look at the tower blocks,'' she says. ``Irish
people were never meant to live in the sky. That's half the problem
here.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In hopes of staving off official action, the Ballymun residents
have organized the Ballymun Horse Owners Club. Members must
contribute a few pounds and attend meetings, and they board their
horses in a hastily converted pub that lay abandoned for years. The
club has shows and races in which it competes with clubs from other
housing projects. The races often generate kitties of more than
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the former pub, horses poke their heads out through holes
knocked through the cinderblock walls. A cat with a mouse in its
mouth hunts for privacy as chickens and ducks squabble in a corner.
A half-dozen kids between 11 and 15 clean the stall floors, which
are covered with straw and sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Barnes, 36, instructs 11-year-old Brian Boyle on the finer
points of cleaning mud from a shoed hoof. ``Mind the quick,''
Barnes says. ``That's it. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who loves to race his horses, says he's taught himself
how to care for the animals. ``The horse will teach you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, the DSPCA chief inspector, has no doubt that many people
in Ballymun love their horses and do their best for them. However,
he believes the horses in the stable are not representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are horses that are left tethered on a rope in the
football pitch in the open, even in winter,'' he says. ``The boys
ride them bareback, not realizing that this is very painful to the
horse, with the hard seams in their jeans. They will get up in the
morning and ride their horses have dinner and go and ride them
again like the hammers of hell. And then at night others will ride
them too. The horses are exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   McElligott acknowledges that there are problems, but she insists
that people who treat their horses well should not be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she knows that the situation as it is, cannot last.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could come in today and close us down and take the horses
away,'' she says, watching her son and his horse make one more
jump. ``They want to annihilate this way of life.''

<P>
   LAKEVILLE, Mass. _ A nursing home that sits empty and ramshackle
in farm country about 50 miles south of Boston is slated to open
next summer as the nation's first residential home for people who
have left or escaped religious mind-control groups.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Institute of Religious Research, which says it
helps former cult members put their lives back together, is
remodeling the 2 1/2-acre property it bought here last month as a
treatment center for up to 25 people, including families.
</P>
<P>
   Each resident will be given three months to be reintroducted to
their families, jobs, homes, even to their own names, according to
the institute's director, the Rev. Robert Pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients may come from such high-profile communal groups as
Heaven's Gate and the Branch Davidians. But most will have left
largely unknown New Age and religious groups that allow members to
live on their own but use coercive means to make them give the
group everything, including wages and every free moment.
</P>
<P>
   These ``walkaways,'' as therapists, ministers, and cult
specialists call them, often have no money, no job, no friends
outside their religious group, and frayed family ties. In addition,
they often have a deep fear of leaving groups that work hard at
promoting dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to call and tell them why I left. For a while, I
thought I had made a mistake'' by leaving, said Jeffrey F. Brown,
50, who spent most of the past five years with the Twelve Tribes on
their 11-acre property in East Aurora, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he joined the group out of a a yearning to study the
Bible every day. He was initially captivated by the group's
peaceful lifestyle and loving care of members' children, he said.
He worked long hours in construction and then worked in the group's
bakery. Though he was fed and clothed, Brown was not paid for his
work.
</P>
<P>
   An international group with 28 branches worldwide, the Twelve
Tribes believe they are direct descendants of the biblical
Israelites.
</P>
<P>
   Brown _ who was renamed Zacharyah Cham by the group's elders _
said he finally decided to leave last May 5 after he was forbidden
from taking anything but homeopathic medicine for his worsening
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Reichmann, 26, a divinity school student in St. Paul,
Minn., left a Twelve Tribes communal farm in Bellows Falls, Vt.,
two years ago, after four cult-awareness specialists, including
Pardon, met with her at her parents' request during a visit to her
family's Indiana home.
</P>
<P>
   Reichmann said she joined the Twelve Tribes after meeting
members at a Grateful Dead concert in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was willing to join them because I wanted to please God, and
I wanted to live out the Bible. I believed they knew how to do
that,'' said Reichmann, who taught the sect's children. ``But I
realized that while I was with the tribe, I could not see things
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300,000 Americans like Brown and Reichmann walk
away from 5,000 mind-control groups or communes each year in the
United States, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving such groups often means having to rebuild lives and deal
with guilt, fear, and regret, say former cult members.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists who work with former cult members say it can take up
to four years to overcome the effects of being in an abusive group.
Therapists liken the work they do to counseling substance abusers.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the large numbers believed to be affected,
specialists say, there are only two short-term treatment centers:
Wellspring, run by a cult awareness educator in Ohio, and the
Odenwald Residence in Leibenstadt, Germany. Both offer two-week
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lakeville officials are not at all sure how to
respond to the center planned for Crooked Lane. They have met once
with Pardon and say they have more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know know if this is something I am for or
against,'' said Selectman Chawner Hurd. ``Let me put it this way:
This is a nice, quiet neighborhood in a nice, quiet town. We don't
want anything that will cause furor or uproar. But we are not sure
what our powers are.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said he has asked the town attorney whether the center
requires a local or state license, whether children can be allowed
to live there, and, if they can, whether those children have the
right to attend Lakeville public schools, even though their
families would not pay property taxes here.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon said he was not aware of any licensing problems, but he
stressed that he wants to work with the town because the services
the home would provide are badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving these groups is not like leaving the Kiwanis Club,''
he said. ``These people are leaving God's groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Barba, the institute's associate director, said: ``You
lose your identity. They name you, and every aspect of your life is
regulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon and Barba say that one of their biggest hopes is that the
new residential center will help dispel myths about cults and the
people who join them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, studies have shown that people who join cults are
no more likely to be mentally ill or depressed than anyone else.
And specialists say that, for the most part, people do not
knowingly join cults, but join what they consider to be a group
appealing to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't come out against beliefs, but we look at abusive
practices,'' said Julia Bronder, executive director of a foundation
in Connecticut that helps former cult members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The halfway house will give people a safe place to work out
everything that is conflicting them,'' Bronder said.

'99 PATRIOTS DRAFTEES LOOKING GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Skeptics would say the Patriots wouldn't have
to go far to beat the rookie classes of the previous two years. And
that is partly true.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Canty, their top pick three years ago out of Kansas State,
was a bust they acknowledged by letting him go in the offseason.
Robert Edwards, No. 1 in 1998, was the real thing until going down
in a flag football game last winter in Hawaii. Offensive linemen
Damon Denson and Ed Ellis haven't earned starting jobs in their
third year. But Tony Simmons, Rod Rutledge, Chris Floyd, Chris
Carter, Brandon Mitchell, and Tebucky Jones are either starters or
pushing for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   If the drafts of '97 and '98 deserved a grade of C-minus, as
many gurus have insisted in national publications, then the
Patriots have improved dramatically with their '99 picks. It
appears that their first three picks _ Damien Woody, Andy
Katzenmoyer, and Kevin Faulk _ will open the season as starters.
Except for Woody being benched at the start of the second
exhibition game as a disciplinary measure for missing a workout,
the rookies have been well-behaved and hard-working.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first time since 1991 that the Patriots have
started three rookies. In '91, the rookies were running back
Leonard Russell, tackle Pat Harlow, and safety Harry Colon. The
Patriots hope Faulk's career lasts longer than Russell's did, that
Woody can have as long a career as Harlow, and that Katzenmoyer
will make more of an impact than Colon, who was an eighth-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the top three, the Patriots have a pretty good free
safety in Tony George, an aggressive safety/corner in Marcus
Washington, an oversized offensive lineman in Derrick Fletcher (who
is far ahead of Ellis), and two seventh-round picks in Michael
Bishop and Sean Morey who have electrified Patriots fans in the
first two exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   As camp breaks at Bryant College, these rookies haven't left the
Patriots with as many questions about their ability as the previous
two draft classes did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all young kids, we won't be able to fully assess them
until they start playing in regular-season games,'' said vice
president of player personnel Bobby Grier, who has taken heat for
his past two drafts. ``They've done very well and we think they'll
be good players, but let's wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier is probably hesitant about trumpeting the rookies;
defending Canty as often as he did came back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are indications that Grier is pleased with his
work so far. Early in camp, Grier was trying hard to find a veteran
running back, but he said Tuesday, ``I never had a concern about
our running back. I think the little guy (Faulk) is a good player.
I think he can do some things for us. He's been a productive player
for a long time and I haven't seen anything to think that won't
continue. The one thing we're looking for is for someone like
Harold Shaw, if he comes around, to be able to put in there so we
can utilize Kevin on special teams. If that can happen, that would
be exciting for us because this kid can do some things for us in
that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier, a former running back and running backs coach, doesn't
completely buy Chad Eaton's description of Faulk as a Jerome Bettis
type since about 60 pounds separate the two, but he did say, ``He's
a strong runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer struggled in his first game but came on in the
second and now needs to show consistency and begin to make big
plays in the middle. The Patriots' ability to stop the run depends
largely on Katzenmoyer's play, particularly if Henry Thomas
struggles with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Andy is going to work out fine there,'' said Grier.
``We'd like to find another veteran linebacker to plug in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Saturday's game vs. Tampa is huge for all three
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to build up game after game,'' said Carroll.
``Andy made a remarkable jump from the first week to the next and
I'd be really happy to see him play as well as he did last week.
Kevin needs to get the ball again. We need to get him at least
another dozen carries to see how he goes. We'd like to give him
more space because we didn't get him loose last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk gained only 17 yards in 11 carries against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   What would concern Carroll is whether they can maintain the
intensity they are showing now. Carroll likened the regular season
to playing in bowl games, and he expects them to be up for that.
</P>
<P>
   As for George, he hasn't been able to unseat Chris Carter, but
he feels the best is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I have to make my mark on special teams and do
something when I get into the game,'' said George. ``I guarantee
that when someone comes my way he's going to get hit. That's what I
bring to the table here. I'm going to hit people and be aggressive.
I'm content right now to back up, but I'm not going to be content
to do that for very long. I have to show them that I can play
full-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop will likely not play as much against Tampa Bay as he did
in the first two games because Drew Bledsoe is scheduled to play a
half. But Bishop is expected to get significant time in the final
exhibition game against Carolina when Carroll will want to rest the
regulars and hold an open competition for the few remaining depth
spots on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get out there against the 2's or the 1's just to
show I can handle that,'' said Bishop. ``It's been fun so far. I
just want to get better and improve every time. I'm trying to do
what I've always done and so far the coaching staff has allowed me
to be what I am. I want to be a quarterback, but if they want me to
try something else, I'll do that too.''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of the salary cap, when teams can get decimated in
their depth spots because they can't afford the middle-range-salary
players, it's imperative to fill those voids with draft picks. The
Patriots tried to do that after their two Super Bowl appearances
and there was a dropoff in record. It's a dropoff that cannot occur
again. And it appears this class may offer some salvation.

JACKSON AIDE BALANCES INSPIRATION, LEGWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wearing leggings, sneakers, and an old Delta Sigma
Theta T-shirt, Marie Nelson was standing before Undersecretary
Thomas R. Pickering in his State Department office while her boss,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, argued for NATO clearance to enter Belgrade
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had scooped her up for the meeting as she was heading
for the gym. Nelson, a relatively new staffer on Jackson's foreign
policy team, was unable to persuade him to let her make a quick
change of clothes. ``When it's time to play ball, you got to be
ready to play ball,'' Jackson told her. ``It doesn't matter what
you have on.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the challenges of working for Jackson, a US special
envoy for Africa and, by the sheer force of his personality, one of
the most unpredictable diplomats the foreign policy world has seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half since Nelson _ a master's degree from
Harvard in hand _ went to work for Jackson, she's discovered that
for all her acumen in international security policy and creating
computer models, improvisation turns out to be her most valued
asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the Kennedy school and spent two years torturing
myself trying to learn every quantitative thing you can possibly
imagine,'' she said. ``I came here and what I spent a lot of time
doing is organizing him and getting him places and making sure that
he has the information he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson's diplomatic missions can seem like a one-man
performance, Nelson is a key behind-the-scenes person ``who
balances and manages all of his different interests in foreign
policy,'' said Jendayi E. Frazer, who taught Nelson at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's longstanding stature as a diplomat and human-rights
activist has been burnished recently, especially after his success
negotiating the release of three American soldiers held captive in
Belgrade _ a mission that Nelson helped prepare and conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Since she graduated last year from the Kennedy School, Nelson,
27, has supported Jackson's foreign policy work from a tiny office
at Rainbow/PUSH in tony Georgetown. She blends her skills as a
former journalist and a student of international politics with an
in-depth knowledge of Africa _ the continent of her birth _ to aid
the preacher in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we're traveling, he introduced me as the
transcontinental Negro,'' laughed Nelson, whose mother is from
Liberia and father from Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is international in her bloodstream,'' Jackson said in a
telephone interview from Chicago. ``She has great instincts and
feel for global work and the cultural flow of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson writes Jackson's briefing papers and keeps him abreast of
international crises in other far-flung corners of the world as
well as Africa. A former reporter for Africa News Service, an
on-line news source about the continent, she helps write his
speeches, does the logistical work for his trips, and helps lay out
the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frazer, who is an assistant professor of public policy at the
Kennedy School, said Nelson's most distinguishing qualities are her
``sharp mind'' and ``her ability to quickly analyze situations and
know what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is extremely grounded,'' Frazer said, ``and therefore able
to work with a range of people, whether heads of states or families
having trouble with immigration'' who contact Rainbow/PUSH.
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson's mission to Belgrade, Nelson arranged the chartered
airplane, helped craft the message that Jackson and a delegation of
religious leaders took with them, and guided Yugoslavia's
ambassador to the United Nations to fulfill his promise to ensure
their safety once they got there.
</P>
<P>
   And when Jackson fretted about the risks to the delegation of
entering Yugoslavia, especially considering the fierce opposition
of the US government, Nelson prodded him to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it looked like the trip wouldn't happen because there
were so many obstacles in our path _ our government was against it
. . . and in fact blocked it by discouraging pilots from landing
there _ she made it happen,'' said Jackson. ``She was a huge factor
in that mission,'' he added. ``She was determined it was the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nelson: ``He was definitely a lot more concerned about
exposing the delegation to the type of risk, whereas in my mind, we
had done everything possible to minimize the risk, and it really
came down to making a decision on whether the current risks were
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chalked it up to my youth and a little bit of
recklessness,'' she said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was one of about six people in the 20-member delegation
allowed to join Jackson in visiting with the three American POWs.
She sat furiously taking notes, to the point that her hand ached,
as Jackson and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic talked. She
then clasped hands in their small circle as they all bowed their
heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   As she listened to one of the clerics tell Milosevic, ``The
problem is you,'' her mind flashed back to the tyrant in her own
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson came to the United States from Liberia at the age of 8,
the third youngest of nine children. The family fled to America in
1980 after a bloody coup in which Master Sergeant Samuel Doe and
about 17 others overthrew the government and assassinated president
William Tolbert and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's uncle _ her mother's brother _ was one of the dozen
former officials executed. All the men in her family, with the
exception of her non-Liberian father _ were jailed for varying
lengths of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of almost a year, we . . . lived in a house of 26
people waiting for more of the men to get released from prison, and
then eventually they would get resettled,'' Nelson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just seeing the effect that wars can really have on people,
the long-term effect, has always been with me and has always been
something I was interested in,'' she said. ``You can really
understand what it means to be without a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them refugees,'' she said. ``It is so easy to not
really understand what that means. But not to have really any place
that you call your home is significant, and it always has inspired
me to want to . . . understand what causes these wars and, more
important, what can you do to try to help reconstruct and rebuild a
society that has experienced that kind of devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how she felt seeing Milosevic in person, she said,
``It was very difficult, and I think particularly because of my
background. I had always imagined what it would have been like to
actually meet Samuel Doe face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a part of you that knows this person has been
responsible for very grave injustices, and it's difficult to sit in
an environment with him and listen to him and not only deny that
but act as though it's all just a concoction of your imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has not been concocted is the price of being an
aide to Jackson. It entails long hours and longer days still, and 4
a.m. phone calls from Jackson because he has come up with an idea _
which was how the Kosovo trip came about.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while she was walking down the aisle of a friend's wedding
in Boston, Jackson tried desperately to contact her on her cell
phone. Luckily, she had turned the telephone off, at least for the
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been calling, I've been calling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend, I was walking down the aisle,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson brought Nelson aboard as director of African policy for
Rainbow/PUSH after his trip to Africa with President Clinton in
March of last year. The job, however, entails much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson snapped her up before she could finish work on her
degree at the Kennedy School, though she eventually went on to get
a master's degree in public policy, concentrating on international
security and political and economic development. For three months
before graduation, she commuted between Cambridge and Washington
three days a week before taking the position at Rainbow/PUSH full
time.
</P>
<P>
   She chose Harvard over her other option of Berkeley, she said,
in part to please her mother, Marion Parker Nelson, who lives in
Columbia, Md. ``Growing up, it was always her dream for me to go
Harvard and become a doctor. I figured if I couldn't do both, then
maybe I could do one,'' said Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   For her job she has traveled throughout Europe and Africa, and
been a critical part of Jackson's efforts to bring peace to her
beloved homeland. In May, Jackson helped broker a tentative
cease-fire agreement in West Africa's Sierra Leone, the site of one
of the bloodiest wars this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Working for Jackson, Nelson said, has driven home ``a little bit
more'' the promise and opportunity that exists on the African
continent and the value of the work Jackson does.
</P>
<P>
   The gig, she says, ``has been great.''

<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Bill McCann is trying to decide whom to support
for president. He has met with Vice President Al Gore twice and he
hopes to talk to former senator Bill Bradley, too. Representatives
of both candidates have contacted him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still listening,'' said McCann, the vice chair of the
Dover school board and manager of the Somersworth liquor store. ``I
don't want to sit on the sidelines, but it's a tough call.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann may be one of the last of a breed, reminiscent of that
well-worn joke in which a crusty voter can't make up his mind
because he has only met the candidate three times.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by political scientists at Dartmouth
College, the New Hampshire tradition of one-to-one contact between
voters and presidential candidates is more folk wisdom than fact.
</P>
<P>
   Using data collected during the 1996 presidential primary, the
Dartmouth study said that only 2.5 percent of the voters received
three or more contacts from any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts encompassed meeting the candidate, seeing the
candidate at a rally, receiving a phone call from a campaign, or
receiving a candidate's literature in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire voters get their information from the same place
as everybody else,'' said Dean Spiliotes, one of the co-authors of
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting in their living rooms watching television with news
stories of candidates meeting voters in their own hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1996 data, Spiliotes said voters were not meeting
candidates in order to learn about them. Rather, voters who went to
a rally or met a candidate at a house party were already favorably
inclined to support that person.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the contacts between voters and candidates will increase
in 2000 with the advent of e-mail remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The state's political leaders have long promoted the notion that
New Hampshire is the only state besides Iowa where candidates can
spread their message from one home to another before small crowds
of neighbors in charming hamlets and villages.
</P>
<P>
   But while all candidates say how important this style of
campaigning is, not all of them are practicing it. Texas Governor
George W. Bush, for example, may be the Republican front-runner,
but he has only been to New Hampshire three times this year and
none of his trips included any house parties.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, on the other hand, has been working the state
hard, but she committed a faux pas recently on the heels of her
strong showing in the Iowa straw poll. At the Manchester Rotary
Club, Dole showed up late, spoke briefly, only took three questions
from the audience and then dashed out without shaking hands with
each of the 60 members in attendance in order to talk to a
television reporter from WNDS-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, proponents of the New Hampshire primary would
rather focus on the interaction with voters that does occur. Trying
to prevent other states from encroaching on the state's
first-in-the-nation primary status, Governor Jeanne Shaheen pointed
to the voters' direct contact with politicians and said that style
of campaigning is unavailable in other states, where candidates
must pay millions of dollars in television advertising to circulate
their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``This simply isn't possible in most places,'' Shaheen said at a
news conference in December. ``The opportunity for personal, retail
campaigning is lost in larger states, where campaigns are played
out in television commercials and on airport tarmacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Karen MacNair of Portsmouth may be more typical of voters
these days. Unlike Bill McCann, she has never met with a
presidential candidate, and she has never attended a house party to
listen to a presidential candidate's ideas. In fact, MacNair had
never met a presidential candidate until she tried to go to the
post office on a recent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What she found were the roads blocked off and the area crawling
with Secret Service agents. So MacNair stood in front of the
Portsmouth Brewery and waited to shake hands with Al Gore, who was
walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley Reid, on the other hand, has met four presidential
candidates: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and most
recently, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to places where I knew they were going to be,'' said
Reid, who lives in Dover and works as a temporary office worker.
After meeting the vice president in Portsmouth recently, Reid said
she expects to vote for him. ``I was a little in awe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The voters of New Hampshire have had an impressive track record
in picking winners. Since 1952, only one person has lost the New
Hampshire primary and gone on to be elected president _ Bill
Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The state has long played a role in winnowing the list of
candidates who run for president, and it has also been known for
toppling front-running candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, television footage of candidates sitting and
talking to families at their kitchen table is more photo
opportunity than reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Bradley comes to Dunkin' Donuts in West Lebanon and no
one was there to cover it, was he ever there at all?'' Spiliotes
asked, suggesting that candidates primarily go out to meet voters
in order to get on television, so that other voters see them
interacting with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, the majority of New Hampshire voters
had no contact whatsoever with any presidential campaign between
October of 1995 and Feb. 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent of the voters never received a phone call, a
mailing or a handshake from a candidate. Twenty-nine percent said
they had only one contact with a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the voters here had more contact than voters in the rest
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 20 percent of the New Hampshire voters surveyed met a
candidate or attended a rally. By contrast, 6 percent of the voters
nationwide ever met a candidate or attended a rally.
</P>
<P>
   The authors said that given the state's reputation, they
expected New Hampshire voters to have far greater one-on-one
contact with the candidates.

AUGUSTIN IS DOWN-AND-DIRTY SERIOUS ABOUT MOUNTAIN BIKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DOVER, Vt. _ It's drizzling on a mid-August weekend at the
Mount Snow ski area, and Audrey Augustin is about to get dirty,
muddy, and wet. She doesn't go out of her way to splash through
puddles or run over rocks, but it's a byproduct of what she does _
she races mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin, who lives with her husband, Phil Huffman, in Willston,
Vt., has spent the summer traveling across the country on weekends
to race bikes. She wrapped up the season here last weekend, and is
now on a break until she heads to Sweden next month to compete in
the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin, 32, grew up in Wellesley, Mass. and went to the Winsor
School in Boston. She then went to Bowdoin College in Maine, where
she played field hockey (three-time All-American), lacrosse
(two-time All-American), and graduated with a degree in visual
arts/art history.
</P>
<P>
   But something took her out West, and something else led her to
the world of mountain biking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of did that twenty-something thing where I lived in a
bunch of places,'' Augustin said.
</P>
<P>
   First she went to Berkeley, Calif., and got a job at an
outdoor-sports store. Then she worked for a graphic designer there,
designing ads in brochures and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I decided I wasn't ready to stay inside all day long,''
said Augustin, who took a job as a river-rafting guide.
</P>
<P>
   But after two summers of that, California had lost its novelty,
and Augustin decided to move back to New England.
</P>
<P>
   She got a part-time job in the Bowdoin athletic department and
also worked at a physical therapy clinic. In 1993, it was back to
the Boston area, where she worked for a camping/outdoors company in
Reading, then up to Vermont to work for an outdoor footwear company
that eventually was bought out and relocated to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But Augustin, who was doing graphic design for the company,
stayed in Vermont and was able to work for the company on a
free-lance basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way I could have my own business, and race
professionally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Augustin said that even though her daughter didn't take
the typical high school-college-career route, she never thought
that mountain biking was a temporary phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Audrey, we didn't think it would pass,'' said
Rosalind.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Rolf, drive from Wellesley to watch their
daughter race as often as they can, and she insists that she's not
fazed by seeing her daughter finish a race caked with mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mud part doesn't bother me, but it does seem a little
dangerous at times,'' said Augustin's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin, who bought her first mountain bike in California,
entered a race in Vermont in 1993 at the urging of friends. She
rode in the sport category, for those with the least experience,
and even with the heavy bike and toe clips that are far removed
from the equipment she now uses, Augustin finished third. From that
point on, she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased and thought, maybe I should do more of this,''
she said. ``I had camped out in the parking lot and just had a
blast, it was a great network of folks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got really into it, and that was the beginning,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin soon became a fixture at the Burlington airport as
she'd take her bike box most weekends and fly all over the country
to enter races. When she wasn't on the road, she'd stay around New
England to race and try to win money to fund her traveling. At one
race, she won $50; at another, she won $750.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago she turned pro _ the highest category _ after
sending a letter to the National Off-Road Bicycle Association
(NORBA) documenting her results.
</P>
<P>
   And even though her results were good last year, Augustin's
season ended with professional and personal disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   First, Augustin was told she couldn't be on the pro elite
women's team that would compete in the World Championships in
Quebec. As a consolation, though, USA Cycling told her she could go
along and race on the masters' women team (ages 30-39).
</P>
<P>
   That was to be in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 2, Augustin's plans were placed on hold when her
in-laws were killed in the SwissAir plane crash off Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, forget it, I'm not doing the race,'' Augustin said.
``But after we'd gotten over the shock _ well, we still haven't
gotten over the shock _ Phil told me, `There's no question, you've
got to do the race.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She did, and won it by 4 1/2 minutes. And maybe, in some way,
the tragedy inspired her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much mental stuff going on, it was a really
intense period,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This past winter she was signed by Schwinn, not for its top-line
salaried team, but to be a member of the bike company's regional,
or ``homegrown,'' team.
</P>
<P>
   So Augustin doesn't get paid, but she does get a bike, a jersey,
tires, and lodging when she's on the road. All of which are pretty
good perks to a mountain bike racer.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Augustin is used to doing things on her own. In most
of the cross-country races, no one can help her change a tire _ and
flats are not unusual on the rocky courses that go though woods. So
she takes along a tire iron, a tube, and a pump, or an air
cartridge (``or both if the cartridge doesn't work''). And she
relies on friends or her husband to hand her a new water bottle
filled with water, a sports drink, or soda.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the weather, which can range from a hot day in
Napa, Calif., to last weekend's rain at Mount Snow.
</P>
<P>
   The worst, so far, Augustin said, was at the race in Cranmore,
Alberta, in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out in the pouring rain and it was 40 degrees,''
she said. ``In the middle of the race the temperature dropped 10
degrees and it was snowing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Snow last weekend, Augustin finished 32d in the women's
long cross-country race on Friday, and seventh in the short course
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The course at the base of the ski area, she said, was ``rocky,
rooty, and deceptively hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The season, though, ended on a high note when Augustin got word
that she was picked to go to the Worlds, this time on the elite
woman's team.
</P>
<P>
   The team is led by national champion Alison Dunlap, of Boulder,
Colo., and No. 2-ranked Ruthie Matthes, of Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Girard, the mountain bike coach of US men's and women's
teams, said he chose Augustin, not just because of her results this
past year, but because of her experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows about riding, about how to get ready for the big
race, and all about the pressure,'' he said. ``She won't be
intimidated at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Not by the rocks, not by the mountains, and not by the world
championships.

BRISBY STRUGGLES TO STAY IN ROTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Just four seasons ago, Vincent Brisby was New
England's go-to guy at wide receiver. Nowadays, he's the fourth and
possibly even fifth receiver.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the depth chart is _ surprise! _ Terry Glenn.
Veteran Shawn Jefferson is the other starter. Troy Brown, with
improved speed, can catch the ball well underneath and appears to
be the third wideout. And second-year man Tony Simmons has shown
promise in training camp as a deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   So where exactly does Brisby fit into Ernie Zampese's offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really answer that question,'' said Brisby after the
team's morning workout Tuesday. ``I can't tell you what my role is
right now. But I think before the regular season starts, we're all
going to have some kind of role on this team. But I'm just taking
it one day at a time and just trying to do my best every time I'm
out there. Whatever happens is just going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three seasons, it's been a tossup between Glenn
and Brisby as to who was the most injury-prone Patriot. A slight
edge for that distinction may have to go to the former, though
Brisby has been bothered by hamstring problems throughout his
career, starting just five games in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he missed two games because of the pulled muscle. Two
years later, he missed the first 13 games of the season because of
a hamstring pull suffered in the preseason. Last season, Brisby
played in only six contests thanks to a broken right index finger
and a pulled you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in this age of ``what have you done for me lately?''
Brisby has managed to hang around. He re-signed with the team after
a '96 season in which he did not catch a pass. The Patriots even
restructured his contract this summer, adding an extra year (2001)
and an $875,000 bonus to give themselves more room under the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did try to trade the 6-foot-3-inch, 195-pound
Brisby last season but were only offered a sixth-round pick in
return. Though they could use some help at other positions, it
looks as though the Patriots aren't going to deal the seven-year
veteran, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely want to be here,'' said Brisby. ``I've seen a lot
of things happen in this league. I've seen guys come and go every
year, so I wouldn't be surprised one way or the other. I just take
it year by year, and I just wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Brisby was making things happen for the Patriots.
He arrived in New England the same year as Bledsoe and Brown,
starting 12 games and leading all NFL rookie wide receivers with 45
catches. The next year he helped make league history as one of five
Patriots to catch 50 passes (58), while scoring five touchdowns. In
'95 he racked up a team-best 974 yards on a career-high 66
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   But Brisby's next three seasons would be the opposite of his
first three. His absence during the '96 campaign coincided with the
drafting of Glenn, the arrival of Jefferson from San Diego, and the
emergence of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his role is,'' Jefferson said Tuesday. ``I
don't know what mine is, so I can't tell you what his is. All of us
are good at different things, so I think they're going to put us in
position to use our talent at what's best for that moment. I don't
think he's a forgotten guy. He's a good receiver, and we need him
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said he plans to rotate the five receivers,
though it's difficult to imagine Brisby matching his production of
four years ago. At least in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have never imagined that it would be as difficult as
it has been,'' said Brisby. ``I think I take part of the blame for
not being healthy. So it is a bit frustrating in that sense. But I
think I can make plays. I think I can help the team inside,
outside, or whatever's needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in God and I put my faith in Him, so as long as I
have Him on my side I don't really worry about other things that
happen. I just have to keep faith and do my best.''

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES BETS ITS FUTURE ON A HIGH-END CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ When the big day arrived two weeks ago,
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s headquarters was surprisingly quiet.
Its vast atrium lobby, with high windows to bring in the maximum
quota of California sun, was mostly empty. There were no hordes of
reporters or workers gathering in hopeful celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The day marked the introduction of AMD's newest product, the
Athlon, a processor chip that can out-compute anything made by
archrival Intel Corp. But the quiet rollout belied what will likely
be the most important year in AMD's corporate life, during which
the company's campaign to sell its new chip will likely determine
whether it will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Anixter, AMD's vice president of external affairs,
acknowledges that the stakes really are this high in the company's
duel with Intel. ``We are competing against a very formidable
company,'' Anixter says, ``and they're trying everything they can
to put us out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, AMD's 13,000 employees may not be the only ones
who suffer. The company's aggressive pricing of Intel-compatible
processor chips are a major reason why powerful desktop computers
are now available for $500 or less. The recent surrender by two
other Intel antagonists has left AMD as the Intel's last viable
competitor, the only obstacle preventing it from gaining the kind
of overwhelming market power in processor chips that Microsoft
Corp. has in desktop operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's strategy of providing Intel-like performance at a lower
price has been severely tested, as Intel counters with big price
cuts. And although AMD's K6 line of microprocessors has been
adopted by most of the world's PC makers for their bargain-priced
computers, AMD hasn't fared so well in the offices and data centers
of corporate America. The company has been hurt by manufacturing
breakdowns that have reduced its output of high-end chips. To make
matters worse, renowned chip designer Atiq Raza left his post as
AMD's president last month, forcing CEO Jerry Sanders to step into
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Such events have given AMD a patina of unreliability that has
hampered its sales in the high end of the market. Besides, the K6,
while adequate for most computing tasks, has never quite measured
up to Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium II and III chips.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon is the chip that's supposed to change everything.
Among its lead designers is Dirk Meyer, who also helped engineer
Digital Equipment Corp.'s Alpha processor, still considered the
world's fastest line of processor chips.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer joined AMD's research facility in Austin, Texas to work on
a chip that would be fully compatible with Intel's processors, but
more powerful. He designed the Athlon around the same kind of
high-speed ``system bus'' used by the Alpha. This means that when
an Athlon swaps data with other chips in the computer, it does so
at twice the speed of a Pentium III. But unlike the Alpha, the
Athlon will run any software that will work on an Intel machine.
</P>
<P>
   According to benchmark trials run by independent testers, Athlon
leads the Pentium III in every performance category. The question
is whether merely having a better product will be enough to put AMD
on a firm footing.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of industry experts are deeply skeptical, citing AMD's
famous difficulties in keeping its chip plants running. ``Clearly
the new product they have is impressive,'' says Joseph Osha ,
senior semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The question
is, can they make it? I'm not sure they can.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD makes all its K6 and Athlon chips at a single factory in
Austin, Texas, where production has been plagued with quality
problems. In any chip plant, there often is considerable variation
in the quality of the chips in any given batch. Earlier this year,
AMD found that its production runs were yielding too many low-end
K6-II chips, which could only be sold at prices well below $100.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AMD has been plagued by success. Computer makers,
eager to sell home PCs at prices below $1,000, embraced the K6
chip. In January, for the first time, more PCs sold in retail
stores were powered by AMD processors than by Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fought back with price cuts on Pentium and Celeron
processors, with the result that even as AMD got chip production
back under control, it had to continue to drop its average price
per chip. Intel had over $26 billion in revenues last year, and $6
billion in earnings, making the company one of the most profitable
in the world. Worse yet for AMD, Intel's profits come mainly from
high-end chips, so the company can afford to flood the market with
ultra-cheap chips to pressure its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the market's weaklings, National Semiconductor Corp. and
Integrated Device Technology Inc., both were forced out of the
processor business this spring, selling out to Taiwanese
motherboard maker Via Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   That left AMD as Intel's last viable competitor - if a company
can be viable while bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars. AMD
has lost money in six of the last eight quarters. The only reason
the firm posted an $80 million net profit in the second quarter
this year was because it sold off Vantis, a non-microprocessor
subsidiary for $259 million. Excluding that and a few other
adjustments, AMD lost $162 million last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company's last hope for a turnaround resides in its
single Austin factory, and a second facility in Dresden, Germany
set to start production next year. Not only must AMD get the new
plant up and running; the company is also in the process of
redesigning key aspects of how its chips are made.
</P>
<P>
   AMD will begin to use copper to form the extremely tiny circuits
inside its chips, instead of aluminum. Copper interconnects run
cooler and use less power. In addition, these interconnects,
already at an astonishingly small width of a quarter of a
micron--far thinner than a human hair--will be thinned even
further.
</P>
<P>
   AMD has to embrace these technologies to keep the Athlon a step
ahead of Intel's Pentium III. But they require a major overhaul of
chip production, and AMD-watchers like Merrill Lynch's Osha is
doubtful they can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that's had problems in the past that's
asking the investment community to believe that they're going to
hit back-to-back home runs,'' Osha says. ``It is a huge leap of
faith to imagine that they are going to be able to meet the
manufacturing challenge that they have set for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Linley Gwennap, publisher of Microprocessor Report, a top
industry newsletter, thinks AMD is running out of chances.
``They've got a couple of hundred million in the bank, but they
lost a couple of hundred million last quarter,'' says Gwennap. ``As
far as I know, all of their assets are already leveraged, and
they're pretty well tapped out right now. If this thing doesn't
work out, they're going to be hurting for cash.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD officials say it's all under control. They expect to produce
a million Athlons this year, for use in machines by dozens of
computer companies. So far, a couple of major PC makers -- IBM
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. -- have signed on to make Athlon
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports say that Intel plans to respond by by dropping
prices on its high end processors, to keep computer firms from
switching to Athlon. But AMD doesn't think Intel can play that game
this time. Customers who want the fastest computer will cheerfully
pay a bit more to get it, they argue. And all the price cuts in the
world won't make a Pentium III as fast as an Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is AMD's master plan. By building a chip that's
better than Intel's, it can attack Intel's formerly secure stream
of high-end profits. And retaliatory price cuts will only slash
Intel's income. ``Over the short term,'' says Athlon designer
Meyer, ``what they can do is pretty limited.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory, anyway. And the chipmakers of AMD are betting
the company on it.

DESPITE WEAK DEMAND, FIRMS LINE UP IPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good news is as scarce as hens' teeth in the market for initial
public stock offerings at the moment. So why are so many
Massachusetts companies filing new applications to go public?
</P>
<P>
   Harvardnet Inc. of Boston, a telecommunications company,
postponed its big $124 million IPO last week. It blamed market
conditions, despite the efforts of a heavyweight investment banking
team that included Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, and
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Lionbridge Technologies Inc. of Waltham managed to get its IPO
off the ground last week, but came away with less money than it
expected. The deal raised only $35 million, far less than the $50
million originally anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO market is littered with stories like these for the
moment, tales of deals that were scaled back or taken off the table
entirely. Investors have beefed over the glut of mediocre ``dot
com'' companies rushing to market, but institutional buyers for all
kinds of new public companies seemed to have disappeared. The
weekly list of IPOs scheduled to hit the market, which can run into
the dozens in the best of times, contained just three names
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But many new companies, like thirsty people lining up at an
empty water cooler for a drink, are filing registration documents
necessary for them to launch their own IPOs in the weeks and months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, seven companies have registered this
month for IPOs to raise nearly $600 million. Most of them want to
raise big bucks for emerging technologies tied to the Internet or
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone continues to tee up to go public regardless of the
fact that you've seen significant resistance by institutional
investors,'' said Benjamin Howe, head of technology mergers and
acquisitions at SG Cowen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   What do they see that isn't apparent to the naked eye?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the IPO market's normal seasonal lull is taking
its toll as usual in the final weeks of August. The generally poor
results of stock offerings in early August only emphasized the
seasonal vacation flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a robust backdrop for an IPO in general, much
less an Internet IPO,'' said Gail Bronson, an analyst at IPO
Monitor. ``It's worth postponing (previously registered IPOs) for a
little while, until the market turns up.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that start the IPO process in August won't actually
hit the market until late September or October. Their gamble:
things change, and the market will become much more receptive to
new stocks by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Year in and year out, the cycle often becomes a self-fullfilling
expectation. Stronger stock offerings stay out of the market in
August and pile into the fall calendar. Demand follows the quality
of supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty optimistic about what the market will look like
after the Labor Day break,'' said Katherine Kirk, a managing
director of Hambrechet &AMP; Quist in the investment bank firm's Boston
office.
</P>
<P>
   But investment bankers and analysts agree IPO investors will
likely become more discriminating about the deals they select, at
least in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the market is already sopping with backlogged
Internet deals. At the same time, investors are facing more IPO
risks than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers: size and speed. There is much more money riding on
individual IPOs and companies are hitting the public stock market
earlier than ever in their business development.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, the typical IPO raised $30 million to
$40 million for a new company. Today, that range has doubled and
offerings exceeding $100 million have become common.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk suggests IPOs are bulking up in part because big mutual
fund buyers don't want to own shares of companies with a $30
million stock float. Others think companies raise more money for
the old-fashioned reason: because they can.
</P>
<P>
   Engage Technologies Inc. of Andover, a hot Internet marketing
company, originally filed in May for an IPO that would raise $60
million. By the time the deal hit the market in mid-July, Engage
attracted $90 million in public financing.
</P>
<P>
   Engage officials say they will use the money for internal growth
and possible acquisitions, but won't make any more specific public
comments about their financial plans.
</P>
<P>
   But few companies can match Akamai Technologies Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass. when it comes to quick investment cycles from
private equity placements to IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which sells a service that speeds information flow on
the Internet, sold 5 percent of the company to Apple Computer Inc.
in June in return for $12.5 million. Last week, it sold another 5
percent to Cisco Systems Inc., this time for $49 million. Two days
after the Cisco announcement, Akamai registered its IPO plan to
raise as much as $86 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies like Interspeed Inc., a telecom equipment
company in North Andover, Mass., is trying to raise a relatively
modest $38 million by going public but has practically no revenues
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Interspeed and other companies like it have become public
venture deals proposing the dangerous combination of venture
capital level risk at public stock market prices.
</P>
<P>
   Any experienced investor will tell you that risks aren't such a
bad thing. Just make sure you're getting paid well to take them.

ITEMIZING A SEASON'S MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time for some ruminations, rumors, and reaction as the WNBA
heads into its three-round playoff season:
</P>
<P>
   --Unrelenting hype and hullabaloo (even by NBA standards)
accompanied Chamique Holdsclaw during her first professional
season, but her play lived up to the Jordan-esque fanfare. The
6-foot-2-inch forward averaged 16.9 points (sixth in the league)
and 7.9 rebounds (third) for Washington and is a cinch Rookie of
the Year. Perhaps more significant than her own numbers was her
impact on the Mystics. A 3-27 expansion team a year ago, Holdsclaw
helped Washington quadruple its win total.
</P>
<P>
   --Holdsclaw precluded any chance that Nykesha Sales would earn
top rookie honors; still, the former Connecticut star was one of
the chief reasons Orlando, an expansion team, remained in playoff
contention until the season's final day. Sales was 13th in the
league in scoring (13.7) and fifth in steals (2.2) while starting
from Game One.
</P>
<P>
   --Allison Feaster waited until the last three games of the
regular season to rack up her best WNBA efforts, scoring a
career-high 16 points, then following that up with 14- and 13-point
games for Los Angeles. The Harvard grad, sidelined almost her
entire rookie season a year ago with a broken foot, shot 51 percent
from the field and averaged 5.1 ppg while starting four times and
seeing action in every game.
</P>
<P>
   --One glance at the final standings easily reveals where the
balance of power lay in the league. No Eastern Conference team
would have qualified for the playoffs if they had played in the
Western Conference. In head-to-head competition, the West
dominated, 60 wins to 22, and no East team had a winning record
against the West. Only champion New York had a plus .500 record in
the East, and Charlotte and Detroit each made the postseason
despite losing more than they won. How very . . . NBA.
</P>
<P>
   --The WNBA may have broken its overall attendance record for the
second straight season, but that doesn't mean all is well with each
franchise. Average attendance was down and various reports suggest
that a third of the league's teams _ Los Angeles, Charlotte,
Cleveland, and Utah _ could be moved because of problems at the
gate. WNBA president Val Ackerman has said a decision on any
relocation won't be made until the league holds an evaluation in
the fall. But that hasn't stopped the speculation _ a recent rumor,
denied by the WNBA, was circulating that the Charlotte franchise
would be moving to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   --A knee injury ended her season prematurely, but it also may
have indicated that Yolanda Griffith is the WNBA's Most Valuable
Player. Griffith's basket with just over a second left gave
Sacramento a win over Los Angeles Aug. 10 and its first playoff
berth, but a torn meniscus in the next game effectively finished
her team's season. The Monarchs lost their last three
regular-season games and home-court advantage for the first round
of the postseason without Griffith, the league's second-leading
scorer (18.8) and top rebounder (11.3).
</P>
<P>
   --Kim Perrot, who died of cancer last Thursday at age 32, may
have been her team's smallest starter, but nobody stood taller for
the Houston Comets when they won the first two WNBA titles. At 5-5,
Perrot was a feisty point guard and a defensive standout. ``She
made this team against 1,000-to-1 odds, then it turns out she was
the reason we won the championship game last year,'' said coach Van
Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Controversial coaches
</P>
<P>
   Coaches in any sport often can be lightning rods for
controversy, and the WNBA has supplied its share of firestorms this
season. After Detroit coach/GM Nancy Lieberman-Cline traded Cindy
Brown and Korie Hlede to Utah at the end of July, each player
blasted their former boss. ``There's one thing Nancy has going for
her: she really knows how to manipulate people and turn things
around to make her look good,'' said Brown, who also called
Lieberman-Cline an ``egomaniac'' to the Detroit Free-Press. Said
Hlede: ``I was sick of her bull. She plays too many mind games.''
Lieberman-Cline did not respond. Ironically, the Shock's playoff
berth was secured in large measure by the play of Wendy Palmer, who
was obtained in the trade. The 6-2 Palmer had five double-doubles
in Detroit's last seven games . . . How appropriate that Cheryl
Miller coaches the Phoenix Mercury, because one of the greatest
players in the history of women's basketball is nothing if not
mercurial on the sidelines. Miller has amassed over two dozen
technicals and been tossed out of five games in three years. She
was fined a league-record $5,000 when, at her seething best after
being ejected from a midseason game, she flung one of her crutches
(being used after Achilles' tendon surgery) across the court and
then offered this up to the Arizona Republic: ``It's too much
testosterone and rent-a-cops in this league, you know, rent-a-refs.
It's ridiculous.''

DEPTH SAVES `DEEP' FROM USUAL CARICATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
IN TOO DEEP 
Directed by: Michael Rymer 
Screenplay by: Michael Henry Brown, Paul Aaron 
Starring: Omar Epps, LL Cool J, Nia Long, Stanley Tucci, Hill
Harper, Pam Grier, Jake Weber 
Running time: 104 minutes 
Rated: R 
Star rating: !!!

<P>
   The most openly racist term in American film is urban crime
thriller. It means movies about black stereotypes with guns and
drugs. It is, in short, an offensive, and sometimes even
offensively lucrative genre. And it would be altogether dismissible
if not for the invigorating excellence of the occasional movie that
moves off stereotype enough to respect the moral and emotional
complexity of the people caught up in their street wars. Spike
Lee's underrated ``Clockers'' was such a movie. Michael Rymer's
``In Too Deep'' is another.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the fact that its protagonist, an undercover
cop in Cincinnati, is perhaps too sincere and honorable for his
job, which in this case involves penetrating the city's biggest
drug operation and bringing its kingpin down. Screenwriters Michael
Henry Brown and Paul Aaron were inspired by the experiences of
Jeffrey Coy, a Boston policeman whose undercover work led to the
arrest and conviction of drug lord Darryl Whiting. Coy committed
suicide at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Omar Epps's soulful, lidded eyes are the perfect
arena for the conflict that soon starts building in the cop, Jeff
Cole, after he convinces the drug gang that he's tough enough to be
worth recruiting. Meanwhile, back at headquarters, his bosses are
rejoicing, but they're also wary.
</P>
<P>
   With reason, it turns out. Just as ``Clockers'' had a likable
drug kingpin in Delroy Lindo, so ``In Too Deep'' has one in LL Cool
J. He's every bit as vicious and territorial as he feels he has to
be. But in his own way, he's also a loyal family man who's liked in
the community. On a superficial level, he's warm and approachable,
and he has a crude genius for public relations, expressed in acts
like buying Thanksgiving dinner for everyone living in the
projects. In short, although the things he does are inexcusable,
he's removed from the world of cartooning and given some human
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   His deepening relationship with J. Reid, as Cole is known in his
made-up identity as a drug dealer from Akron, is a love story
without sex. The cop finds himself conflicted. He responds
positively to the loyalty the gang shows him and starts feeling
torn that he's there to seduce and betray the drug kingpin, who
does not discourage the widespread use of his nickname _ God.
(That's the nickname Whiting used). The tension is increased by
Epps's cop worrying about his cover being blown. If he's found out,
of course, he's dead. So the question becomes whether he can
engineer the big drug bust before he's unmasked.
</P>
<P>
   Because Epps conveys sensitivity, he also conveys conflict. Not
that he spends a lot of time sitting around agonizing. ``In Too
Deep'' has all the action a film of this type promises. It's just
not spun out in stereotypical simplicity. It even hints at root
causes and indicates why a life in the drug trade might seem a
valid response to young men growing up in the world they grow up
in. On the flip side, it also ponders the corruption built into the
law enforcement system. Not obvious kinds, like payoffs. Rather,
more subtle kinds, like interagency rivalries headed by ambitious
bureaucrats who don't mind sacrificing officers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most similar but lesser films, `In Too Deep'' has a
superior officer concerned that the undercover cop is being
stressed to the point of dysfunction on the job and further
dysfunction when he returns to society and is expected to pick up
the rhythms of a normal life. Stanley Tucci is both skillful and
incisive as Cole's boss. In an unusual move, the action pauses when
the boss yanks Cole out of what he considers to be a dangerous
pressure cooker. It's only after a bit of regeneration that
includes a budding romance with Nia Long that Cole goes back for
the final act. You won't forget the expressions on his face, or the
look on the kingpin's, in this rewardingly textured work that's
more cognizant than most of the drug trade's casualties.

LEFT TILTS TOWARD WAR; ADVENTUROUS SORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Vietnam, the American left has generally seen US
military intervention abroad as an evil to be protested. No chorus
line jerked its knees with more regularity and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Kosovo. Suddenly, a number of lefties were
supporting the US-led bombardment of Serbia by NATO forces. To the
question ``What's going on here?'', Todd Gitlin in Mother Jones
supplies a characteristically thoughtful answer by tracing the
evolution of his own views about justifiable warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, several years after he had marched and spoken against
the Gulf War, Gitlin was jolted to learn that Saddam Hussein had
indeed been on the verge of possessing nuclear weapons before the
war, and had indeed loaded missile warheads with anthrax for a
surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
   But a broader rethinking of military force was already underway
among Gitlin and some others of his ideological stripe. Observing
that intervention saved lives in Haiti while a failure to act in
Rwanda led to massive slaughter, they had grown increasingly
impatient with what Gitlin calls the ``childishly easy'' stance
against any war, anywhere, for any reason. He was also disturbed by
the seeming indifference to Milosevic's victims by some on the
left, and by their fastidious hair-splitting about which side was
more moral while Kosovars suffered and died. He concluded that ``a
careful Yes'' to military force ``could do good, while a reflexive
No was being discredited by events.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, the American left's near-automatic No to
military force, a staple of conviction, even `identity,' for three
decades, is finished,'' writes Gitlin. ``Just as well.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   You and I might flinch at the sight of a kitten if we'd had Alan
Root's experience with the animal kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Root, a 60-ish wildlife filmmaker whose story is told by George
Plimpton in a New Yorker issue devoted to adventure, wears a scar
on one leg from the time he was bitten by an angry gorilla. His
other leg contains a hole that, Root notes, ``you could put a Coke
bottle through,'' a souvenir of a goring by a hippopotamus. He also
lost a finger to a snake and left part of his buttocks in the jaws
of an attacking leopard.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Root doesn't regret a minute of it, and shrugs that the
animals who made an appetizer out of him were just ``having a bad
day.'' (He's even willing, after death, to be stretched out on the
Serengeti for the vultures and hyenas to feast on as a way,
Plimpton writes, of ``repaying his debt to wildlife.'') Plimpton
describes his friend's exploits with a kind of respectful
bemusement, but it's clear that Root is endowed (afflicted?) with
that obsessiveness and heedlessness of physical harm that
differentiates the truly adventurous from the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   A more sensible chap, if that adjective can be applied to a man
who chooses to spend a night alone in Central Park, is Bill Buford.
In his New Yorker account of that long, long night, Buford freely
admits to being frightened by every passing gang of teenagers and
every snapping branch. Buford is further burdened during his
high-risk nocturnal perambulations by his mental catalog _ surely
common to any New Yorker _ of every murder that occurred at the
scenic spots he passes.
</P>
<P>
   So what on earth was the appeal of this particular adventure?
Buford's answer is simple and, to an adventurer, one supposes,
sufficient: ``It was the thing you don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A different kind of daring _ actually, an instinctive heroism _
was displayed by Dave Sanders, the only teacher killed during the
Columbine High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was the man who ran from the faculty lounge to the
cafeteria and led 200 students out of harm's way before being cut
down himself by one of the killers. It remains one of the more
throat-catching stories out of Columbine: As he lay dying, with a
student showing him pictures of his wife and daughters, Sanders
said: ``Tell my girls I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sanders was able to take charge that day when others were
frozen in terror, it may have stemmed from the fact that he was
used to exhorting kids into action as a coach of cross-country,
track, basketball, baseball, soccer, and softball. In a brief but
affecting piece in Runner's World, Amby Burfoot talks to one of
Sanders's former students, now a coach herself. She recounts how
she told one of her runners ``how Mr. Sanders used to encourage us
to do our best during practices. He would be there with us yelling
`Run, run, run!' And (she) said to me: `That's probably the exact
same thing he was yelling to all the kids in the Columbine
cafeteria when he saved their lives.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dave Sanders brought nobility to an already-noble profession:
teaching. If this country had the remotest sense of priorities,
educators would be paid far better than they are, if only to
compensate for the fact that many students today come to them from
home environments that double the height of the hurdles teachers
must clear.
</P>
<P>
   A disheartening case in point is featured in Life magazine for
September. Life visited West Memphis, Ark., as part of a fresh look
at communities whose education systems the magazine spotlighted 50
years ago. Back then, West Memphis treated black children
shamefully, spending less than $20 a year to educate them compared
to $145 per year on white students. A conscience-searing Life photo
showed scores of black children crammed into a filthy classroom
with little heat, no electric lighting, and few books. Belatedly
conscience-stricken, West Memphis built a new school.
</P>
<P>
   One of the children in that picture, Ora Breckenridge, grew up
to be principal of the school. Breckenridge is proud of her
students _ ``my babies'' _ and tries to inspire them with her own
story, but the parents of too many of the students are either
absent or negligent, allowing kids to stay up late playing video
games or watching TV, making them unable to focus at school. Of
course things are better than they were in 1948, but there is no
happy ending yet for Ora Breckenridge, who is sometimes so
discouraged that she considers retirement, though she's only 56.
``We need parents,'' she says.

 &HT;    A puff piece from Puff Daddy
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing about a Puff Daddy record is the same thing the
rapper/producer is berated for: the samples.
</P>
<P>
   Deftly used, as on ``Satisfy You,'' the bit from Club Nouveau's
laid-back ``Why You Treat Me So Bad'' is unimposing background for
a better-than-average romantic offer.
</P>
<P>
   Or lazily applied, as on ``I'll Do This for You,'' Foxy's crisp,
finger-snapper ``Get Off'' is the sole redeeming factor in a song
that does little to disguise Puffy's pedestrian rhyme style and
pretty limited range of topics.
</P>
<P>
   (``Forever'' must be the answer to the question: How long does
Puffy rap about his Bentley?)
</P>
<P>
   But what's surprising about the second album from hip-hop's
biggest star is his ability to step up with his surroundings. Give
him a high-speed, original track on ``Is This The End (Part Two)''
and the team-up with limber rapper Twista becomes a standout. Or on
``Real (Expletive)'' alongside Lil' Kim and the late Notorious
B.I.G. _ one of hip-hop's best rappers _ nothing here sounds more
harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what you may think about Puff Daddy after the recent
addition to his police record, this record is mostly harmless
confection.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in other words, a lot of Puff.

 &HT;    Haden Quartet's latest is mood music supreme
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love the lush life? Charlie Haden's your man.
</P>
<P>
   The bassist, whose career has long absorbed and reflected a wide
range of musical traditions, has specialized in everything from
folksy Americana to big-band versions of South African protest
anthems. His versatility is guided by a melodic sense that finds
romantic elements in all kinds of sources. The music he makes with
his Los Angeles-based Quartet West is the most romantic of all:
unabashed nostalgia that looks to old Hollywood, vintage American
pop songs and Raymond Chandler for inspiraton.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet's latest disc is a comeback of sorts, varying a
formula that had become easy to take for granted. ``The Art of the
Song'' invites vocalists Shirley Horn and Bill Henderson to
perform, accompanied by chamber string arrangements, a repertoire
drawn from screen and stage productions such as ``On the Town'' and
``High, Wide and Handsome.'' It's bittersweet, glistening stuff
that moves at a stately tempo some listeners will find frustrating,
especially when even statelier excerpts from Rachmaninoff and Ravel
are offered for ``change of pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you approach the album as a movie soundtrack _ not
a jazz disc, per se _ it all makes sense. It's mood music supreme,
and it ends with an unexpected vocal from Haden himself, who offers
an affectingly fragile rendition of a 200-year-old traditional,
``Wayfaring Stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art
</P>
<P>
   of the Song''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Haden Quartet West with Chamber Orchestra. Verve. 13
tracks.

 &HT;    CD mini reviews
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar, Sonia Murray and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ROCK EN ESPANOL
</P>
<P>
   ``Reves/Yosoy''
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Tacuba. Warner Bros./WEA Latina.
</P>
<P>
   64 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's coolest rock band thrives on the weird coherence it
brings to the unlikeliest collisions of sound. Cafe Tacuba's is a
world where traditional melodies can be hijacked by cheesy
synthesizers (revenge of the Big '80s!) and then plowed into choppy
garage-rock. Years ahead of remix specialists like the Dust
Brothers (producers of Beck and the Beastie Boys), the quartet has
pioneered its own musical esperanto. The group's latest project is
an ambitious two-disc set split into instrumental and vocal halves,
creating more space than usual to experiment. The wordless
``Reves'' is actually the superior effort, an intriguing tech-Mex
fusion that percolates with minimalist repetitions, pauses for a
lovely patch of string music (with guests, the Kronos Quartet), and
finds a comfy spot on the CD shelf between Brian Eno and Love
Tractor. ``Yosoy,'' prankishly programmed so it actually boasts 52
tracks (for 15 songs), is thoroughly engaging as it moves between
billowy ballads and skewed rock tunes that display a joyously
anarchic spirit and new-wave heart.

   &QR;  RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoopla''
</P>
<P>
   Speech. TVT Records. 19 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a last gasp, Speech's ``Hoopla'' is more of a pleasant
reminder of what made his hip-hip group Arrested Development so
compelling ... back in 1992. Thematically the Atlantan's second
solo album is as consistently high-minded as AD's amiable singles
``Tennessee'' and ``People Everyday.'' And musically this '70s
-steeped effort replete with live instruments is miles ahead of not
only AD's Grammy-winning debut, but much of what purports to be
rhythm and blues today. Whether lines like ``Hip-hop without
Speech/Is like oli without that ravi'' will resonate in a 1999
that's seen such rap lyricists as Nas and Dre, however, is another
matter altogether.

   Michelle Malone. SBS Records.
</P>
<P>
   13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Is there something in the draft beer at Eddie's Attic? Atlanta's
singer-songwriter set has been producing some primo albums of late.
Add this ebullient stunner by longtime local favorite Michelle
Malone to top-notch recent works by Josh Joplin and Doria Roberts.
Malone, whose writing has tended toward tough-as-nails posturing
and heart-tugging melancholia, recasts herself convincingly here as
a perky popsmith. ``Avalon'' takes a page from Indigo Girl Emily
Saliers' sunny songbook; Saliers herself plays guitar and sings
backup on the lovely lean-on-me number ``Strength for Two.''
Malone's mood doesn't darken until six songs in, when she disses
the music industry on ``Brand New Dream.'' Even then, she delivers
the kiss-off with a hook so bouncy and irresistible it makes the
Indigos' ``Shame on You'' sound like a dirge.

 &HT;    An exhilarating excursion
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Go'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   It has the energetic, late-night delirium of a Chinese fire
drill. A three-part comedy-drama unfolding on a single Christmas
Eve, it's directed and shot by Doug Liman (``Swingers'') with some
of the wraparound chronology used in ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   You could think of it as a movie built on ``X's.'' We get Xmas,
exhilaration, exhaustion, excitement and the drug called ecstasy,
better known as X. The movie is like a bright, shining package:
Though it turns out to be pretty empty, you can't help admiring how
cleverly it's wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp ensemble cast includes Scott Wolf, Jay Mohr, Katie
Holmes, Sarah Polley and William Richtner and Jane Krakowski as a
hilariously odd cop and his wife.

 &HT;    Mini video reviews
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' (R) _ Two young women (Elodie
Bouchez and Natacha Regnier) meet in a small French town and decide
to share an apartment. They scrounge for odd jobs; they flirt with
guys, joke and argue. Finding the miraculous in the mundane, the
feature debut from director Erick Zonca is the kind of movie that
finds grace in small details, in a glance or the way someone
smiles. Much of the credit goes to the actresses, who chart a
symbiotic friendship as deep and volatile as a love match. There's
not a false, actory moment in the whole movie. It's no wonder they
shared the best actress prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival.
They deserve it. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Celebration'' (R) _ At the gala 60th birthday party of
his father, a young man (Ulrich Thomsen) reveals a dark family
secret in this Danish long day's journey into night. A mix of
old-fashioned theatrics, pop psychology and cinema verite, it's a
wonderfully compelling melodrama. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``La Separation'' (unrated) _ Think of it as a Gallic ``Kramer
vs. Kramer.'' Daniel Auteuil and Isabelle Huppert play longtime
lovers and parents of a toddler who must cope with her attraction
to another man. The acting is terrific, but it may be all too
civilized, too French, for some. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Last Broadcast'' (unrated) _ The other independent flick
about a video crew that goes into the woods and never comes back.
The makers hint that the ``Blair Witch Project'' folks stole their
idea, but originality and quality aren't always the same thing. The
flick is sometimes eerie, but it's told in a cluttered,
start-and-stop style that's meant to parody TV documentary style
but just seems messy. Then there's that ``surprise'' ending that
doesn't really make sense. One point of interest: It was shot with
digital cameras. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Six Ways to Sunday'' (R) _ A twisted Freudian gangster
nightmare, starring Norman Reedus as a young hoodlum, Deborah Harry
as his seductive mother and Elina Lowensohn as the young woman who
comes between them. This black comedy is a tonal mess, but it's
often a watchable guilty pleasure if you're in a midnight-movie
mood. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I'm Losing You'' (R) _ Bruce Wagner takes his brilliant,
bitter Hollywood novel and removes its fangs in his own film
adaptation. Andrew McCarthy, Frank Langella and Rosanna Arquette
play members of a show-biz family who find themselves haunted by
mortality, whether it's the unexpected death of a child, a cancer
diagnosis or McCarthy's infatuation with a brittle HIV-positive
woman (Elizabeth Perkins). It's an interesting piece of work, but
it bears almost no resemblance to the book. Grade: C

JACK, BOBBY AND THE END OF CAMELOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT L. TURNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SONS AND BROTHERS 
The Days of Jack and Bobby Kennedy 
By Richard D. Mahoney 
Arcade, 441 pp., $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Books in Print lists 263 volumes centered on the lives of John
F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. There would seem to be little
need for another, especially one that raises more questions than it
answers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sons &AMP; Brothers,'' by Richard D. Mahoney, a former John F.
Kennedy Scholar at the University of Massachusetts and the Kennedy
Library, views the eight years in which the brothers were at the
center of national life through its own prism, one that is both
provocative and frustrating. Little new information will be found
here, but the facts and allegations are aligned to support the
intriguing central theme of the book, that Robert Kennedy was an
even greater influence than has generally been recognized on the
life of his brother the president and also, unwittingly, on his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney credits the younger brother, the hard-driving moralist,
with pushing the urbane president to some of his most important
decisions _ the determination not to bomb Cuba during the 1962
missile crisis, and the strong stand mounted against
segregationists Ross Barnett and George Wallace, for instance. ``By
1963 Jack was at the forefront of change, and Bobby had brought him
there, against the better judgment of all of his brother's
advisors,'' Mahoney writes. The president ``now found in Bobby the
moral compass that would direct them forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Kennedy also took some paths alone. He pursued a
zealot's siege against the Teamsters Union's Jimmy Hoffa and the
Mafia, despite the fact that his brother and their father both had
dealings with the latter. The effect, according to Mahoney, was
devastating. In 1962 and 1963, 965 mafiosi were indicted and 404
convicted, including some in the nation's top crime families. Also,
the attorney general worked with white heat to rid Cuba of Fidel
Castro. While John Kennedy felt contrite after the Bay of Pigs
fiasco, Mahoney writes, his brother's ``crusade against Castro,
which took form during the Bay of Pigs postmortem, was a dark
admixture of emotion and crude miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mahoney's view, this was a fatal mix. It gave the trained
killers in the mob both the motive and, in large part, the means to
assassinate the president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a ridiculous scenario. Many serious students of the
assassination believe that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone, and
a good portion of these think organized crime could well have been
involved. For one thing, it is now known that Jack Ruby, who
silenced Oswald, had much tighter mob connections than was
understood in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, while not detailing his view of exactly how it would
have transpired, supplies enough detail to make the mob-connection
theory interesting. Essentially, he suggests that a small group of
anti-Castro Cubans in Florida was working with mobster Johnny
Rosselli and the CIA to kill Castro, all with Robert Kennedy's
knowledge and approval. When Rosselli turned against the president,
he could be confident the CIA would cool the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Mahoney's analysis is often questionable.
And he too often mixes established facts with assertions that are
in doubt, while not always noting the difference. For instance,
Mahoney describes the detention and release of three ``tramps''
near the grassy knoll in Dallas, where many believe the fatal shot
was fired at John Kennedy. But, says Mahoney, ``a photograph taken
reveals that one of them was Charles V. Harrelson, a shooter for
the Marcello family'' in New Orleans who was later convicted of
murdering a judge. Strong stuff, except that few people believe the
photo is of Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney's episodic style, focusing on a few events, undercuts
the book elsewhere as well. For instance, he capsulizes the 1960
Kennedy-Nixon campaign by describing colorfully how the Chicago mob
stole Illinois _ and thereby the election _ for Kennedy. ``The
Kennedy dream may well have been delivered by people who murdered
for a living,'' Mahoney writes. But he never mentions that Kennedy
won the election by 303 to 219 electoral votes. Had Illinois's 27
gone to Nixon, Kennedy still would have won the White House by 30
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the assassination, if there was mob involvement, the real
truth will probably never be known unless some aging participant
decides to tell the story on his deathbed. But it won't be
Rosselli. Like Oswald and so many others, he was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sons &AMP; Brothers'' attempts to describe one of the most
interesting relationships in government and the crime of the
century. It does neither with sufficient depth or power. Still, the
questions it raises continue to fascinate. Few would put this on
top of the Kennedy book list, but it wouldn't be 264th, either.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a darkened office Stephen Moore is doing his part to clean up
the visual clutter on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   As a research subject for Lycos Inc., an Internet portal company
that helps users navigate on line, Moore has evaluated the layouts
of dozens of sites _ and has declared many of them wanting. One was
a kitchen-supply site from which he tried to order a turkey smoker,
until he found the confusing array of images and text impossible to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so convoluted!'' said Moore, a 47-year-old sales
executive at Bell Atlantic. The site's ``links'' led him to such
merchandise as coffee makers and tablecloths, but the smoker was
nowhere to be found. He gave up after 10 minutes. ``I couldn't find
it no matter where I clicked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's frustration was duly noted by Lycos researchers, part of
their efforts to understand how viewers scan Web pages on the
Internet, an often challenging task for eyes accustomed to the
familiar layouts and visual cues of the printed page.
</P>
<P>
   By mapping how a person's vision travels across a computer
monitor, Lycos hopes to reduce Web-page clutter and formalize some
design principles for the sometimes chaotic new medium. Selfishly,
Lycos also hopes to better hold the attention of millions of
Internet users as the Web continues its explosive expansion. This,
in turn, will help it and other on-line companies raise advertising
rates and increase revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't read the Web, they browse, so you really need to
build pages that use minimalist writing and open space,'' said
David Hendry, a computer scientist who oversees many of Lycos's
usability studies.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Less is more' is something we say a lot around here.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Lycos, of Waltham, Mass., has paid about 275 volunteers
$50 each for an hour of on-line surfing, sometimes tracking their
eye movements with infrared video cameras. Other companies such as
IBM Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., and Hannaford Bros., a grocery chain
that runs an on-line delivery service, have sponsored similar
studies, all in hopes of drawing more users to their sites and
keeping them there.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, bits of conventional wisdom emerging from such research
have begun to influence the look of the Web. Users seem to focus
initially on material at the center of a page, sometimes with a
quick glance at the upper-left corner; then they move on to
material strung along the right side of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why users view the Web the way they do isn't clear, says
Kate Dobroth, a principal scientist at the American Institutes for
Research in Concord, Mass. While certain mechanics of human vision
may be at work, Dobroth suspects people have learned their
Web-viewing habits simply from common Web site design practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a chicken-and-egg issue,'' Dobroth said. ``If
others tend to put their interesting information in the upper-right
corner, you might learn to look there. Then everybody else will
start to think it's a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Hendry and other scientists think they can
point to other traits as well. For instance, they say new users
tend to miss material posted at the bottom of the page. And
animated graphics, they say, are a big distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Tullis, vice president for human interface design at
Fidelity Investments, says the company's home page once included a
flashing ``Fidelity'' logo. But it was yanked after research
subjects found it distracting. Now the page features a static logo
in the upper-left corner. Tullis says the logo-placement works
because it is simple. More complex descriptions of the company and
its products can wait until people click through several more
layers of pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People usually have some goal, and you want to stay out of
their way,'' Tullis said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, good Web sites give their users the illusion of
control, says Krzysztof Lenk, a professor at the Rhode Island
School of Design in Providence, R.I..
</P>
<P>
   ``Good functional aesthetics give you the sense in your mind
that you're controlling the flow of the data on the screen, rather
than the other way around,'' Lenk said. ``You feel like you're dumb
if you don't know which button to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that certain visual cues can affect consumer behavior
is reflected in the design of everything from newspapers to shampoo
bottles. As traffic on the Internet has soared since 1995, many
marketing companies have turned their attention on line as well.
One, Perception Research Services Inc., of Fort Lee, N.J., began a
study for IBM several years ago to map how people scanned its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM studies used a video camera package made by IScan Inc.
of Burlington, Mass. It includes a near-infrared light to
illuminate a subject's cornea; the resulting reflection functions
as a fixed point on the eye's surface while the pupil moves. By
comparing the two locations, the cameras determine to within an
inch which part of a computer screen has drawn a volunteer's gaze.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study prompted plenty of revisions on the
ibm.com site. For example, the study caused IBM to rethink the
placement of a photo of a flower in the prominent upper-right
corner of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The plant was taking up valuable space, says Gary Bridge, a
marketing vice president at the company. ``Some designer must have
thought it looked visually pretty.'' The photo was replaced with
on-screen buttons that link to other pages devoted to shopping and
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also recently began what it calls a policy of
``harmonization'' to include similar graphic elements on the tens
of thousands of Web pages maintained by about 125 different
divisions within the giant computer company. The task will cost
millions of dollars, but Bridge says the work will make it easier
for visitors to scan the Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to feel like you're in one big IBM-land, not like
it's all Balkanized,'' Bridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other companies are also reconfiguring Web sites after
studying user viewing patterns. Hannaford Bros. plans to revamp the
site of its HomeRuns on-line delivery service next month. Among
other things it will include a yellow-beige background rather than
the current white one.
</P>
<P>
   Test subjects reported the new color provided less contrast to
the site's black text, making it easier on the eye, said HomeRuns
Web manager Kirk Doggett.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Texas, SBC Communications Inc. plans to
introduce a site next month that is likely to include more visual
elements in the center section of the page, based on the firm's own
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Kortum, SBC biomedical engineer, won't be more specific
about the pending changes but concedes the company's current home
page has too much bland text in the middle. ``I wish I'd been
involved in that design,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Waltham, Lycos has also reconfigured a few pages based on its
research. For example, pages devoted to automobile and music clubs
now feature fewer words and more photographs, creating what Lycos
describes as a ``cleaner environment.'' Some of the text that
remains has been shifted to the left side of the screen, out of the
way of the more powerful visual images.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were meant to keep visitors entertained, says Lycos
product manager Alka Gupta, and appeal to the notoriously short
attention spans of younger Web users. ``If you want to keep them,
you need to spoon-feed them,'' Gupta said.

GRACE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because they are smart, the publishers Farrar, Straus and Giroux
have released a new edition of John McPhee's classic profile of the
collegiate Bill Bradley, ``A Sense of Where You Are.'' The 140-page
book, which chronicles Bradley's 1965 season as the All-American
basketball captain of the Princeton Tigers, is a sportswriting gem
and is especially timely as Bradley emerges as the main challenger
to Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The McPhee book is a powerful piece of campaign literature,
originally written by a disinterested outsider for The New Yorker
magazine. Like the Bradley campaign _ like all modern presidential
campaigns _ it is a work of nostalgia, hearkening to an era long
before the invention of the three-point line, when college athletes
spent four years on campus and wore button-down shirts to class.
</P>
<P>
   McPhee's Bradley is almost too good to be true: a young
scholar-athlete who taught Sunday school every weekend he was on
campus. Between games, Bradley burned the midnight oil to win a
coveted Rhodes scholarship, turning his back on lucrative offers to
play pro basketball while he studied at Oxford. He played
basketball to win, but reveled in other talents. One teammate
commented: ``Basketball was one-millionth of what he had to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in the Bill Bradley candidacy, by which I mean
that I don't believe that I will ever live in a country that elects
Bill Bradley president. I'd like to live in that country, though.
In one of several postscripts, McPhee emphasizes that the 1999
``Dollar Bill'' (Bradley was the only child of a well-to-do bank
president) closely resembles the 1965 issue.
</P>
<P>
   In later life, McPhee hooks up with the novelist John Edgar
Wideman, who played against Bradley in 1963. Wideman and Bradley
had been friends, but the novelist was chary of renewing his
acquaintanceship with Senator Bradley, citing his concerns about
``the mutating effects of political life.'' To which McPhee
answers: ``You've got nothing to worry about. Look him up some
time. You'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   McPhee's book is nostalgic in another sense as well: It made me
miss good writing. When I was in college, and later, McPhee was the
gold standard, a writer who made you want to become a writer.
``Sense'' is a book within a book; as Bradley conducts a tutorial
on basketball, McPhee conducts a tutorial on writing.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Most accomplished basketball players will tell you that
they aim at the back of the rim when shooting foul shots. But
Bradley tells McPhee that he aims at the tiny steel eyelets under
the rim that hold the net to the hoop. And that he aims for one
particular eyelet _ the one in the center. And you realize that it
is McPhee's attention to detail, as much as Bradley's, that has
extracted this tiny gem.
</P>
<P>
   When McPhee writes of Bradley, ``He dislikes flamboyance, and .
. . has apparently never made a move merely to attract attention,''
he could just as well be writing about himself. If you haven't
already, I suggest you acquaint yourself with the worst of modern
sportswriting, as published in GQ, Esquire, and other glossy guy
rags. A typical sentence would read: ``But enough about me; here
are my real feelings about Ken Griffey, Jr.'' I doubt today's
sportwriters could craft such tiny flourishes such as McPhee's
allusion to Bob Cousy's ``coleopteran eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   I've heard people pigeonhole the McPhee profile of Bradley as
one white Ivy League guy writing about another, both of them
oblivious to the changing, i.e. increasingly black, world of
basketball. But I disagree. Not just for 1965, but for the
historical record, McPhee and Bradley get race right. Bradley knows
that Oscar (The O) Robertson is the best player in the game, and
assiduously copies virtually every Robertson move.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials _ did I mention that Bradley also has a
gold medal? _ UCLA's black star Walt Hazzard approached Bradley,
and said, ``Where I come from, you are known as `The White O.' ''
Wow. If you don't plan to vote for Bradley, at the very least, take
the time to reread this wonderful piece of writing.

   1. TV INVADES BHUTAN! The wilfully isolated Himalayan mountain
kingdom of Bhutan has finally let television inside its borders.
Can its ancient Buddhist traditions survive the tube? By Peter de
Jonge. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (4,400 words)
+ edited article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
'WITCH' CRAFT BREWS ON THE NET The mayor of Burkittsville, MD., is
having trouble sleeping these days - and she hasn't even seen ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' the horror film allegedly set in her quiet,
one-street town, population 200. Strangers are converging on the
cemetery; the town sign disappeared; and county police have
increased security. It's all Mayor Joyce Brown can do to keep up
with the constant queries : Is it true? For the record, it is not.
``We're dealing with it day by day,'' says Brown. ``This is a
Christian community and we're praying that it all goes away.'' By
Patti Hartigan. From The Boston Globe. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
CHER BELIEVES IN LIFE AFTER 50 She's the queen of re-invention.
Just when you think Cher is finished, she bounces back. In the
summer of 99 she is more popular than ever, with an eye-popping
live show that is receiving the reviews of a lifetime. Her
enormously popular single ``Believe'' has been called a masterpiece
of technopop and became her biggest hit in a four-decades long
recording career. ``I always laugh when people say I'm reinventing
myself,'' says Cher. ``It's just a matter of being popular or not
popular ... I'm pretty much the same person I've always been, and
I'm doing pretty much the same things.'' By Ivor Davis. 1,300 words
+ photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
'CLOCKWORK'S' MCDOWELL REMEMBERS KUBRICK AND 'CALIGULA' Malcolm
McDowell, the actor who became a role model for young sociopaths
when he played the ultra-violent Alex in Stanley Kubrick's classic
``A Clockwork Orange,'' says the director of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and
``2001'' let him down. Just months after the death of the director,
McDowell says Kubrick owed him money and had reneged on their
friendship. It's been nearly three decades since McDowell played
the ruthless punk with a penchant for Beethoven, but he is as busy
as ever, acting in a new British gangster movie and in a
time-travel comedy. And he's watching for the re-release in
September of his notorious ``Caligula,'' a
</P>
<P>
   cult classic considered the only high-budget pornographic movie
in history. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
'SEX AND THE CITY' In the TV show ``Sex and the City,'' Sarah
Jessica Parker and three other actresses play single New Yorkers in
their '30s who repeatedly suffer horrible humiliations at the hands

THE GREEN SLIME NETWORK : 20 YEARS AT NICKELODEON Green slime has
become a trademark of Nickelodeon, the first network for children
and the No. 1 cable network. (A running routine was that when
anyone said ``I don't know,'' green slime was dumped on his or her
head.) Now 20 years old, it has been celebrating its birthday this
summer with wacky special programming, contests, retrospectives,
giveaways and, of course, some of that old green goo. In 1979 it
was a different kind of place, more refined but a lot less fun. It
was known to most kids as the ``green vegetable network.'' It was
good for you, but the taste left a lot to be desired. By Laurel
Graeber. 900 words + photo.

MUSICAL MUSCLES Vocal cords evolved for coughing. Noisemaking came
as something of an evolutionary afterthought. Now humans rely on
some unusual anatomic aspects of the throat and mouth that allow us
to transform life-giving breath into dynamic sound waves. A report

KELLIE MARTIN'S UNPREDICTABLE ROAD TO 'ER' When Kellie Martin, 24,
joined the cast of 'ER' last year, she faced the rare challenge of
becoming part of a show which she'd followed since its earliest
days. Martin talks about the show, overcoming her nervousness at
working with her favourite actors, her recent marriage and why she
has learned never to make plans. By Andrew Ryan. From TV Guide
Canada. 1,400 words + photo.

AS CENTURY WINDS DOWN, IT'S NOT OLD-TIMERS' DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be no relief from these ``best of the century''
lists. ESPN is going to bombard us each week as it counts backward
toward No. 1 (it better be Babe Ruth), and Major League Baseball
will announce its 25-man All-Century Team at the start of the 1999
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are voting for the All-Century Team, and the early returns
are a little startling. Balloting is being done via the Internet,
at Kmart, and at the ballparks. There are 100 names on the ballot
(selected by a panel of baseball executives, writers, and
historians), and fans can vote for two players at each infield
position, two catchers, six pitchers, and nine outfielders. Voting
ends Sept. 15 for paper ballots and Sept. 19 for Internet ballots.
</P>
<P>
   If the election were complete today, the starting nine for
baseball's All-Century team would be:
</P>
<P>
   Catcher: Johnny Bench
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher: Nolan Ryan
</P>
<P>
   First base: Lou Gehrig
</P>
<P>
   Second base: Jackie Robinson
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop: Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Third base: Mike Schmidt
</P>
<P>
   Outfield: Hank Aaron
</P>
<P>
   Outfield: Babe Ruth
</P>
<P>
   Outfield: Ted Williams
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan? Excuse me? Nolan Ryan was spectacular. He struck out
more batters than any pitcher in history. But his career winning
percentage is .526. In 27 seasons, he went 324-292. That's an
average season of 12-11. For 27 years. It's downright Wasdin-like.
And he's going to be named the greatest pitcher of the century
ahead of Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Cy Young, Sandy Koufax,
and Bob Gibson? Compared with these guys, Nolan is a Kmart Special
in Aisle 13.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr.? Again, we all love Cal. His iron man streak
brought the game back from the work stoppage of 1994-95. He's a
shortstop who hit for power and won two MVP awards. But Honus
Wagner won eight batting titles and hit over .300 17 straight
years. And Ernie Banks hit 512 homers and also won two MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Rip are in the lead because voters can't be expected to
know 10 decades of baseball history. It's the same reason we see
Mark McGwire ahead of Jimmie Foxx at first. How else could Ozzie
Smith rank ahead of Wagner and Banks at short? It's like selecting
Limp Bizkit ahead of the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   More than 670,000 votes have been cast. Here's where it stands:
</P>
<P>
   Catcher: Bench is going to win and Yogi Berra will be second.
Few can quarrel with Bench, and Yogi makes everybody happy, but
Bill Dickey and Mickey Cochrane should be higher than sixth and
seventh. We love Carlton Fisk, but his ranking at third is way too
high. That's what happens when you wind up in ``Good Will
Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   First base: Gehrig will win by a landslide and McGwire is
comfortably ahead of Foxx (178,284-118,458). Too far ahead. Playing
in a dead-ball era, Foxx hit 524 homers with a lifetime average of
.325. McGwire's career average is .264. George Sisler (.340) ranks
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Second base: Robinson and Rogers Hornsby. Hornsby is by
acclamation the greatest righthanded hitter of all time and we can
only hope he makes the team, ahead of either Joe Morgan (current)
or Robinson. Can't expect today's voters to be up to speed on Nap
Lajoie (.338).
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop: Ripken and Ozzie are still 1-2, but Banks and Wagner
are within striking distance. Let's hope the old guys make a move.
Artificial-turf/salami-bat Ozzie simply can't bounce both Wagner
and Banks. It's a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Third base: Here we have a position (like catcher) where the
modern players are batter. Schmidt is hands down the best third
baseman of all time. And who can argue with Brooks Robinson? Pie
Traynor should be higher than sixth, but otherwise, third base is
OK.
</P>
<P>
   Outfield: This is the most fun. The team members (as of today)
are Aaron, Ruth (almost a dead heat), Williams, Willie Mays, Joe
DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Ty Cobb, Ken Griffey Jr., and Pete Rose.
The first three omissions are Roberto Clemente, Stan Musial, and
Joe Jackson. Give me Musial over Rose and I'll live with it, but
Frank Robinson at No. 16 _ behind Tony Gwynn and Carl Yastrzemski _
is a joke. And how would you like your chances with that
second-string outfield of Mays, DiMaggio, and Mantle?
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher: The greatest-ever staff thus far is Ryan, Koufax,
Young, Gibson, Roger Clemens, and Johnson. Clemens is a Kmart
Special, as is Greg Maddux at No. 7. Mathewson (373-188, 2.13 ERA,
80 shutouts) is a hideous No. 14 and Warren Spahn is only 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that baseball has allowed itself a small window
to correct some of the injustices. A panel will be allowed to add
five players to the team and no doubt Mathewson, Foxx, and Wagner
will be worthy additions to a team overloaded with the Ripkens,
Ryans, Clemenses, and Smiths of today.

OFFICE DATING RAISES QUESTIONS OF LAW, PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- About a year ago, Richard Levin sat in the personnel
office of a small South Shore manufacturing company and listened to
a trembling witness tell of a co-worker's three-hour lunch breaks,
cover stories, and what looked to be a secret romance with her
subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced human resources consultant, Levin had spent years
guiding managers through thorny issues like racial sensitivity and
sexual harassment. But he still recalls that meeting as edgy and
unscripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person was literally shaking,'' recalled Levin, who
consults out of an office in Wellesley Hills. ``She had held it
back for a while, several weeks, sleepless nights and the whole
routine. She didn't want to report on them.'' Then the witness
left, and it fell to management to decide how much of an employee's
private life is a workplace concern.
</P>
<P>
   State officials were thrown into similarly uncharted ground this
week, as they investigated rumors that Economic Development
Director Carolyn Boviard was having an illicit affair with her
chief of staff, David Shagoury. Governor Paul Celluci turned to his
chief counsel, Len Lewin, for advice. But as Lewin can testify, it
is managers, rather than lawyers, who are increasingly faced with
the problem of office romance _ and their solutions are far more
delicate and ambiguous than the law.
</P>
<P>
   While workplace romances _ especially those between a supervisor
and subordinate _ can hurt office morale, it is illegal to fire an
employee for lawful activities that take place outside the
workplace. And managers and workers agree that, in an overworked
nation, trying to prevent relationships between co-workers would be
like trying to hold back the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be absolutely irrelevant to say to you as an expert
that workplace relationships are good or bad. I'll just say that it
happens, and it happens six to eight million times a year,'' said
Dennis Powers, a longtime business attorney and author of ``The
Office Romance: Playing With Fire Without Getting Burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Brook Zeisse, who works at Bowne Internet Solutions in
Cambridge, put it this way: ``They say it's inappropriate, but so
are a lot of things. They can't fire you for taking cigarette
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies back up the precariousness of managing
intra-office relationships _ a topic that, for human resources
specialists, has taken a place beside sexual harassment and
diversity. In a 1998 survey of 2,750 members of the Society for
Human Resource Management, 55 percent of respondents said their
companies ``permitted but discouraged'' workplace romance. But 55
percent also said they knew of at least one workplace romance that
had ended in marriage. Twenty-eight percent of respondents said
workplace relationships had resulted in accusations of favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Business specialists said that in companies without an explicit
policy to fire employees involved in relationships, most managers
will attempt to relocate two lovers into separate divisions. Rather
than implementing draconian antidating policies, companies are
``moving toward more tolerance'' because they do not want to lose
valuable employees, said John Challenger, CEO of the Chicago
outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, sexual harassment laws have brought new
scrutiny to workplace romance, especially between people at
different levels of power, and a series of executives have been
unseated in recent years when illicit affairs were uncovered.
Martin Hanaka, president of Staples Inc., resigned in 1997 after it
was found that he had broken a company policy prohibiting
``fraternization.'' An extramarital affair scuttled Air Force
General John Ralston's bid to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And
at the University of Wisconsin, a dean stepped down in 1997 for
failing to disclose an affair with a woman who worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Powers sees it, sudden-death, no-dating policies
tend to be enforced selectively, and for political purposes _ with
the case of President Clinton standing as primary evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a high-profile boss with a subordinate, these
will be cannon fodder. The rest of us will never have to deal with
this, thank God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with an eye on the alleged relationship between Boviard and
her chief of staff, who is 11 years her junior, one observer
speculated that the story had captured the public imagination
because it is a spin on the cliched CEO and his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that it's still not entirely accepted for women
in positions of power to have relationships with younger men who
are their employees,'' said Elizabeth Sherman, director of the
Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston. ``That's an inevitable result of what
we've seen over the past 15 or 20 years, which is the advancement
of women into the very top of their professions. That's probably
going to be grist for the mill of scandal.''

THE MOTHER OF ALL SENATE RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. -- New York is a monster of a state, the wealth
and fashion frenzy of its dominating city obscuring the remoteness,
ruralness and Midwesternness of ``upstate.'' The Hudson River
carved out of the hills and gullies forms a rugged landscape that
is more like Northern Maine, Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, or Ohio
in terms of attitude and suspicion of people from ``the city'' and
their ways.
</P>
<P>
   You can drive north 400 miles and still not reach Buffalo, a
city whose very name bespeaks the frontier. Rip Van Winkle and
Ichabod Crane are not characters vaguely recalled from a
``Seinfeld'' re-run. To capture this sprawling domain politically,
you have to run left of Ohio but right of Massachusetts. The
Republican establishment reinvented itself after the rich years of
Nelson Rockefeller, and came back as a suburban-upstate
conservative coaalition.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cuomo's 12-year governorship ended because his limping
incumbency was burdened with the twin saddlebags of high taxes and
opposition to the death penalty, wildly popular here. But the
defeat last year of Cuomo's nemesis, ex-Senator Al D'Amato,
encouraged Hillary Rodham Clinton's boosters.
</P>
<P>
   When now-Senator Charles Schumer took out after D'Amato, it was
a two-year campaign of finances, firecrackers, and ferocity. That
conflagration will undoubtedly be exceeded in intensity and
fierceness by the struggle between Mrs. Clinton and New York City
Mayor Rudy Giuliani. What makes this the most important one-state
election in the country is the amount of money and media attention
built into the script.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of the outgoing president grappling with the
no-nonsense mayor of New York City is an epic confrontation that
pits the core of the Democratic Party's priorities on social
welfare themes against the shape-up-and-fly-right Republican
ideology. Some Republican consultants believe Hillary's prominence
will soak up money and media that would otherwise drift toward Al
Gore's uphill struggle to succeed her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand-dollar checks falleth upon Ms. Clinton as rain upon the
place beneath. Her iconic stature among certain kinds of female
voters is weighed against the intensity of the fear of her, and
what she represents. Conservative forces deride her ``vast
right-wing conspiracy'' theory behind the futile impeachment
scenario. And they march in lockstep against her vision of health
care, education, child-nurturing and outspoken views on where the
taxpayer's money should go.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is perhaps the one politician in America who can make
the icy Mrs. C. a likeable figure. His 45-minute weekly radio talk
show is a ``Saturday Night Live'' parody of the original model,
when Fiorella LaGuardia, ``The Little Flower,'' read the funnies to
the kids in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is a bit of a paranoiac. His barbed-wire personality
and eye-for-an-eye style appeal to New Yorkers, who seem to want to
have a tough guy to hide behind when it comes to dealing with the
vicissitudes of living in the city. But his ``You got a problem
with that?'' style and a take-it-or-leave-it attitude about
governing make him a bit of a threatening figure.
</P>
<P>
   What would a man with his personality do over six years in the
US Senate? Because this state's senators get far more than the
average senator's attention, what they say and how they say it is
writ large in the political dialogue of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mrs. Clinton leaves Martha's Vineyard this week for a
lakefront retreat in Skaneateles, west of Syracuse, it is oddly
reminiscent of an untried contender going to the country to train
for a heavyweight title fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton collects rabid enemies the way a dog draws fleas:
Wall Street Journal editors, Republican fund-raisers whose payoff
depends on continued control of the Senate, gun-users frightened of
outrages-triggered gun control, moralists who scorn her for not
turning on her straying husband.
</P>
<P>
   But not even her most vitriolic critics deny that she has
considerable political talent. Masterful in speaking, a brainiac
when it comes to explicating the complexities of social problems,
tautly disciplined, never flummoxed or upstaged, she seems to be a
far more composed candidate than the volcanic Giuliani. His public
appearances seem to resemble therapy sessions, with a lot of
enabling payrollers around to smooth his feathers and explain
afterword what he really meant. His volatility makes him suspect.
She might flatten him in debate.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary will be a tough sell upstate and in the suburbs. She may
have to carry the city by close to 3-1 to smother the conservative
vote elsewhere. No one knows how the presidential succession will
bear on her race, or hers on it. She seems to be close to
displacing Ted Kennedy as the liberal conservatives most love to
hate.
</P>
<P>
   As with most elections between evenly matched combatants, the
toughest one usually wins. Giuliani's toughness is legendary,
beyond dispute. But Mrs. Clinton is no fragile flower. Not since
Eleanor Roosevelt has a first lady taken this kind of heat, and
propspered. They can shout ``carpetbagger'' all they want. Hillary
may not know much about Hell's Kitchen. But over the past seven
year's she has been to hell and back several times. And still she's
back for more.

POLITICAL MORALS ARE 2-WAY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lesson of this political season is simple: You can't have it
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas Governor George W. Bush is going to market his marital
fidelity and his religious conversion as evidence of his moral
fitness for higher office, he had better come clean about any past
cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   If Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci is going to banish an
underling for sleeping with one of his cabinet officers, he had
better jettison the cabinet secretary, too.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive us our skepticism when a politician claims to be the
victim of a smear campaign and then refuses to clarify those
``unfounded rumors.'' We are not jaded. We have merely been here
before.
</P>
<P>
   Bush asks us to give him a pass on any youthful experimentation
with illegal drugs even as he endorses the incarceration of anyone
found in his state with a gram of cocaine. If rich, white George
Bush was entitled to a callow youth, why weren't those inmates,
mostly poor and black, now serving time for drug offenses in Texas
jails?
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Massachusetts Office of Economic Development
asks us to blame rumors of a romantic liaison with her chief of
staff on a vengeful, soon-to-be-ex-spouse even as she shows her
purported paramour the door. If Carolyn Boviard is just the victim
of a nasty divorce, why is her chief of staff, David Shagoury,
suddenly unemployed?
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Boviard are able to spin themselves into righteous
fury over alleged ``assaults'' on their privacy because they know
the public has grown weary of a political press corps weaned on
scandal. But the line between public and private life is not nearly
as indistinct as Bush and Boviard would have us believe.
</P>
<P>
   We do not much care about Bush's wild youth unless it highlights
the hypocrisy of his public policy on illegal drug use. We do not
much care whom Boviard beds down with unless it disrupts the
public's business in a major state agency.
</P>
<P>
   If the favored Republican presidential aspirant snorted coke in
his salad days, he needs to say so and then explain why only the
privileged prep school set gets to sow its wild oats in the rather
more diverse democracy he hopes to lead.
</P>
<P>
   If the state's economic development director had a sexual
relationship with her top aide, she needs to say so and then
explain why she stood by while he tried to intimidate the rest of
her staff, several of whom are lining up to describe witnessed
clutches and threatened retaliation against any employee inclined
to whisper about the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, the ever vigilant guardian of the taxpayers' money,
says he will not demand Boviard's resignation unless there is
certain evidence that she misused public funds. His chief legal
counsel has spent the last several days poring over expense reports
looking for a hotel bill or restaurant receipt that might qualify
as a smoking gun. Boviard, herself, insists she has no intention of
resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Call me old-fashioned, but isn't the abuse of power cause for
dismissal in the public sector anymore?
</P>
<P>
   It would be no one's business in whose arms Boviard sought
comfort during her bitter divorce and custody battle for her two
adopted children were it not for allegations by members of her
staff that the affair disrupted office business and that Shagoury
threatened those who gossiped about the couple with poor
performance reviews.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the director of the office of economic development;
she is. Whatever happened to ``the buck stops here?'' Whatever
threats Shagoury might have made only carried weight because of his
relationship with Boviard, Cellucci's political appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say, ``Bye, Bye, Carolyn,'' Governor?
</P>
<P>
   For decades, women in the workplace who became romantically
involved with the boss were forced to quietly resign when an affair
threatened to compromise the Big Man's career. It was a double
standard then; it is no less of one now when the boss is the one
wearing the skirt.

<P>
   MASHPEE, Mass. _ The yacht-lined inlets of New Seabury exude a
feeling of comfortable, secluded affluence that many vacationers
equate with Cape Cod living at its finest. Indeed, the
development's success has been a high-end complement to the booming
growth that has transformed once-sleepy Mashpee in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   But drive north of the busy Mashpee rotary, past the bustling
commercial center of Mashpee Commons, and another picture emerges.
There, off pine-lined roads that lead into the scrubby heart of
Cape Cod, dozens of families struggle to cobble together a living
that belies the relaxed, suntanned, and surf-splashed image that
the Cape has burnished for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a tiny, termite-troubled cottage, Catherine and Randy
Patterson cook pasta and rice they received from charity, use a
broken-down car for storage space they don't have in their home,
and occasionally collect returnable bottles so that they can buy
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them is employed. Randy, 32, is looking for a job
after being laid off in June from an assembly-line position.
Catherine, 36, stays home to care for a 1-year-old son and
3-year-old daughter whom she cannot afford to put in day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never go out to eat. We never go to the movies. All our
shopping is done at the thrift shop,'' Catherine says. ``Things
have got to get better. They've got to.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Pattersons, and for many others across Barnstable
County, things have gotten worse since the decade began. The most
recent statistics, from 1995, put 8.1 percent of Cape Cod residents
below the federal poverty level, an increase from 7.5 percent in
1990. For a family of four in 1998, that income threshold was
$16,700.
</P>
<P>
   But as more families need help, with everything from food to
fuel to substance-abuse counseling, less funding is available for
human services. This is largely because of the budget-draining
demands of educating the Cape's growing population.
</P>
<P>
   In Mashpee, for example, school spending this decade has risen
to 60 percent of the town's $30 million budget, says state
Representative Nancy J. Caffyn, a Mashpee Republican. By contrast,
she says, human services spending amounts to only $80,000 this
year, or less than one-third of 1 percent of the annual town
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely a critical need, and there has been for a
long time,'' Caffyn says. ``We're supposed to be La-La Land here.
But I think there's a lot of denial on the Cape. We have a lot of
developers and builders who became selectmen, and they don't like
to talk about problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Mashpee appointed its first full-time human
services director in July, the community became only the second
town on Cape Cod to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That director, Louise Patrick, sees a challenging job before
her. A 1998 health-needs assessment by Barnstable County ranked
Mashpee third among the 15 Cape towns in arrests for possession of
controlled substances, fourth in substance-abuse treatment
admissions, and 10th in attendance at self-help sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with rapid growth comes growing pains,'' Patrick says,
which can cause a ``frustrating adjustment and a certain amount of
discomfort.'' Mashpee's population has exploded from 7,200
year-round residents in 1991 to an estimated 12,500 today.
</P>
<P>
   That growth can spawn problems with drugs and alcohol, domestic
abuse, and a compounding of day-to-day stresses as lower-income
families try to make ends meet in a vacationland where the costs of
necessities are routinely higher than they are inland.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Green sees the problems every week at the Mashpee Food
Pantry, where she interviews needy families and dispenses food,
clothing, and even small amounts of cash. Each month brings six to
10 new families up the stairs to her donated office off busy Route
28.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Green said, 131 families, many of them headed by single
parents from abused backgrounds who feel they have nowhere else to
turn, received help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't go to the doctor, to the dentist, they're working
under a lot of stress. A lot of the kids don't have health
insurance,'' says Green, who volunteers her time.
</P>
<P>
   Caffyn, the state representative, says an estimated 30 percent
of Cape Cod residents do not have health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cape Cod's most recent poverty figure of 8.1 percent is
lower than the state level of 9.7 percent, Caffyn says that a
straight comparison is probably misleading. Massachusetts has many
urban areas with high poverty levels that push its rate upward, she
says, and Cape Cod has a disproportionately large number of elderly
residents who do not file income taxes that are used to compute
poverty figures.
</P>
<P>
   A more relevant statistic, Caffyn suggests, might be median
family income.
</P>
<P>
   Mashpee's figure of $34,500, she says, puts the town in the
bottom 20 percent in Massachusetts. Many other communities on Cape
Cod are in similar straits, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Cape Cod through the lens used to distribute state
aid presents a more flattering, but unwarranted, picture, the
lawmaker says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the town's value is used to gauge state aid, a
significant number of wealthy homeowners can increase total dollar
value to a point where it does not reflect the community's typical
family and its needs.
</P>
<P>
   And in Mashpee, there are stark distances between the haves and
the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick says that greater awareness of the town's diversity, and
the social needs that creates, can bring an already-welcoming
community even closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is a lot of income disparity,'' Patrick says,
``people can be isolated in their own area of residence and not
have a lot of awareness of what's going on in other parts of
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing that awareness is part of her job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize we have problems,'' she says, ``but we're also
saying we're going to deal with it.''

DUNKIN' DONUTS WEB GADFLY GAINS A BUYOUT OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn.: Conn.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMDEN, Conn. _ David Felton sits in the neighborhood Dunkin'
Donuts shop, downing his bagel and coffee, and gloating, just a
little.
</P>
<P>
   In his nondescript, preppy clothing, Felton notes that, to the
harried clerks, he's one more in an endless stream of customers.
But to their corporate employers, he's the enemy, a clever Internet
renegade who stood eyeball to eyeball with the fast-food giants,
and made them blink.
</P>
<P>
   Felton, 25, was the force behind a Web site dedicated to gripes
against the Dunkin' Donuts chain. The Web site's address:
www.dunkindonuts.org.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts asked him to stop, but Felton wouldn't budge, and
the complaints kept coming. So when its legal saber rattling
failed, the doughnut chain decided on a time-tested business
strategy: if you can't lick 'em, buy 'em.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Dunkin' Donuts agreed to pay Felton an undisclosed
amount of cash to obtain the rights to the Web site, which grew
from a single gripe he posted on his personal home page.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of the Internet, and _ surprisingly, perhaps,
in this era of faceless national chains _ the power of angry
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically the catalyst to change within the Dunkin' Donuts
system,'' Felton said. ``They can't sweep the problems under the
rug because they're out in the public.''
</P>
<P>
   When Felton created the site two years ago, Dunkin' Donuts, the
Randolph, Mass. fast-food giant with nearly 5,000 stores worldwide,
offered no Internet forum of its own. So thousands of people across
the country began to use Felton's site, to rail against the company
as well as to praise it.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts asked Felton to stop _ first, with a letter, and
later, with the threat of a lawsuit. But the company agreed to a
settlement, and will soon take over the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confused the customers,'' company spokeswoman Jane Powell
said. ``They thought they were contacting the corporate office, and
in reality, they weren't. We can better respond to their comments
when it comes directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Felton said he was willing to settle because Dunkin' Donuts has
set up its own Web site with space for consumer comments _ and
because he didn't want to face the time and cost of an ongoing
legal battle. But not all consumers were pleased with his decision.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after settlement talks were announced, one visitor
lambasted Felton for ``selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone really think DD is going to allow a freewheeling
discussion of its faults on this site after they take over?'' the
visitor wrote. ``What a bunch of weasels you are!''
</P>
<P>
   Felton says he never thought the dispute would make it this far.
He said he didn't expect to become a consumer champion, or make any
money, or become semifamous for battling a fast-food chain. When it
comes down to it, he doesn't even like doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   But he does like coffee with skim milk _ not cream, not whole
milk _ and that's how his story began.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Felton was a regular customer at a Dunkin' Donuts
in Hartford, where he would stop before work. Though a sign in the
window advertised coffee ``your way,'' with four kinds of milk, the
employees told him he couldn't have skim.
</P>
<P>
   Felton was mad, and wanted to vent. So he turned to his personal
Web site, stocked with jokes and pictures of his family, and added
a new page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunkin' Donuts sucks,'' it began. ``Here's why.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained his milk grievance, tacked on a few more
complaints, and figured he was finished. ``I thought nobody would
read it but my friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, a powerful search engine, found Felton's new page and set
up an instant link for people who looked up Dunkin' Donuts and
``consumer opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangers began to visit, Felton said. Others sent him e-mail
with their own gripes about Dunkin' Donuts. Soon, he decided to
post the complaints. And more started coming, nearly 20 per week.
</P>
<P>
   When the traffic grew, Felton decided to create a separate Web
site. He researched Web addresses and discovered that, while
Dunkin' Donuts owned the rights to dunkindonuts.com, the address
dunkindonuts.org was available. He bought it for $70.
</P>
<P>
   The move was legal, said Nicholas Papastavros, a Boston attorney
who specializes in intellectual property and technology. The law
only bars companies from sharing the exact same Web addresses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dunkin' Donuts claimed the site infringed on its
trademarks, Papastavros said criticism tied to a brand name is
generally permitted on the Web. In fact, the Internet is full of
sites devoted to gripes about banks, insurance companies,
department stores, and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Web commerce is rife, as well, with a brand of renegade known as
the ``cybersquatter,'' who scoops up company names and holds them
hostage for high sums. Felton insists that was never his intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to withdraw their offer to pay me and leave me
alone, I would gladly accept that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His site, which included disclaimers spelling out its
independence, has always been devoted to being a public forum, he
said. And when it comes to doughnuts, it turns out, people have a
lot to say.
</P>
<P>
   In May, one woman wrote to ``express my undying love and
gratitude for Dunkin' Donuts.'' In July, an employee warned
customers that ``the jelly filling is disgusting; it sits in the
back all warm. . . . People toss it around, play with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many complained about service, or sour milk, or discontinued
flavors, or franchises that run out of food. Some told the others
to stop complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Felton said he usually gets 50 to 70 visitors per day. Most post
comments between 8 and 11 a.m., around the time of the typical
doughnut run.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want that instant fix,'' he said. ``To a lot of them,
it's therapeutic just to post the message, and they'll say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts has been visiting, too, Powell said, monitoring
the site since its inception and sometimes responding to customers'
complaints. In July 1998, the company sent Felton a letter, calling
the site ``a lively public forum'' but asking him to turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   Felton researched the law and, after consulting a lawyer _ his
father _ decided to stand his ground.
</P>
<P>
   He held firm when a lawyer hired by Dunkin' Donuts threatened a
lawsuit last November. When he first made the offer to sell, he
said the lawyer ``basically chuckled.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the corporate lawyer called back, Felton said. He
wanted to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The original offer was $1,070: the $70 registration fee, plus
the $1,000 Felton had paid a company to host the site. Negotiations
started from there, Felton said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, they reached a deal; as a condition, neither Powell
nor Felton can discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web site remains in operation _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   The company hasn't decided whether to keep posting consumer
complaints, Powell said. On dunkindonuts.com, comments go directly
to the customer service department, but aren't made public.
</P>
<P>
   To Felton, that's an important distinction _ and the beauty of
the Internet. When 52,000 consumers per year complain to a global
audience, he said, change is bound to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``By themselves, they are nobody at Dunkin' Donuts,'' he said of
consumers. But on a Web site, he said, ``they unite. And they force
Dunkin' Donuts to act.''

NOTES HAUNT ULSTER REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ In three decades as a journalist chronicling Northern
Ireland's Troubles, Ed Moloney has written his share of stories
about political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in a case replete with the menacing intrigue that
remains common here despite the ongoing peace process, the veteran
Belfast reporter stands on the brink of becoming a prisoner
himself.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Belfast court will decide whether Moloney should be
jailed for refusing to turn over his notes from an interview with a
loyalist paramilitary figure who admits to supplying the guns used
to kill a Belfast defense attorney, Patrick Finucane, in 1989.
Moloney faces up to five years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go to jail before I turn over my notes. I have no
choice,'' said Moloney, 50, sitting in his Belfast office.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of journalistic principle, he said, but that's not
all. If he turns over his notes, he believes he'll never be able to
work again in Northern Ireland, where sources will rarely disclose
the murky side of politics and paramilitary activity unless they're
assured of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   It also could get him killed.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say Moloney has become a pawn in a politically
charged dispute over reforming Northern Ireland's police force, the
Royal Ulster Constabulary. The former Hong Kong governor, Chris
Patten, is expected soon to issue a report recommending changes in
the force, which is 93 percent Protestant, so that it will command
the respect and confidence of Catholic nationalists who make up
more than 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Finucane's murder _ as he sat eating Sunday
dinner with his wife and children _ stands out as one of the most
controversial of some 3,500 deaths in Northern Ireland over the
last 30 years. There have been persistent allegations that the
police colluded with loyalist hitmen to bump off one of their most
dogged adversaries. Finucane represented Irish Republican Army
suspects, and frequently won acquittals, earning the enmity of both
the police and the IRA's loyalist enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of police collusion grew last March when
Rosemary Nelson, the lawyer who replaced Finucane as the most
successful legal adversary of the police, was herself murdered by a
car bomb planted by loyalists. RUC chief Ronnie Flanagan called in
the deputy chief of London's Metropolitan Police, John Stevens, to
look at not only the circumstances surrounding Nelson's murder, but
the Finucane case as well.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after just two months of work, Stevens's investigators
arrested William Stobie, who as the admitted quartermaster of the
Ulster Defense Association in North Belfast, supplied guns to the
most prolific murderers in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   When he was charged with Finucane's murder, Stobie played his
trump card, proclaiming his innocence and saying that he had worked
as an informer and tried to prevent the murder. Stobie claimed he
had twice warned his police handlers that Finucane was going to be
killed, but they did nothing to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Stobie released Moloney from a
confidentiality agreement they had entered into in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, after detectives had interviewed him about the
Finucane murder and filed weapons charges against him that were
later mysteriously dropped, Stobie decided to put his story on
record in case his police handlers made him the scapegoat and
charged him with the murder. He approached Neil Mulholland, who was
then working for Sunday Life, a Belfast newspaper. He told
Mulholland his sensational story, but made him promise that he
wouldn't print it unless ``something bad happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moloney, who covers Northern Ireland for the Sunday Tribune of
Dublin, said Mulholland told him about Stobie, hoping Moloney might
have better luck getting the story into print. With an introduction
from Mulholland, Stobie agreed to repeat his story to Moloney if he
promised not to print it until Stobie gave the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing he had an explosive story, Moloney tried over the years
to coax Stobie into getting it out ``in a controlled way,'' so
Stobie's life would not be in danger. Stobie refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I gave him my word, I was bound by it,'' said Moloney.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after Stobie was arrested, Moloney's dramatic,
disturbing account about one slice of the dirty war in Northern
Ireland ran across the front page and two inside pages of the
Sunday Tribune. It made riveting reading. It also led detectives
from Stevens's team to Moloney, demanding his notes.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Moloney wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have approached me before, seeking assistance or
material,'' he said. ``You tell them no and that's the last you
hear of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens's investigators were more determined, returning with
a court order demanding Moloney's notes.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and his detectives believe their determination not to
leave any avenue unexplored shows they are serious about getting to
the bottom of the allegations that the police were complicit in the
murder of their most outspoken critics.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland gave a statement to police about his 1990 interview
with Stobie. He later left journalism and is now a press secretary
for the British government's Northern Ireland Office. He is on
vacation and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to squeeze Moloney have been criticized by even
conservative elements of the British press, including The Times of
London, that are usually supportive of the police, while the entire
investigation has been panned by Finucane's family. Geraldine
Finucane says she believes the police probe into her husband's
murder is a smokescreen aimed at avoiding a far-reaching public
inquiry, which under British law would have greater powers of
investigation and get at secrets that can be kept hidden in the
name of national security.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Moloney thinks the police have shot themselves in
the foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rebounded on them in a big way. It's got the back of the
press up and has reopened the case,'' he said. ``Some people would
argue the wrong people are in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Moloney insists his personal safety ranks a distant third to his
concerns about his word and his livelihood, but there is plenty of
evidence that when the men who have waged the war in Northern
Ireland feel they have been double-crossed or insulted in the
press, reporters are in danger. While overt violence was more
common a decade ago, intimidation continues today.
</P>
<P>
   A Belfast tabloid had its offices firebombed, and one reporter
had to flee or face execution after a series of exposes about
loyalists in the 1980s. In 1988, after news organizations turned
over to police photos of a mob that attacked and helped murder two
plainclothes British soldiers who had stumbled into an IRA funeral
cortege, the IRA issued threats against several journalists. They
later fled. Just a few months ago, a reporter had to build a wall
and install cameras at his Dublin home after police warned him that
a loyalist he had written about had threatened to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney said the past refusal of news organizations and
journalists here to take principled stands and risk court action
has turned his case into a cause celebre, but he believes he is
doing ``what any journalist should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past, when the debate about whether journalists
should become information gatherers for the police was largely
ignored, there has been a public show of support for Moloney. His
paper backs him. The National Union of Journalists picketed outside
the courthouse where the case was heard Monday. Human rights
organizations and influential American journalists, including Pete
Hamill and Sydney Schanberg, have signed letters criticizing the
police.

RANKING IS A FACTOID OF LIFE FOR MANY SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harvard and the California Institute of Technology
may exchange good-natured jabs over who belongs at the top of the
US News &AMP; World Report list of best colleges, but for schools
lodged in the middle, the rankings are no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Between backdoor swipes at their competitors, administrators
acknowledged that their schools' reputations can hinge on these
annual rankings. The list hit newsstands this week.
</P>
<P>
   For some lesser-known universities and liberal arts colleges,
inching up in the ranks generally equates to free national
advertising and an opportunity for second looks from prospective
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, there's grumbling. I've heard administrators say
the rankings are fluky or superficial,'' said Carol Schneider,
president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities,
a Washington-based group of more than 700 college and university
presidents. ``But no one wants to grumble too loudly, just in case
their schools do well in the rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 years since US News began ranking the nation's
colleges and universities, school officials have sharply criticized
the magazine but very few have questioned the impact on the number
of applications or campus esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an elephant in your living room that won't go
away,'' said David Gould, director of admissions at Brandeis
University, which was ranked 31st in the category of national
universities. ``It's here to stay, so you have to keep paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis, one of the nation's most difficult schools to get
into, gets overshadowed by other big-name colleges, particularly
Ivy League schools, and that's when the rankings come into play,
according to Gould.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to say the rankings don't matter, shouldn't matter,
but they do for the people who buy the magazine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Colby College in Waterville, Maine, touts on its Web site that
it ranks 18th among national liberal arts colleges, even though
school officials questioned the value of ranking colleges at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, any kind of publicity is important,'' said T. Stephens
Thomas, Colby's director of admissions. ``Harvard can stand on its
own two feet, but other schools can use the help.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospective students often mention the US News rankings on
campus visits, said Karen Foust, director of admissions for
Valparaiso Universit in Valparaiso, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The school's Web site even links to the page in the magazine's
Web site that prominently displays the school's number 4 ranking
among Midwestern universities. Foust said the ranking, combined
with other recruiting efforts, has helped increase interest in the
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know students, parents, and high school guidance counselors
are looking, so we like to show off a little,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Caron, vice president of college relations for Providence
College in Providence, said the magazine's survey helps his school
``stay on people's radar screens.'' Providence was ranked second in
the category of universities in the Northeast. ``People will hear
of the school one way or another, but the rankings do give you a
boost,'' Caron said.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure to come out on top has prompted some schools to
resort to petty tactics, such as fudging admissions figures or
calling the magazine to accuse other schools of playing with their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of tricks that schools can play, and I can
name a few schools who do play it,'' said a university official who
admitted to having cheated in past years.
</P>
<P>
   The official, whose school ranks among the top 50 national
universities, said some colleges omit the lowest SAT scores to
inflate the average test score. Schools can also fiddle with
admission or graduation rates, according to the official, who did
not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it has come down to: a terrible courtship process,
an awful game you have to play,'' the official said. ``Other
schools will tell you the same.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Anne McGrath, managing editor of the Best Colleges
issue for US News, rumors about cheating are unsubstantiated. The
magazine sends reporters to check on accusations that roll into the
office, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always speculation, but it has remained just that _
speculation,'' McGrath said. ``We haven't been able to track down
names of schools yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators, even those who say their schools have benefited
from high rankings, criticized the magazine for fostering a
dog-eat-dog mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine asks the wrong questions,'' said Richard A.
Detweiler, president of Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y., whose
school has declined to give information to the magazine for the
last four years. ``They don't come inside the classrooms, they
don't ask students how they like their schools. I can see how some
schools would be tempted to cheat a little.''

 &HT;    Scrubbed, shined, waxed and buffed: Day at the auto spa can
leave your car feeling as if it just rolled out of the showroom
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My car has always had that lived-in, slept-in,
thrown-a-few-casual-dinner-parties-in look.
</P>
<P>
   This roomy Explorer not only gets me places but also serves as
extra storage and pretty much a den on wheels. Until recently it
also doubled as a second home to my 200-pound English mastiff _ the
ultimate alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit the car hasn't had more than a lick and a
promise as far as washing is concerned since I drove it out here
from California about a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   What better candidate for an article on what to expect when you
have your car detailed?
</P>
<P>
   Before you shell out well over a hundred dollars for one of
these super-duper car cleanings, there are some things you need to
know.
</P>
<P>
   First, you have to prepare your car a bit before its day at the
auto spa. You know how you sort of pick up your house before the
housekeeper comes? Same thing. Remove any personal debris from the
vehicle, so that the detailer has a clear field in which to work.
For most folks that might mean emptying out a few soda cans, maybe
removing an infant car seat and perhaps some straggly bits of
miscellaneous paper. It wasn't quite that simple in my case.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that my Explorer also is a rolling scrapbook of
sorts? When I began cleaning out the interior, I unearthed plenty
of memorabilia from my cross-country trip: a yellowed pamphlet and
map welcoming me to the wonders of the Grand Canyon, a menu from a
little restaurant in the heart of Santa Fe, a handful of matches
snatched from time-worn motels along Route 66 and a few tins that
once held miniature cigars belonging to a friend who used the SUV
as a smoking section.
</P>
<P>
   I gathered up food magazines, a few well-read Vanity Fair
issues, along with a stack of books that obliterated the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   In the back compartment, I scooped out half-empty water bottles,
an unopened can of cat food meant as bait for some feral cats
friends I captured at a local park last winter and a tube of baby
powder-scented dog shampoo wrapped in a couple of towels.
</P>
<P>
   You see, it's not that my vehicle never got near a car wash, but
more often than not, when I went to those do-it-yourself places, it
wasn't the Explorer that received the bath but rather the
Yugo-sized dog.
</P>
<P>
   That reminds me to offer a word of caution to pet owners: Most
of the car detailers I spoke with agreed that the toughest problem
to clean in a vehicle is dog hair.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cole, the owner of California Gold auto detailing, says the
hair gets embedded into the carpet fibers and vacuuming often
doesn't get it all out.
</P>
<P>
   My detailer was not going to be a happy camper.

 &HT;    A lot of elbow grease goes into getting car in showroom shape
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The hard part was done. The interior of the Explorer
was picked clean of clutter and trash. At last, my faithful SUV was
ready for its appointment at the detailing shop.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it didn't look half bad, except for those dried-on
smears from the dog's massive snout covering the rear windshield. I
had deliberately not washed them after sending him off to a
friend's in New Jersey, where he could romp with a hefty Bernese
Mountain dog. Each time I looked in the rearview mirror, those
smears provided little reminders of the big guy.
</P>
<P>
   I selected Avril Auto Boutique &AMP; Detailing Center on Roswell
Road for the long-overdue grooming _ primarily because the location
was handy. But we are a city of cars, and the metro Atlanta area
has no shortage of detailers. You can spot them on nearly every
street corner. The Yellow Page listings fill most of two pages.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I drove up to Avril, someone approached the car and
asked what I needed done. I told him to please detail it, and he
immediately took charge. Within minutes someone was already
kneeling by the tires and had begun scrubbing. All at once,
literally thousands of miles of grime was washed away, and the
wheels were transformed into shiny chrome discs that I hadn't seen
in quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   I watched amazed as a small corps of detailers outfitted in
pumpkin-orange T-shirts with ``Fast lane junkies'' emblazoned on
the back, began hosing down the exterior.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the car was covered in a blanket of thick
white suds that promptly turned the color of 2-week-old snow pushed
on the side of a busy interstate as it slid slowly down the car's
sides.
</P>
<P>
   I was used to the ecru tint the Explorer wore for so long and
had to do a double-take at this stark white vehicle that was
emerging. I could see that my car was in capable hands, so I went
in to find out more details on detailing.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Joffe and his wife, Avril, opened the car wash in 1980.
In addition to the Atlanta location, they have two others, one in
Norcross, (Ga.) and another in Marietta, (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Joffe says waxing is the most critical step you can take to
prolong the life of your car's finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays car companies bake on paint that only gives color,
then a clear coat is applied for shine. Pollutants penetrate the
clear coat if you don't have a good wax _ wax is the only thing
that really protects the clear coat well. You should wax your car
every three to four months,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways car washes take care of that precious
clear coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most car washes use a pH-balanced soap. It loosens the dirt
first so you don't grind it in.''
</P>
<P>
   And on cars that have some extra dirt on them, Joffe uses an
added chemical wash that takes out the extra dirt buildup soap
can't. This allows for a smoother surface on which to apply the
wax. Needless to say, the Explorer received the chemical treatment.
Curious as to the progress on my car, I wandered out to take a
look. Joffe's top detailer, Ha Loi, who's been with Avril for 18
years, squirted a pink blob of wax on the hood. With an electric
buffer he began spreading the wax, leaving behind more shine than
that car's seen since it left the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Once the wax was applied, all the Explorer's doors were opened,
mats were removed and some serious vacuuming took place along with
window cleaning. The floor mats were shampooed and scrubbed with a
brush, then laid out to dry. The crew cleaned and conditioned the
leather seats, shampooed carpets, wiped down the dash and
instrument panel. Door jambs weren't ignored and at one point, Loi
walked around the car with what looked like a fat blush brush and
poked it into every crevice. After a couple more hours, he
pronounced the car finished.
</P>
<P>
   Expect detailing to take anywhere from three to five hours
depending on the size and condition of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was a minor miracle, definitely worth $135. It
really did look new.

<P>
   When I slid in the driver's seat I had the feeling one has upon
entering a model home: It looks perfect but somehow something is
missing. Like a Stepford wife. As I glanced in the rearview mirror
and saw a clear view not marred by those doggy smears, I knew.

 &HT;    We're glad you asked: Your guide to car detailing
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  What's the difference between detailing and washing?
</P>
<P>
   A basic car wash generally includes washing the exterior and
cleaning the wheels and tires. The interior gets vacuumed, windows
washed and dash and console wiped down.
</P>
<P>
   Detailing goes much further. Your car gets an exterior wash, wax
and polish; tires and bumpers are cleaned and dressed; and tar,
road paint and gum are removed. The interior gets shampooed;
leather is cleaned and conditioned. Ashtrays aren't merely emptied
but wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How much can you expect to pay?
</P>
<P>
   For a standard car you can expect to spend anywhere from $110 to
$165. Expect to plunk down a bit more for sport-utility vehicles
and trucks. Tipping is expected; 15 percent is appropriate. It pays
to shop around to get the best deal. Most shops have printed menus
with plenty of options. For instance, if you don't want the engine
steam-cleaned or minor scratches buffed, then say so.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some shops offer pickup and delivery services. But it's
usually just within a few miles. Be sure to ask.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What extras can I get?
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in, we ask them what they're looking for,''
says Kathryn Cole, who owns Decatur's California Gold with her
husband, Sam. ``Do they want to sell the car? Keep it? We can make
the car look like it came off of the showroom if that's what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cole admits that detailing a car doesn't always produce
miracles. She says that some customers think that scratches should
disappear with detailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can feel the scratch with your fingernail, it's too
deep for us to just buff out. And if you paint over it, you'll be
able to see the scratch,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While some detail shops can buff out minor scratches, many
places will contract out the tougher jobs _ at an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   John Guarino, owner of Executive Auto Detailing Centers, uses an
ozone machine that he says removes odors from a car. For more
stubborn odors, he uses a fog system that goes through the air
conditioning system, where much of the smell comes from. Yes, these
services cost extra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently we had a woman who left a watermelon in her car and
we used the fog system to remove the odor.''
</P>
<P>
   While a rotting melon might sound offensive, according to
Guarino, the toughest odors to remove are those caused by our
four-legged friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pet odors are the worst, especially cats,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How do I find a detailer?
</P>
<P>
   Check out the phone book and ask your friends for
recommendations. Check with car dealers, because many don't detail
their cars in-house. Also, your mechanic may be able to refer you
to someone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How often should I get my car detailed?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the detailers I spoke with agreed that you should have
your vehicle detailed twice a year. But remember to wax that car at
least four times per year. Also, many establishments now offer gift
certificates: A perfect gift for the car buff and even more so for
those of us who are a bit lax with their car's hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What if I don't have time to take my car to a detail shop?
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Metro Atlanta boasts plenty of mobile detail shops.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Burger, owner of All American Mobile Detailing, will drive
his van to your home or business (as long as you have a water
outlet).
</P>
<P>
   If your office doesn't have an available water faucet, don't
worry, Mad Wax can handle the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carry all our own water and electricity. We have two trucks
that each carry 110 gallons of water and generators,'' says owner
Marcy Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Mad Max is in the Chamblee area but detailers will travel from
Midtown to Cumming. They also can fax you a menu of their services.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What can I do while I'm waiting for my car?
</P>
<P>
   It helps if the place offers more than a lawn chair and a cranky
soda machine.
</P>
<P>
   Those who value a good cappuccino as much as a clean car can get
both at California Gold in Decatur. Here, owners Sam and Kathryn
Cole provide a meeting place that offers comfortable booths, lively
conversation, gourmet coffee, a variety of pastries and even a hot
dog lunch special.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a fake coffee shop, we're real _ we grind our own
beans,'' says Sam. ``We try to get people to relax while they get
their car clean. This place is for people who appreciate good
coffee and a good car wash.''
</P>
<P>
   At Executive Auto Detailing, you can watch television while
lounging on recliners. But those who like to shop can browse
through Avril's roomy boutique and pick up anything from maroon
sheepskin car covers and custom license frames to key rings and
leather steering wheel covers.

 &HT;    History is at home in `old-fashioned' town
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Ga. _ Mention that you are going to Washington to
shop and everyone thinks you are bound for D.C, which boasts a
plethora of posh boutiques _ not to mention plenty of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. About 103 miles northeast of Atlanta is the charming
little town of Washington in Wilkes County, home to 4,800 residents
and an eclectic collection of shops. History is your constant
companion as you wander into centuries-old brick buildings turned
into boutiques or tour grand 18th- and 19th-century homes on
tree-shaded streets.
</P>
<P>
   With its pretty public square and easy-to-navigate side streets,
the compact town is made for shopping _ and walking. The stores'
merchandise is an interesting mix of the old and the new, the
necessities and the luxuries. For example, you can buy a
modern-looking starburst Swarovski pin ($125) at Tena's Jewelry &AMP;
Gift Shop, try on a chic Sigrid Olsen knit cardigan ($98) at Ye
Olde Dress Shoppe or snag a circa 1875 pine-and-copper bathtub at
Spotted Dog Trading Co. for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   You might even hunt for gold. Legend has it that in 1865, what
was left of the Confederate treasury _ estimated at more than half
a million dollars in gold _ left Richmond. For months, it was moved
from one Southern city to another to protect it from seizure by
Northerners. Washington was the last town to shelter the gold.
Although some of the fortune was captured, speculators like to
think the remainder is buried somewhere in Wilkes County.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Washington is a living museum, since it spans the
decades from Colonial America through antebellum times and the
Victorian era to the present. Formed in 1777, Wilkes was one of
eight original counties in Georgia settled by the English, Scots,
Irish and French. In 1780, a charter was issued for Washington,
named in honor of the first U.S. president. This was confirmed by
him on a visit to Georgia in 1791 as the first city chartered in
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many small towns, Washington has a thriving downtown
commercial district. On a recent Friday, locals as well as visitors
were shopping, chatting and enjoying lunch at Another Thyme, an
upscale cafe on the square. Around the corner, at Judy's Books &AMP;
Beans shop, friends Lynn McLanahan of Athens and Margaret Scurry of
Augusta were buying coffee and fudge. ``Washington is an
old-fashioned town with adorable shops,'' said McLanahan, pushing
her 8-month-old son, Jack, in a stroller. ``Margaret and I always
find different things to buy than we do at home. And it's not that
far from Athens.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping on the sidewalk to chat, resident Mary Jordan sang the
praises of her adopted town. ``I lived in Atlanta for 30-something
years,'' she said, ``and never thought I would love a small town.
Now you can't drag me away.''
</P>
<P>
   People live as well as work in the downtown area, in buildings
turned into studios and apartments. Former Atlantan James Woodall
moved to Washington about four years ago from Buckhead and opened
The Plunder Room, an antiques and collectibles shop on the square.
It's housed in an 1815 building, which is the oldest brick store in
Wilkes County. ``Washington is a hidden gem,'' said Woodall. ``I
wanted to move back to a smaller town. This one is the perfect
size, with plenty of history and charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodall just finished turning the upper floor of his store into
an apartment for himself, furnishing it with antiques from the mid
19th century. He did a major restoration, including rewiring and
plumbing plus a new roof and custom-made period windows. This
apartment, and several others, will be on the 11:30 a.m.-5:30 p.m.
Sept. 25 home tour called The Upper Rooms. Tickets are $7.
Information: 706-678-7760.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for more development in downtown Washington will be
the $2.2 million restoration of the 1898 Fitzpatrick Hotel on the
square. A project of Alpharetta developer Walter McGill, the hotel
will contain a restaurant and piano bar, 10 bed-and-breakfast
suites, an Athens Tech satellite campus plus one- and two-bedroom
apartments. It's slated to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the opening of the hotel space, more people can live and
enjoy our downtown,'' said Sandy White, executive director of
Washington Tourism. ``Right now, we have about six families living
in and around the square. And many more are renovating buildings
for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like to tell people, `Washington is a great place to
live, but if you can't do that, come for shopping or a visit.'
Instead of visiting another place, why not visit another era?''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-20 east to Greensboro (Exit 53). Take a
left onto Ga. 44 east and head into Greensboro. At the light, go
right on Ga. 44. Continue for seven miles to Union Point. Still on
Ga. 44, take a left at the underpass. The road then takes a right.
Follow it for 24 miles to Washington. Take a right onto Robert
Toombs Avenue (U.S. 78). This takes you into downtown Washington.
About a two-hour drive from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Free parking around the square, also parallel street
parking and lots on West Robert Toombs Avenue and Jefferson Street.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Stores are generally accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Public restrooms open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Fridays
at the Courthouse on Public Square and in the Chamber of Commerce
office, 104 E. Liberty St. Plans are in the works to have public
restrooms open on the weekends.

</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Maynard's Manor: If you've always wanted to stay in an
antebellum Southern mansion, here's your chance. Built in 1820, the
white-pillared bed-and-breakfast inn with six rooms and private
baths was completely redecorated last year. Feet hurt after a day
of shopping? Relax on the front porch and enjoy complimentary wine
and hors d'oeuvres. And after dinner at a Washington restaurant,
walk back to the inn, and owners Louise and Ross Maynard will ply
you with a homemade dessert, perhaps Jack Daniel's pecan pie or a
Key lime pie. The next morning you can enjoy a gourmet breakfast,
feasting on strawberry crepes, bacon and fresh fruit. Smoke-free
rooms are $85-$125. No children under 12. 219 E. Robert Toombs Ave.
706-678-4303; www.kudcom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also recommended: Some of these bed-and-breakfasts are within
easy walking distance of downtown; others require a short drive:
Blackmon-Wingfield, 512 N. Alexander Ave. 706-678-2278; Hill &AMP;
Hollow Farm, 2090 Thomson Road, 706-678-4439; Holly Ridge Country
Inn, 2221 Sandtown Road, 706-285-2594; The Cottage at Poplar
Corner, 210 W. Liberty St., 706-678-2453, and Wisteria Hall, 225 E.
Robert Toombs Ave., 706-678-7779 or 770-993-4633.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When doing serious shopping, it's not difficult to work up an
appetite. A good choice for lunch or dinner is Another Thyme (5 E.
Public Square, 706-678-1672), located in a renovated 1895 yellow
brick building. The cheerful exterior extends to the service, while
the food is contemporary with touches of Southern. For lunch, the
chicken salad ($6.75) is a winner, as are any of the sandwiches,
including barbecued pork, a grilled chicken pita or a BLT
($5.50-$5.75). Save room for the homemade peach ice cream ($2.25),
which is served in an edible waffle bowl. At night, entrees range
from lightly breaded catfish ($10.95) to marinated shrimp ($14.95)
and fresh salmon fillet ($12.95). Hours: 11 a.m.-2 p.m. and 6-9
p.m. Mondays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Other dining spots to try: Elaine's Kitchen, 521 Whitehall St.
(706-678-3082). This casual restaurant serves up hoagies
($2.49-$2.89) as well as burgers ($2-$3.50), hot wings (six for
$2.50), chicken livers (six for $2.25) and rib sandwiches ($3).
Hours: 8 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays; 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Fridays; 10
a.m.-7 p.m. Saturdays. The Home Cafe of Washington (1001 North
By-Pass East, 706-678-2231) bills itself as ``specializing in
home-cooked meals and fresh vegetables.'' Items run the gamut, from
a BLT ($2.25) or fried chicken ($6.95) to a 12-ounce T-bone steak
($10.95). Hours: 6 a.m.-2 p.m. and 5-9 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   The large number of antebellum and Victorian homes make the town
of Washington a wonderful place to take walking or driving tours.
If you have a history buff in the family, stop by any of its three
museums: the Washington Historical Museum, the Robert Toombs House
State Historic Site and 1869 Callaway Plantation. The latter is the
setting for the 19th annual Mule Day _ a celebration of plantation
life _ on Oct. 9. You'll get a kick out of watching kids' mule
plowing contests; mules judged in various classes on appearance
with harnesses or hitched to wagons. Also, there will be sheep dog
herding contests and ample opportunity to watch basketweaving,
candlemaking, blacksmithing and weaving. Food and music on tap as
well. 9 a.m.-4 p.m. $5; $3 children 7-12; free 6 and under.

 &HT;    Where can I find it?

<P>
   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But due to the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Write us at Buyer's Edge Find It, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us

<P>
   Q: I can't find Lee Kum Kee's sweet &AMP; sour sauce. Please help
me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kay Pascale, Duluth
</P>
<P>
   A: Since 1888, Lee Kum Kee's Sweet &AMP; Sour Sauce has been gracing
tables all over the world. We found our 8.5-ounce bottle ($1.69) at
the International Farmers Market, 5193 Peachtree Industrial Blvd.,
Chamblee (770-455-1777). This product, according to the
manufacturer, ``is a great dipping sauce for spring rolls and
deep-fried appetizers.'' It can also be used in recipes for
sweet-and-sour chicken (recipe is on the bottle) or pork.
</P>
<P>
   Added perks: The sauce contains no MSG and no preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was young, we had adjustable metal pants frames that
we would insert into pants after they were washed. After drying,
the pants did not need pressing. Any ideas where to find them?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann C. Keely,
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: No longer will you have to sweat over an ironing board trying
to get those pants creases just right. Easy-to-use pants stretchers
save time and effort. Simply wash your pants, then slip a stretcher
into each leg and adjust to a snug fit. Presto! Once dry, your
pants will have a just-ironed look. You can use them for jeans,
cords or chinos. The rust-resistant steel stretcher fits most adult
sizes. A set of two stretchers ``presses'' one pair of pants. One
stretcher is $7.95. If you order two or more stretchers, the price
is $7.50 each. From Home Trends catalog: 1-800-810-2340.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Max Factor cosmetics gone out of business? I am
especially looking for their foundation Colour and Light. I have
been to many places but can't find their products anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carol Sellers, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Another Max Factor request: I am unable to find Stay Put Base by
Max Factor. It comes in a lipstick case and was always available in
all the drugstores. For the last three months, it hasn't been on
the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Renee Savage, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Yet another request: I am trying to locate Max Factor's Super
Lash Mascara with the comb/brush applicator. The last place I found
it was Wal-Mart. Is the product discontinued?
</P>
<P>
   _ Lou McClain, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Although Max Factor is still in business, many of its
longtime products have been discontinued. Since 1991, Max Factor
has been owned by Procter &AMP; Gamble Cosmetics, which owns Cover Girl
and Oil of Olay. Three years ago, according to spokeswoman Cheryl
Hudgins, the company did an evaluation of the cosmetics and found
that 80 percent of sales came from 20 percent of the products. The
company decided to focus on the top sellers and discontinue the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   However, there have been replacements for some of your
favorites. The 2000 Calorie Waterproof Mascara ($5.62) takes the
place of Super Lash Mascara. Lasting Performance Foundation ($9.20)
replaces Colour and Light Foundation. Unfortunately, there is no
substitute for Stay Put Base. Max Factor Cosmetics are available in
drugstores and mass-marketing retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a friend who just bought a new home and does not have
built-in toilet paper holders in his bathrooms. For a housewarming
gift, he wants a free-standing holder. I can't locate one. Can you
please help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kirsten Cantley, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You have several options for the housewarming gift. The
Lillian Vernon catalog has a free-standing, chrome-brushed
stainless steel toilet tissue holder (left) that goes with most
bathroom decors. For easy paper refills, the scroll-design holder
on top has a plastic snap-in bar. The 22 3/4-inch-high holder,
which resists rust and moisture, has a weighted base. It easily
screws together to assemble. $34.98. To order: 1-800-285-5555.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Depot Expo Design Center, 1201 Hammond Drive N.E., also
offers free-standing models. Gato makes a basic stand with a
traditional base, in white, chrome or brass ($39.87). Polder offers
an all-chrome stand with magazine holder ($26). For a more
decorative look, Stylebuilt makes a brushed-metal holder with
scrollwork accents ($64.95). Information: 770-913-0111
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please help me find any merchant in or around Atlanta who
sells Bachman's Pretzel Stix _ the best I have ever eaten. Package
size is not important, but I prefer reasonably small boxes of these

   A: Start eating your favorite snack. We found Bachman's pretzels
at Costco, 645 Barrett Parkway, Kennesaw (770-794-3362). The
pretzels are $3.89 for 24 1-ounce boxes. Costco is a wholesale
membership club; cost to join is $40, which includes a free spouse
card. You can also order the pretzels from Bachman, 1-800-523-8253,
and ask for their retail store. Sixty 1-ounce boxes are $12 plus
shipping and handling.

   TROOP-WITHDRAWAL (Washington) _ Under pressure from the Pentagon
and Republicans in Congress to reduce military commitments
overseas, the administration plans to withdraw the last 400
American troops stationed in Haiti, even though peace there remains
tenuous at best. The Pentagon is also pushing for other troop
reductions, including a sharp cut in Americans in Bosnia and a
pullout from the U.N. mission in the Sinai. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   WARCRIMES-ARREST (The Hague) _ Austrian police seized the
current chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army on Wednesday, the
most senior Bosnian Serb detained on orders of the U.N. war crimes
tribunal. Gen. Momir Talic was in Vienna for a military conference
unaware that U.N. prosecutors had secretly charged him with the
persecution and expulsion of Muslims and Croats in northwestern
Bosnia in 1992 when he was a corps and regional commander. By
Marlese Simons.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   GAY-LAWMAKER (Phoenix) _ A young conservative state legislator
has triggered one of the more unusual investigations under
President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy toward
homosexuals in the military. He spoke in the state legislature, not
as a Republican, a Mormon, or a soldier, but as an openly gay man,
denouncing an anti-gay bill under consideration and its right-wing
sponsor. This not only angered some conservatives in his party, but
resulted in a military investigation that may result in his
discharge from the Army Reserve. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   SD-WHITE-ATTACK (Martin, S.D.) _ A white man beaten and left for
dead with a rope around his neck was found near an Indian

   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SKY-MYSTERY (Undated) _ The mystery object that has
confounded astronomers for three years has been identified,
astronomers announce. New spectral readings taken at the Keck
telescope in Hawaii show it is a type of broad-absorption quasar,

nature. By John Noble Wilford.

of less than 1 percent. Every major category posted sizable gains.
While the data are notoriously volatile, those looking for evidence
of a slowdown in economic growth may be disheartened by the
broad-based nature of the July rise. A trade group, meanwhile,
reports that sales of existing homes declined in July.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ A neighborhood group based on the
West Side of Chicago, the Greater West Town Development Project,
has trained dozens of former welfare recipients for an unusual job:
making musical harps. ``We turn out the best harps in the world _
with former welfare mothers,'' said Tom Berry, the plant manager.
``They've worked out terrifically.'' And there lies a message both
optimistic and sobering about the next stage of welfare reform.
Greater West Town provides a workable model for putting welfare
recipients on an upward economic escalator. And yet Greater West
Town's highly interventionist model is one that cannot be easily
replicated. By Michael M. Weinstein.
</P>

   MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The daily Marketplace column.
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE-OIL-DUMP (Undated) _ The chief executive of Royal
Caribbean travels to Alaska to try to stem the fallout from charges

</P>
<P>
   SEASIA-BANKS (Singapore) _ Banking scandals have been rippling

   CAPISTRANO-MISSION (San Juan Capistrano, Calif.) _ Perched on a
scaffold five stories above the ground, Gerald J. Miller surveys
the crumbling mortar and flaking brick, the jagged six-inch cracks
and the scars of swallows' nests dotting the underside of a sagging
stone dome, and marvels aloud, ``You wonder what the hell is
holding this up.'' Quickly and ruefully, he answers himself, ''It's
held up by faith alone.'' Miller is the administrator of Mission
San Juan Capistrano, the landmark relic long known as the jewel of
California's 21 Spanish-Colonial missions, and it is his job to
make sure that what he calls ``the most important ruin in North
America'' is soon held up by a whole lot more. By Todd S. Purdum.

SAN FRANCISCO _  COLLEGE EATS  _ A quiet revolution is simmering on
the steam tables of America's college dining halls. Dining halls
are evolving into food courts and restaurants, offering fresh and
appetizing food. &HT;    But college students aren't biting. Although they say in surveys
they want salads and stir-fries, they're still eating pizza and
french fries. And many find that the pressures of school coupled
with erratic schedules and changing self-image lead to weight gain
or to eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia.
 &HT;    Main story, two sidebars (tips for parents and students, what's
in and out among campuses), two student accounts of their college
food experiences).

BERKELEY, Calif. _ &UR; CLASSIC-I-House &LR;  _ After the success of an
International House that opened in 1924 in New York City,
philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. gave $1.8 million in 1928
which started the International House at University of California
at Berkeley. From the outset, it was a community; shared meals were
an integral part. Today the majority of residents are graduate
students, plus a few visiting scholars.

It can be a great magnet for making new friends. And one of the
best ingredients for a beginner to keep on hand is long-grain white
rice.

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; BOOK PANISSE  &LR; _ There were rave reviews three
years ago when Alice Waters' sixth cookbook, ``Chez Panisse
Vegetables,'' (HarperCollins, 1996) was published. Many cooks and
critics felt the work _ solid and imaginative, personal yet widely
appealing _ could not be topped.
</P>
<P>
   But Waters and crew have done it again. ``Chez Panisse Cafe
Cookbook,'' due in bookstores within the next week, is the most
accessible yet. This book, is more than a collection of recipes and
reminiscences. It is a testament to a holistic way of looking at
cooking, and it radiates with the author's most vital ingredient _
a passion for food.

 CHRON  
 They're Off to College: Choosing what and how much to eat
becomes  a afreshman survival skill   By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  A quiet revolution is simmering on the steam
tables of America's college dining halls.
<P>
   Industrial-sized cooking kettles are giving way to
individualized wok stations. Cafeterias are being remodeled to
resemble food courts and restaurants. Tortillas and rice are served
alongside sliced bread and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some dining halls deliver late-night pizzas from wood-burning
ovens. Others, like those at the University of California at Davis,
encourage students to submit their favorite family recipe so it can
be prepared for the whole school.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Bay Area's best food professionals are pitching in.
Chef-instructors from the Culinary Institute of America's Greystone
campus have started teaching university cafeteria cooks to break
away from oversized pans of muddy beef stroganoff and instead cook
vibrantly flavored couscous, Thai curry and vegetarian lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   But a big hurdle stands in the way of all this change _ college
students themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many aren't joining the campus culinary revolution. Although
they say in surveys they want salads and stir-fries, they're still
eating pizza and french fries. And many find that the pressures of
school coupled with erratic schedules and changing self-image lead
to simple weight gain or more severe eating disorders like anorexia
and bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen in particular often make poor eating choices. Away from
diets regulated by family meals and facing a more sedentary,
competitive and stress-filled routine, they find solace on the
cafeteria line. They have unlimited access to 24-hour ice cream
machines, trays of bacon and burgers and as many french fries as
they care to eat at one sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Staner, 22, a mass communications student at the
University of California at Berkeley, gained 10 pounds her freshman
year. She attributes the gain to two things: too many visits to a
doughnut bar at breakfast and eating the same, mostly starchy diet
almost every meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I went to dinner with my roommate and friend and they
just laughed because I was eating what I ate almost every day: a
salad with dressing on the side, pasta with butter and cheese and a
giant bowl of Lucky Charms.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students use food to combat homesickness and a sense that
they're losing control of their lives, and often develop eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``College is an emotional pressure cooker for a lot of students
and they don't realize how fast eating can get away from you,''
says Sharlene Hesse-Biber, an author and Boston College sociologist
who specializes in nutrition and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use food as a way to comfort them or to control things
in a world where they can't control anything else. Pair that with
the pressures of college and you've got a charged situation for
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of serious eating disorders for college-age women _
and experts say the overwhelming majority of affected students are
women _ range from 1 percent for anorexics to as much as 15 percent
for bulimics.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Applegate, a professor at UC Davis, teaches beginning
nutrition to about 2,000 freshman every year. Overeating and eating
disorders such as anorexia and bulimia aren't uncommon at the
campus of 24,000 students, she says, because young people simply
don't have the tools to take care of their own eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them come out of families where they were not sitting
down for meals. Suddenly they find themselves sitting with dorm
buddies and overeating because they're spending more time at the
table,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In response, some schools offer special classes designed to
teach incoming students how to handle their newfound freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students go off to college, one of the first things they
demonstrate is that they can make choices. But they usually realize
that they make some dumb choices,'' says George Chang, a nutrition
professor at the University of California at Berkeley who teaches a
freshman survival skills seminar. ``The dorm cannot cook like
everybody's mother, so it is up to the student to control what he
eats.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Anderson, who is starting her junior year at the
University of California at Santa Barbara, left a family kitchen
where healthy cooking was the norm. She tried to eat healthy her
freshman year, but still gained 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have a grilled chicken breast sandwich like every day,''
she said. ``I think drinking has a lot to do with it. I didn't
drink in high school but when you go away to school you drink a
lot, especially when you're a freshman. That, and no exercise, hurt
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities combat the problem through a mix of
revamped menus and renovated dining halls along with counseling and
programs that emphasize nutrition. Almost every campus displays the
calories and fat grams of dishes being served. Student health
centers have counselors specially trained in treating eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   At some schools, cafeteria workers are trained to recognize
students who might have a problem associated with food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers watch for certain eating patterns,'' says Juliane
Kiehn, director of campus dining services at the University of
Missouri-Columbia and the recent past president of the National
Association of College and University Food Services (NACUFS).
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone comes in and all they ever get is raw salad, we
might note that. Another tip would be someone who comes in and gets
five doughnuts, six cookies, a bowl of cereal and two glasses of
chocolate milk and takes a long time to eat it. If that happens
repeatedly, we'll pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Although all of this sounds grim, university dining hall
managers say students are slowly becoming more interested in
healthier eating. And today's freshman class is more ethnically
diverse with more sophisticated tastes, making it easier to
introduce improved styles of eating.
</P>
<P>
   Requests for vegetarian options are on the rise. At the
University of California at Santa Cruz, some 20 percent of the
3,000 students eating at campus dining halls identify themselves as
vegan or vegetarian. About six years ago, dining hall managers
there began creating vegetarian dishes but used lots of cheese. The
students complained about the fat, says Elise Levinson, who is in
charge of the food program at the school, and the recipes have
since been refined. Using a recipe exchange on the Internet, the
food service staff secured innovative recipes for vegetarians and
vegans that feature soy products like tempeh and tofu. ``Now we
have a vegan brownie that is fabulous,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Among other examples of the new approach to campus dining:
</P>
<P>
   _ For the first time, a dining hall at UC Berkeley will be open
until midnight to accommodate students' erratic eating schedules.
Other menus feature smoothies, quesadillas and stir-fried dishes
made in small batches. The executive chef, who strolls through the
dining room in his toque, will offer cooking demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   _ At UC Santa Cruz, popular dishes are sushi and ``casserettes''
_ individual casseroles heated just before serving so the top is
browned and bubbly. The school also has a student pizza cooperative
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   _ A staff dietitian is available to meet individually with
students at UC Davis, where tabletop cards explore food-related
topics like the USDA food pyramid or fat in food. Davis also offers
theme meals based on different foods, such as Pacific Rim cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such innovations, change isn't easy at college campuses.
Many are saddled with staff who lack the skills to cook smaller,
healthier and more flavorful dishes and with old kitchens designed
for industrial-strength cooking. Many don't even have gas burners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have people who have been making the same rice and
broccoli for 20 years, and they're scared of cooking new things
like couscous or rice noodles or even tamales,`` says CIA
chef-instructor Lars Kronmark, who worked with NACUFS to create a
program that teaches university chefs new ways to cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opening statement when I talk to them is always, `Why can
you go down the street and get a very good dish of noodles and
asparagus with an Asian sauce, but you come back here to campus and
get soggy pasta with snow peas that aren't green anymore?' '' he
says. ``Students know good food today, so you have to cook so they
will eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if every college kitchen in the country put out
perfectly prepared, healthy food, students would still go for the
comfort, ease and indulgence of fried, starchy foods, many
university food service directors agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the option for healthier food even though they might
not take it,'' says the University of Missouri's Kiehn. ``We'd have
a rebellion if we took burgers and fries off the menu.''

BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Survival Tips for Parents and Students &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Kim Severson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Eating healthy at college isn't impossible, but it takes some work.
The following tips for parents and students is based on interviews
with college nutritionists, dietitians, psychologists and
California college students who survived the freshman year:
</P>
<P>
   _ Accept the fact that dorm food is not going to be as good as
home cooking. Try to focus on the variety of choices and find
dishes that you like and provide some nutritional value.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't eat meals while you study. Set aside a separate time to
eat so you can enjoy your food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rent a mini-refrigerator for your dorm room and stock up on
healthy fruit juices and nonfat milk for quick breakfast drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a water pitcher with a filter so you alway have plenty of
drinking water in your room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have on hand plenty of small, crunchy snacks: pretzels,
vegetables, popcorn, rice cakes and the like. Also, have some
heartier food like canned tuna, dried fruit, protein bars, cereal
and fresh fruit that can serve as a quick breakfast or lunch.
You'll be less likely to pick up the phone and order that
late-night pizza.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you don't want to go to the dining hall, find out if your
dorm has a kitchen. Most do, even if they're only equipped with
toaster ovens and microwaves. Often, it's easier and healthier to
prepare a frozen, low-calorie meal than turn to fast food, take-out
pizza or vending machine snacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since physical education class is no longer required, get some
other exercise. Take the stairs, use the campus gym or recreation
center, walk to new parts of campus.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ Watch what you drink. Beers pack calories _ lots of them _ not
to mention other side effects. Soda consumption can add up, too.
Most sugared sodas have about 150 calories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get up early enough to eat breakfast. Your brain works better
when it's burning glucose. Eating breakfast will also help you
avoid making unhealthy food choices later in the day. Try to eat
dinner at a regular time.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you do end up ordering a late-night delivery, get
vegetarian pizza instead of pepperoni. And don't order extra
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to find a dining plan that allows students to pay for what
they eat, rather than one that allows unlimited access to the
cafeteria. It keeps students from feeling pressure to eat more, and
allows them to think more carefully about what they are choosing.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you feel your eating habits are out of control _ that
you're eating too much or not enough _ get professional help.
Counselors are available at guidance centers or health centers on
every campus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents should be gentle when dealing with a students who are
gaining or losing weight. Don't tell them they look terrible when
they come home from Thanksgiving 15 pounds heavier or lighter.
Instead, talk to your children about their diet and focus on
feelings, not looks. And listen first. Don't try to immediately fix
whatever problem is causing the weight gain or loss.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relax. In most cases, students settle into reasonable eating
patterns by spring semester.

 &UR; Gaining and Losing _ Students Recount Their Struggles With Food &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Editor's note: &LR;  In the first few months of college, eating can &LR; 
 &LR; easily get out of control. Some students gain weight. Others &LR; 
 &LR; develop eating disorders such as anorexia. Here are accounts &LR; 
 &LR; from two Chronicle interns who struggled with food and share &LR; 
 &LR; their stories. &LR;

 &UR; Partying and fast food conspire to add pounds &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Pervaiz Shallwani &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  It was a freshman year of mammoth proportions _
well, at least 25 extra pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After being brought up on a diet of home-cooked food with plenty
of spice _ from Indian curry to Mexican fajitas _ and little salt
and grease, I found the food during my first few weeks at the
University of Missouri was incredibly boring.
</P>
<P>
   When I entered the university in 1995, the dormitory food was
like an endless bad buffet, with overcooked pasta and cold,
dried-out macaroni and cheese. Even the new and innovative stir-fry
line looked more like the food you see in jailhouse cafeterias on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I survived on a daily diet of Crispex for breakfast
and red Jell-O and iceberg lettuce salad with sunflower seeds,
raisins and Italian dressing for lunch and dinner. Every once in a
while there was the chicken stew which, with a lot of pepper,
actually tasted good.
</P>
<P>
   Dorm food led me to supplement my diet with afternoon lunches at
the campus Burger King, Pizza Hut or Chick-fil-A, where at least
the food had flavor. I also indulged in greasy happy hour
appetizers combined with hearty servings of Bud, Bud Light,
Killian's Red or any other pitcher of beer on special, and 2 a.m.
gatherings of dorm rats for 20-inch pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Fridays and Saturdays were something to look forward to, walking
downtown to the local Cajun, Chinese or Thai restaurant or even the
local brew pub.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining weight was inevitable. It's part of the college
lifestyle. You are no longer an active high school teenager; you're
a young adult with barely enough time to keep up with classes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a completely new cycle when you get to campus. Eating meals
at the same time everyday is no longer the case. And there is no
more gym class or track practice. For many students, a workout
means lifting beer bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Moving out of the dorms felt like a release from the
penitentiary. Finally, an apartment with a stove, a good-sized
refrigerator and storage space for dried and canned foods and yes,
spices _ everything from minced garlic to chile powder.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery shopping twice a month became a highlight for me, and
cooking from a cookbook and supermarket recipes became what I
looked forward to most evenings.
</P>
<P>
   There were leftovers for snacking, along with the opportunity to
have dinner parties, plan meals with my roommates or girlfriend and
invite friends over for Thanksgiving turkey and potluck side
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The weight was still there, but at least the food was healthier
and tasted better.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, I might change some of my eating habits that led
to the extra pounds. If I were to relive my freshman year, I'd
force myself to go to the student recreation center everyday if
only for a 20-minute jog. And I'd stay away from the late-night
feasts and snacks between meals.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
 &UR; Fear, need for control lead to anorexic behavior &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Elizabeth Brubaker &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  I grew up in a family that used food as a reason
to come together, a way to celebrate and express emotion. Maybe
that's why, when my life went spinning out of my grasp during my
second year in college, I quit eating. If I could exert power over
something as significant as food, then I could feel in control.
</P>
<P>
   When I first left home in Illinois for the University of
Virginia I was scared, excited and eager. At first I was homesick,
but I soon got over it, and was exhilarated by the wealth of new
experiences that I found waiting for me on the other side of
timidity. There were clubs to join and people to meet. College was
what I expected.
</P>
<P>
   But by the second semester of that first year, the novelty had
worn off. Despite myriad opportunities, I had not yet found a
niche, and I felt at loose ends. I didn't fit into the wild
fraternity party scene, but I felt anti-social if my life got too
quiet. I had started dating my first serious boyfriend and I
enveloped myself in that relationship because it was easier than
trying to branch out. When I wasn't with my boyfriend, I was
studying. If I couldn't be the quintessential party animal I would
be the quintessential good student.
</P>
<P>
   But my first summer home I realized I was still unsettled in my
college life. Walling myself off with books hadn't been the answer.
I vowed that the next year I would change everything.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to do it all _ academics and a social life and lots of
extra-curriculars. And I wanted to look good while I was doing it.
So my entire focus the summer before I headed back for my sophomore
year was losing the weight _ a paltry five pounds _ I had gained
from late-night pizzas, beer and the obligatory essay-writing bags
of pretzels. I ran five times a week and ate mostly fruits and
vegetables. At 5'8'', I went from 130 pounds to 122 in two months.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I was becoming obsessed, but I simply couldn't stop
dieting. The thought of eating any fat scared me to death. One
night, I completely fell apart when my mother added a minute amount
of oil to my dinner vegetables. I yelled at her for being
insensitive, telling her that I had tried so hard all summer to
lose weight and now I would just get fat again. I looked forward to
going back to UVA where I could starve without anyone looking over
my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to school, my first step toward my new self was
to break up with my boyfriend. I approached my social life feeling
like I had a moral obligation to have fun. I felt guilty if I chose
not to go out. I tried out for three singing groups and the elite
University Guide Service. I volunteered at a day care and joined
the university model United Nations. I tackled my studies with the
same resolve, not wanting my grades to slip from the straight A's I
earned when I did nothing but study.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for my plans to fall apart. I was way too
busy but I still felt I wasn't doing enough. I felt guilty, thought
I was a failure and I was overwhelmingly homesick.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I kept losing weight. It was the one thing I felt I
could excell at.
</P>
<P>
   I constantly thought about eating. A day's food would be a bagel
with fat-free cream cheese for breakfast, a banana and a can of
green beans for lunch and a tortilla with vegetables for dinner. I
knew that a mushroom has three calories and a peach 40, and I would
add up how many calories I had eaten on the pages of my notebooks
during lectures. I allotted myself a scant 1,000 calories a day.
</P>
<P>
   If I planned to go out to dinner with friends where I couldn't
starve myself inconspicuously, I would compensate by skipping
breakfast and eating a handful of celery sticks for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this routine, I still loved the idea of food and the
culture that went with it. I read cookbooks and fantasized about
meals I could cook for other people. I even started to play with
the idea of going away to cooking school the next year.
</P>
<P>
   By October I had dropped to 117 pounds and a size 4. And I was
still losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I couldn't change my behavior, some survival
instinct must have kicked in. Maybe it was that I was so miserably
unhappy, and common sense told me obsessive eating habits couldn't
be helping. But I still didn't think I was anorexic. I just thought
I had the beginning of a problem. However, I was scared enough to
go see the school's nutritionist right before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   That first visit with the nutritionist opened my eyes. She
tapped into my unending mental struggle. When she asked me to talk
about what my eating habits were and how they made me feel, I burst
into tears.
</P>
<P>
   During that visit, the nutritionist convinced me to go into
therapy, which I planned to start after Christmas. When I left UVA
for Christmas vacation with my family in San Francisco, I weighed
113 pounds and bought my first pair of size 2 jeans.
</P>
<P>
   During that vacation, even as I refused to be a part of my
family's holiday food traditions, I decided to go to the California
Culinary Academy instead of going back to UVA. It gave me something
to look forward to, but that passion for food still belonged to an
entirely separate part of me from my anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   I started therapy when I returned from winter break, but it
wasn't enough. I wanted my good intentions to make me well without
actually having to take the hard step of eating again. My
perception of how the rest of the world eats was so skewed that
when I felt like I was gorging myself I was barely eating enough to
get through the day, let alone enough to gain weight.
</P>
<P>
   That spring I hit my rock-bottom weight of 108 pounds. My doctor
and my counselor told me that if I got any thinner I would be
hospitalized and I wouldn't be able to go to culinary school the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time I realized that what I looked like simply
wasn't important enough to me to let it jeopardize my future. At
that point I managed to turn all the willpower it had taken for me
to starve myself into the will to get on with my life. Even now,
when I think back on it, I feel a knot of determination grow inside
me.
</P>
<P>
   I left school for two weeks and went home to take charge of my
health with the help of my parents. It was the beginning of a
healing process that has spanned 11/2 years, two cities, two
therapists and more love and understanding from my friends and
family than I will ever be able to repay.
</P>
<P>
   Culinary school taught me to love food in the way that I always
yearned to _ surrounded by healthy people with that same passion.
Now I relate to food as a source of pleasure and fulfillment rather
than as something to control out of fear of losing control all
together.
</P>
<P>
   I am returning to UVA for my senior year and am looking forward
to it. In fighting my battle, I have found a perspective from which
I think I can be happy there. Life, and college, only happen to us
once, and I want to enjoy them both. With that in mind, I plan to
embrace who I am and let that be my success.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Favorite Cellars in the Sky  &HT;        By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; If you're a frequent air traveler who bemoans the
quality of on-board wine, Business Traveller International magazine
wants you to know that all is not lost.
<P>
   You just have to be more selective about your airline _
specifically, forget about U.S. carriers if you're a wine lover. In
its August issue, BTI tells which airline has the best wine lists
and what are traveler's favorite wines.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the story is BTI's 10 Best Cellars in the
sky. The tasting panel sampled 185 wines served in business class
aboard 38 airlines, selecting the 10 best sparkling, white and red
wines. The panel of 22 tasters, mostly members of the East Coast
wine trade, showed a particular liking for French and Italian
wines. Wines from California, Australia and Chile didn't show as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In order, these are BTI's 10 Best Cellars: Finnair, TAM, Air
Canada, Virgin Atlantic, Japan Airlines, China Airlines, KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines and Qantas (tied), Sabena, EVA Airways and Martinair
Holland. Not one U.S. carrier made the cut, but then American
Airlines and Alaska Airlines, both with good wine programs, did not
participate in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The BTI tasters rated Piper-Heidsieck NV Brut as the top
Champagne and/or sparkling wine. All but one of the Top 10 bubblies
are Champagnes, including Charles Heidsieck 1990, Pol Roger 1990
and Laurent-Perrier Grand Si &LR; e &LR; cle NV La Cuvee. The lone sparkling
wine is Deutz Marlborough NV Cuvee from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   All but three of the top 10 white wines are French, with Domaine
La Grappe d'Or 1997 Pouilly Fum &LR; e &LR;  rated as the best. The nonFrench
exceptions are Selaks 1998 Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand and two
whites from South Africa _ Neil Ellis 1998 Sauvignon Blanc and
Stellenzicht 1997 Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Lynch-Bages 1992 was chosen as the best red wine. The
popular French Bordeaux joined four other French reds in the top 10
red wine category. Other top reds include Lindemans 1997 Bin 45
Cabernet Sauvignon (Australia), Deutschkreutz-Ried 1997 Zweigelt
(Austria), Cune Rioja 1990 Imperial Gran Reserva (Spain) and four
from Italy _ Villa Antinori 1995 Chianti Classico Riserva, Marzieno
Vino da Tavola dei Colli Faentini Rosso 1994, Bersano 1994 Barolo
and Frescobaldi Remole 1997 Chianti.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Winery of the Year &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One New World winery missing from the BTI in-flight wine tasting
is Rosemount Estate, one of Australia's most consistent wineries in
terms of quality, value and award-winning wines.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a consistent winner in Chronicle wine tastings,
Rosemount Estate was selected as Winery of the Year for 1999 by the
San Francisco International Wine Competition held June 26 and 27.
The popular winery was honored for winning the most medals at the
wine judging that took place at San Francisco's Park Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Events &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Livermore Valley will celebrate the beginning of its
150th grape harvest with the Fourth Annual Vine to Wine foot race
through the vineyards. For registration and more information, call
RhodyCo Productions at (415) 759-2690 or Livermore Valley
Winegrowers at (925) 447-9463. Tickets for adults are $17 in
advance, $20 at the door; tickets for children under 5 are $12 in
advance, $15 at the door.
</P>
<P>
   On September 5 and 6, the Livermore Valley Winegrowers follow
the vineyard race with the 18th Annual Livermore Harvest Wine
Celebration. The two-day event at valley wineries will feature wine
tastings, gourmet food and entertainment. Admission is $25 and may
be purchased from Livermore Valley Winegrowers (925) 447-9463.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Henry B. Meyer of San Francisco is the owner of the following
three old European wines and he wonders about their drinkability
and value.
</P>
<P>
   A: Zeller Schwarze Katz (Black Cat) is made from a number of
individual vineyards, around the town of Zell on the Mosel River.
It is a white wine made for early consumption, so it is unlikely
that the 1957 Schwarze Katz is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gilis 1933 St. Emilion Light Bordeaux is a mystery to me,
although at 66 years old, I would think that any ``light'' wine
must now be an undrinkable curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Caraco &AMP; Benitez Malaga Oro, may be the keeper of the lot.
Malaga is a sweet dessert wine from the Costa del Sol region of
Spain. Some Malagas age well, but since there is no way of knowing
the true age of your wine, I'd pull the cork. If you decide to
drink the Malaga, I'd like to hear your impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: C. Earlenbaugh of Oakland inherited a bottle of Charles Krug
1972 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and is curious about its value
and if any restaurant has an interest in adding his Cabernet to its
wine list.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not knowing the history of the particular bottle, I can only
offer general advice. Vintage 1972 was not that good in the Napa
Valley for red wines, and most of the best wines were already
tiring by the early 1990s. Since any remaining '72s are not
generally on collector's lists, I suggest gathering together a few
friends to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, restaurants can not legally purchase wine from a
private party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Janne Mahan of Menlo Park wants to know where to purchase
1995 Signorello Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   A: Signorello reports the wine is mostly sold out, but
Andronico's may still carry some. Or, call Linda at Signorello,
(707) 255-5990, for more help.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few weeks ago, a reader asked about the availability of
Barbera Blanc, a blush-type wine made from the Barbera grape.
</P>
<P>
   A: Readers have informed Potpourri that a Barbera Blanc called
Imbianco is available for $9.50 at Viansa Winery, 25200 Arnold
Drive in Sonoma and at Viansa's Lo Spuntino tasting room on the
square in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More on Mead &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Recent Potpourri items on mead, the fermented beverage made from
honey, prompted Walter L. Dawson III, of Salinas, to write that
Bargetto Winery has been making mead for years.
</P>
<P>
   Bargetto meads and grape wines are available for tasting and
purchase at The Taste of Monterey tasting room on Monterey's
Cannery Row. The waterfront tasting room has one of the best views
of any in the state.

 CHRON  
 Cold Soup Hits the Spot for Summer Suppers   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  This time of year, forget about ``Soup's on!'' as
a rallying cry on cold, dark, blustery nights. Think of ``Soup's
up!`` as an inviting call on what are often the balmiest times of
our year: the mellow evenings of late August and September.
<P>
   Americans don't have a great home-grown cold-soup tradition, but
many of our ancestors, wherever they came from, considered a cool
soup an eminently fitting first course for hot-weather dinners or
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, these are not soups meant to be a meal by themselves.
They are not dished up in capacious bowls or accompanied by hearty
breads. Rather, they should be served in small bowls or cups (mugs
are fine, especially on the patio) as appetizers. For
accompaniments, consider dainty crackers (no Saltines), Melba
toasts or homemade croutons made from challah or similar delicate
breads.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the character of the soup, you might spread these
toasts lightly with butter or brush them with a touch of olive oil.
For a tomato or other vegetable-based soup, they could be sprinkled
with Parmesan, chopped chives or chervil. For fruity soups, a whiff
of cardamom or nutmeg adds pizzazz.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of European cold soups have become commonplace on our
shores. Gazpacho, Andalusia's summer market-basket puree of
tomatoes, onions, celery, garlic, bell peppers and more, seasoned
with olive oil and vinegar or lemon juice, could give paella
competition for the honor of being the best-known Spanish dish in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Vichyssoise may have a somewhat questionable French pedigree (it
was reportedly born in an American restaurant kitchen), but some
version of creamed leek and potato soup is traditional in French
cuisine. And it's such a versatile soup. You can make a big batch
and serve it hot one time, chilled another. Add watercress, spinach
or sorrel to the basic recipe, and you have something completely
different.
</P>
<P>
   Many tomato soups are excellent served cold. If you are using an
older recipe, it may specify an enrichment of butter toward the
very end of cooking. Skip that for a cold presentation. If calories
are no great concern, a splash of cream successfully replaces the
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavian cooks make the most of their short summer season
with fruit soups, often served as the start to a fish dinner. It
may be a surprising pairing, but it works.
</P>
<P>
   Similar soups are common in northern Germany, a country that
also favors beer and wine soups. And for the very simplest
preparation, farm families in those same regions, as well as in
Poland, sometimes start a hot-day meal with a bowl of ice-cold
buttermilk or yogurt thinned with a few spoons of milk, lightly
sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon or cardamom.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound like India's favorite yogurt drink, lassi? Some
simple ideas are so natural, they crop up in many corners of the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Variations on Vichyssoise
</P>
<P>
   By following the basic recipe for Vichyssoise (see recipe), you
can make a number refreshing summer soups. Here are a few examples
to get you started:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chilled Watercress Soup &LR; : Decrease leeks to 2 cups; add leaves
from 1 bunch washed and drained watercress 5 minutes before cooking
time is finished. Omit chives and garnish with watercress sprigs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chilled Spinach Soup &LR; : Proceed as above, substituting leaves
from 1 bunch spinach for the watercress and adding 1 chopped garlic
clove to the potato/leek mixture. Add a few grindings of nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chilled Pepper Soup &LR; : Decrease leeks to 2 cups; add 1/2-1 cup
peeled, roasted red bell peppers (prepared at home or from a jar)
before pureeing the soup. Garnish with chopped chives or chopped
chervil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chilled Asparagus Soup:  &LR; Decrease leeks to 2 cups; add 1 minced
garlic clove to the potato/leek mixture, and add 1-11/2 cups
blanched and cut-up asparagus spears along with 3 tablespoons
nonfat dry milk to the mixture 5 minutes before cooking time is up.
For a low-calorie version, skip the cream enrichment or use only a
tablespoon or two _ the nonfat dry milk makes this creamy without
adding fat.

<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ripe stone fruit, washed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup lemon juice, or to taste

<P>
   1/2 to 3/4 cup creme fraiche or plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pit the fruit, cutting larger fruit into quarters (pit cherries
over a bowl to catch juices and add them to the pot). Remove 1/2
cup fruit, chop and reserve for garnish, tossing with a little
lemon juice. Refrigerate in a covered container.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the remaining fruit and the water in a nonreactive pan.
Bring to a boil, then simmer until the fruit is very soft, 15 to 25
minutes, depending on fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Cool slightly, then pass through a food mill or puree in a
blender or processor. Return to the pan; add the sugar, cloves,
cinnamon and lemon zest. Bring to a near boil; reduce heat to low
and simmer, uncovered, for 8 minutes. Remove the whole spices and
lemon zest.
</P>
<P>
   Dissolve the arrowroot or cornstarch in a little cold water. Add
to the simmering soup and cook, stirring, until the soup is clear
and lightly thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Add the wine and return to a simmer for 2 minutes; do not let
the soup boil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat and add the optional almond extract and lemon
juice to taste. Add more sugar, if desired.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Classic Puttanesca Loses Its Freshness in a Jar   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Puttanesca is a classic Italian pasta sauce that's
been popping up on many restaurant menus. But we were surprised
when we started seeing it in jars on supermarket shelves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sauce is usually just a combination of onions, olives,
garlic, oregano, capers, anchovies and tomatoes. However, what's in
the market is more of a tomato sauce with the addition of the other
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted nine sauces labeled as puttanesca. They
varied dramatically in price from $3.69 for 28 ounces to a whopping
$10.99 for 24 ounces. A couple received decent scores. But, as a
whole, the panel felt the fresh taste of the classic dish seems to
get lost in the jar, and the quality of the olives was particularly
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   The sauces were tasted on their own and tossed with hot cooked
penne pasta.
</P>
<P>
   The top score went to  &UR; Coppola Mammarella &LR;  (26 ounces, $5.99 at
Andronico's), Francis Ford Coppola. One panelist loved the big
pieces of basil and another thought the sauce was obviously made
from top-quality ingredients. But another described it as too bland
and herbal for a puttanesca. Three would buy it, one might buy it,
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Frutti di Bosco &LR;  (25.5 ounces, $5.59 at
Whole Foods). Three panelists found it overly acidic but another
liked the balance. Two would buy it, two might buy it and one would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place was a tie between  &UR; Patsy's &LR;  (16 ounces, $5.59 at
Andronico's) and  &UR; Sonoma Gourmet  &LR; (25 ounces, $4.49 at
Andronico's).
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists liked the balance of pungent to sweet flavors in
Patsy's. One complained of the cardboardlike texture of the
tomatoes, and another thought it was too oily. Two would buy it,
one might buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sonoma Gourmet, two panelists described it as just OK,
while two others thought it was well balanced. One panelist
complained about a chemical aftertaste. Two would buy it, two might
buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coco Pazzo  &LR; (24 ounces, $8.99 at Andronico's) came in fifth.
One taster thought the sauce was tart but with good texture;
another thought it needed more heat. One would buy it, one might
buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Barilla, Donnello's, Don Pomodoro and
Rao's Homemade but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin,
culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San
Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 COOK'S BOOKS: Chez Panisse Returns With Cafe Favorites   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  There were rave reviews three years ago when Alice
Waters' sixth cookbook, ``Chez Panisse Vegetables,''
(HarperCollins, 1996) was published. Many cooks and critics felt
the work _ solid and imaginative, personal yet widely appealing _
could not be topped.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Waters and crew have done it again. ``Chez Panisse Caf &LR; e &LR; 
Cookbook,'' due in bookstores within the next week, is the most
accessible yet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it's based on the cooking of the upstairs cafe
with its eclectic California/Provencal/Tuscan melange may explain
part of its appeal. But not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are as dedicated to politically and nutritionally
correct concepts (fresh, local, organic, natural, unfussy) as their
counterparts in the downstairs restaurant, the upstairs chefs
clearly have fun. So does artist David Lance Goines, long
associated with Chez Panisse, who did the provocative
illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of fun permeates the book in the most infectious way.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to leaf through these pages and not itch to get into
the kitchen. It's also hard not to be won over to Waters and
company's dedication to the Bay Area's agricultural riches and
their determination to find and use the best. Waters also
reminisces about the history of Chez Panisse and the cafe, recalls
what inspired certain preparations, and discourses on essential
qualities of ingredients. Those who don't cook like Waters does may
still find the book an interesting read.
</P>
<P>
   Like all her cooking, the recipes are entirely
ingredient-driven. Waters is like the old-fashioned cook who went
to the market in the morning, purchased what looked most appealing,
then devised the family menu around those ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   However, even those cooks who are attuned to the Waters way may
find that some recipes take more dedication and time than they want
to invest. Making lamb sausage or boudin blanc to stuff into
sausage casings is labor-intensive; concocting head cheese (``ask
your butcher to cut the pig's head in half and discard the brain .
. .'') might make some readers renounce meat.
</P>
<P>
   But for every one of these dishes there are dozens of other
recipes that easily fit into most home cooks' repertoires. The
recipes call for the finest ingredients but are not snobbish. In
some ways, Waters' tips resemble those of the proverbial thrifty
French housewife, using what others might consider discards.
</P>
<P>
   This book, not unlike the preceding vegetable tome, is more than
a collection of recipes and reminiscences. It is a testament to a
holistic way of looking at cooking, and it radiates with the
author's most vital ingredient _ a passion for food.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 large boneless chicken breast halves, skin on
</P>
<P>
   2 chicken legs
</P>
<P>
   Extra virgin olive oil (about 2 tablespoons) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  1/2 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts chicken stock

<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; First prepare the sauce:  &LR; Remove the fillets from the chicken
breasts. Using a cleaver, chop each chicken leg into 4 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In a large, deep saucepan, brown the chicken leg pieces and the
fillets in a little olive oil. When they are well browned, deglaze
with the white wine and cover with chicken stock. Bring to a boil,
reduce to a simmer and add the parsley, thyme, garlic and 1
tablespoon of the peppercorns. Simmer 1 hour, then strain,
reserving the cooked meat for another purpose, like ravioli
stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Skim off the fat. Reduce this broth until rich and slightly
thickened; only about 11/2 cups should remain. The sauce may be
prepared several hours ahead, or the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a moderately hot grill. Carefully pound the chicken
breasts to flatten them slightly. Crack the rest of the peppercorns
in a mortar or crush them on a cutting board with the bottom of a
heavy pan. Coat the breasts lightly with olive oil and season with
salt and the cracked peppercorns. Gently grill the chicken breasts
skin side down, rotating them frequently for even browning, and
when cooked two-thirds through, turn the breasts to finish cooking,
about 8 minutes in all.
</P>
<P>
   Let the breasts stand for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Warm the sauce, check for seasoning and add a few drops of wine
vinegar, if you wish.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Chez Panisse Brine Brings Out the Best
in  Poultry and Pork   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Leave it to Alice Waters and her crew at Chez
Panisse to come up with a recipe that's so simple and so brilliant
that it brings out the best in chicken, pork or turkey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They've created a brine with sugar, salt and a few seasonings
that infuse loads of flavor into the meats. In fact, she has used
this brine on her Thanksgiving turkey and reports that it was
marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   To test how well the brine worked, I cooked two chickens side by
side. One had been soaked in the brine for 24 hours; the other had
not been brined at all. Both were filled with Italian parsley,
preserved lemons and onions and roasted in a 400-degree oven.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was remarkable. While the regular chicken had a
deeper richer skin color, the brined chicken was plump and juicy,
though a little anemic looking. More important was the amazing
flavor and texture. It was also the moistest chicken I can remember
eating.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I warmed the leftovers. The regular chicken was
even drier and had that typical day-old taste, but the brined
chicken still tasted moist and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the brining the chicken stays moist enough to leave
it in the oven a little longer if necessary to achieve a crisp,
bronzed skin.
</P>
<P>
   We also tried a pork roast, brined for three days. It came out
fabulous, too, and is particularly good leftover for sandwiches the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Since Waters opened Chez Panisse more than 25 years ago, she has
been at the forefront of improving our food supply _ first
gathering farmers to grow the best organic produce, and now
spotlighting other causes: a school gardening program and
sustainable agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But the food at Chez Panisse, or upstairs in the Cafe, isn't
about politics; it's about finding the best ingredients, cooking
them simply and presenting them with care.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to take things for granted, Waters refurbished the
craftsman-style interior in 1998, adding smoky copper mirrors and
new lights to give the already pretty space a new lease on life.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Chez Panisse, 1517 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley; (510) 548-5525. &LR; 
 &LR; Dinner Monday-Saturday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SECRET OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; The brine. &LR;  The brine infuses flavor into pork, chicken and turkey
and makes the meat tender and succulent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHEZ PANISSE'S BRINE FOR MEATS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   21/2 gallons cold water
</P>
<P>
   2 cups kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves, torn into pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh thyme, or 4 tablespoons dried
</P>
<P>
   1 whole head of garlic, cloves separated and peeled
</P>
<P>
   5 whole allspice berries, crushed
</P>
<P>
   4 juniper berries, smashed
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the water in a large pot that can easily hold the liquid
and the meat you intend to brine.
</P>
<P>
   Add all ingredients and stir for a minute or two until the sugar
and salt dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   Leave poultry in the brine for 24 hours; pork for 3 days. If the
meat/poultry floats to the top, use a plate or other weight to keep
it completely submerged in the brine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; The recipe may be halved or doubled; the important thing
is to have enough brine to completely cover the meat or poultry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To roast a brined chicken:  &LR; Drain well. Pat dry and stuff with
onions, lemons and herbs. Rub the skin with oil to help browning
and sprinkle with pepper (salt isn't needed because of the brine).
Roast in a 400 degree oven until done; generally about 1 hour and
15 minutes for a 31/2- to 4-pound bird.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To roast a boneless brined pork roast:  &LR; Place the meat in a
roasting pan and roast at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes per
pound, until the center is just pink, or until the internal
temperature reaches 150 degrees to 160 degrees.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Think of Rice as a People-Magnet That
Attracts  Company   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Every year as fall approaches, thousands of young
people get ready to leave home for the first time to go to college
or to get jobs in a big city. One of the most important survival
skills they can take with them is knowing how to cook a few simple,
basic dishes. This ability not only can save them lots of money,
but it can be a great magnet for making new friends. Inviting
people to share food at your table is the easiest way to become
part of a new community.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best ingredients for a beginner to keep on hand is
long-grain white rice.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't an accident that rice is the staple for half the
world's people. Rice has all the right qualities: It's cheap,
abundant and nourishing _ and doesn't spoil, provided it's stored
in an air-tight container.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked rice blends with almost any ingredient, so you can try
some of your favorite foods mixed with it.
</P>
<P>
   The following Mexican rice dish is very, very good. It can be
used as an accompaniment to a simple roast chicken, or serve it as
a basic entree accompanied with warmed corn tortillas (wrap
tortillas in foil and warm them in the oven just before serving the
rice).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(SIDEBAR AND RECIPE FOLLOW) &QL; 
 &QL; 
RICE TIP
</P>
<P>
   Store all rice in a jar with a tight-fitting lid.
</P>
<P>
   Rice attracts Indian meal moths and proper storing will protect
it from infestation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; MEXICAN GREEN RICE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups long-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   4 Roma tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 green onions
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup canned diced green chiles (Ortega brand; these are mild,
not hot)
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Steaming the Rice &LR; : Use a 3-quart or larger saucepan with a
lid to steam the rice. Combine the water and 1 teaspoon salt in the
saucepan and turn the heat to high. When the water boils, reduce
the heat to low and slowly pour the rice into the water. Stir the
rice in case any grains are sticking to the bottom. Put the lid on
the pot and set a timer for 20 minutes. Check after the rice has
been cooking for about 5 minutes and make sure the heat is low and
the rice water isn't furiously boiling &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Vegetables:  &LR; Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise.
Cut out the core and discard. Put each half cut-side down on a
cutting board and slice into 4 lengthwise strips. Gently hold the
strips together and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces. Put the
chopped tomatoes into a small bowl, season lightly with salt,
sprinkle in the vinegar and toss, either using your hands or a fork
so the vinegar covers all the tomato pieces. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the green onions under cold tap water. Slice off the root
end and trim about 2 inches of the coarser green tops. Holding the
onions together, slice crosswise into thin little rings, 1/8 inch
or less. Add them to the bowl with the tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the bunch of cilantro under cold tap water, then shake the
bunch and pat dry. You don't have to get fussy, just shake off most
of the water. Remove enough of the leaves from the stems to measure
about 11/2 cups, loosely packed. (A little more or less of any of
these ingredients will still be fine.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing the Green Rice:  &LR; When the rice is done, taste a few
grains; they should be tender, not firm. If the rice seems firm,
cook another 5 to 10 minutes and taste again for doneness. Stir the
tomatoes, onions, cilantro leaves and diced green chiles into the
rice. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot. This is good garnished with a little sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: I-House Still Shines After All These Years  &HT;        By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; BERKELEY, Calif. _  &LR; Sitting at long dark-wood tables under enormous
Spanish-inspired chandeliers and digging into a steaming plate of
polenta with spicy black bean sauce, few Berkeley students would
guess that this pleasant dining venue was once at the vortex of a
scandal.
<P>
   But in 1928, when International House, a coeducational residence
and dining facility for about 600 students and visiting scholars of
all ethnic backgrounds, was proposed, and again when it opened on
August 18, 1930, there were outcries in the then not-so-liberal
city of Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women would live in the same building? White Anglo
Saxons would share meals with Asians and Africans, Mexicans and
American ``colored people''? Eight-hundred residents _ mostly
property owners _ thronged one meeting protesting these devious
designs which _ mercy be _ might even lead to interracial pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Those '30s bigots were right on the last count: Over the years,
quite a few romances and marriages had their start at I-House
dining tables. And those protesters, predicting inevitable failure
of the venture, would have been shocked to hear that the
institution _ the first of its kind west of the Mississippi _ is
thriving 69 years later. What's more, residents not only share
living arrangements and tables with peers from around the globe,
they are often treated to the foods of these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the predictable Chinese New Year, Bastille Day and
Cinco de Mayo dinners, the food staff tries to bring some of the
more unusual foods of its residents' homelands to the table. Gary
Beitch, a 23-year veteran of I-House and now its director of dining
services, points to Indian dinners, a Turkish meal, a Norwegian
smorgasbord and an annual native American feast.
</P>
<P>
   Students get involved with these events, providing ideas and
recipes and helping in the attractive kitchen that produces 1,400
meals a weekday, plus food for special events and catered meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days _ even when Beitch arrived on the scene in the
'70s _ menus featured standard American cafeteria food, he admits.
``You know, beef stew one night a week . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, students' complaints tended to be of a general
nature, Beitch says. ``They would just say the food wasn't very
good.'' Now, they get specific. A couple of years ago, for
instance, a student from Spain implored him to never let the cooks
make paella again (``I thought they'd done a pretty good job,''
Beitch says). In Spain, the young man explained, paella isn't just
food _ it's a way of life _ which, apparently the I-House version
didn't capture. (The student didn't respond to an invitation to
come teach the kitchen staff how to make a more soulful paella.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes guest chefs lend authenticity to I-House menus. Rhoda
Wing of Oakland's Chinatown was one, another was Paola Bagnatori.
Bagnatori, a noted San Francisco Italian cook, said in a Chronicle
interview in 1993 that she started cooking in self-defense when,
just arrived from Italy, she lived at I-House and found the food
``just awful.'' The I-House people, far from being offended,
invited her back, ``and she cooked us this fantastic Italian
chicken dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Beitch and staff cater to the tastes of the time as much as
possible. The facility is not state-subsidized but, guided by its
own board, exists on fees, grants and gifts. Beitch finds it hard
to put an exact price on meals, since, consistent with the
institution's goal to let students and scholars from different
racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds study, live and eat
together, room and board are a package and fees are lumped
together. But he quotes a ballpark cost of just under $3 a meal.
</P>
<P>
   On that kind of budget, filet mignon is not an option, but lots
of fresh fruit and vegetables are, as are pasta and legumes. This
neatly dove-tails with an increased request for vegetarian food.
Everything is clearly labeled, including the few items that contain
pork or pork-derived products. That's about as far as the staff can
go in accommodating individual preferences, Beitch says. ``We can't
do special diets _ vegan or kosher, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to individual requests/complaints, a student
committee helps direct the menu. Somewhat surprisingly, there have
been no demands for organic or against bioengineered or irradiated
food.
</P>
<P>
   There have been concerns about fried food, but, Beitch laughs,
when most fried foods were temporarily dropped there was vociferous
opposition: ``We  &LR; didn't &LR;  mean fish and chips.''
</P>
<P>
   They have returned to the menu.

KO THIS STATUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer business has saddled us with many a confusing
acronym: SDRAM, JPEG, WYSIWYG. Well, here's the most dismaying one
yet: UCITA. What's really scary about this one is that it was
dreamed up by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws
is a band of legal experts who write ``model statutes'' that can be
enacted by all 50 states. That way, the law stays roughly the same
between here and Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the conference served up its latest effort, the
Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, or UCITA. It's a
model statute that's supposed to govern purchases of computer
software, and the commissioners want to see it become law in every
state. So do the world's leading software companies. UCITA is
backed by the industry's biggest lobbying groups _ the Business
Software Alliance and the Software and Information Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a winner, until you learn that attorneys general
from 26 of the 50 states (not including Massachusetts, alas) have
denounced the proposed law. So has the Federal Trade Commission,
the publishers of Consumer Reports magazine, the Association of
Computing Machinery, the American Library Association, and even the
American Law Institute, which had worked with the commission to
draft earlier versions of UCITA.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because UCITA takes some of the worst aspects of the
software business and etches them permanently into the law.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: Do you actually own the software you buy? Probably
not. Read one of those nearly unreadable contracts that come in the
box. There's a good chance that what you really bought is a license
to use the software, not outright ownership of your copy of it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the programming know-how in your copy of Microsoft
Word still belongs to Microsoft, just as the contents of the novel
``Rainbow Six'' belong to Tom Clancy. But imagine Clancy telling
you that he owns your copy of the book, and you need his permission
to resell it, or even lend it to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The book publishing industry actually tried to pull such a stunt
early in the century, until Macy's department store took it to the
US Supreme Court and won the right to sell used books. The courts
have not yet settled the issue whether consumers own the software
they buy. UCITA would settle it, and the answer would generally be
``no.''
</P>
<P>
   This might not be too bad if the license terms are reasonable.
Lots of companies grant permission to resell software, for
instance. But how will you know before you buy? Under UCITA, the
full license doesn't have to be provided until you've purchased the
software. Yes, you're allowed to return it if you don't like the
terms, but that's still a considerable stumbling block. There's a
cheap, simple solution: require companies to publish their licenses
on a Web site. UCITA doesn't bother with this.
</P>
<P>
   Under UCITA, software companies can dream up just about any
licensing scheme they want, as long as they provide the consumer
with ``conspicuous'' notice of the terms. Companies already try to
blow these terms past us, but UCITA would provide them with an
extra layer of legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Network Associates Inc. forbids users of its
McAfee antivirus software from publishing reviews of the product
without permission? It's right there, ``conspicuously'' displayed
in one of those licenses virtually nobody takes the time to read.
Under existing law, such a provision is probably unenforceable, and
it might also be unenforceable under UCITA. But it could take a few
years of plodding through federal courts to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Raise these concerns with software industry folks, and they
wonder about all the fuss. ``Quite frankly, why should the attorney
general care about UCITA?'' said Mark Nebergall, counsel for the
Software and Information Industry Association. Nebergall told me
the state attorneys general who signed an anti-UCITA letter didn't
know what they were doing. He figures the AGs were goaded into
signing by the states' consumer protection lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, Mark. That's why states have consumer
protection lawyers _ to blow the whistle on laws that threaten to
injure consumers. Laws like UCITA that, in its current form, should
be sent to wherever acronyms go when they die.

 &HT;    -- QUESTIONS for LI HONGZHI --
 &HT;    (As the Chinese government calls for his arrest, the exiled
leader of the massive Falun Gong movement talks about living in New
York and watching politics and belief collide back home in China.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you think of yourself as a political dissident?
 &HT;    A: I don't want to get involved in politics. I don't care for
it. Governments focus only on the problem at hand, instead of
looking at what has caused this problem in the first place. If
ordinary people's society does not become more virtuous, any number
of problems may occur, and I cannot concern myself with this
prospect. I am only responsible to the practitioners of Falun Gong.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: But you've recently been described as one of the most
influential people in Asia. Does this new high profile help you?
 &HT;    A: I think it has done quite a bit of damage to me, personally.
Were cultivators of Falun Gong to know that I was ranked among the
influential people of the world, they would most likely laugh at
me. As cultivators, we do not seek fame and profit. My masters are
all practicing in the mountains. If they don't want to be seen,
even I couldn't find them. I ''came out'' only because they said
that I should. Otherwise I would not.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: For the past three years you've been in America. During that
time, what differences did you find between Chinese and American
culture?
 &HT;    A: The difference is quite enormous. Chinese people's mentality
is deeply influenced by their ancient cultural heritage. But
Americans are unfettered by ancient culture. In terms of human
characteristics, because Chinese people are so rational, they will
consider the substance of what they do. A Westerner will make sure
that it is done well on the surface. For instance, everyone knows
Chinese food is quite delicious. But when it comes to surface
qualities, it is not very particular. Chinese restaurants are often
very casual, and all you really need is a pair of chopsticks. But
Western cuisine, while it doesn't necessarily taste any better,
pays much closer attention to exactly which fork is to be used when
eating a certain food. Chinese people are concerned with the inner
quality of culture, whereas Westerners are concerned with the
surface qualities of culture.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Those can be loaded terms. Do you disapprove of American
culture?
 &HT;    A: Personally, I have no opposition to it. I need to have a
quiet and calm place to concentrate on the practice. So I don't
watch TV and movies often. But I know they have created
irreversible pollution to the world. And human beings can never
reverse the pollution and get back to its purest state, no matter
how hard we try.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You were supposedly living underground until very recently.
With all the Chinese immigrants in your neighborhood, didn't anyone
recognize you?
 &HT;    A: If they do not look carefully they will not recognize me. I
seldom communicate with others because of the language barrier, and
because of my personal practice, I seldom walk down the street.
Sometimes on weekends, we go to the mall. You know, sometimes I
help my wife do the grocery shopping. I love that I can get Chinese
sauces in New York.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Are you settling into life in New York? Or will you return to
China?
 &HT;    A: My wife and I have registered our own small company. We are
preparing to publish my books. But I've been thinking, if the
Chinese government would not treat their people as they do now, and
if they were willing to solve the issues through dialogue, I think
that would be good for the Chinese government and people as well.
If they want me back, I would go back. But the government is
nervous and they don't want me back. I don't want to be any trouble
to them. I can live wherever I am.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Unlike in China, however _ where you are said to have
millions of followers _ here in America very few people understand
your movement. Is Falun Gong a religion? Does it require faith?
 &HT;    A: It is a practice that can remove illnesses, keep people fit
and make one live longer. Like tai chi, it's a morning exercise.
People practicing Falun Gong are expected to follow the principles
of truthfulness, compassion and forbearance. And they must speak
truthfully, have compassion, be benevolent, be tolerant. But
whether people have other faiths or not, they can all practice
Falun Gong. We do not get involved in faiths. We respect all of
them.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Falun Gong has been described as a cult. Is that description
fair?
 &HT;    A: A cult advocates end-of-the-world theories and leads people
to do many bad things. I am only teaching people the practice for
healing and fitness. Not only that, I am teaching people to have
good moral characters. I think this is good and meaningful to
society. The Chinese government accused me of advocating a doomsday
and of saying I can delay the end of the world by 30 years. That's
really ridiculous. And very often people assume that in order to
study the Great Way of Falun they would have to live like a monk
and give up everything. Actually, all practitioners are members of
society; they do ordinary things just like anyone else.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Perhaps more specifically, cults don't tolerate dissent. Do
practitioners of Falun Gong have differing opinions? Or do they
tend to be of one mind on most things?
 &HT;    A: Normally people who do not like the principles of
truthfulness, compassion and tolerance would not be very likely to
study Falun Gong. Only the people who like these principles would
come to learn. But people come and go as they please, you know;
it's voluntary.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In every end there's always the promise of a beginning. In the
same way in every prophecy of the Apocalypse there's always the
promise of a future paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The human species progresses through reason, but faith is its
strongest reason for living. This faith always places a hope in the
horizon, which retreats as we walk toward it.
</P>
<P>
   These last months of the century have been rich in prophecies of
all kinds. Some of them are related to Latin America, and maybe it
wouldn't be useless to remember them.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago I read, in a small book called ``El ano mil''
(``The Year One Thousand''), by Henri Focillon, the clever idea
that humankind always projects its fears onto the years with a
round number _ decades, centuries or millennia _ thus making these
dates an occasion for anxiety or perpetual hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Apocalypse foretells, as is known, the Second Coming of
Christ and the return of all men to the earthly paradise lost by
Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in late July, a trio of archaeologists discovered,
in the southeast of Salta Province, in Argentina, the ruins of a
city called Talavera de Esteco. Nearby, a tribe of gypsies had
prophesied, 50 years ago, that the finding of the lost city of
Esteco would coincide with the birth of the Antichrist and the end
of human history.
</P>
<P>
   Legends generally are false, but it's strange to see up to what
point they actually do coincide with other data from reality.
</P>
<P>
   When the tribe of gypsy prophets arrived in Tucuman, in August
1949, a fiery and dry winter was ending; the night sky was always
full of shooting stars.
</P>
<P>
   While the men of the tribe built their tents in the southern
wastelands and started to earn money by selling parts for old
automobiles, the gypsy women invaded the streets in town, selling
lockets to attract love and mica stones to repel enemies, and
reading the palms of any who wanted to know their destiny.
</P>
<P>
   They all spoke of the end of the world and the horrors of
Esteco, whose ruins they had crossed, while avoiding any look at
them.
</P>
<P>
   Esteco's fate is described in volumes of Latin American colonial
history, free of any flights of the later gypsies' imagination. The
tale repeats the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. It mentions the same
hostile and rough landscape, the same unforgivable sins of lust and
pride, the same legend of the curious woman who turns her head and
becomes a salt statue.
</P>
<P>
   There's no mention of the angels sent by God to tell Lot about
the end of the doomed city, but it seems the gypsies of 1949 said
they were the angels, so they could ask for more money from the
people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1634, a Spanish bishop named Maldonado wrote that the land of
Esteco was ``among sand and damned saltpetrous land'': the houses
were falling down because of the repeated earthquakes, and the
Indians died in their ceaseless work to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   One quake finished whatever was standing and is reflected in
this stanza: ``Don't follow that road,/do not be prideful and
obstinate,/you might finally get lost/as the city of Esteco.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later in Caracas, I heard a similar prediction.
Supposedly at the end of August, 1979, the stone statue of Maria
Lionza was going to fly to the sea, leaving its solid pedestal, and
that would be the final sign before a fissure would open in the
mountains and the Caribbean waters would pour into the capital,
flooding it.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Lionza is a popular Venezuelan divinity _ she forever
flies astride a stone tablet, curing the poor of their illness and
sorrows. And the city's nearness to the sea _ separated from the
coast by a mountain ridge six or seven miles wide _ has always
weighed on the minds of the people of the capital as a threat of
the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   To those gypsies in 1949, after the final fire, when the city of
Esteco was discovered, there would be civilization of harmonious
and immortal beings, immune to hunger and unhappiness. Meanwhile,
the Caracas' prophecy meant that a great tidal wave of the waters
would end the oil wealth of the greedy, bury the mansions of the
rich and allow the poor people in settlements built on higher
ground to create an egalitarian society.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, prophecies of salvation are irrational and leave
many unanswered questions, but there is a virtue in ambiguity which
is that if they aren't fulfilled today, they might be fulfilled
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Some impatient fanatics decide they will speed the arrival of
the end, by joining sects that promote mass suicide, for example,
those in Waco, Texas, and Jonestown, Guyana, where 800 people
poisoned themselves to ``receive eternal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Others give away everything they have, as was the case with a
millionaire in Singapore. Or they try to accumulate as much wealth
as they can, for example, a Korean former electrician who attracted
3 million followers in a hundred countries and plans to reunite
them in an illusory Korea that will become, on the day of the
Apocalypse, the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, in remote cities of Argentina, Colombia and
Mexico, I heard several times a prediction made more than 400 years
ago. Many of those who were repeating the prophecy didn't know its
origin. Its author is Nostradamus, one of the great seers of the
16th century, and his prediction is in the 10th poem, stanza 72, of
his Book of Centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone may interpret the words as he wishes: ``In the seventh
month of the year 1999/there will come from the Heavens a great
King of Terror/it will resuscitate the great king of the Mongols./
And Mars will happily reign before and after.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three lines are cryptic; the first, though, is
unequivocal. The seventh month of 1999 is July. The prophecy, then,
hasn't been fulfilled. One of the most literal interpretations
supposes that July marks the birth of the Antichrist, the place of
that birth is Mongolia, and after being devoured by wars the world
will find happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The human species is, now more than ever, searching for answers.
To predict that there will be an end of the world is not enough,
because everything which has a beginning, unavoidably has an
ending.
</P>
<P>
   What is proposed in the Book of Centuries and the rest of the
Apocalyptic texts is more disturbing. They explain that, over the
course of time, everything that is lost returns _ in another way,
in other forms, in other languages.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, at the foot of the tall rocks of Sodom, to the south
of the Dead Sea, there are hundreds of salt statues which evoke an
image of Lot's wife, a woman who is immortal. So too in Esteco, the
tablets just recovered by the archaeologists remind us of that lost
city, which has lost its splendor, but not its legend.
</P>
<P>
   Man's imagination is full of prophesies. There are so many of
them nobody should be surprised if one is fulfilled.

<P>
   In every end there's always the promise of a beginning. In the
same way in every prophecy of the Apocalypse there's always the
promise of a future paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The human species progresses through reason, but faith is its
strongest reason for living. This faith always places a hope in the
horizon, which retreats as we walk toward it.
</P>
<P>
   These last months of the century have been rich in prophecies of
all kinds. Some of them are related to Latin America, and maybe it
wouldn't be useless to remember them.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago I read, in a small book called ``El ano mil''
(``The Year One Thousand''), by Henri Focillon, the clever idea
that humankind always projects its fears onto the years with a
round number _ decades, centuries or millennia _ thus making these
dates an occasion for anxiety or perpetual hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Apocalypse foretells, as is known, the Second Coming of
Christ and the return of all men to the earthly paradise lost by
Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in late July, a trio of archaeologists discovered,
in the southeast of Salta Province, in Argentina, the ruins of a
city called Talavera de Esteco. Nearby, a tribe of gypsies had
prophesied, 50 years ago, that the finding of the lost city of
Esteco would coincide with the birth of the Antichrist and the end
of human history.
</P>
<P>
   Legends generally are false, but it's strange to see up to what
point they actually do coincide with other data from reality.
</P>
<P>
   When the tribe of gypsy prophets arrived in Tucuman, in August
1949, a fiery and dry winter was ending; the night sky was always
full of shooting stars.
</P>
<P>
   While the men of the tribe built their tents in the southern
wastelands and started to earn money by selling parts for old
automobiles, the gypsy women invaded the streets in town, selling
lockets to attract love and mica stones to repel enemies, and
reading the palms of any who wanted to know their destiny.
</P>
<P>
   They all spoke of the end of the world and the horrors of
Esteco, whose ruins they had crossed, while avoiding any look at
them.
</P>
<P>
   Esteco's fate is described in volumes of Latin American colonial
history, free of any flights of the later gypsies' imagination. The
tale repeats the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. It mentions the same
hostile and rough landscape, the same unforgivable sins of lust and
pride, the same legend of the curious woman who turns her head and
becomes a salt statue.
</P>
<P>
   There's no mention of the angels sent by God to tell Lot about
the end of the doomed city, but it seems the gypsies of 1949 said
they were the angels, so they could ask for more money from the
people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1634, a Spanish bishop named Maldonado wrote that the land of
Esteco was ``among sand and damned saltpetrous land'': the houses
were falling down because of the repeated earthquakes, and the
Indians died in their ceaseless work to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   One quake finished whatever was standing and is reflected in
this stanza: ``Don't follow that road,/do not be prideful and
obstinate,/you might finally get lost/as the city of Esteco.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later in Caracas, I heard a similar prediction.
Supposedly at the end of August, 1979, the stone statue of Maria
Lionza was going to fly to the sea, leaving its solid pedestal, and
that would be the final sign before a fissure would open in the
mountains and the Caribbean waters would pour into the capital,
flooding it.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Lionza is a popular Venezuelan divinity _ she forever
flies astride a stone tablet, curing the poor of their illness and
sorrows. And the city's nearness to the sea _ separated from the
coast by a mountain ridge six or seven miles wide _ has always
weighed on the minds of the people of the capital as a threat of
the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   To those gypsies in 1949, after the final fire, when the city of
Esteco was discovered, there would be civilization of harmonious
and immortal beings, immune to hunger and unhappiness. Meanwhile,
the Caracas' prophecy meant that a great tidal wave of the waters
would end the oil wealth of the greedy, bury the mansions of the
rich and allow the poor people in settlements built on higher
ground to create an egalitarian society.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, prophecies of salvation are irrational and leave
many unanswered questions, but there is a virtue in ambiguity which
is that if they aren't fulfilled today, they might be fulfilled
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Some impatient fanatics decide they will speed the arrival of
the end, by joining sects that promote mass suicide, for example,
those in Waco, Texas, and Jonestown, Guyana, where 800 people
poisoned themselves to ``receive eternal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Others give away everything they have, as was the case with a
millionaire in Singapore. Or they try to accumulate as much wealth
as they can, for example, a Korean former electrician who attracted
3 million followers in a hundred countries and plans to reunite
them in an illusory Korea that will become, on the day of the
Apocalypse, the Promised Land.

WEB SITE (PLUS) ROCK STARS (PLUS) ACTIVISM (EQUALS) ACTIVISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an unlikely scenario: Pop stars meet computer geeks meet
United Nations development workers. Together, these unusual
partners come up with an ambitious plan to fight world hunger and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it sounds, that's precisely the strategy behind NetAid, a
project that aims to combine the communications power of the
Internet with the celebrity lure of such rock stars as U2 singer
Bono and Bush. The initiative will make a splash on Oct. 9 with
simultaneous concerts in Geneva, London, and the Meadowlands, N.J.,
that will be broadcast on television, radio, and over the Internet.
The lineup so far includes both Bono and Bush, the Corrs and the
Counting Crows, Celine Dion, Jewel, the Eurythmics, Wyclef Jean,
George Michael, Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend, and Robbie Williams.
About a dozen additional acts are expected to be announced in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity-studded concerts are designed to raise awareness
of a new activist Web site, www.netaid.org, a joint project of the
computer networking company Cisco Systems and the United Nations
Development Program. The organizers want the site to serve as a
sort of global portal for social activism, providing information on
such issues as hunger, refugees, the environment, and human rights.
When the site is in full operation, it will provide ways for
individuals to hook up with relief and aid organizations, either to
donate funds or volunteer services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary goal isn't to raise money, it's to raise
consciousness and get people engaged,'' says Don Listwin, executive
vice president of Cisco Systems. ``It's like the eBay concept: You
are able to match up your desire with the right thing. In this
case, it doesn't happen to be a Furby; it happens to be a social
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Malloch Brown, the UN Development Program's administrator,
likens the site to a ``sophisticated dating service,'' matching
individuals with the needs of nongovernmental organizations. ``The
Net is a great constituency-building tool,'' he says. ``In the old
days, you could only get this kind of information by traveling or
joining the Peace Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerts _ at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, Wembley
Stadium in London, and the Palais des Nations in Geneva _ provide
the big splash to attract attention to the site: They will be
broadcast by VH1, MTV, and the BBC, with streaming video on line.
Listwin bills the event as the ``largest fully integrated global
multimedia event'' in history; thanks to technology from Akamai
Technologies, the Cambridge, Mass Web site can handle up to 10
million viewers during the event and 125,000 simultaneous video
streams _ 10 times the capacity for the 1998 Olympics and the 1998
men's World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be launched on Sept. 8, the same day as the debut
performance of a NetAid single, ``New Day,'' written by Bono and
hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean, who will play it at the United Nations.
The single, Listwin says, may be available for free digital
download, a proven way to attract viewers to a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But this effort isn't simply ``We Are the World'' with
computers; Unlike other one-time-only musical events like LiveAid
or FarmAid,'' NetAid is not simply a feel-good, knee-jerk response
to social issues, Brown says. It is a sustainable project with
three long-term goals: to build a global constituency to fight
poverty; to build a public-private partnership that Brown says will
``get the UN out of its hidebound, bureaucratic environment''; and
to bridge the digital gap between developed countries and the Third
World. ``At the moment, about 2 billion people have not even placed
a telephone call, much less (gone) on line,'' says Brown. ``But I
want to raise this as a challenge to the information technology
industry: How do we meet the challenge of providing connectivity?
The Internet, we know, can be a great equalizing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, the Internet industry has hardly been
a model of philanthropic largesse, despite huge profits and rapid
growth. ``That's one of the great possibilities here,'' says Brown.
``This new industry has been growing up out West without a sense of
social responsibility, but now they're starting to come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Web site, there will also be a NetAid
Foundation that will donate the proceeds from the concerts to
refugees in Kosovo and Africa. And when the music stops, the site
will live on. ``Five years ago, we didn't have any idea how rampant
e-commerce and the Net would be,'' Listwin says. ``Now if the Net
could only have one-tenth the impact on social change as it is
having on business, we could do great things.''
</P>

LINUX GAMESTERS

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Backers of the upstart Linux operating system like to joke that
their ultimate goal is world domination. They're getting there. In
fact, anyone with a Linux computer can create an interplanetary
empire, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   All the Linux user needs is a copy of Civilization: Call to
Power, a popular new computer game that lets the player launch a
campaign of cosmic conquest. Granted, it's a make-believe empire,
but the very fact that companies are releasing Linux versions of
their new computer games demonstrates how much market power Linux
has acquired in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent LinuxWorld trade show in San Jose, Calif., Linux
devotees lined up to play Civilization and two other popular
computer games _ Myth II and Railroad Tycoon II. Meanwhile, Linux
versions of the immensely popular Quake series of combat games are
now on sale.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Linux games is still small, but Scott Draeker
plans to change that. Draeker, a software licensing attorney, is
president of Loki Entertainment Software, a Tustin, Calif., company
that produced the Linux versions of Myth II and Railroad Tycoon II
and plans to keep rolling out Linux versions of major games.
</P>
<P>
   Draeker, a former customer support worker at Apple Computer
Inc., was a long-time fan of Apple's Macintosh computer. But after
years of slow Mac sales, most leading game makers stopped producing
Mac versions of their products. ``People were constantly
complaining that there were no games,'' Draeker said. At the same
time, Draeker grew disenchanted with Apple's management. ``I wanted
to leave the Mac behind,'' he said. Draeker switched his loyalty to
Linux because of its ``open source'' policy, which lets Linux users
modify the software to fit their own needs. Apple's Macintosh
software generally doesn't allow this.
</P>
<P>
   Draeker realized that when it came to games, Linux was in the
same boat as Macintosh _ virtually no major game companies offered
Linux versions of their products.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Loki to redress the balance. Draeker negotiates
licensing deals with the companies that created the original games.
These companies provide the original ``source code'' _ the raw
programming instructions that control each game. This code is then
modified so that it will run on a Linux machine, a process known as
``porting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's far easier to port a game than to build one from scratch.
Top-quality games can cost millions of dollars to produce and
require dozens of workers. By licensing existing games, Loki can
get into the business on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The game producers also profit from royalties on the sales of
Linux versions of their games. They get to sell their games to
Linux users, without having to bear the expense and complexity of
creating Linux versions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how large a market there is for Linux games. Linux
is mainly popular as an alternative to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT
operating system for running powerful server computers. Few people
run Linux on the home machines on which they play games.
</P>
<P>
   But Draeker said Linux is spreading beyond corporate server
machines and onto home desktops, in place of Microsoft's Windows 95
or Windows 98 software. He cited a report from Corel Corp. that a
million people have downloaded the Linux version of Corel's
WordPerfect word processing software. ``They're not running that on
a server,'' Draeker said.
</P>
<P>
   Loki is working on Linux versions of eight more games and is
constantly looking for new products to port to Linux. Draeker said
most game software makers are quite interested in working with his
company _ with one major exception: Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approached their booth at E3 (a leading electronic-industry
trade show) and asked them about porting Age of Empires,'' one of
Microsoft's most popular games. The response? ``I got a belly
laugh,'' said Draeker.

A FREE PC? READ THE FINE PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID EINSTEIN   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Several major computer stores are offering a $400 rebate on
practically any PC if you sign up for three years of Internet
access. This sounds like a terrific deal, since you need an
Internet provider anyway. What's your opinion of this offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: In general, I'd say that any time you can get a $400 rebate
you should take it. But there are a couple of potential drawbacks
to this ``free PC'' deal:
</P>
<P>
   _You could end up with lousy Internet service. Although the
companies involved are generally well known, including Prodigy,
CompuServe and the Microsoft Network, there's no guarantee they
will provide reliable access in your area. Over the past few years,
I've suffered busy signals and even no signal at all from several
ISPs (remember how unreliable AOL was for a while?).
</P>
<P>
   _In the next year or so, cable modem and/or DSL is going to
become available in most well-populated areas. You'll have to hope
that the ISP with whom you sign up now starts to offer one of these
high-speed options earlier rather than later. Also, when you
convert to high-speed, your monthly rate will go up, and you won't
have the luxury of being able to shop around for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   A few more words of warning: Read the fine print before you sign
up for a ``free PC,'' especially one being offered by a PC-maker,
since those companies tend to lump unnecessary add-ons and service
agreements into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is Micron. Its Micronfreeware.com offer charges
you extra for Microsoft Works _ a program that comes free with many
PCs _ and makes you sign up for a three-year repair service and a
three-year e-Additions Club membership, whatever that is. Bottom
line: Your free PC, including Internet access, ends up costing you
$1,087 ($1,308 if you pay by the month).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Clearing Shortcuts
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I delete a Microsoft Word file, it's still listed in the
Documents folder that's on the Windows start menu. If you click one
of these files, it searches for the file and finally reports that
the Shortcut has been changed or moved. The problem is that I can't
find a way to get these files out of Documents. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The Documents folder doesn't actually contain documents. It just
lists links to documents that you've used. But it's a pretty goofy
feature, because when you delete a document from your hard drive,
the link _ also known as a Shortcut _ stays in the Documents
folder, where it sits uselessly.
</P>
<P>
   To remove a Shortcut from the folder, right-click on it and
choose Delete. Or, you can empty the Documents folder entirely like
this: Click the Windows Start button, then point to Settings and
choose Taskbar &AMP; Start Menu. Tab over to Start Menu Programs and
click on the button labeled Clear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Busy Signal
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work online and have one phone line. Is there anything that
will tell me that people are trying to get through on the phone
while I'm online?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in luck, my friend, because there are a bunch of
solutions for your problem. The first thing you should do is check
with your telephone company and your Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   One or the other may offer Internet Call Waiting as an optional
feature that won't require you to buy any hardware. Expect to pay
about $5 a month for such a service.
</P>
<P>
   If Internet Call Waiting isn't available directly from your
carrier or ISP, you may be able to get it another way.
InfoInterActive, a Canadian company, has made its Internet Call
Manager service available in many parts of the United States. Go to
www.infointeractive.com to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   You can also solve your problem with gadgets like the $60 Call
Pending Indicator from Human Electronics
(www.humanelectronics.com), or the $80 HotCall HC2000 from Command
Communications (www.command-comm.com).
</P>
<P>
   These small devices work with the Call Waiting feature from your
phone company to make it possible to field incoming calls. However,
if you answer a call and talk for more than a few seconds, you're
going to lose your Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know what I think? Cough up the $18 a month for a second
phone line and write it off as a business expense if you can.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you want to delete a program from your PC, but the
program didn't come with an uninstall option. Don't fret.
</P>
<P>
   You can get rid of most programs made for Windows 95 or Windows
98 like this: Go to the Windows Start button, point to Settings and
Choose Control Panel. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon. On
the page titled Install/Uninstall, select the name of the program
you want to remove from the list and click Add/Remove.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer first beeped almost 50 years ago. It hasn't stopped
since. And now it's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers beep. Answering machines beep. ATMs beep. Elevators beep.
Phones beep. We have warning beeps, ready beeps and attention
beeps. There have been private and public beeps and beeps heard
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The beep has even entered the vernacular, courtesy of the
answering machine (``Leave your message after the beep ...'').
American society has been inundated by peppy beeps.
</P>
<P>
   The beep originally served as an alert. And for a long time,
only high-tech things beeped, like satellites and computers. But
today the most mundane things _ from children's toys to pens _ do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are moments of my day where I think: If hear another
beep, I think I am going to shoot the device,'' said Cindy Mason, a
computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, who
added that sometimes she hears more than 100 beeps in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   With its democratization over the last 40 years, the beep has
moved from cutting-edge chic to downright tacky. And it may be
headed for the scrap heap if sound designers have their way. ``The
time has come for the beep to die an honorable death,'' said B.J.
Fogg, a researcher at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   A small army of researchers, engineers and programmers has
declared war on the beep, which, they say, has overstayed its
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beeps have become like the little boy who cried wolf,'' said
Bruce Tognazzini, a human-computer interaction designer for the
Healtheon Corp. ``They are often ignored even when they might have
been useful. Having a computer that constantly emits the identical
sound whether it is just happy to see you or is on fire and about
to explode is akin to having a housemate that is similarly
afflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the beep continues to hold its ground. ``The downfall of the
beep is only in fiction,'' said Bill Buxton, chief scientist for
Alias/Wavefront, a software subsidiary of Silicon Graphics, and a
foe of the beep. ``In the real world, the beep is still thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer irritation caused by the beep is one reason for its
longevity. Research has shown that humans are bothered by sounds
that are sudden, high-pitched and short.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to design an annoying sound, you can't do much
better than a beep,'' said Bill Gavin, a researcher at the Royal
College of Art in England. Fogg described a beep as ``a poke in the
ribs, a simple but annoying method for gaining attention or
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer historians say that modern computer beeps evolved from
typewriter carriage return bells. Piercing beeps were substituted
as alert signals for the familiar ring of the bell. Today the
program code to make a computer beep is still called the bell
character.
</P>
<P>
   Why a beep, as opposed to a buzz or even a ding? The answer is
dictated by economics. ``Beeping is cheap,'' Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   A beep requires only two mechanical parts: an energy source and
something to vibrate. Beep sound waves are produced by the rapid
oscillation of on and off electrical pulses, in either a square
form or a sine wave form. In contrast, more complicated electronic
sounds require many more components.
</P>
<P>
   The 1957 launch of the Russian Sputnik satellite ushered in a
new era of celebrity for the beep. At the height of the Cold War,
American television and radio stations continually broadcast the
satellite's taunting signal as it blazed over United States soil
every 96 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound was something very remote, very powerful and very
frightening'' said James Katz, a Rutgers University professor who
was 9 years old at the time. ``After all, it was a man-made entity
in space over the United States. The beep made it much more real.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, beeps became most strongly associated with
high-powered mainframe computers, and for engineers and
technicians, they were a comforting and familiar sound. But when
computers breached mainstream workplaces, the beep began to lose
its luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers are very sensitive about not making mistakes, so the
beep gave the users an incredible psychological stress,'' said
Giordano Beretta, who worked as a bank computer support technician
in the 1970s. ``If you use a beep to signal a problem, people hate
it because they feel socially responsible for making a mistake.''
Beretta said he was regularly asked to disable beep features on the
computers.
</P>
<P>
   When bar code scanners were first introduced, many library and
supermarket employees often felt that beeps represented
management's measuring of their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Even appliances not designed to beep will chime in the chorus
given the right electrical impulses. In 1987 a utility company in
Dallas conducted an experiment using electrical transmission lines
to carry digital signals. As a result, all the electronic
appliances around the house of John Feagins began emitting a series
of soft beeps every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hear it out of the TV speakers,'' recalled Feagins, who
was a physics student at the University of Texas at the time. ``I'd
hear it out of the radio speakers. I'd hear it out of the stove. It
was everywhere in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his complaints to the utility, the beeping continued on
and off for about a year. ``I got aggravated enough to unplug
everything, because otherwise I couldn't sleep,'' Feagins said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that the proliferation of the beep has a
cultural basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, Americans believe that the device needs to
shout at you _ hence the loud beep,'' said Richard Giordano, a
computer science lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French, on the other hand, believe that the user should
not be distracted from solving the problem, that the device should
indicate the problem to the user in a calm manner and not get in
the way of solving the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why French nuclear power stations are much quieter than
American ones, Giordano said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of the beep is not simply a matter of eradicating
it; the beep has to be replaced with something else. Specialists
who work in ``human factors'' laboratories are looking to create
sounds that are less sharp and richer in timbre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pity people don't use chimes and bells more often,''
lamented John Murray, a human factors specialist at Exponent
Failure Analysis, a consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There are three main approaches to the design of information
tones. One is the earcon, an audio equivalent of an icon, which
uses different rhythms, pitches, timbres and melodies to
communicate different messages. Increasing a sound's tempo, for
example, makes it seem more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   A paralinguistic approach gives computers a library of nonspeech
tones used in human spoken communication (like ``uh-oh''). Finally,
audio icons use caricatures or simulations of naturally occurring
sounds _ like a burp _ that carry specific associations.
</P>
<P>
   The current trend is for high-tech companies to have their own
trademark sound _ a logo for the ears, like America Online's
``You've got mail'' and the ICQ instant messenger's peppy
``Uh-oh!''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's Macintosh computer was the first serious desktop assault
on the computer beep. Instead of using the simple grating tones,
users could choose from a host of alerts ranging from a quack to
the sound of a droplet.
</P>
<P>
   One Macintosh sound, called sosumi (``so sue me''), was a
pointed taunt at the Beatles' Apple Corps company, which threatened
legal action to prevent Apple Computer from releasing music under
the Apple name.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows platform also comes with a standard litany of sounds
to choose from. Screen savers and other programs let users
substitute sounds, from Homer Simpson's ``D'oh!'' to the ``Star
Wars'' theme song.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enmity it faces, the beep is still healthy, thanks
especially to answering machines and to personal pagers, which made
beeps mobile (much to the dismay of many churches and theaters).
</P>
<P>
   But pagers also contributed to the beeper backlash. Pagers were
originally the domain of an elite few who had to be reached
immediately, like doctors. ``A loud ring on such a device let
certain louts know, who might otherwise have remained unaware, that
the pagee was someone of money and distinction,'' noted Tognazzini,
of Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   When pagers became commonplace, their beeps became scorned
rather than respected. As a response to customer complaints,
companies introduced vibrating pagers, dealing the beep a major
blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vibration was huge,'' said Karen Holmes, a marketing manager
at Motorola. ``Consumers just loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Glassman, author of a book on techno-etiquette, says that
pagers should always be kept on vibrator mode while in public. She
adds that the only reason pagers still have a beep mode is ``so
that we don't have to call them vibrators.''
</P>
<P>
   The pager beep was displaced not only for reasons of etiquette
but also for practical reasons. Mono-frequency beeps are unnatural
to the ear, and psycho-acoustic research has shown that human ears
have great difficulty determining the direction the sound is coming
from, which is why it often seems difficult to find a misplaced
pager or cell phone in a room or to identify whose phone or pager
is sounding.
</P>
<P>
   To Buxton, of Alias/Wavefront, this is evidence that the beep's
days are numbered. ``When people start designing devices that
demonstrate subtle, well-designed sounds are less intrusive and
more effective than the beep, the beep will be shamed out of
existence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not going quietly. Even without a sound card, today's
desktop PCs can still belt out a primitive trill, which Eric
Isaacson, a technical writer at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
in Pullman, Wash., discovered much to his dismay.
</P>
<P>
   After Isaacson installed Windows NT on his office computer, the
machine suddenly began beeping loudly enough for officemates 10
feet away to hear. For four weeks, the support technicians at his
company could not figure out how to make it stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I just got a little irritated when it beeped at me,''
Isaacson said. But the situation soon escalated. ``Later,'' he
said, ``I started making it beep on purpose, after it beeped at me
first _ kind of the `I'll show you' attitude. This progressed to
the point of my stabbing at the keys to make it beep, taking out my
frustrations on the poor keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, through an online news group, he found a way to silence
the beep. ``Now my beep lets out not a peep,'' he said.

COURTS EMBRACE CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER HARTLAUB   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the suspect in a high-profile Yosemite
murder case was scheduled for an arraignment at the federal
courthouse in Fresno last month, staff members there braced for a
media circus of O.J. Simpson-trial proportions.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what they got: A pack of reporters, bulky
satellite trucks in the parking lot and even a legal pundit or two.
</P>
<P>
   But the least of their problems, surprisingly, has been meeting
the demand for records. Since the case broke, almost every legal
document related to the case of Cary Anthony Stayner has appeared
on the court's World Wide Web site an hour after filing.
</P>
<P>
   Posting records on the Web is a growing trend in California
courthouses, where the public can cut through multiple layers of
red tape with a few strokes on a computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern District federal courthouse, based in San
Francisco, has a Web site (www.cand.uscourts.gov) that is even more
advanced than the Fresno site and most others in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at the other Web sites,'' said Northern District
clerk Rich Wieking. ``Ours is as good as, if not better than, the
best of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If a federal court case breaks with as much public interest as
Stayner's, officials in the Northern District say they are ready to
post documents on the Web. Stayner is accused of killing a
researcher at the Yosemite National Park and reportedly confessed
to killing three visitors to the park earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other jurisdictions could have used such a service.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the document needs for the O.J. Simpson murder trial and
civil lawsuit was a hassle for the staff of the Los Angeles
Superior Court, who had to print numerous copies of inch-thick
documents, selling them for 57 cents per page.
</P>
<P>
   While the staff in the Eastern District managed to avoid that
nightmare, the Stayner case wasn't the first major news event to
get an assist by a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents from the case of Theodore Kaczynski, the
convicted Unabomber, have been on the Web for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having Kaczynski in our district, I wasn't looking
forward to having such a high-profile case,'' said Marianne
Matherly, deputy in charge of the U.S. District Court clerk's
office, who handles media requests for the Stayner case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it went quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northern District Web site includes detailed maps to each of
its courthouses, downloadable forms, court calendars for each judge
and new civil case filings, which are updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew J. Jacobs said prosecutors
juggle cases in different courtrooms and appreciate the Web access
to court calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very helpful,'' Jacobs said. ``I've used it, and I know
others have used it frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he hopes entire cases end up on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of paper that gets used in litigation, both
civil and criminal,'' Jacobs said. ``For some cases, (paperwork)
can end up filling a whole room, or several rooms.''

LIFE IN THE NOT-SO-FAST LANE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a 28.8K modem, but when I download
something, I download at 4.24K per second. Is there anything wrong
with my modem?
</P>
<P>
   _ Impatient
</P>
<P>
   DEAR IMP: Yes. You should go out immediately and buy a new one.
And I'm not saying that just because I'm trying to get a kickback
from 3Com. Well, that's not true, but because I haven't heard back
from them, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Your modem is capable of connecting at approximately 28.8
kilobits per second. Most browsers measure downloads in kilobytes
per second. A byte is composed of eight bits. I know, the math
still doesn't work out, even with all the extra bits that help
verify a successful download thrown in. Download speed not only
depends on how fast you're connected, but how fast the remote
location can serve up a file to you, and there are so many
variables involved, it's not even funny. Be satisfied with your
4.24, and thanks for blowing the 3Com deal. I wonder if anybody
from Rockwell was reading this. ...
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I downloaded a game from the Net, and when it
asked what program to open it with, I didn't know which, so I
clicked on Dr. Watson. How do I change the program I open this file
with? Every time I download a game or demo, it won't open because
of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Game Over
</P>
<P>
   DEAR OVER: Like the family cocker spaniel, Windows desperately
tries to please you. If it doesn't know how to do something, it
looks to you for guidance, which, in my case, explains why my
ex-dog thought drinking spilled beer on the floor was a good thing
and made everybody happy. In effect, you have told your cocker
spaniel to lick the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Windows tries to open programs based on file extensions. An EXE
extension means it's an executable file and should open or start
running on its own. Most downloads come that way. Something with a
ZIP extension is a zipped, or compressed, file, and you need a
special utility (WinZip32 is one) to open it. If you don't have the
utility, Windows asks you what to use instead. If you don't know
what to use, it's better to bail and try to figure out what you
really need.
</P>
<P>
   Open up ``My Computer'' and look for Folder Options in the View
menu. In there, you'll find File Types. This is where Windows
associates helper programs with file extensions. Just find the one
you added and delete it.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What impressed me about your recent comments
about America Online is that you immediately said that you really
were not informed, for example, referring to AOL's on-hold music as
``Muzak.'' If you have ever been on hold with AOL and listened to
the background music (soft volume, not loud!), then you would know
they play classical music. ``Scheherazade'' and ``1812 Overture''
are two I have heard on numerous occasions. I don't think either of
them would be on the top of Muzak's easy-listening list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Classical Gas
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CLASS: You know, it's so much easier for me when people
hold themselves up to ridicule instead of having me do it. Thanks
for the break. Hope you get through to an AOL tech soon!
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Bombay is looking for the Muzak version of ``Stairway to
Heaven'' to put on his voice mail, but will settle for anything by
the Go-Gos (soft volume, not loud!). He can be reached at
drbombay(at)star-telegram.com or via snail mail to Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX 76101. Fax: (817) 390-7257.

COMPANY TO PRODUCE FILM FOR INTERNET RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a sign of growing interest in the Internet as a
way of distributing movies, the company that produced ``What Dreams
May Come'' has agreed to produce a film that will be initially
released through the Web, executives said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While many films are available on the Internet, backers of this
project said it represented one of the first times that a movie by
an established filmmaker was being made specifically for initial
Internet distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is being made by Metafilmics, a four-year-old company
that specializes in entertainment with spiritual themes. Its first
theatrical movie, last year's ``What Dreams May Come,'' starred
Robin Williams and won an Academy Award for best visual effects.
The Internet movie, called ``The Quantum Project,'' will be about a
physicist who has a mystical experience and will be directed by
Francis Glebas, the director of ``Fantasia 2000,'' a forthcoming
movie from Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Barnet Bain, a co-founder of Metafilmics, said the company was
interested in the new artistic possibilities presented by the
Internet and by the chance to be its own distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the most glorious opportunity to have an extremely
new canvas and be among the first to do it,'' Bain said. But he
conceded that the company was hedging its bets: The $3 million
budget is tiny by Hollywood standards. ``It's important that we
stretch ourselves but not sink the ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie will be distributed by Sightsound.com, a Web site that
will charge a fee to people who want to download the movie,
probably a few dollars for someone who wants access to the movie
for, say, one to five days. An actual purchase would be more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quantum Project'' is scheduled to be available next May
and will rely heavily on computer-generated animation, even though
it will be a live-action film. It will be more than 40 minutes long
but perhaps not as long as a full-length feature to minimize
downloading time, Bain said. He said the company hoped it Could
still show the movie in theaters even after its debut on the Web,
perhaps by adding more visual effects for the theater version. The
movie would also be available for television and home video.
</P>
<P>
   Sightsound.com is one of several start-ups trying to offer
movies over the Internet and generating interest in the movie
business.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Atomfilms, which specializes in short films,
has attracted investments from Warner Brothers, Allen &AMP; Co., the
media industry investment banking company, and Frank Biondi, the
former chief executive of Universal Studios. Atomfilms, based in
Seattle, announced agreements Monday to distribute some of its
films through Warner Brothers Online, NBC's Snap.com and Real
Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, full-length movies take hours, even more than a day,
to download using a conventional modem. The picture can be jerky
and is confined to a small box on the screen. This is hardly a
match for a movie theater or even a videocassette seen on a
television.
</P>
<P>
   But as high-speed Internet connections grow more common, those
barriers are expected to fall. Hollywood studios are watching
warily, anxious to make sure they do not lose control of
distribution, as record companies have to some extent. Indeed,
pirated films like the recent ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace'' are now available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, most of the movies legally available online
tend to be older movies, or B movies, or those made by small
filmmakers who lack other means of distribution. The mainstream
Hollywood studios have used the Internet to publicize films, not to
distribute them. The value of the Internet for publicity was made
clear with the runaway success of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a
small-budget picture that has become a smash hit because of
excitement built up through a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the new agreement seems to indicate growing interest in the
Internet by filmmakers who can get their fare into theaters. ``It's
easy to get B, campy horror movies for Internet distribution,''
said Scott Sander, president of Sightsound.com, which is based in
Mt. Lebanon, Pa. ``It's nice to get something that's uplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   SightSound.com earlier this year offered on its site the movie
``Pi,'' which had been in theaters. But Scott Sander, the president
of the company, said it had been difficult so far to attract
mainstream movies. Its Web site now offers ten films with titles
like ``DOA,'' ``Troma Toxic Container'' and ``Reefer Madness.''

alternative high-speed connection to the Net's backbone is UUNet.
But that offer comes with an asterisk: UUNet is a wholly owned
subsidiary of MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet providers contacted by representatives of UUNet
expressed anger that they were not told during the sales pitch
about the relationship between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea when they called they were part of the same
company,'' said Phyllis Porta, owner of LA Connections of Santa
Clarita, Calif., an Internet provider serving 500 customers. She
said that MCI Worldcom's ownership of UUNet should have been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, MCI Worldcom said UUNet controlled its own,
separate high-speed access to the Internet backbone and thus was
not selling access to the same network that was disrupted for 10
days starting Aug. 5. Linda Laughlin, a company spokeswoman, said
it was not uncommon for divisions within MCI Worldcom, the United
States' No. 2 long-distance company, to have ``channel conflict,''
meaning they compete for the same customers.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom last week attributed blame for the failure to an
upgrade of software made by Lucent Technologies Inc. About 30
percent of MCI Worldcom's high-speed network customers were
affected, and on the weekend of Aug. 14-15 the company took the
network down altogether for 24 hours to restore stability.
</P>
<P>
   UUNet's overtures represented competition not just to its
corporate cousins but in some cases to MCI Worldcom customers, like
DataXchange, which buys network access wholesale from MCI Worldnet
and sells it to 150 Internet providers. About 66 of its customers
were blacked out completely during MCI Worldcom's partial failure.

   Latest Offer in Overseas Calls: Free but Not Commercial-Free
</P>
<P>
   And now, free international phone calls _ if you can tolerate a
15-second advertisement at the beginning of each call, followed by
another ad interrupting the conversation every three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That is the proposition behind a very young, very small start-up
called Cortex Telecom, based in New York. For now, Cortex offers
free calling between only five cities _ Brussels, London, Miami,
New York and Paris. But the company is seeking $15 million from
venture capitalists and plans to use the money to expand its
network to dozens of other cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The service is fairly simple to use. In each of its five cities,
Cortex has a local access number. A would-be user calls, answers
about 20 demographic questions and then receives a code to use for
calls to any of the other four cities. (Oddly, it is not possible
to sign up at the company's Web site, www.cortextelecom.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The only fee borne by the user is the cost of a local call to a
Cortex access number, and the user can talk as long as he or she
wants. But every three minutes, a 15-second advertisement is
played, and it is not possible to talk over the advertisement.
Among Cortex's initial advertisers in English are the Ronald
McDonald House, the Flatotel in New York (where Cortex is based)
and Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about five minutes of every hour is given over to
advertising. In contrast to the 13 minutes of every hour devoted to
advertisements on another free service, prime-time broadcast
television (including promotions for coming shows and public
service announcements), five minutes seems relatively unintrusive.
</P>
<P>
   But just because consumers are willing to accept interruptions
during passive viewing of fare like ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza
Place,'' that does not necessarily mean they will accept
interruptions in their international conversations. A company
called Broadpoint offers free domestic long-distance calls, but its
customers generally have to listen to advertisements only before
the call begins.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Another Free Offering From a Web-Site Operator
</P>
<P>
   If your mother sends you unsolicited advertising, is it still
junk mail?
</P>
<P>
   This and perhaps other questions arise as a result of a Miami
start-up that is offering to transform postal service from a model
based on stamps to one based on advertising. On the Web, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The company: Postage4free.com.
</P>
<P>
   The concept: Starting Monday, the company is giving away 10
stamps and 10 envelopes to people who visit its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: The envelopes have advertisements. Some of these are
attached with perforation, which the sender rips off. Others are
printed on the back and inside.
</P>
<P>
   But in this instance, the price of a 33-cent stamp and an
envelope is a bit more than just having to look at an ad. To sign
up, participants must answer nine demographic questions about
things like their interests and hobbies, ownership of pets, and
whether they wear glasses or contact lenses. The envelopes they
receive are supposed to carry ads selected to match those
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Krop, the company's president and a co-founder, said
the idea behind gathering demographic data to personalize the ads
was that ``people are getting coupons they can actually use.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, at this point, consumers may have to settle for whichever
advertisers the company can sign up. Krop said Postage4free.com was
still trying to sell the positions.
</P>
<P>
   As for your mother, Krop said that Postage4free's envelopes did
not qualify as junk mail, because people were participating
voluntarily. But what about the recipients of the letters, who
presumably had not agreed to participate?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' he allowed. Apparently lacking a
good answer, he noted: ``There is no clutter or waste with our
product. And the front of the envelope is completely white.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother would no doubt be proud.

MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSIONS DRIVE NET TOWARD GRIDLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a nation's highway system, the Internet has traffic rules
that prevent chaos and gridlock. But an increasingly popular type
of multimedia traffic is turning out to be a cyber road hog that
flouts the rules and creates traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   This scofflaw traffic, known as streaming media, is widely
hailed as the future of home entertainment, capable of eventually
delivering high-quality audio and video programming over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, network experts warn, it may drive everyone else
off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming media is analogous to broadcast media in that the
audio or video material is produced as soon as a computer receives
the data over the Internet. The problem is that the streaming data
does not respond to network congestion in the way other Internet
traffic does.
</P>
<P>
   When a computer sending conventional data encounters congestion,
it significantly slows its own transmission rate, but a computer
sending streaming data will reduce the flow only slightly. So if
streaming traffic competes with conventional traffic for the same
congested strip of roadway, the streaming traffic, like some VIP
motorcade, assumes the right of way and lets all other data traffic
pile up.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, said Van Jacobson, chief scientist for Cisco
Systems Inc., a leading maker of Internet traffic routers, is that
conventional traffic ``is polite; this stuff is impolite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People writing software for that traffic _ they don't care,''
Jacobson said of streaming media. ``In the long term, it's a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   By its very nature, streaming media has to flow continuously to
the user's computer, so it cannot follow the same traffic rules as
conventional data. But even so, it is possible for packets of
streaming data to interact civilly with other traffic on the
Internet. The reason they do not, Jacobson said, is that streaming
media providers have no incentive to comply with traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, ``if Real Networks is polite and Microsoft
isn't, then Real looks crummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even elbowing all other data aside, today's streaming media
produces a very low quality of entertainment most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that lack of quality today is a result of slow modems at
the user's end. In three to five years, when cable modems and
souped-up digital telephone lines are expected to be common, most
Internet users may be listening to live Webcasts or playing
high-quality radio on their computers. In 10 years, movies and
commercial television might very well be carried over Internet
channels.
</P>
<P>
   This increasing demand will add vast amounts of streaming
traffic to the Internet and could lead to what Jacobson calls
``congestion collapse'' _ the Internet equivalent of gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers are also concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blake, vice president for marketing and business
development for AT&AMP;T Labs Research, calls the trend disturbing,
adding, ``What people are saying is, `If my stuff gets through,
that's all I care about.''' He said AT&AMP;T and other Internet service
providers were pressuring the producers of streaming media to head
off the problem before it grows out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming media traffic is also of growing concern to the
Internet Engineering Task Force, an industry group that is the
closest thing the Internet has to a governing technical body.
Jacobson, an active task force participant, said the group has not
yet formally addressed the issue, because ``it's not big enough to
kill the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet anyway. But a number of Internet service providers are
getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said he would like to see streaming media use
congestion controls that are compatible with those used for
conventional data-packet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, according to measurements by the National Laboratory for
Applied Network Research at the University of California at San
Diego, none of the existing streaming media providers are using
such controls.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks, the largest streaming media provider, declined to
respond to the growing criticism, although a spokesman, Jay
Wampold, said the company was trying to address congestion
problems. Over the last year, he said, Real Networks had installed
a network of computers for delivering the company's broadcasts that
bypasses the Internet's main traffic routes.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Unangst, lead product manager for Windows Media, the
streaming media division at Microsoft Corp., said the company was
working with network companies to route its streaming data around
the Internet's main arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know bandwidth and optimizing bandwidth is a huge, huge
issue,'' Unangst said, using an industry term for transmission
capacity, ``and we're covering all the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson said that while actions like those taken by Real
Networks and Microsoft might help, they would not resolve the
problem. The bottlenecks are not on the main thoroughfares, he
said, but on the side streets and access roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get out to the edge of network, closer to users, that's
where the bandwidth gets limited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While cable modems and digital subscriber lines will increase
bandwidth to the home, a truly significant increase in Internet
bandwidth would require ripping out 300 million copper wires and
replacing them with fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen fast,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy, experts say, lies in providing incentives for
streaming media providers to comply with traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
   With the proper incentive structure in place, streaming material
from both Microsoft and Real Networks would look slightly worse
than it does now, Jacobson said, but at least the competition for
bandwidth would be fairer.
</P>
<P>
   As a standards-setting organization, the Internet Engineering
Task Force does not have legal authority to force software
developers to adopt congestion-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   But standards, which enable all the computers linked to the
Internet to talk to one another, can sometimes be used to
discourage disruptive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the tragedy of the commons,'' said Sally Floyd, a
researcher at the AT&AMP;T Center for Internet Research at the
International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif. ``Only
with the right incentive structure do the right things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tragedy of the commons'' is an example from economic game
theory. If a group of farmers must graze their cattle in the same
small patch of grass, or commons, it is in the farmers' collective
interest not to overgraze, lest all the grass die out and all the
cows starve. The problem is that it is in each individual farmer's
interest to act counter to the common good.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ordinary Internet traffic _ e-mail and data transmissions to and
from Web sites, for example _ follows a basic set of traffic laws
known as the transmission control protocol, or TCP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, when rising Net traffic led to severe
congestion problems, TCP has included a congestion-control
mechanism that instructs a transmitting computer to slow the data
flow by half as soon as the data it is sending encounters
congestion. Only when the congestion clears does the data speed up
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting is that congestion itself is effectively
the error signal that gives the sender the feedback to speed up or
slow down,'' said Robert J. Berger, president of Internet Bandwidth
Development, a consulting firm in Saratoga, Calif. ``It means that
there will almost always be at least a bit of congestion, but
that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not OK when traffic that conforms to TCP runs into
traffic that does not follow those same rules. When the point of
congestion is reached, TCP traffic cuts its sending rate in half.
But streaming traffic just barrels through the stoplights. This in
turn creates more congestion, which further slows the law-abiding
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming media traffic ``needs to back off,'' said Scott
Shenker, head of the AT&AMP;T Center for Internet Research in Berkeley.
``I think most researchers feel it's a flaw in the Internet
architecture that there's no way to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Shenker and Jacobson believe the solution to the streaming
media problem is to build incentives into the architecture to
encourage good behavior. But they have very different ideas of what
form those incentives should take.
</P>
<P>
   Shenker prefers to plant a mechanism within Internet routers
that he calls ``fair queuing,'' which would force packets sent from
different sources to wait their turn to be sent.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's proposal, developed with Ms. Floyd in 1989 and only
now being tested in Cisco routers, uses a kind of virtual penalty
box. When the router experiences congestion, it takes a random
sample of its traffic. If a certain host computer is
overrepresented in that sample, its packets are placed at the end
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   This creates the right incentive structure, he said, because the
Internet service providers do not have to persuade Real Networks or
any other company to obey the rules. Rather, he says, ``The
customers do instead, because the quality'' of their audio and
video ``gets really crummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair queuing and penalty boxes rely on software fixes to change
the incentives. Another approach, favored by many service
providers, is to create economic incentives for fair sharing of the
roadways. The basic idea is that heavy users should be paying for
the extra bandwidth that they consume.
</P>
<P>
   This model, known as differential service, is already being
deployed on the Internet. But there are many questions about how it
should be adapted to streaming media _ especially about who should
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real puzzle about streaming media is who is going to make
the money _ if we knew this, then we could answer a lot of the
technical questions,'' said David Clark, a senior research
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory
for Computer Science.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever solution is eventually adopted, the streaming media
problem is certain to be resolved, these experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Internet that's growing and can handle streaming media is
in everyone's interests,'' said Blake of AT&AMP;T Labs. ``We poke each
other with sharp sticks all the time, but slowly we move forward.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to a combination of foresight, luck and good timing,
Richard Forman has won the right to boast. His company,
Register.com, is the first and most aggressive player in the game
of breaking up the monopoly on Internet address registrations that
a Virginia company, Network Solutions Inc., has enjoyed for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting gate is still closed to the more than 250
companies expected eventually to compete in what is stacking up to
be a risky venture even by Internet standards.
</P>
<P>
   One big unknown is how far registration fees will drop from the
$70 Network Solutions charges for an initial two-year registration
as more competitors enter the arena. An even bigger gamble is that
key rules for the game remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those rules will be decided this week when the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, the nonprofit
corporation charged with introducing competition into the business
of registering names ending in the popular domains of .com, .net
and .org, holds its fourth board meeting in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The group is expected to approve a uniform dispute resolution
policy that the companies will have to follow in cases of
cybersquatting _ the practice of registering domain names just to
hold them in hopes of making a profit _ and other tangles over
trademark issues. The policy will be play a large role in
determining what legal liabilities the new competitors will
ultimately face.
</P>
<P>
   Other important issues also remain the subject of protracted
negotiations between Network Solutions, based in Herndon, Va., and
the Department of Commerce, which chose Icann last year to run the
Internet's addressing system and to establish the framework for
introducing competition to Network Solutions' cash-cow monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include contract terms for allowing competing
companies to register addresses in the master data base of domains
that Network Solutions will continue to administer _ including how
much they will pay Network Solutions as a service fee for each name
they register.
</P>
<P>
   Although the delays and uncertainties have a number of potential
competitors in a holding pattern, they have provided an unexpected
bonus for Register.com, which was one of five companies chosen in
April to participate in a pilot round of competition with Network
Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com, the first of the five to go live, won't say how
many names it has already registered. But Forman, insists that the
numbers are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the second largest registrar in the world,'' he says
with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com has competed aggressively with Network Solutions in
what are expected to be important areas of the business _ like
providing customer service and computer operations for running Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com has entered into partnerships with nearly 20
companies, including Staples and Mastercard, giving it a link on
their Web sites and offering services related to building a Web
site. It also has partnerships with 30 Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   But like the registration of domain names themselves, those are
all areas where Network Solutions has had a head start.
</P>
<P>
   With the exclusive right since 1993 to register addresses that
end in .com, .net and .org at $70 each, Network Solutions has
reported snowballing profits for the last 11 quarters. Anticipating
competition, it has spent much of the last two years building
international partnerships and new services aimed at small
businesses that want to build a Web presence. Network Solutions now
has more than 500 employees and averages 400,000 new domain name
registrations a month.
</P>
<P>
   Register.com, by contrast, has about 100 employees and a lot
less cash. But Forman is confident that when the dust has settled,
he'll be on top. ``I spent a lot of money building these systems; I
know how much they cost,'' he said. ``You're going to see a lot of
companies that just can't do the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Merenbloom, an Internet analyst with Prudential Securities,
agrees in part with that assessment. ``The potential here is for a
very large industry,'' he said, ``but it is likely to be controlled
by _ or rather comprised of _ a few rather successful companies,
some largely successful, a few moderately successful companies and
a large number of nominally successful companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think Rich has positioned himself in the first
heat, and, given the inevitable issues and delays, he and others in
the first group have a natural time advantage. That's not to say
that over time the playing field won't level. I think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   But while those delays offer some advantages to the first five
companies, they are also making it difficult for them and for other
potential competitors to develop solid business plans and raise
capital, Merenbloom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear what the requirements are to be successful _
other than quality service at a reasonable price,'' he said. ``The
real issue right now is that nobody wants to do the wrong thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture are Internet giants like America
Online, which is also participating in the pilot round of
competition. Like the other bigger companies in that group _ France
Telecom and Melbourne IT _ it has done little yet to kick off the
business and has said even less about what its plans are or whether
it will try to go head-to-head with Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Stubbs, chairman of the only nonprofit group participating
in the test round of competition, the Internet Council of
Registrars, said a lot of people were ``waiting to see what comes
out of these negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know how much money you are going to make next
week, it's hard to sign a lease on a new apartment,'' Stubbs said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ For years, Timothy Koogle built
high-performance cars and raced them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love speed,'' he says. ``And I love well-built, highly
engineered machines.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Koogle is the chief executive of Yahoo, and his
board won't let him take the risk. But the same impulses that
inspire his passion for fast cars have helped build Yahoo into the
well-tuned machine that paces the Internet pack.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 million people visit Yahoo worldwide each month _
traffic that will help it sell about $500 million in advertising
this year, up from $208 million in 1998. And even after a 40
percent drop in its stock price since April, Yahoo has a market
value of $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for Yahoo's success. In the early days of
the Web, in 1994, its founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo, came up
with a good idea while avoiding writing their computer science
dissertations at Stanford University _ a handmade directory of Web
sites. And they picked a great name.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Koogle, 48, whose predilection for speed belies an
understated and analytical demeanor, who figured out how to make
Yahoo a business. Like the top executives of most companies that
operate on Internet time, he insists on running flat out. Unlike
most, he has also steered a straight course, never allowing Yahoo
to drift from its ambitious but simple business model, even as
other Web start-ups bounced from fad to fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the outside, Yahoo is a fun and irreverent place,'' Yang
said, ``but on the inside we are extremely competitive people who
are very disciplined and serious about growing.'' Referring to
Koogle by his nickname, he added, ``T.K. has ingrained in all of us
that whatever we do, it should speed us up, not slow us down.''
</P>
<P>
   An engineer with no background in media companies, Koogle
concluded soon after he was hired in 1995 that Yahoo's biggest
opportunity lay in offering a free advertising-supported service.
That model is almost universal today, but at the time, creators of
other search sites thought they could charge money for software or
even for searches.
</P>
<P>
   And he was the first to map a strategy for expanding a search
engine from a simple way to find things on the Internet to the kind
of broader service that has come to be known as a portal, mixing
products like free e-mail with specialized information areas like
the popular Yahoo finance site. What is more, he planned not only
to do this in dozens of countries but to do it while earning a
profit _ a distinct rarity among Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most fundamental difference, however, is that Koogle
insisted that Yahoo stay obsessively independent, essentially the
Switzerland of the Internet. In its early, cash-starved days, that
meant turning down eager suitors willing to pay for the right to be
the exclusive provider of one thing or another. Recently, it has
also rebuffed overtures from huge conglomerates interested in
marrying Yahoo to their broadcasting or publishing properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of the long term and a big fan of discipline,''
Koogle said recently. ``If you are short term in your thinking,
people will wave checks at you and you will take them. We've seen
our competition do that. Our users value us because we are a
trusted, independent, comprehensive source.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some wonder whether Koogle's stubborn independence can
survive the cutthroat market battles that lie ahead, especially
redoubled competition from Microsoft Corp.'s MSN and America
Online, both of which offer Internet access and browser software as
well as a broad range of online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo's problem is that it needs to be bought,'' insists Barry
Schuler, who runs most of the online services for America Online.
``Yahoo's management is great, but the portal model has failed.
It's just a feature of something bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all the other search engines have rushed to align with
larger partners. Excite was bought by At Home Corp., which is
largely owned in turn by AT&AMP;T and other cable companies. Infoseek
is being acquired by Walt Disney Co. Snap is controlled by General
Electric Co.'s NBC subsidiary. And in the spring, Lycos agreed to a
complex marriage with USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, these deals have created nothing but drag.
Lycos was forced to cancel its merger after investors complained.
Disney has had to revamp its deal with Infoseek after a slow start
for the partners' new Go Network service. And Excite, long Yahoo's
most vigorous competitor, is now caught in a family feud between
AT&AMP;T and the other owners of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle has preferred to play the role of acquirer. He courted
Excite earlier this year until At Home snatched it away from him,
and then immediately bought Geocities, the big community-based Web
service, and Broadcast.com, an Internet audio and video service.
Those deals have expanded Yahoo's offerings, audience and market
value while preserving its cherished neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could own them and have them still be as
successful,'' said James Murdoch, the president of News America
Digital, the arm of News Corp. that runs Internet services for Fox
News and Fox Sports and has a number of nonexclusive promotional
deals with Yahoo. ``People don't want to go to a portal and only
see Fox properties or NBC properties. The reason Yahoo has done so
well is that they are independent _ and they have been religious
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Koogle says his ideas about management were inspired by the
self-reliant work ethic of his father, a fireman and machinist for
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said nobody owes you anything, so go out and earn what you
want,'' Koogle said, ``so I've been making money since I was 7
years old.'' In high school, he worked fixing machines at
McDonald's and repairing cars with his father.
</P>
<P>
   As an engineering student at Stanford, he rebuilt the engines of
other students' cars _ ``rich kids with plenty of money to pay to
have them fixed correctly,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His other passion is music. During less hectic periods in his
life, he played in several rock bands. And now, divorced with no
children, Koogle will pick up one of the several guitars strewn
around his office or his bedroom to relieve the stress of a
round-the-clock work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle's love of machines spurred him to start a business while
he was a graduate student in 1978 making controllers for
electronics manufacturing. He eventually sold the business to
Motorola. He next moved to Intermec _ then an ailing subsidiary of
Raytheon _ which makes bar-code scanners, as chief engineer and,
later, president.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning Intermec to take the helm of Yahoo was a significant
gamble. In 1995, the Internet was largely a curiosity, a blank
slate with no successful business models. He set out to create a
corporate culture that tempered big-company ambitions with an
entrepreneur's focus on financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have conversations with people asking, `Why do you
bother with profits?''' Koogle said. ``But I've had enough
experience to know at a gut level that if you don't build a company
from the start to be profitable, you're never going to be able to
get profitable later.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo achieved its first profitable quarter in September 1997,
and reported an operating profit of $28 million in the most recent
quarter, excluding the charges associated with its acquisitions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite its success, the company still prides itself on
penny-pinching. Executives will cut out of meetings early to catch
the last flight home and save the cost of a hotel room. Salaries,
from top to bottom, are low by Silicon Valley standards. The
payback, of course, is stock options; Koogle's are worth nearly
half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For a workaholic, guitar-playing, race-car-driving,
demi-billionaire, Koogle comes off as surprisingly serene. He
speaks slowly, methodically, with quiet, self-effacing humor. On a
bright morning a few months ago, smoking a cigarette outside
Yahoo's headquarters, sporting black jeans, a denim shirt and a
mane of gray hair, he looked more like an aging rock 'n' roller,
which of course, he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not one of those ego-CEOs who try to micromanage
everything,'' said Karen Edwards, Yahoo's marketing head. ``He is
easy to talk to, but it always seems like he's pondering life's
true meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, operating details are delegated to the staff of young
producers, while strategy is still forged in spirited late-night
debates among Koogle, Yang and Jeff Mallett, the company's chief
operating officer. Despite their different styles, the three men
have, by all accounts, developed an easy working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   As intense as Koogle is laid back, Mallett, 34, oversees the
company's operations. Yang is often Yahoo's face to the outside
world and its designated worrywart, pondering the next wave on the
Web. His very private cofounder, Filo, helps manage the company's
vast computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's management has anticipated _ or invented _ most of the
major shifts in the short but chaotic history of the Internet. Last
year the company's big push was to develop services like e-mail,
customized news pages and chat rooms, all of which force users to
register their names and other valuable demographic information.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is developing a suite of services for businesses,
including advertising, e-mail and online store software, built on
its vast store of data about users.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo's penny-pinching ways caused it to fumble the
attempted acquisition of its archrival, Excite, according to
executives involved in the negotiations. At a pivotal bargaining
session, Yahoo appeared to back off from some of its earlier terms.
This prompted Excite to open parallel talks with At Home, which
quickly raised the bid, with one condition: Excite could not give
Yahoo a chance to counter.
</P>
<P>
   Learning its lesson perhaps too well, Yahoo swung the other way
in its next deal, offering a big premium over Geocities' existing
share price on the condition that the company agree within a day.
Only six weeks later, it made a similar pre-emptive bid for
Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals have not been universally popular among investors.
So far, advertisers have shown little interest in Geocities pages,
which are all created by amateurs. And most of Broadcast.com's
revenue has come from running Internet conference calls for
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle argues that Yahoo can tap its large sales force and
database marketing prowess to increase the advertising revenue from
both services.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest question, though, is whether the company is
positioned to thrive in a world of high-speed Internet access
provided by cable, telephone and satellite companies, which are
forming alliances with programming providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for Yahoo to keep its brand front and center,''
said Shaun Andrikopoulos, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex.
Brown. ``That will be difficult to do, because they don't control
the front screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Koogle asserts that even high-speed customers will bypass the
front door provided by their cable or phone company and seek out
Yahoo because of its broader offerings and, more important, because
fast connections play to the strengths of multimedia programming
from Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are multiple technologies, multiple providers,'' he
said, ``and we think that there is a great benefit for us to remain
independent.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The organizing drive among the engineers at the Pratt &AMP; Whitney
factory in Palm Beach, Fla., was a home-grown affair. The
leadership of the aspiring union, the Florida Professional
Association, knew it had a difficult job, and in an early appeal
stressed that ``just because we are seeking change doesn't mean
we're radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   While they may not have been radicals, they did employ a novel
tactic: They sent their appeals to all of the factory's 2,000
engineers at their company e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got away with about 10'' of the mass mailings, said Kenneth
Coolidge, the union treasurer, ``before the company found out and
objected.'' Those objections led to the suspension of Coolidge and
the union's president, Brian Waldron, for using the company's
e-mail system for what was deemed personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, more than two years after the suspensions, the union
in Florida agreed to withdraw a complaint accusing Pratt &AMP; Whitney
of using unfair labor practices in return for the company's pledge
to allow the limited use of its system for such e-mail in the
future. And both sides along the labor-management divide are
looking to this settlement for signs of how friendly an environment
cyberspace _ particularly the cyberspace surrounding corporate
offices and factories _ will be for the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   While some union officials have been emboldened by the
settlement, others say they will tread lightly until there is a
greater consensus about the rules for contacting employees via
corporate e-mail addresses. And all the while, companies are
fighting to keep their systems off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail has become common in many workplaces that unions are
eager to organize, including those at software companies and in
other high-technology industries. And unions have found it an
unusually effective organizing tool, one that combines the intimacy
of a conversation, the efficiency of mass-produced leaflets and the
precision of delivery by mail to work forces that are often widely
dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves time, it saves money,'' said Michael Blain of the
Washington Alliance of Technical Workers, or WASHTECH, an affiliate
of the Communication Workers of America that is trying to organize
software workers in the state of Washington. ``We can reach 1,300
people by just hitting `send.'''
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders at Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a unit of United
Technologies Corp., who ultimately failed in their drive to
organize the Palm Beach plant, said they had used e-mail to respond
quickly to management statements. ``If you get the information out
quick, the bureaucracy has to be more accountable,'' Coolidge said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies may find it galling to see unions capitalize on
corporate e-mail systems to organize workers. When nonemployees
send e-mail to organize, some say, that should be considered
trespass, and when employees receive union e-mail at work, it will
invariably be read on company time, a practice that they say labor
law should prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail from unions does interfere with employers' expectation
that work time is for work,'' said Frank Morris, a lawyer who
represents management in labor disputes. ``The unions are trying to
make extraordinary use of a tool that didn't exist until recently
for their benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies also contend that any mass e-mailing, even if about
work conditions or union organizing, is an intrusion comparable to
the ``spamming'' done by commercial outfits. Intel recently
persuaded a California Superior Court judge to order a former
employee, Ken Hamidi, to stop sending e-mail messages to its
employees by invoking common law about trespass. (Hamidi has
appealed the ruling.) According to court papers, Hamidi sent more
than 30,000 e-mail messages about the company's employment policies
in six bursts between 1996 and 1998 while avoiding the company's
efforts to thwart him.
</P>
<P>
   The California court's decision has angered free-speech
advocates who say e-mail is useful precisely because it is not
trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is potentially a solution to a previously insoluble
dilemma,'' said Lewis Maltby of the American Civil Liberties
Union's employment rights office. ``Employees have a right to
organize and employers don't have to allow trespassers. But now
employees have a way of learning about unions without trespassing
on the employers' property.''
</P>
<P>
   Some organizers are eager to test how far they can go. ``We have
e-mailed, and thought about using e-mail in organizing drives,''
said George Kohl, research director for the Communications Workers
of America. ``But the context we work in is that we don't own'' the
company's e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the union did not contact anyone at a corporate
e-mail address during its successful campaign this month to
organize 10,000 passenger service employees of US Airways Group
Inc. Instead, it relied on a bulletin board at the union Web site,
Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman, said. ``We don't use corporate
e-mail,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``We just think there are better ways
to do it without the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   A more common use of e-mail at the Communications Workers of
America, said Suman Ray, a research economist there, is to build up
a network among people already committed to the cause. That way
there is no concern of antagonizing noncooperative employees who
might inform management about the unsolicited messages.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft Corp., for example, WASHTECH organizers have
collected a list of 1,300 supporters, including nearly 200 people
who gave Microsoft e-mail addresses. (While the other 1,100
presumably work at Microsoft and other software companies in the
area, organizers said, most gave home e-mail addresses.) ``We don't
worry about sending to Microsoft addresses,'' Blain said, although
he added that he thought the company had the ability to block out
any messages coming from WASHTECH.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the National Labor Relations Board, he added,
``That's not the direction the NLRB is heading, and if Microsoft
were to discriminate, that is illegal.'' A Microsoft spokesman
declined to comment on the company's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even at unionized companies, there are no clear guidelines for
union access to corporate e-mail systems; increasingly it is
becoming another bargaining issue.
</P>
<P>
   A shop steward of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, which represents engineers and technical workers at
Boeing Co. of Seattle, was recently given a written warning for
sending a message to 80 or so workers about ``a workplace issue at
that location,'' said Phyllis Rogers, the union's general counsel.
She said the union understood that such communication would be
permitted if directed at fewer than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rogers said the union, which represents 25,000 professional
workers, mainly in the Puget Sound area, had formed a negotiating
committee to address the issue. The union's current contract
expires on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokeswoman, Amanda Landers, would not discuss the
specific dispute but said that in general, Boeing allowed
nonbusiness e-mail only for ``incidental, personal use.'' Ms.
Rogers, the union lawyer, said, ``We are offended that our
correspondence should be considered the same as any other e-mails,
because we have a legal relationship with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pratt &AMP; Whitney case, the company conceded in an e-mail
dated July 6 that employees can use e-mail to ``initiate a response
or reciprocal discussion, relating to terms and conditions of
employment, and the employee's interest in self-organization'' as
long as the use was ``occasional, incidental and infrequent.'' But
since that agreement was made without a ruling from the NLRB, which
referees union organizing, it is not precedent-setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases are bubbling up,'' said Fred Feinstein, the
general counsel for the labor relations board, whose office decides
whether to file complaints against companies for unfair labor
practices. In a recent report summarizing important issues coming
before the board, Feinstein made it clear that he considered the
right to use e-mail to be protected under the National Labor
Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said he believed that in at least some cases, e-mail
is best compared to ``solicitation,'' one-on-one conversation
typically permitted in factories during work breaks anywhere on
company property, instead of ``distribution'' of literature, which
can typically be more closely regulated. (Of course, this presumes
that a union's e-mail message would be read by workers during a
work break.)
</P>
<P>
   Morris, the management lawyer, objected to this reasoning and
said unions ``have had the benefit of a Clinton-appointed NLRB that
has not taken into account the costs.'' He said it was foolish to
apply Industrial Age examples to new technologies and said
congressional legislation might be the best way to devise rules to
protect companies.

Windows `Solitaire' never lost in shuffle 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us now, with a nod to James Agee, praise famous programs.
</P>
<P>
   I submit to you the proposition that within the bowels of
Windows, under the Accessories button, there lies the very heart of
computing, a small gem of programming, a glass through which all
other such endeavors may be viewed and judged.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, my friends, I speak of ``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   See how readily it leaps to the screen. ``Solitaire'' never
fails to come when called; no rough edges, no obscure error
messages, no lockups.
</P>
<P>
   Observe the brilliant colors, the sharp graphics, set against
the green background. I can sit back until my arms can't reach the
keyboard and still tell the queen of diamonds from the queen of
hearts with no difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small thing, my friend. I have a ``Solitaire'' game
for Macintosh, that presumed paragon of graphics computing, on
which I can scarcely discern one card from another with my face
right up to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Note how cunningly a card snaps into place when it reaches its
destination, how a double-click will send an ace and its subsequent
suite members zooming into place. A small thing, perhaps, but can
you remember how messy it was with real cards?
</P>
<P>
   A woman who didn't get it once marveled at the time her friends
spent playing computer ``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you miss shuffling? Isn't handling the cards the point
of the whole thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh dear me, no. What good is fancy shuffling and riverboat
dealing in ``Solitaire''? By its very name, the player is alone _
there is no one to impress. A new deck of cards is stiff and
resistant. After going through a couple of dozen games, the
stiffness is gone, soon to be replaced by limp and creased cards,
especially if you're the kind who peeks. Dirty cards, too. You'll
never turn over a dirty card in Windows ``Solitaire.'' Mind the
mouse and the keyboard, though.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen decks to choose from, including one with a
sunlit beach that does funny things when you aren't watching. You
don't often see the backs, but such riches are not to be sneered
at.
</P>
<P>
   You want competition? Standard scoring and Vegas scoring. Turn
one card, turn three. Personally, I never heard of turning one
card. It has a nasty, subversive sort of sound to it. I wouldn't
trust anyone who turns one card.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we come to my only quibble about Windows ``Solitaire.''
You have to send all the cards to the upper field before you get a
proper winner's payoff, with the cards bouncing gracefully all over
the screen. I had a ``Solitaire'' program once that would recognize
instantly when all the cards were played for a win. A penguin would
march out, as I recall, and wave a banner at you. That was nice.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Windows ``Solitaire'' may, in the end, be
Microsoft's finest achievement. What else would maintain our sanity
as we listen to some geek's idea of soothing music while waiting on
terminal hold for tech support?
</P>
<P>
   How else pass the time between the completion of a project and
lunch? How many world-bending decisions may have been made over an
evening of Windows ``Solitaire''? How many insomniacs lulled off to
dreamland by the steady march of jack to queen to king?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Word is wonderful and Excel is excellent, to be sure.
But ``Solitaire'' is ``Solitaire.''

If the game is monopoly, Intel's an opponent to fear 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you worry that Microsoft dominates the technology
world so completely that other software companies don't have a
chance, let me give you something more important to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Microsoft. It's a big company. It does have the lion's
share of the operating system market for PCs. But there are
legitimate challengers. There's Unix and its variations coming on
strong enough, and with enough real-world advantages over Windows
to make Microsoft look over its shoulder. Apple _ like a high-tech
Frankenstein _ has arisen from the near dead thanks to that trendy
and multicolored iMac machine.
</P>
<P>
   Worry about Mr. Chips instead. Worry about Intel.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the world and half the Justice Department watch
the Microsoft antitrust action with fear and loathing, something
important is happening in the chip market.
</P>
<P>
   To tell my story, I have to back up a little bit. For several
years, the consumer PC world has been changing from a market where
the sale is closed based on features and power to one where price
closes the sale. Some people will always look for the most powerful
brand-name computer they can find, and price, basically, is no
object. But you don't have to look past the computer newspaper ads
to understand that price is king now.
</P>
<P>
   As that became obvious, manufacturers began to look for ways to
sell a computer at a price beneath the competition. That created a
marketplace for microprocessor chips _ the chips that furnish the
brainpower for PCs _ that cost less than those from Intel.
Companies such as Cyrix and AMD jumped into the market. Nowadays,
to cut to the chase scene, AMD stands alone a legitimate threat to
Intel. It's a real threat. AMD claims to have 51 percent of the
market for PCs that sell for under $1,000. That still leaves Intel
in the driver's seat on more-expensive machines for home and
business.
</P>
<P>
   If the world rocked along like that, with AMD content to hold
its share of the under-$1,000 market and Intel fat and happy with
the power machines, this sort of a divide could continue forever.
</P>
<P>
   But AMD has done a brave _ and perhaps financially necessary _
thing. It has created a chip that challenges high-end Intel chips.
This new AMD chip _ once code-named the K7 and now called the
Athlon _ is available in both 600-megahertz and 650-megahertz
models. When tested against the Intel Pentium III chip, it does
very well. In fact, in most tests, it beats the Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel may be big and slow to react, but it is also powerful. It
knows what AMD did to it in the low-price market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is capable _ if it chooses _ of undercutting the Athlon on
price, even if it means losing money. AMD can't afford to get in a
high-stakes poker game with Intel. If money were poker chips, Intel
sits in front of a high-as-the-moon stack of blue chips, and AMD
has just one blue chip. That chip is Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a cruel marketplace. The best technology does not
always win.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a battle that AMD must win. AMD executives
acknowledge that the success of Athlon is crucial to the company.
If AMD does lose, and if losing does break the company, Intel
stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I prefer the Intel chip for reasons no more
sophisticated than those a bass fisherman might have for selecting
a blue crankbait. I hope this is one time that you don't bank on my
personal preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Without legitimate competition, prices generally rise.
Innovation slows. Competition drives chip companies just as it does
lemonade stands and football players.
</P>
<P>
   I don't fancy a future when the only brand of lemonade comes
from Intel.

TRobots beyond science fiction 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, when science fiction novels _ not video games _ were
an obsession with most boys and some girls, the robot was king.
</P>
<P>
   The robots of science fiction were wonderful (and sometimes
awful) creatures that could think for themselves and that seemed
like mechanical versions of a real person. For a time, it seemed
almost certain that _ as technology moved to the stage where such
things were possible _ robot housekeepers and waiters would be
common by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the wind shifted and robots _ that kind of robot _ fell
out of favor. Sure there were robots, but these were the
computerized cutting and welding arms used in automobile
manufacturing, designed to do one specialized task. There also were
toy robots _ even expensive ones _ that could wander around in an
amusing way but served no real purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for all of you who grew up and dreamed of someday having a
robot of your own, there is hope from an unlikely source: Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. Sony built a $2,500 robotic dog. It looked
like a dog, had some ability to learn and could even be taken for a
walk on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   Sony was shocked when it sold 2,000 of those creatures in the
United States and also thousands in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sony thinks there is a future for real robots _ for
household helpers and for industrial robots to be used in mines.
The importance of this news isn't that some company thinks it can
turn a buck selling robots. The importance is that this is Sony ...
these are folks who make a living selling popular technology, not
weird one-offs that are too expensive and too specialized.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the real shocker. The quote from Toshi Doi, president of
Sony Digital Creatures Laboratory (from an interview with Reuters),
speaks for itself:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future the total industry of automated robots will
exceed the total amount of the person computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If Doi is right, then there is definitely a robot in your
future.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting is fundamental
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember TV's ``Dating Game''?
</P>
<P>
   Sure you do. The potential date would sit on a stool and ask
three potential suitors really dumb questions. They, in turn, would
give really stupid answers. Eventually, she would pick one of the
three. It probably was as sensible a way of finding a date as
getting fixed up by your Aunt Milly. And, instead of making poor
choices a private matter, it let the world watch.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fun to you?
</P>
<P>
   Now you can try it. Not only is Sony big into robots these days,
it also plans to help your love life.
</P>
<P>
   The new sensation is called ``The Dating Game Online.'' During
its premiere week on the Web in July, it attracted some 75,000
players. You can see what it's all about for yourself, or even join
in, at www
</P>
<P>
   .station.sony.com/datinggame.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Sony Online Entertainment, it gives players a chance
to test their humor and charm _ should they have any _ with others
in a multiplayer environment. Since things like this have a natural
potential to get out of hand, the online version has a feature not
found on the TV show.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``jerk button.'' Contestants can tag and eject
players who get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Probably many single folks have wished for a real-life version
of that button.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the rules. All players must be at least 18 years old.
Sony encourages players not to share personal information or e-mail
addresses. To play, you have to register. If you're a jerk, well,
you get buttoned up fast.
</P>
<P>
   A secure feeling
</P>
<P>
   Almost every survey about technology and the Internet these days
mentions the public's growing fear that privacy can be invaded
based on the information kept in their computer and also available
over their Internet account.
</P>
<P>
   There's a growing trend toward high-tech security measures _
instead of a password. Some of these gadgets would do James Bond
proud.
</P>
<P>
   It's a field called biometrics. Some of these devices use your
fingerprints, and others use unique characteristics such as voice
or even the inner architecture of your eye to make sure that it's
really you.
</P>
<P>
   One such program is called Saflink SAF/nt 2.0. It costs $149 and
is aimed at networks of computers that rely on security. But odds
are that you'll be seeing more of these products aimed at the home
user. Unlike a conventional password, this is real security that is
almost impossible to violate since it relies on a unique
characteristic of the user.

New games for 2000, home networking among the hot topics for late
summer By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these fading days of summer, time remains to squeeze in a few
more new computer games. You can find some likely choices in the
August issue of PC Gamer. The issue features new reviews, plus a
look at the 10 best games scheduled for release next year. New
titles include ``Freelancer,'' ``Throne of Darkness,'' ``Alone in
the Dark 4'' and ``Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Maximum PC examines home networking. It
shows how to set up a home network through a variety of ways,
including Universal Serial Bus or wireless technology. The same
issue also includes a look at the new wireless PalmPilot, model
VII. Maximum PC calls this model ``the wireless walkie-talkie to
the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel and the Civil War Trust have jointly
produced a new computer CD called The Civil War Experience. It is
an interactive guide to the war that killed more Americans than all
other wars combined. There are photographs, video and sound clips
of historians and famous battle sites. You'll also find lots of
battle maps. The Civil War Experience is available only for PCs
with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some new barbecue recipes for these final days of
summer? Check out the company site of Weber Grills. Of course, it
is in the company's best interest to promote outdoor cooking. It
does a pretty good job of it, with hundreds of recipes, according
to Yahoo Internet Life. You'll find it at www.weberbbq.com.

Marketers want to know all about you 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There he was, the Beastie Boys' rapper Mike D., dressed in the
rocker/rapper/slacker uniform of T-shirt and jeans, slumped before
a microphone in a meeting room at the Marriott Marquis in New York
City, talking about leveraging databases to increase marketing
opportunities on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Rock stars aren't talking about the Web as a medium for artistic
expression, but as a medium for purchasing this outpouring of
artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is struggling with a variety of money-and
Web-related issues, thanks to the explosion in digital music
download technology. It is desperately searching for ways to bring
loyal fans to the Web with credit cards in hand to purchase music,
concert tickets and other items.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a little surreal to hear the Beastie Boys and other
music stars talk about how to get their fans to buy things from
them on the Web. It's hard to imagine Bob Dylan or Diana Ross
talking about database marketing and optimizing retail
opportunities, but the music business is in a serious turnaround
because of the Web. Stars have become brands as well as artists,
and they want to turn the people who love them offline into a
marketing bonanza online. Even Tom Petty offers digital downloads
on Amazon.com in hopes of selling CDs both on and off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds cold and calculated, because musicians are supposed to
be above this sort of thing, but personal information is rapidly
becoming the Web's gold standard. Everyone from Amazon.com to The
New York Times knows that information is the Internet's most
valuable currency.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, the Web guru who oversees online operations
for New York Times Co., has been talking about the value of
databases for years. Anyone who wants to read the Times online has
to register first.
</P>
<P>
   It's not complicated and only takes a few minutes. The Times
doesn't sell the information. It uses it to show advertisers the
market it offers and to develop new products.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother isn't watching yet, but he would definitely like to
be. Most Web sites realized a long time ago that no one is willing
to pay money to look at Web sites. They are forced to rely on
advertising dollars and electronic commerce to keep the money
coming in and their sites up on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If all this ``data mining'' _ as they call it in the direct
marketing industry _ works, you'll be getting information you
actually want, about CDs you might buy or vacations you might take.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium still struggling to figure out ways to make money,
gathering personal information seems like the ideal way to charm
both users and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Web sites are totally and completely dependent
on you, the surfer. A researcher for Arbitron, the prominent media
measurement service, says she always lies on online applications.
``There's no reason why anyone on the Web needs to know a single
thing about me,'' she says. This from a woman who gathers data for
a living but won't tell Amazon what books she likes.
</P>
<P>
   In return for providing a Web site with information your spouse,
best friend and mother might not know, you will get frequent notes
from the places at which you have registered.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is one visit to Amazon.com to see exactly how this
works. Should you decide to buy a second book from Amazon, you'll
be greeted with a cheery personalized ``Welcome Back!'' followed by
a link to a list of recommended titles based on your last purchase.
If the books aren't to your liking, you can tell Amazon what sort
of books you do like, so you can receive recommendations better
suited to your interests.
</P>
<P>
   Give your e-mail address to Salon, the online magazine, and
you'll get a weekly roundup of new articles and essays. The New
York Times on the Web will let you know when it has a special
section, Delta Air Lines will send you a list of cheap flights out
of town this weekend, and Lands' End will offer you a weekly
overstocks newsletter of clearance items.
</P>
<P>
   However, the interesting thing about this is that rappers, rock
stars and media giants can yak all they want to about the value of
databases, but if you don't give them the information, they won't
have any. They are dependent upon your willingness to provide
information about yourself to Web sites you frequent. They need to
know as much information as you are willing to give, from where you
live to how old your kids are. You, the Web surfer, hold all the
cards in this online marketing game.
</P>
<P>
   It's your choice to dispense or withhold personal information.
If filling out online forms makes you nervous, don't do it. It will
just force Web marketers and folks like the Beastie Boys to think
of other ways to get your attention and your money.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
A world tour can start anywhere 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is, after all, the World Wide Web _ not the neighborhood Web
or the American Web.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a fast and surprisingly satisfying way to tour the
world _ zapping at the click of a mouse from New Zealand to
Newfoundland. There are, of course, thousands of sites filled with
the kind of information you'd find by reading an atlas and
encyclopedia. But for a really interesting world tour via
cyberspace, try to visit some of the out-of-the-way places ... the
sort of places where the locals hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start, faithful to that theme, at a site you probably have
never visited. It's the official page of the Auckland, New Zealand,
city government at akcity.govt.nz/. Among other things, you'll
learn there's an Andy Warhol exhibit over at the Auckland Art
Gallery, the City Council takes the Year 2000 computer problem
seriously and has worked hard since 1997 to make sure there are no
serious problems, and that _ like every place else _ taxes keep
going up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe by now, you're getting the idea behind this world tour.
Instead of learning the population, chief industry and history of a
city or country, we'll use the Web today to learn what it is like
to live in a different country and get the feel of traveling in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   So let's spend a little time in a very beautiful place, the Cape
Verde islands, off the coast of Africa. Pop on over to users
</P>
<P>
   .erols.com/kauberdi/, and before you read a word click on the
link to see the photographs. Just spend a moment enjoying the view.
This is an archipelago that was populated by the Portuguese, slaves
from the Guinea Coast, Muslims and others beginning shortly after
its discovery by navigator Antonio da Nola in 1457. The language
there is Papiamentu, which is a form of Creole. There's a link
where you can learn enough of the language to sound silly. Bon bini
is welcome, kon ta bai is hello and bon dia is good morning.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go to out-of-the-way places geographically to
get an insider's view of a country. For instance, a visit to the
site at www.open.gov.uk/ in the United Kingdom can take you deep
into an inquiry about an event that happened Jan. 30, 1972, in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It started as a civil rights march and ended in the deaths of 13
people, with 13 more wounded. Click on the link on this page for
the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, and you will instantly be immersed in a
government inquiry into what went wrong that Sunday, when British
soldiers began firing into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, of course, are a good way to learn about the
day-to-day activities in a country or region. The Israeli newspaper
Haaretz is online at www3
</P>
<P>
   .haaretz.co.il/eng/htmls/11
</P>
<P>
   .htm. You will be given the choice of reading the paper in
Hebrew or English.
</P>
<P>
   The real interest here is in the small stories, not the big ones
about the region that you'd see in this newspaper. Part of the
daily fare here is about bombs that were defused, bombs that
weren't defused and terrorist activities. There is even a column
that treats ways to travel the world, using the Net.

IN FRENZIED WORLD OF ON-LINE AUCTIONS, BUYER BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS   
 c.1999 Albany Times Union   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On-line auctions let you window-shop 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, until you find what you want, without
wearing out your feet or car.
</P>
<P>
   But be aware of the caveats before you start clicking on that
bid box.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass., is a research company that
reviews, ranks and rates e-commerce sites using more than 100
criteria, from ease of use and customer confidence to on-site
resources and relationship services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the consumer's advocate,'' said Hank Hudepohl, an
analyst at Gomez. Even with a watchdog group, each shopper has to
be responsible and follow some basic advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't jump in and buy on impulse,'' Hudepohl said. ``People
can easily get caught up in the fun or competition. It's almost
like gambling. So try to keep your cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommended researching a site and previewing the
merchandise. Watch bidding and see how it goes. Read up on the
rules, which differ from site to site. Most require bidders to be
over 18. And, ``If something seems too good to be true, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are very interested in buying an item, check the bidding
action every hour or so. At eBay.com, for instance, potential
buyers offer as many as 600 bids per minute, according to Kevin
Pursglove, senior director for communications of the on-line
auction house. The site is currently the leading person-to-person
on-line trading community, with more than 1,600 categories and more
than 1.5 billion page visits per month.
</P>
<P>
   Although some on-line auction houses monitor their sites for
strange bidding behavior and unusual listings, the buyer should
still be cautious and savvy before starting to bid, according to
on-line auction specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites let you retract your bid if you accidentally hit the
wrong key or change your mind in a certain time span, while others
allow retracted bids until the last minute of the auction, Hudepohl
said. Know the value of the item you are bidding on and set a limit
for yourself, so you are not caught up paying more than it's worth
or you can afford. Sites like BiddersEdge.com, BidFind.com and
DealTime.com provide a historical record of what was paid for a
type of item at auction, as well as its current auction price and
which auction site has it for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are on-line shopping tips at many of the sites,''
Pursglove said. You can also check into tips produced by Internet
Fraud Watch unit of the National Consumers League based in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The league's Web site is http://www.natlconsumersleague.org/
</P>
<P>
   Know who you are dealing with. On-line auction sites involve
business-to-consumer trading, as with Onsale.com, or
consumer-to-consumer, like eBay and Yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers register with an on-line auction site of their choice
that caters to the type of inventory or item they plan to sell.
They then select how many days the item will be for sale, which can
be anywhere from three days to one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are buying from a business, always look to the area of
their Web site that talks about who they are and how to contact
them,'' Hudepohl advised. ``A site can look very professional and
if you've never heard of it before, you should always verify the
seller.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests checking the feedback forum, where buyers write
their comments about transactions with sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said that even though the main responsibility is with
the seller, the buyer should always do the homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find out how to contact the seller before you start bidding,''
said Pursglove, so you can ask any questions that may not have been
answered on the Web site. You can ask questions while the bidding
is going on, right up until it ends.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pursglove said sellers write their own descriptions of the
items. Some include one to three photos, showing different angles,
while others have no photos. Hudepohl said that you should ask if
you can pay by credit card (with most cards, you are only liable
for the first $50 in case of a scam or fraud) and if there is an
escrow service for holding your money until you receive your
merchandise. Never send cash through the mail. Ask about the return
policy and if a high-value item has been or can be certified for
authenticity by a third party.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of shady dealings. Just because 25 people are actively
bidding on an item doesn't mean it's valuable. It could be an
instance of collusion between sellers and false bidders who are
trying to increase the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Some bidders engage in sniping, timing their first bid for the
very last second to beat out all other people. At times, auction
companies will extend the bidding by an hour or more if they expect
that this is the case.
</P>
<P>
   Bid shielding is an unethical practice of trying to block others
from bidding. Here's how it works: One person bids $10 for a book
and a colleague quickly bids $500, assuming that no one will
overbid the inflated price. The high bidder retracts the bid at the
last minute, giving the first person a $10 deal.
</P>
<P>
   On-line auctions should be fun when they are conducted right and
if buyers are honest, Pursglove said. ``There's a great sense of
community when partaking in an on-line auction, where you can chat
with other people who have the same interests as you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudepohl also said to have fun, but as with anything, continue
to always be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to product selection, there's almost an
unlimited potential for finding what you need,'' Hudepohl
said.``It's important to know that only the top 50 (sites) have 95
percent of the market. Many sites are just trying to get their feet
off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudepohl said merchandisers market and liquidate their products
much more efficiently in auctions.
</P>
<P>
   With 500 auction sites on the World Wide Web, there's something
for every interest. Even the venerable Sotheby's auction house went
on line this summer. Matthew Weigman, director of Sotheby's press
office in New York, said that the auction house is also in a new
joint on-line auction site with Amazon.com, best known as a book
retailer. This fall, Sothebys.amazon.com will offer memorabilia
from Secretariat, America's most beloved Triple Crown winner, and
baseball memorabilia.

THE DEN INTRODUCES INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT VIA THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
 &HT;    SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ It's twilight on a warm Friday evening,
too early to prowl the subterranean Los Angeles night life, yet too
late to be click-clacking away at the office. But at a funky,
two-story converted warehouse here, workers show no signs of
slowing down for the weekend. Some are gathered for an impromptu
cake-and-beer celebration, where a dressed-down executive
introduces 40 new employees. Others remain cheerfully glued to
their workstations, staring at monitors as if they contain the
great secrets of the universe.
 &HT;    The intense young computer heads and self-conscious creative
types, most in their early 20s, eagerly pop out of their cubicles
to explain the place to a visitor. The Concept is Big, these
staffers say. It's the biggest thing to hit Hollywood since D. W.
Griffith invented the epic. It's bigger than the talkies. It's
bigger than television. It's bigger than _ gasp _ MTV. It's a brand
new media for a brave new world, they claim.
 &HT;    Who are these self-promoters and what is this place? What's the
Big Idea? The company is called Digital Entertainment Network, or
simply the Den. ``We're trying to build something, and it's going
to change the world,'' says the Den's director of marketing, Adam
Solomon, a kind of combination cruise director and spin doctor. The
concept is this: The Den aims to develop Internet-specific
programming geared for Generation Y, today's high school and
college students, ages 14 to 24. This generation, estimated at 60
million and also known as Echo Boomers, grew up with computers and
faxes and cell phones and beepers: They're used to
``multitasking,'' and they're at home getting their information
through one wire or another, often through more than one at once.
 &HT;    Den's low-budget programs, aimed at such narrowly defined groups
as gay teens, Christian young adults, and punk rockers, will be
delivered via streaming video on the Internet; all shows will be
interactive, with built-in e-commerce mechanisms and plenty of
click-on features that provide as much or as little information as
an individual viewer wants. These shows will be available on
demand, 24-7 (Netspeak for every hour, every day). Each segment
(which costs anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 to produce, less
expensive than network television and with a shorter turnaround
time) lasts a mere six or seven minutes, the ideal length for the
generation that is growing up with a mouse in one hand and a remote
in the other.
 &HT;    That's the basic idea, and Solomon discusses it with the zeal of
a scientist pondering the cure for cancer. Solomon leads a
high-energy tour of the warehouse, racing by the conference room
(``Ikea meets money''), the recording studio (``Austin Powers meets
the Jetsons''), and then bounding up to the second floor for a demo
of the site (which is at http://www.den.net). It begins with a
promotional video, in which the familiar NBC peacock logo morphs
into a stuffed holiday turkey. Next up is a preview of ``Frat
Ratz,'' a soap-opera series featuring testosterone-driven students
and their long-suffering yet lovely girlfriends.
 &HT;    Shallow plot aside, the series does experiment with
interactivity. In one segment, an actor who is shaving delivers a
plug for the razor, just as actors did in the early television of
the '50s and '60s (and in ``The Truman Show''). Viewers can click
on a logo and purchase the razor or surf over to the razor
company's home page. Likewise, when music plays during any Den
show, viewers can stop the program, click to get more information
about the artist, read articles, or buy the album. They can also
stop the show at any point to get more information about their
favorite characters.
 &HT;    This kind of interactive programming _ also known as TV Plus,
telefusion, or convergence _ is suddenly all the rage in Hollywood,
and investors and sponsors are viewing it as the Next Big Thing in
entertainment. And the Den is growing exponentially. Launched in
1998 by three entrepreneurs, it began 1999 with 10 employees.
Today, it has 220 staffers spread out in six buildings, including
the original warehouse. It has raised $26 million so far, with
funds from prominent venture capitalists as well as Dell Computer
Corp. and Microsoft Corp. And Den has signed up Pepsi and Ford
Motor Co. as charter sponsors.
 &HT;    ``We're looking for a fresh approach to reaching the Echo
Boomers,'' says Dave Ropes, Ford's director of corporate
advertising and integrated marketing. ``It's no question that this
generation has a short attention span; they want to be entertained
in shorter lengths and shorter soundbites.''
 &HT;    Interactive entertainment could be the next gold mine in
cyberspace, but so far, mainstream networks have offered only
regular television programming complemented with a chat rooom or a
fan site on line. ``Convergence usually means a separated
experience,'' says Jim Ritts, the Den's chief executive officer,
pointing out that running between the television and the computer
is hardly an integrated experience. ``It's like saying, `I have a
potato, and I put plastic eyes and a nose and a mouth on it, and
now I have an animated character.' No. It's not an animated
character. It's Mr. Potatohead.''
 &HT;    The Den isn't toying around, though, and neither are several
other companies racing to enter the market before the networks and
film studios offer their own made-for-the-Net entertainment. These
media companies seem to be popping up every day and include
ventures like WireBreak.com, Brilliant Digital Entertainment, and
Honkworm Interactive. Den's primary competitor is the New
York-based Pseudo.com, which has launched a network of Internet
talk shows and bills itself as ``TV you can't get on TV.''
 &HT;    Pseudo.com founder Joshua Harris considers Den a formidable and
respectable competitor. ``If I had to say anything about their
programming, it's a little too much like regular broadcast TV,''
Harris says. ``Den and Pseudo, not in that order, I hope, are
dogfighting it out to get a toehold in a market that I know will
clobber regular old television in the long run.''
 &HT;    But even Harris admits that the technology isn't quite there yet
to satisfy most viewers. Den targets its programs for machines with
Internet connection speeds of 56K or higher _ the faster the
connection, the better the quality. But the New York-based Jupiter
Communications predicts that only 20 percent of all computers will
have broadband Internet access by 2002, creating an accessibility
problem. And some analysts are skeptical in general about the
quality of streaming-video technology, which features grainy images
on matchbox-sized screens.
 &HT;    But others are impressed with the Den model. ``They are creating
unique content and not just reproducing something else on line,''
says Mark Hardie, senior analyst at the Cambridge-based Forrester
Research. ``What normally happens is producers add a chat room to a
situation comedy and think they're doing programming for the Net.
That's nonsense.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Some folks in Hollywood, however initially slow to respond to
the Internet, are beginning to get it. Most film studios and
television networks are currently exploring ways to offer
Net-specific entertainment; Warner Bros. Interactive, for one, will
launch a Net entertainment portal, called Entertaindom, later this
year. David Wertheimer, former president of Paramount Digital
Entertainment, launched WireBreak.com, a Web operation that is
developing short interactive shows; when he left Paramount last
fall, he says, colleagues told him he was crazy, but the same
people are now asking for jobs. ``It's suddenly hip and trendy to
be in entertainment on the Internet,'' he says.
 &HT;    Hip and trendy is what La-La Land is all about, and so far, the
buzz about the Den has been mostly positive _ with one major
concern. ``They are to be saluted for being one of the leaders
moving the Internet into the entertainment field,'' says Jim
Moloshok, president of Warner Bros. Online. ``But from what I've
seen to date, all they're doing is creating poorly written
television shows and streaming them on the Web. Bad scripts and bad
acting aren't going to appeal to the public just because you're
streaming them on line.''
 &HT;    Indeed, most of Den's programs follow the linear-story format of
traditional television, be it talk show, sitcom, or sci-fi drama
(see accompanying story). ``That's a fair note at this time,'' says
Den president David Neuman. ``Most of the shows are very linear and
true to the Aristotelian storytelling method. But over time, you'll
see more innovative programming. You're literally watching the
previews.
 &HT;    ``But name one network show done with Asian teenagers,'' he
continues. ``Name one show about punk rockers. Name one show about
Hispanic teenagers. This is the most diverse generation in history,
and we think it would be bad business and bad karma to leave
anybody out.''
 &HT;    Den was producing its diverse programming before the NAACP
criticized the television industry this summer for its
overwhelmingly white fall lineup; that backlash might pay off for
the Den. ``I'm disappointed with the lack of commitment television
makes to show the texture of America,'' says Jack Johnson, producer
of a Den show about hip-hop music. ``The beauty of the Internet is
that we're able to take that risk.''
 &HT;    But while Den prides itself on being a multicultural,
youth-oriented company, its top executive suites are occupied by
middle-aged white men. And one of its premiere shows, a digital
sci-fi thriller called ``Royal Standard,'' is directed by
53-year-old Randall Kleiser, best known for such Boomer teen movies
as ``The Blue Lagoon'' and ``Grease.''
 &HT;    That said, the network is striving to develop a show for every
possible subculture of Generation Y, from punk rockers and
hip-hoppers to skateboarders, surfers, and computer geeks. This
approach is called ``narrowcasting,'' and it's what the Internet
does best. ``A lot of us are really sick of MTV because it doesn't
cater to different subculture preferences,'' says Leo Zhao, a
24-year-old Den designer. ``Me, I'm into post-dance electronic
music, and I'm bored with 99.9 percent of the stuff out there on
television.''
 &HT;    Zhao is not just an employee: He's a member of the Den's target
audience. The top brass want today's youth to describe themselves
as the ``Den Generation,'' the same way the Gen-Xers identify with
MTV. But will it work? Will Den capture the attention of a
generation or will it just slip away, like so many other Internet
startups?
 &HT;    The denizens, no doubt, are banking on the company's mix of
industry connections and youthful enthusiasm. The top executives
have ties to Disney Television and Channel One (the controversial
in-school network), while the programming and producing staffers
reflect the pop culture that blooms on the streets of Los Angeles,
with 20-somethings sporting tattoos and piercings and various
unnatural shades of hair. ``I feel very much at home in this
environment,'' says Zhao.
 &HT;    Everyone who sets foot in the place learns to talk the talk _
and they might as well, since they all have stock options.
Music-industry veteran Gary Gersh signed on in June to head the new
Den Music Group; he picked up the company line instantly. ``We
think of ourselves as NATO for the music industry; we're here for
everyone to use and interact with,'' he says, explaining that bands
signed by Den Music Group can be featured on other Den programs,
including the dramas and the talk shows.
 &HT;    Comparisons to international peacekeeping forces, of course,
mean nothing if the kids don't come to the site. Den debuted its
preview site in May (in what Internet folks call a ``soft''
launch), featuring a few segments of 10 video shows and limited
interactive features. The revamped site (the ``hard'' launch) will
be unveiled in mid-October, with 30 shows, chat rooms, and other
popular Web features. The company is mounting a marketing campaign
on college campuses and in funky hangouts and youthful meccas,
trying to pull off the kind of buzz that turned the low-budget
horror flick ``The Blair Witch Project'' into a phenomenon. The
campaign, with posters designed by Zhao, will hit Boston next week.
 &HT;    The company's stated mission is to provide today's youth with
``a revolutionary replacement for the passive, brain-killing
experience of watching network and cable television.'' Is its
programming really that revolutionary? Industry critics say no, but
Den staffers are convinced they are on the cusp of a radical media
realignment. ``A lot of what we're doing is still rhetoric, but
we're in the process of turning it into a reality,'' says Solomon.
 &HT;    And Ritts adds, ``It will be just as different in 90 days as it
was 90 days ago. This is a network of, by, and for the Y
Generation. So we better be nimble. We better adjust. And we better
be fluid.''
 &HT;    And they better stick around on a Friday night. Solomon, for
one, knows he ought to be home with his toddler, 17-month-old
Theodore. ``You have to understand; we're defining a brand new
medium,'' he says. And as for Zhao, he works all night, every
night, not necessarily at the office. ``It's part of my job to
scope out the underground of LA night life so I can be in touch
with the newest trends,'' he says. It's unclear whether those fads
will play in Peoria, but for the young programmers in Santa Monica,
if one trend loses its luster, the next Big Thing is just a few
clicks away.

 &HT;     WHAT'S ON THE 'NET TONIGHT?  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They call it ``narrowcasting'' _ that is,
something-different-for-everyone programming. Say you're into
extreme sports: There's a show for you. The rave scene? Click right
in. This philosophy of programming lies at the heart of Digital
Entertainment Network (or Den), an Internet startup targeting
14-to-24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sole mission is the self-actualization of Generation Y,''
says Den president David Neuman. ``And we would not be embracing
that unless we embrace everybody _ every ethnic group, every
interest, psychographic, and subculture.''
</P>
<P>
   So how narrow is narrowcasting? Here are a few examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tales from the Eastside'': Described by Den staffers as a
Latino ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' this made-for-the-Net soap opera
presents the barrio of East Los Angeles as a mix of gangs, love
affairs, and the occasional boxing match. The characters border on
stereotypes _ hardly a cultural breakthrough. But the show is
presented in both Spanish and English, and interactive links
connect viewers to information about prominent Latino artists and
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct Drive'': Host Veronica De La Cruz, a 23-year-old
promoter of dance parties in Los Angeles, spotlights the DJ
culture, introducing viewers to the styles and the spinners. The
show offers an inside look at a phenomenon that has been all but
ignored by the mainstream media. ``The kids don't have a place to
go,'' says De La Cruz. ``It's a very underground community, and Den
is giving kids the programming they want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chang Gang'': Den executives describe this show as a ``Hardy
Boys mystery with Asian-American kids,'' with a supernatural twist
similar to ``The X-Files.'' Den designer Leo Zhao, who was born in
China, says of the series, ``It represents a segment of Asian kids,
the sort who wear designer labels and drive custom-made cars. It
represents a part of us, not all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frat Ratz'': ``Animal House'' for the '90s _ only the clothes
are different. In the Den's own description, the heroes are
``feebleminded stalwarts'' who ``stumble and bumble through
calamity after calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Redemption High'': The pilot hasn't been shown yet, but the
show is about a group of Christian teenagers faced with issues of
faith and fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help Den'': A self-help show for teens that explores such
issues as AIDS and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggronation'': Extreme sports on demand. Watch for
opportunites to click and buy the equipment when the network
launches officially in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of a Punk Planet'': Rival punk rockers band together to
save their favorite nightclub. Not your usual dramatic series
subject, but the script is your basic fill-in-the-blanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exoticom'': Two wild and crazy guys travel the globe and offer
their ``insights.'' In Thailand, they ride elephants, commune with
monkeys, and visit ancient temples. Here's the show's take on
Buddhism: ``I'm not real familiar with the religion, but the monks
lead these really incredible lives'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Rated DG'': The show claims to feature film critics and
reviews, but it offers little more than glorified press releases
for feature films, complete with promotional footage. Here's a
recent ``review'': ``If you like smart scripts, cute chicks, and
pot-eating presidents, check out `Dick.' '' Not.

   WASHINGTON _ Dobie Gillis, eat your heart out.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV series from 1959 through 1963, Dwayne Hickman
portrayed Dobie as a cheerful young man who would appreciate a
little more respect, but got enough guidance from caring adults to
emerge triumphant from the academic and social pressures of high
school life.
</P>
<P>
   That's just how most American high school students feel today,
according to a national poll released Wednesday. It was conducted
in June for Shell Oil Co. by Peter D. Hart Research Associates,
using questions written with the help of the U.S. Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results should help destroy movie stereotypes of
today's high school as ``full of perky blonde cheerleaders, dumb
jocks, quirky nerds and teachers who haven't a clue,'' said
Education Secretary Richard Riley, who spoke at length about the
results to the Commonwealth Club in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may dress differently, look different, and listen to
music that is simply beyond us, but they are not a lost generation
or a negative generation,'' said Riley, 66.
</P>
<P>
   While a poll last year showed that most adults believe today's
teens are ``rude, irresponsible and wild,'' Riley said the poll of
teens shows that most are ``ambitious, striving and open to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how often they have various feelings, nine out of every 10
students said that ``most'' or ``some'' of the time they feel happy
(93 percent), cared about (91) and confident (86). They were more
likely to be bored (57) than to feel angry (37), depressed (24) or
lonely (23).
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to life after high school, 76 percent agreed
that ``I am pretty confident that things will work out for me,''
while only 21 percent said, ``I'm not sure how well things will
work out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they cope with pressures ``to get good grades'' (44),
``to get into college (32) and ``to fit in socially'' (29). Far
fewer said they had to deal with pressure ``to use drugs or
alcohol'' (19) or ``to be sexually active'' (13).
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom they turn to for support and guidance, a vast
majority said they rely ``a lot'' or ``a fair amount'' on their
parents (78) or friends (75). Fewer turn to a teacher (41), member
of the clergy (37) or school guidance counselor (31).
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 said they had a teacher they feel close to, and
nearly half said they have had a teacher who has changed their
life.
</P>
<P>
   They look forward most days to going to school, where 68 percent
say the best thing is seeing their friends, while only 21 percent
say the best thing is going to classes. Two common gripes: About
four in every 10 said their school is overcrowded, and nearly half
said theirs has too few small classes with personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   While 81 percent of white teens gave their school an ``A'' or a
``B'' on being a ``safe place, without violence,'' that was true of
only 69 percent of the Latinos and 58 percent of African-Americans
polled.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance, two-thirds of all students would award their
school a grade of ``A'' (17) or ``B'' (49) on how well it works.
Even the grumpy one-third had many gentle graders, with 26 percent
giving their school a ``C,'' only 6 percent awarding a ``D,'' and 2
percent saying ``Fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the high satisfaction? At one extreme, 90 percent gave their
school high marks on ``teaching basic academic subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, 81 percent plan to continue their education
immediately after graduating from college. In reality, only
two-thirds are likely to do that.
</P>
<P>
   To which, most students say, ``So what?'' Asked to choose
between two attitudes toward setting goals for their themselves,
only 19 percent chose ``It's better to play it safe and not set
your sights too high so that you're not disappointed in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 79 percent instead chose, ``It's better to aim high
and have big ambitions so that you challenge yourself and achieve
new things.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,015 high school students was conducted between
June 8 and June 29, and had a sampling error of 3 percentage points
for the entire sample, and higher for sub-groups or for questions
asked of only half the sample.

</P>
<P>
   That's just how most American high school students feel today,
according to a national poll released Wednesday. It was conducted
in June for Shell Oil Co. by Peter D. Hart Research Associates,
using questions written with the help of the U.S. Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results should help destroy movie stereotypes of
today's high school as ``full of perky blonde cheerleaders, dumb
jocks, quirky nerds and teachers who haven't a clue,'' said
Education Secretary Richard Riley, who spoke at length about the
results to the Commonwealth Club in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may dress differently, look different, and listen to
music that is simply beyond us, but they are not a lost generation
or a negative generation,'' said Riley, 66.
</P>
<P>
   While a poll last year showed that most adults believe today's
teens are ``rude, irresponsible and wild,'' Riley said the poll of
teens shows that most are ``ambitious, striving and open to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how often they have various feelings, nine out of every 10
students said that ``most'' or ``some'' of the time they feel happy
(93 percent), cared about (91) and confident (86). They were more
likely to be bored (57) than to feel angry (37), depressed (24) or
lonely (23).
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to life after high school, 76 percent agreed
that ``I am pretty confident that things will work out for me,''
while only 21 percent said, ``I'm not sure how well things will
work out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they cope with pressures ``to get good grades'' (44),
``to get into college (32) and ``to fit in socially'' (29). Far
fewer said they had to deal with pressure ``to use drugs or
alcohol'' (19) or ``to be sexually active'' (13).
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom they turn to for support and guidance, a vast
majority said they rely ``a lot'' or ``a fair amount'' on their
parents (78) or friends (75). Fewer turn to a teacher (41), member
of the clergy (37) or school guidance counselor (31).
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 said they had a teacher they feel close to, and
nearly half said they have had a teacher who has changed their
life.
</P>
<P>
   They look forward most days to going to school, where 68 percent
say the best thing is seeing their friends, while only 21 percent
say the best thing is going to classes. Two common gripes: About
four in every 10 said their school is overcrowded, and nearly half
said theirs has too few small classes with personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   While 81 percent of white teens gave their school an ``A'' or a
``B'' on being a ``safe place, without violence,'' that was true of
only 69 percent of the Latinos and 58 percent of African-Americans
polled.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance, two-thirds of all students would award their
school a grade of ``A'' (17) or ``B'' (49) on how well it works.
Even the grumpy one-third had many gentle graders, with 26 percent
giving their school a ``C,'' only 6 percent awarding a ``D,'' and 2
percent saying ``Fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the high satisfaction? At one extreme, 90 percent gave their
school high marks on ``teaching basic academic subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, 81 percent plan to continue their education
immediately after graduating from college. In reality, only
two-thirds are likely to do that.
</P>
<P>
   To which, most students say, ``So what?'' Asked to choose
between two attitudes toward setting goals for their themselves,
only 19 percent chose ``It's better to play it safe and not set
your sights too high so that you're not disappointed in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 79 percent instead chose, ``It's better to aim high
and have big ambitions so that you challenge yourself and achieve
new things.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,015 high school students was conducted between
June 8 and June 29, and had a sampling error of 3 percentage points
for the entire sample, and higher for sub-groups or for questions
asked of only half the sample.

IN MEDITERRANEAN PARADISE IT'S EASY TO FORGET U.S. POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ To paraphrase Shakespeare, a politician
would, by any other name, smell as sweet or as or sour.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on the hypnotic shores of the Mediterranean, where
America's presidential race is not a matter of great interest,
names that we associate with the quest for the presidency retain
their original meaning.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bush is a shrub that grows in a garden or sprouts
up in a lonely field. A dole is the English equivalent of America's
welfare system. A bauer, when it is spelled bower, is a playing
card. A gore is a wound a ferocious bull tries to inflict on a
matador. A quayle, or quail, is a bird that hunters flush from the
underbrush and shoot from the sky. A hatch is a door on a sailing
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes. One person's bush is another's presidential hopeful.
People in the exotic lands bordering the Mediterranean appear to
have little interest or understanding of the strange, colorful
drama that has begun in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Americans, who are inundated with news and questions
about the likes of George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole, Gary Bauer, Al
Gore, Dan Quayle and Orrin Hatch, they are unconcerned with the
political fate of the men and one woman who aspire to live in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if they read the International Herald-Tribune or watch CNN,
as touring Americans do, they might ask questions similar to those
that fill our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Did the dashing governor of Texas comport himself in an
irresponsible and possibly illegal manner during the days of his
wild youth? If so, why won't he discuss those actions in detail or
explain more fully his positions and policies on key public issues?
</P>
<P>
   Will the bubbly woman who used to head the American Red Cross
and two Cabinet agencies and who also is the wife of unsuccessful
1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, make it to the GOP
finish line in Philadelphia next July? Will she win a place on her
party's presidential ticket?
</P>
<P>
   Will Gary Bauer be able to parley his support among religious
rightwingers into something more than a third- or fourth-place
showing in the primaries?
</P>
<P>
   Will Al Gore overcome his unjust reputation as the dullest
presidential hopeful since Herbert Hoover and excite the electorate
with his knowledge of issues and plans for dealing with them?
</P>
<P>
   Will Quayle, the former vice president who placed eighth in the
much-touted but highly overrated Iowa straw poll, soon follow Lamar
Alexander and John Kasich into oblivion as a disappointed former
presidential contender?
</P>
<P>
   Will Orrin Hatch be able to project his status as one of the
pillars of the Senate into something more than an also-ran status?
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens of Tangier in Morocco may recognize the name of
Malcolm Forbes Jr. because his late father owned a showplace home
near the casbah there. The name of Bill Bradley may mean something
to sports enthusiasts because of his long-ago prowess on the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that not many individuals, including American
tourists, show great interest in the presidential battle back home.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from all over the world demonstrate far more interest
in the great cathedrals, the mighty forts, the architectural gems
that are a legacy of the Moorish influence on Spain and Portugal
and the many shops filled with colorful products and equally
colorful entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, which once stagnated under the iron rule of Generalissimo
Francisco Franco, now appears to be flourishing as a democracy and
a member of NATO. A similar situation exists in Portugal, which
began to enjoy a new birth of freedom when dictator Antonio Salazar
was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Gibralter, a last vestige of an empire that once stretched
around the world, is still an imposing symbol of Britain's long-ago
presence in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   In the cathedral of the majestic city of Seville, tourists can
gaze in awe at the tomb that supposedly holds the remains of the
intrepid navigator who first charted the route across the Atlantic
from the old world to the new: Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca, a handsome Moroccan city on the Atlantic, bears
little, if any, resemblance to the set created on the Warner
Brothers lot in Hollywood nearly six decades ago for the immortal
story of love and wartime intrigue that starred Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Malaga, Almeria, Mallorca and Menorca are delightful ports on
the Costa del Sol. All are bustling modern communities steeped in
the legends and deeds of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But none is more fascinating than Barcelona, the great trading
center that boasts a fabulous heritage and has in the past been a
creative home to such artists as Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and
Joan Miro and cellist Pablo Casals.
</P>
<P>
   Festooned with sycamore trees and brilliant oleander and
bougainvillea blossoms, Barcelona contains one of the world's most
stunning architectural masterpieces, Antoni Gaudi's Church of the
Sagrada Familia. This elegant city is alive with the activities of
the '90s while proudly protecting a past that reaches back to the
pre-Christian era.
</P>
<P>
   It is refreshing to view ancient cultures that have kept up with
the times and vibrate with modernity. It also is refreshing to
escape for a short period the obsession with a presidential race
that will not reach its climax until November 2000.

   The three-handed phone call is one of the odder rituals to be
seen whenever a flock of technology mavens comes to roost. In one
hand is a Palm Pilot, Windows CE or Rex Pro organizer, and in the
other is a cell phone. Then the juggling act begins as the user
first looks up the number on the digital organizer, and then tries
to dial it on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them, and these alpha-geeks invariably agree that it is dumb
in this age of sophisticated digital gadgets to carry one device
for storing all their phone numbers and another device for dialing
them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they want their phones to be smart. They want to carry
a pocket-sized mobile handset with a display screen that integrates
voice services, wireless data services like e-mail and web
browsing, and information storage like contact lists, calendars and
to-do lists.
</P>
<P>
   But such smart phones are not expected to be widely available
and useful until the end of the year at the earliest, and the
initial services they offer are likely to be complex, expensive and
limited. So for now, at least, we have to settle for phones that
are not exactly smart, but not exactly dumb, either. And that
brings us to Motorola's new Startac Clip-on Organizer, a $250
device that clips onto the back of the company's popular little
Startac phone.
</P>
<P>
   The organizer itself is slightly larger than a half-inch stack
of credit cards. The phone (sold separately, with the price varying
depending on service plans) is among the very smallest available
today, and thus is a functional fashion item among the
mine-is-smaller-than-yours braggarts of the tech industry. Motorola
says it has sold millions of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clip-on Organizer is based on the same technology used by
the Rex Pro organizer, which can store hundreds of contact names
and numbers, along with three months' worth of appointments, simple
memos and to-do items, all on a card that can fit in a wallet (but
which is too fragile to risk putting in a wallet). The Clip-on
Organizer is basically a Rex Pro in the shape of a tiny backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the phone and its smart backpack create a 6-ounce
bundle that is 4 inches long, 2 inches wide and 1{ inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   While the small size is impressive, the real benefit is the
ability to look up and automatically dial a phone number with just
a couple of finger-pokes, avoiding the awkward juggling act
required by separate phone and organizer devices.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, after using the Clip-on Organizer for a couple of weeks, I
did find myself impressed. But on reflection, I wonder if this $250
gizmo is really so much better than an old-fashioned, pocket-size,
50-cent paper notepad.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not already own a Startac phone, the appeal of
the organizer is obviously very limited. But even for Startac
carriers, the device has some limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The organizer commandeers the backside slot set aside for the
phone's auxiliary phone battery, which is a double whammy: It
reduces potential talk time and adds bulk to a phone whose chief
appeal is its lack of same. The screen for the contact information
is on one side of the phone, and the screen for the dialer is on
the other. To avoid having to spin the phone around all the time
when trying to talk and schedule something at the same time, the
organizer can be unclipped and carried separately.
</P>
<P>
   The StarTac organizer has no keyboard of its own, and as a
result there are two basic ways of entering data. One is to use the
organizer's little buttons to scoot forward and backward along an
alphanumeric list, selecting one character at a time, a process
that requires the patience and dexterity of a Madame LaFarge. The
process is only slightly less annoying than using, say, a Ouja
board.
</P>
<P>
   The other, more efficient way is to download the data from a
personal computer, using special software and a special cable (both
included) that plugs into the computer's serial port.
</P>
<P>
   The Truesync software that comes with the organizer was
developed by Starfish Software, now a division of Motorola, and it
works with many of the most popular desktop information management
programs, including Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo Calendar, the Palm OS,
Lotus Notes or Lotus Organizer, and Starfish's own Truesync Desktop
PIM and Sidekick. Transferring my personal information to the
organizer from Microsoft Outlook 2000 was a snap, and so was
updating the data periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Overall I was impressed with the clever design of the Mobile
Organizer, just as I was with the original Rex card organizer. But
the cleverness is employed in part to overcome the aggravating
limitations of the device's tiny form, especially for entering
contact information and memos on the road. Startac owners who want
quick access to their appointments and contacts will have to decide
whether this particular two-piece solution meets their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Motorola and all of the other mobile phone companies
are racing to develop one-piece smart phones that combine wireless
voice services, a personal information manager and wireless data
services in the same handset. Motorola is one of the founding
members, along with the Scandinavian mobile phone giants Nokia and
Ericsson, of the Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, Forum,
which is trying to create a global standard for Internet and
advanced telephony services on digital mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, millions of WAP-enabled digital mobile
phones will soon offer users limited access to the World Wide Web,
along with other new services.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more ambitious plans already being tested in Europe
would enable the user to pay bills, trade stocks, buy tickets and
even operate gas pumps and vending machines via WAP-enabled mobile
phones, with the charges added automatically to the user's phone
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even more exciting, in a geeky sort of way, was the recent
announcement that a University of Massachusetts graduate student
has devised an Internet-capable computer the size of a match head,
which eventually could be built for less than a dollar. Equipped
with such a chip, the smart phone becomes absolutely brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   There are far more mobile phone users in the world today than
there are Internet users. One research company, the Yankee Group,
forecasts that a billion wireless phones will be in use by 2005. If
tomorrow's hand-held phones were to contain an Internet-connected
computer, even the most audacious predictions today for electronic
commerce and telecommunications would be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   And then we would all need three hands just to keep up.
</P>

<P>
   Chisels are hand tools that have steel blades with narrow
cutting edges. They are used to remove material in areas a saw or
file cannot reach. Chisels can be divided into two broad
categories, woodworking chisels and cold chisels.
</P>
<P>
   Chisel-like tools were around in the Stone Age, but it wasn't
until the Bronze and early Iron Age that the true chisel was
created. In medieval times carpenters use a wide, flared chisel
called a ''former'' chisel. It was used to carve rough timbers into
shape.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century, chisel design changed. Chisels were
thicker, shorter and had parallel sides. These were called
''firmer'' chisels, and they could be used with the hands or by
tapping the handle with a mallet. Other chisels, like the
''lock-mortise'' and ''bolting iron,'' were developed for specialty
work.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the modern chisel has changed little since
medieval times. Most woodworking chisels are fitted with a handle
made of wood or impact-resistant plastic. Wood-handled chisels can
be pushed with the hand or, when more force is needed, can be
driven with a wooden mallet. They should never be struck with a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Chisels with impact-resistant plastic (some have steel striking
caps on the end) can also be struck with a hammer as well as a
mallet, but remember to use a machinist's hammer, not a claw
hammer, for this. Another type of chisel is the all-steel wood
chisel. It is made of one piece of steel; the blade and a hexagonal
shaft that is the handle. These rugged chisels are designed for
heavy-duty carpentry work.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, woodworking chisels were distinguished by their
length. Butt chisels, the shortest, are about 7 to 9 inches long
and are used for working in tight spaces. Pocket chisels, the
choice for general shop work, are about 10 inches long. The 16-inch
mill chisel is used for heavy-duty jobs and has no practical value
in the home shop. The paring chisel is another long chisel, about
12 to 14 inches long, and is used to cut long grooves for shelf or
stair construction.
</P>
<P>
   Chisels are also designated by their cross section. Firmer
chisels have a stout blade that is rectangular in cross section.
They are useful for removing large amounts of material and for
rough work in cabinet making. A beveled-edge chisel has a blade
that is beveled on the top face of the two long sides. The beveled
edge allows more clearance when working in tight corners; however,
a beveled-edge chisel blade is less rigid than a firmer blade, so
it should only be used for lighter woodworking jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Chisels with curved, hollow cross sections are called gouges.
There are two types of gouge blade. One, an out-cannel, has the
cutting bevel on the outside. The other, with the cutting edge
ground on the inside, is an in-cannel gouge. Out-cannel gouges are
used to cut concave shapes, like finger-pull slots, out of wood.
In-cannel gouges are used to make straight cuts that are concave in
cross section. These cuts are made on the shoulder of a tenon where
it meets a mortise on a curved chair leg.
</P>
<P>
   Today most hardware stores and home centers carry a limited
selection of chisels. These have beveled-edged blades ranging in
length from six to eight inches long. Do-it-yourselfers who want to
expand their tool collection may find butt, pocket and mill chisels
in specialty shops that cater to professional cabinetmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Chisels are generally available with blade widths of 1/4, 3/8,
1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 1, 1 1/4, 1 1/2 and 2 inches. A selection of chisels
with blade widths of 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and 1 inches is sufficient for
most home tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Chisels are most useful for cutting grooves, slots, recesses and
mortises. To make any of these cuts, work only with a sharp chisel.
Cut slots or grooves by first making parallel saw cuts on either
side of the groove. Hold the chisel blade between the thumb and
forefinger, and chisel out the material between the cuts. Try to
keep the chisel as level as possible so the blade remains parallel
with the work surface, otherwise the chisel will dig deep into the
stock. Remove the material by slicing off thin layers. This layer
technique is called ''paring.''
</P>
<P>
   To cut a mortise, a slot that mates with a tenon, first drill a
series of holes slightly narrower than the width of the tenon slot.
Hold the chisel vertically and use a mallet to clear out the waste
and cut a rectangular hole with straight sides.
</P>
<P>
   Cold chisels are used to remove material from hard stock like
metal or masonry. The types of cold chisels available and the
techniques for using them will be featured next week.

ST. PETERSBURG: BEAUTY, CULTURE, BEACHES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ So what if neighbor Tampa boasts a
thriving nightlife, Busch Gardens theme park, a cruise port,
National Football League and National Hockey League teams and one
of the nation's most efficient airports?
</P>
<P>
   And skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're vacationing in Florida, you want beaches, right? Ocean
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Surf's up! But only if you point your compass west across the
causeway _ any of three will suffice _ to the Pinellas County
peninsula, which hugs the Gulf of Mexico and encompasses nine
resort communities.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting exploration here are two of the nation's top seven
strips of sun-kissed sand, as decreed by no less an authority than
``Dr. Beach'' (aka Florida International University coastal
geologist Dr. Stephen Leatherman).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 35 miles of beaches beckon within the St.
Petersburg-Clearwater-Dunedin corridor. Acres and acres of
nature-oriented state and county parks, too. These provide the
perfect complement to Tampa's urban ambience and contribute
mightily toward attracting 8.9 million annual overnight visitors to
a common region known as ``Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, too, a secret weapon on the bay's west bank:
</P>
<P>
   Sleepy St. Petersburg, the town _ not to be confused with St.
Pete, the beach, a 15-minute drive away _ has tossed a dose of
culture into the mix of enticements.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy dose.
</P>
<P>
   Within a one-mile radius, six museums vie for attention. Two
have earned world-class recognition: the Florida International
Museum, where a major exhibition focusing on former President John
F. Kennedy opens in November, and the Salvador Dali Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Sand castles and Dali not enough? St. Petersburg sports a
big-league team, too, baseball's second-year Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
who play inside a cavernous domed stadium known as Tropicana Field.
As a bonus, the world-champion New York Yankees conduct spring
training here.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a town once described as the ideal place to relax
between morning and afternoon naps.
</P>
<P>
   First, Dr. Beach:
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Leatherman uses 50 criteria to rate more than 650
public beaches. (Any chance there is a waiting list for the
professor's field trips?) In the 1999 survey, Caladesi Island State
Park Beach, three miles off the mainland from Dunedin, was ranked
sixth. Fort De Soto Park Beach, at the peninsula's southern
extreme, was judged seventh. Four of the top five are in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherman also named Clearwater Beach the top city beach in the
Gulf region. (A map on Page 7G provides an orientation.)
</P>
<P>
   Touting 361 days of sunshine (at least a peek) per year, the
area is a beehive of activity, with hundreds of hotels, motels,
condominiums, restaurants and shops fronting the water.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are ample places to escape. Caladesi Island, for
instance, is accessible only by boat (with passenger ferries
operating from Clearwater and Honeymoon Island). The island is home
to several types of ospreys, and park rangers point the way to
self-guided nature tours.
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula also is recognized as the state's birding capital.
The annual Florida Birding Festival (Sept. 30-Oct. 3 this year and
centered in Clearwater) allows an opportunity to see 19
``state-listed'' species, including the redfish egret, the rarest
egret in North America, and the Florida scrub-jay, the only bird
species unique to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary at Indian Shores is a nonprofit
rescue mission and refuge for more than 500 wild birds.
</P>
<P>
   Golfing, fishing, sailing, biking _ the entire area is an
outdoor lover's delight. But everyone needs an occasional break
from the Florida sun. Thus, we switch focus to St. Petersburg's
wondrous museums:
</P>
<P>
   The Florida International Museum, generally considered the
state's premier cultural attraction, opened in 1995 with an unusual
approach: Present one blockbuster exhibition over an approximate
six-month period, then dismantle it and close the doors while
spending the next six months preparing for the next showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Even the walls are torn down, giving the museum a new look with
every exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Already, more than 2 million visitors have viewed attractions as
diverse as ``Titanic: The Exhibition''; ``Splendors of Ancient
Egypt''; and, most recently, ``Empires of Mystery. The Incas. The
Andes. And Lost Civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John F. Kennedy: The Exhibition,'' which opens Nov. 12, will
feature items from the world's largest private collection of
Kennedy memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Among objects on display will be Kennedy's rocking chair,
bearing the imprint of his back brace; the red, white and blue
telephone that provided a link to the White House during
presidential travels; and the flags that flew on Kennedy's car in
the Dallas motorcade during which he was fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
   Many items _ including those of a personal nature relating to
the president, first lady and other family members _ are expected
to form the nucleus of a permanent display here once a $10 million
expansion allows some museum areas to remain open year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvador Dali Museum already serves as the full-time home of
2,500 objects associated with the artist. The collection features
94 oils _ including six of 18 acknowledged Dali masterworks _ and
numerous watercolors, sketches and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Docents guide tours and provide analysis of some of Dali's most
famous works, including the immense ``Hallucinogenic Toreador'' and
``The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus.'' Brochures are
available to facilitate self-guided tours.
</P>
<P>
   Also in St. Petersburg:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Museum of Fine Arts is acclaimed for its French
impressionist collection.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Florida Holocaust Memorial Museum is the nation's fourth
largest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Highlights at the St. Petersburg Museum of History include a
replica of the Benoist airboat flown across the bay from St.
Petersburg to Tampa on New Year's Day 1914, marking the debut of
commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Great Explorations: The Hands On Museum allows children to
stretch their imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   A trolley system (one token price for all-day rides) serves all
museums and other downtown St. Petersburg attractions, including
``the Pier,'' a five-story complex overlooking Tampa Bay and
featuring an aquarium, shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Recommended for lunch or dinner is the Moon Under Water, at 332
Beach Drive. Billed as a ``British colonial tavern,'' this
establishment offers indoor and outdoor dining, with specialties
including fiery-hot chicken, shrimp or vegetable curries; Indian
pizza; black-bean quesadillas; Key lime pie; and 16 varieties of
draft beer.
</P>
<P>
   Two area lodgings merit special attention:
</P>
<P>
   _ The 360-room Renaissance Vinoy, attractively situated beside
Tampa Bay in downtown St. Petersburg, dates to 1925. Shuttered for
18 years, the hotel reopened in 1992 following a $93 million
refurbishment. Features include a new 18-hole golf course, 14
tennis courts, two pools and a spa. (Call 727-894-1000 for
reservations.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Don CeSar, a European-style resort and spa at St. Pete
Beach, began serving guests in 1928. It was on the verge of being
demolished before new owners restored its grandeur during the '70s.
Amenities include 275 waterfront rooms, two large beachside pools
and a full-service beach club. Sunsets over the Gulf are
spectacular. (Call 800-282-1116.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask college students about buying textbooks, and don't be
surprised if they groan. The twice-yearly ritual usually means
standing in line at the campus bookstore with arms full of heavy
books _ some of which sell for as much as $100 each.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment grows when students realize that most of their
arm loads will be a heavier burden at the end of the semester, when
they must contemplate lugging the books to their next apartment or
trying to sell them for a fraction of their price.
</P>
<P>
   This year, online textbook sellers are ready to capitalize on
those hard feelings. Some of them have opened Web-based shops to
give students an alternative to campus bookstores. Others are
Internet offshoots of the brick-and-mortar stores already in place
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of a massive sea change in the way
college students are _ and will be _ buying textbooks,'' said Eric
Kuhn, a co-founder of one of the textbook sites, Varsitybooks.com.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are now falling over themselves to get students'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Efollett.com, one of the largest textbook sellers, recently
began a $10-million advertising campaign with the slogan ``Get out
of Line.'' It includes television advertisements featuring penguins
in single file scooting along the ice. Ecampus.com, an online
bookshop that opened this summer, has started a $10-million
promotional campaign as well, including advertisements on
television, in Rolling Stone magazine and on 8,100 movie screens
around the country. Varsitybooks.com, another competitor, recruits
students as campus representatives to spread the gospel about its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every online shop boasts discounts, promising to provide
a better deal than students could ever find offline. Textbooks.com,
for example, offers a price of $80.80 for ``A Primer for Calculus''
(Wadsworth), $8.95 off the retail price, the company says. Finding
discounts in the 40 to 50 percent range is much less likely, but
some companies do feature a few books with such price cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There are important differences among the many textbook shops.
Students may like the convenience of being able to click a few
buttons to order their books, but will they still have the option
of selling them back? Not all sites offer this possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to sell books back _ it's huge,'' said Fiona
Smith, a recent graduate of Columbia University. ``After you've
taken a traumatic statistics class, the last thing you want to do
is keep that book.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever savings they find on the Net, students should take
shipping costs into account. The discounts may sound tempting, but
does the cost of mailing 20 pounds of chemistry books cancel out
any savings? And will the books arrive before that first assignment
is due? Students buying online should never place an order without
checking a site's shipping information first.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, just as things get crowded among online textbook
shops, other Internet-based methods of acquiring textbooks are
appearing on the horizon. Some students may find that they can get
the best deals not by visiting online bookstores but by
participating in online auctions, like www.studentauction.com,
Campus24.com, and other college-based auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   And publishers are starting to offer digital textbooks can
simply be downloaded from the Internet. One spot to search for
digital textbooks is Wizeup, at www.wizeup.com, which is developing
online versions of books from Houghton Mifflin, W.W. Norton and
other publishers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the new online shops are focusing on the challenge of
balancing the efficiencies of running a huge centralized bookstore
with students' desires for customization.
</P>
<P>
   Some students have been buying one or two textbooks on
Amazon.com for years, but relying on their on-campus bookstores for
their major purchases because those stores organize their shelves
by course lists supplied by professors. The most serious online
booksellers have tried to replicate that convenience.
</P>
<P>
   VARSITYBOOKS.COM
</P>
<P>
   Varsitybooks.com gets points for shaking up the market. Last
summer, the company unveiled its Web site (www.varsitybooks.com) to
the surprise and consternation of some traditional college
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   When the company's marketers distributed advertisements on
George Washington University's property last August, for example,
security officers ordered the marketers to move elsewhere _ a move
that attracted media attention and, according to the company, drew
more students to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Kuhn and Tim Levy, two entrepreneurs in their 20s, started
the company, which gets its books from a large distributor in North
Carolina and offers discounts of up to 40 percent off retail
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Varsitybooks.com will probably be most useful to students on the
300 campuses for which the site offers course lists. Students at
the University of Texas at Austin, for example, would first click
on the appropriate region on the map of the United States to find
their university listing. Another click takes them to a list of
disciplines, then to a list of course titles, and finally to a list
of books.
</P>
<P>
   The site also allows students to search for books by title,
author, or the 10-digit international standard book number or ISBN.
</P>
<P>
   The company offers a flat shipping rate : $4.95 for UPS
second-day air and $17.95 for UPS next-day air. (The deal may
motivate roommates to buy their books together.) If students don't
receive books in the allotted time, Varsitybooks.com promises to
refund the shipping charges.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not offer students the ability to sell their
books back, nor does it sell used books. Books can be returned
within 30 days, however, for a full refund, not including shipping
costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   EFOLLETT.COM
</P>
<P>
   The Follett Higher Education Group manages bookstores for about
600 colleges. Follett's online counterpart, efollett.com, is
designed to be an online complement to those stores. It also serves
another 275 campuses that have made arrangements to provide
efollett.Com with the book lists for their courses. Students can
find books on the site by conducting searches by course, by
university, by subject, or by title, author, and ISBN.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can order used or new books. If they are enrolled in
one of efollett's partner schools, they can either have the books
shipped or pick them up at the campus store the next day. ``Online
shopping is not going to replace the traditional bookstore,'' said
Tim Dorgan, the company's senior vice-president of e-commerce.
``It's an additive.''
</P>
<P>
   For students who are not on a campus with a partner bookstore,
books are shipped from Follett's 400,000 square-foot warehouse in
River Grove, Ill. Shipping prices start at $3.95 for the first book
shipped within three to five days. The prices go up 95 cents for
each additional book. To receive the order within two days, the
cost is $8 more; a next-day order costs $12.00 more.
</P>
<P>
   To return books, students must send them back or bring them to a
partner store within 15 days during the regular school year and 7
during summer terms.
</P>
<P>
   The site gives students the option of selling their ``gently
used'' books. Students are directed to the site's Buy Back Locator
to find the closest store that will receive their books.
</P>
<P>
   TEXTBOOKS.COM
</P>
<P>
   Go to the textbooks.com site, and you cannot miss its major
selling point: big red letters scream savings of up to 50 percent.
The site, which opened earlier this month, gets its books from a
200,000 square-foot warehouse in Columbia, Mo., that is affiliated
with Barnes &AMP; Noble's college stores.
</P>
<P>
   Textbooks.com does not organize its offerings by course lists.
It assumes that most students would rather get the most updated
reading lists straight from their professors, said company
president Patrice Listfield. ``We're not convinced that posting a
booklist yet is the most critical factor,'' Ms. Listfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Students can search for used or new books by author, title, ISBN
or keywords. They may have to wait several minutes for matches to
appear, however. This week, at the height of book-buying period,
the site was painfully slow in loading pages.
</P>
<P>
   The site also lets students sell their books back. Before you
place an order, the site tells you how much money it will return if
the book is sent back at the end of the semester. The average
buy-back offer is 45 percent of the selling price. The company even
includes a pre-paid return label with its orders, so that students
don't have to pay for the return shipping. Textbooks.com also takes
straight returns, if the books are returned within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping costs $4.95 regardless of how many books are ordered;
the cost goes up for second-day and next-day orders. The site also
offers a further 10-percent discount to members of Student
Advantage, a company that distributes identification cards that
enable students to get discounts.
</P>
<P>
   BIGWORDS.COM
</P>
<P>
   This site comes with a bright orange background and a
20-something attitude. One page highlights an introductory calculus
book ``for your casual reading pleasure.'' The company's chief
executive, Matt Johnson, is a 24-year-old college dropout who is
trying to emulate the Amazon.com model by going directly to
publishers and distributors to pull together books that students
order. The most popular books are ordered ahead and held in a
warehouse in Hebron, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Bigwords.com offers a search-by-school option for students
looking for course reading lists, which in most cases are lists
that professors have sent to the site. But just searching by title,
author, or ISBN is probably their best bet. The site offers savings
of up to 40 percent and urges buyers to join its ``tell a friend''
program in which students can earn rebates for purchases made by
people they have referred.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers free shipping if the order is over $35 and the
student does not need it within the next few days. For next-day
delivery, the price is $11.90 for the first book and $1.95 for each
additional book. Books can be returned for refunds within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   ECAMPUS.COM
</P>
<P>
   Free shipping is also the appeal of Ecampus.com, an online
company started by Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's restaurants,
and nine other investors. No minimum order is required to take
advantage of the free shipping _ but if a customer needs a book in
two days or less, there is a price. The cost is $10.95 for next-day
delivery of one book; $14.95 for next-day delivery of two or more.
For two-day delivery, the price drops to $7.95 and $9.95
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ecampus, like other online book shops, is frantically collecting
as much information as possible about specific courses at campuses
and adding it to its databases. To entice colleges to send course
lists, the company has offered them a commission on books sold
through the lists. More than 80 colleges have signed up so far.
</P>
<P>
   If information is not available for a student's campus, book
searches can be conducted by author, title, keyword, or ISBN. If
books are returned within 30 days, refunds are offered. The site
also sells used books, buys books back (it includes prepaid
shipping label), and is set up to run online auctions. The books
come from a 250,000 square-foot warehouse in Lexington, Ky., where
Ecampus.cCom is based.
</P>
<P>
   THEUZONE.COM
</P>
<P>
   The U Zone opened last week as a college Web portal that is
hoping to draw students in by selling them textbooks at cost. In
other words, the site is like many of today's Internet start-ups
that seem almost to brag about not making a penny of profit. Matt
Ogden, one of the site's founders, expects the company to sustain
itself through advertising and commission sales of other
student-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
   The company has focused on gathering course lists from the 17
largest public universities. Students who are not at one of those
schools should search by title, author and ISBN. Shipping fees
start at rate of $3.00, plus 95 cents a book. For delivery within
two days, the cost is $8.00 and $1.95 a book; for next-day
delivery, the cost is $12.00 and $2.95 a book. Prepaid shipping
labels are included for students to return books.

LIVELY TOBACCO CITY CELEBRATES ITS CLIMB FROM PIPE DREAM TO TOURIST
MECCA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YBOR CITY, Fla. _ It's a typically boisterous Saturday evening
along Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of revelers _ locals and tourists _ mingle on the
pavement; crowd into shops, coffeehouses and nightclubs; and
celebrate from wrought-iron balconies, a setting reminiscent of New
Orleans' Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   Only more sanitized.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the Metropolitan Cigars store, where he paints on
weekends, Arnold Martinez explains to mesmerized onlookers how he
committed actor George Burns and baseball player Tino Martinez to
canvas _ using Cuban coffee and abstract tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Several paces down the street, King Corona Cigar Factory
proprietor Don Barco offers not only a smoke but a haircut and a
glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   At the 7th Heaven Psychic Cafe, diners savor Venus and Mars
salads, Aquarius and Gemini bread and Angel Bites, a dessert.
</P>
<P>
   More down to earth, the Columbia Restaurant _ 94 years old and
bigger than ever, with 1,660 seats in myriad ornate dining halls _
is renowned for its Cuban black bean and Spanish bean soups, paella
``a la Valenciana'' and nightly flamenco dancing shows.
</P>
<P>
   This compact community _ officially a National Historic Landmark
District within Tampa and only two miles west of the city center _
bustles with activity just as it did a century ago, after Vicente
Martinez Ybor (pronounced EE-bore) fled the political and labor
unrest in his native Cuba and established the world's largest cigar
empire here.
</P>
<P>
   As in that era, Ybor City's appeals bridge cultural and
generation gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many other places in the world where you can see
someone with purple spiked hair and a bone in his nose in pleasant
conversation with an 80-year-old man in a business suit,'' says
Barco.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's safe here. Safer than in a mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a pause. ``It wasn't safe here 20 years ago,'' Barco says.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Martinez is more blunt. ``Just eight years ago this was a
desolate place,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is, in a sense, a riches-to-rags-to-riches story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never bring back exactly what it used to be,'' says
Martinez. ``But ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ybor's City,'' as it was commonly known, took root in 1885
and quickly attracted emigrants from Cuba and much of Europe. At
its peak, the district's 200 factories employed 12,000 workers who
produced up to 700 million hand-rolled cigars in a year.
</P>
<P>
   This was a cultural melting pot: Spaniards supervised most of
the factories. Cubans, both white and African in origin, were
largely responsible for the cigar making. Germans designed
elaborate labels for cigar boxes. Italians established bakeries and
vegetable farms. Romanian Jews opened banks and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The cigar workers helped fuel Tampa's growth for more than 50
years. And theirs was a remarkable existence, perhaps best
illustrated through exhibits at the small but fascinating Ybor City
State Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Most couldn't read or write. Yet they knew well the words of
Victor Hugo and Emile Zola and recognized the librettos to some of
the world's great operas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cigar worker had little schooling but became knowledgeable
enough to carry on conversations with any intellectual,'' says
longtime resident Oscar Bonis, a museum volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Men arrived for work in white shirts and ties, women in dresses.
And they contributed 25 cents of their weekly paycheck _ only $7 or
$8 _ toward retaining a ``lector'' to read aloud to them from a
platform as they meticulously went about their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workers would vote to select what they wanted the lector
to read,'' Bonis said. ``It might be the Wall Street Journal. Or a
great novel. He would read all day.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little discrimination either, says Bonis, who grew up
in this environment in the 1920s and early '30s. ``Men and women
were paid equally for the same job. Black and white families lived
next to each other. Romanians spoke Spanish as fluently as we did.
The majority of my best friends were Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   Most workers lived in and _ thanks to an innovative
payroll-deduction plan implemented by Ybor prior to his death in
1896 _ sometimes owned shotgun houses, so named because you could
open the front door and shoot a gun or slingshot through the back
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any money,'' Bonis says. ``We were lucky to
have one pair of shoes. They were always white, and when winter
came we'd dye them black. If we got a hole in them, we'd plug it
with cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were rich in other ways. Every family had its bread
man, milkman, iceman, coffee man, fish man, vegetable man, candy
man. You might call them peddlers; we called them entrepreneurs.
They delivered everything to our house. The people at the fancy
country clubs didn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while living and working side by side, each ethnic group
organized separate community organizations that included a library,
athletic facilities, dining rooms, dance halls _ and medical
services with insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd pay 25 cents a week to join one of these social clubs,''
says Bonis. ``Before you paid the rent or bought food, you paid for
the club because you had to have the medical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These were really the first HMOs, way ahead of their time,''
says painter Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   A few clubs remain active (without medical benefits). And some
loyalists _ including professionals at the Gonzalez y Martinez
factory adjacent to the Columbia Restaurant _ continue to hand-roll
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   But Ybor City's boom cratered in the 1930s, with cigar-making a
victim of the Depression, of new machinery, even of the ``lector''
who was replaced by radios when factory management began to fear
that the daily readings, which occasionally focused on working
conditions, were creating unrest.
</P>
<P>
   While Tampa as an entity, and St. Petersburg across the bay,
grew together into a prominent metropolitan area, Ybor City's
demise continued for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Never a puritanical place _ ``We didn't care that the hotshots
killed each other,'' Bonis says _ the town became riddled with
crime. Businesses shuttered. The close community all but dissolved.
The Columbia Restaurant was its only real lure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a cigar town, tourism was a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Martinez gazes out the window of the Metropolitan Cigars
shop and focuses on the mass of humanity sauntering along Seventh
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This street was our mall,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is again.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, a massive community effort has resulted in
more than 150 new businesses opening in Ybor City, creating 1,500
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 40,000 or more people congregate on weekend evenings,
jamming lively Latin cafes to sip cafe con leche (coffee with
milk); browsing _ and buying _ in art galleries and eclectic shops;
dancing to jazz, salsa and reggae; spilling into the streets where
uniformed officers maintain tight control. Seventh Avenue, all but
deserted a decade ago, is so popular that come sundown it is
reserved for pedestrians only.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million people visited Ybor City last year. And that
represents only a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A 91-room Hilton, which opened last month, is the community's
first major hotel development. If it succeeds, others likely will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   A 200,000-square-foot entertainment complex will open next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   A trolley line _ once the main link between Ybor City and
downtown Tampa _ is being rebuilt and targeted to debut prior to
the Tampa-hosted Super Bowl in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ybor City also continues to honor its past.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the King Corona Cigar Factory _ in reality a store now,
not a factory _ Don Barco says, ``My wife's great-grandparents came
here when Ybor started everything. My children are fifth-generation
Ybor City residents. We made cigars by hand here until the '80s;
now, we import most everything, but we still sell one hand-rolled
Ybor cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   And that two-chair barber shop situated beside the cigar
shelves?
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a lot of barbers in Ybor City,'' Barco says.
``Not anymore. So we added a barber shop. Then, when people wanted
a quiet place to relax, we opened a wine bar. We like to combine
tradition with something different.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Martinez, who crafts cigar-box labels when not busy with
celebrity portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't begin painting until 1977,'' he says, ``but soon I
was experimenting with abstract tobacco and water. Then, I said,
wow, if I can do this, maybe I can paint with coffee and tea.
Coffee and bean. I've even painted with coffee and beer.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Museum, on Ninth Avenue, exhibits and films follow
the rise and fall of the cigar industry and the presence here in
1898 of Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders in advance of the
Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   An authentic shotgun house is open for inspection next door, and
the museum society sponsors walking tours on Thursday and Saturday
mornings. Appropriate to a museum occupying the site of the town's
first bakery, displays also include an oven used for baking bread
in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Delectable Cuban breads are still a readily available bargain,
too. At third-generation family-owned La Segunda Bakery, a short
drive or long walk from the center of activity, guava and cheese
turnovers cost 85 cents. Or join the locals for a traditional
breakfast of Cuban toast (85 cents) and Cuban coffee (75 cents) at
La Tropicana Cafe on Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the early cigar makers appreciated good food, dining
again is an integral part of the Ybor City experience.
</P>
<P>
   Options range from upscale Bernini's try Caribbean stuffed
lobster with crab, shrimp and Jamaican Blue Mountain curry finished
with a banana and exotic rum sauce) to Cha Cha Coconuts (where
appetizers include Cuban caviar _ pureed black beans _ and
plantains).
</P>
<P>
   As for those Venus and Mars salads at 7th Heaven Psychic Cafe?
Earthlings know them as spinach and garden.
</P>
<P>
   No other single enterprise stands more at the heart of Ybor City
than the Columbia Restaurant, which represents a link between the
early heyday and current revival.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1905 by Casimiro Hernandez as a corner cafe popular
with cigar workers, the Columbia is in its fourth and fifth
generation of family ownership. Florida branches thrive in St.
Petersburg, Clearwater Beach, Sarasota, St. Augustine and
Celebration (near Orlando's theme parks), but none rivals the
original in scope and style.
</P>
<P>
   Decor at the exterior and within 11 dining rooms includes
hundreds of hand-painted tiles depicting the fanciful world of Don
Quixote. Marble walls, wrought-iron gates and antiques add to the
opulence.
</P>
<P>
   Whether dining in a garden setting or showroom, consider
starting with the Spanish bean soup _ served since opening day _ of
sausage, garbanzo beans and potatoes in a beef stock, then proceed
to the ``1905 salad,'' another original Casimiro Hernandez
creation: lettuce, ham, tomato, olives and Swiss and Romano cheeses
dressed with a blend of fresh garlic, oregano, wine vinegar, lemon
juice and Spanish olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Cuban and Spanish entrees vie for attention with
steaks and seafood. And save room for Spanish custard topped with
cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   Then, back into the night. A stroll along Seventh Avenue. Where
Mr. Ybor's City has new life.
</P>

EXPO 99 GIVES HOUSTON MINORITY FIRMS VALUABLE CONTACTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By REBECCA MOWBRAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For Abdul Khalfe, succeeding at Expo '99 is about
starting with the small contract.
</P>
<P>
   For competitors Terri Hornsby and Sonyia Graham, it's about
devising creative solutions to a company's needs.
</P>
<P>
   For Sherra Aguirre, it's about researching the company to make
just the right pitch and building the relationship over years.
</P>
<P>
   For Lupe Fraga and Nikki Pinto, it's their biggest marketing
opportunity of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, these and about 800 other minority entrepreneurs
will hobnob with representatives from some of Houston's largest
companies at the Expo '99 trade show at the George R. Brown
Convention Center, in hopes of building their businesses as
corporate suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Minority Business Council's event is a rare
opportunity for business owners to meet with corporate procurement
directors who control multimillion-dollar budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A market that in the past has evaded them is now accessible to
them,'' said Executive Director Richard Huebner. ``It (Expo)
enables minority-owned firms to identify opportunities, business
processes, where the marketplace is, and to position themselves to
be successful to compete for those larger contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 23 years, Expo has grown to include more than 200
corporations and government agencies and 800 minority-owned
businesses. Minority firms that plan ahead can arrange to sit with
their top corporate prospects at lunch, and meet privately with
them in 15-minute one-on-one sessions scheduled throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the participants report getting a contract within
eight months of Expo as the result of the event, Huebner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tejas views Expo as our major marketing tool. Where else can
you get information about hundreds of corporations in a day? It
would take years of cold-calling,'' said Pinto, sales manager at
Tejas Office Products, a company that derives half of its revenues
from big-name clients at Expo. ``If Expo doesn't work, it's because
you didn't work Expo. You have to follow up.''
</P>
<P>
   So that participants get as much out of the event as possible,
Jewel Smith, the minority and women business enterprise coordinator
at Reliant Energy, holds training sessions for the corporations and
minority companies.
</P>
<P>
   Smith coaches minority businesses to be patient and flexible
while looking for ways to build relationships with exhibitors at
Expo, and reminds corporate participants that they have a
responsibility to be facilitators.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this being such a key day, as corporate partners, we owe
it to the minority businesses to be very focused in our listening
skills to make the match work,'' Smith said. ``We should be there
not just to answer questions, but to become the point person in the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Business owners who've participated in Expo say that knowing
what to expect really helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being overwhelmed,'' Aguirre of Aztec Facility
Services says, referring to her first Expo in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, corporate customers were less than 5 percent of her
small facilities maintenance business. Today, her company has 700
employees, and corporate customers make up 60 percent of her
business.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of building relationships at Expo, Aztec won
the maintenance contract for Phillips Petroleum's Houston chemical
complex and world headquarters in Oklahoma, an opportunity Aguirre
believes came because she took the time to understand the company's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very interested in knowing where their business is
headed and what their specific department goals are,'' Aguirre
said. ``My advice would be to do as much homework as you can _ then
you have something to talk about. You're more engaging when you
understand their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the intensity of the day, most first-time Expo
participants don't get any contracts. However, his first year,
Abdul Khalfe, vice president of AllPrinting Office Supply, walked
away with a contract to print Houston Community College's forms.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past seven years, Khalfe has built his company by
picking up government contracts at Expo _ he's printed business
cards for Harris County and the U.S. Air Force, and memo pads for
the city of Houston, and will be angling for more paperwork
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Khalfe meets companies at Expo, he asks questions about
their current suppliers and how long a business is under contract.
If someone is already under contract, Khalfe asks if the company
seeks outside help to handle the overflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `Just try us out. Give us a small job,''' he said.
``Then, we just keep calling them every other week. It's being very
persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Participating corporations say they keep the business cards of
the people they meet at Expo for when new contracts open up.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after Expo, Compaq Computer Corp. hired Graham,
president of Mirror Perfect Marketing, who had done some small jobs
for Compaq, to develop an Intranet site where employees could
purchase Compaq merchandise. At Expo, Graham had let Compaq know
she had expanded into online catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we weren't looking specifically for Sonyia, but
during the year this electronic commerce need came up,'' said Rob
McArthur, director of corporate procurement at Compaq. ``Sonyia was
willing to work with our procurement personnel to create a
solution. It was really her willingness to listen to our needs and
customize it that got people really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said companies like hers need to know how to sell their
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that you know the quality of what you have
to offer,'' Graham said. ``You don't represent yourself as a small
business, you represent yourself as a quality business that's able
to meet and exceed the standards of a large corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   A competitor in the same business of supplying promotional items
to companies, Terri L.C. Hornsby, president of TLC Adcentives, won
a contract and a mentor in Toshiba International Corp. because she
put more effort into her pitch than her competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to the first interview with a mock catalog. It was so
inventive. Nobody else brought a catalog. She sold her company,''
said Marie Fuentes, a buyer at Toshiba. ``For promotional stuff,
the pricing is pretty much all the same, so it's whoever can come
up with the most creative ideas. She wanted the business and she
wasn't afraid to do the homework it took to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, Toshiba has taken a more active role in helping
Hornsby build her business than simply being the other signer on
the contract. When Toshiba learned that Hornsby would have to take
out loans to finance the catalog, the company offered to cover the
costs of the catalog's production for the first year, while Hornsby
handled the inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the second year of the relationship, the two are working
together to put that catalog online, an experience that will expand
Hornsby's marketability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost been like a mentoring type of program,'' Hornsby
said.

   Tom Buckley didn't have much use for a dating service, or so he
thought. ``I didn't need to pay a company to help set me up to get
a date, a girlfriend, a fiancee, a wife,'' said Buckley, 30, a
steel broker in Portland, Ore., who plays rugby in his spare time.
But after a lonely Thanksgiving dinner where he was the only single
adult at the family dinner table, Buckley signed up for a free week
on Match.com.
</P>
<P>
   What ensued on the matchmaking service was an e-mail romance
with Terri Muir, a schoolteacher on Vancouver Island in British
Columbia. ``Anybody who knew us would never have thought we would
have gone down that road,'' Buckley said in a telephone interview.
``My rugby mates would roll in their graves.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the couple's instant attraction, he said, ``e-mail
made it easier to communicate because neither one of us was the
type to walk up to someone in the gym or a bar and say, `You're the
fuel to my fire.''' Buckley said e-mail had enabled him to be more
honest because he knew that if he wasn't, he would eventually get
caught.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months after their first feverish exchanges, Buckley
and Ms. Muir lied to their family and friends and sneaked away to
Vancouver to meet for the first time. At their wedding one year
later, at a winery in Oregon, they finally told the tale of how
they had met to their 100 guests.
</P>
<P>
   More and more single people, used to finding everything else on
the Internet, are using it to search for love. More than 2,500 Web
sites for adults are now devoted to matchmaking, said Daniel
Bender, founder of Cupid's Network (www.cupidnet.com), an Internet
portal for personals sites that went online in 1995 listing only a
handful.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many people are staying single longer, busy
professionals barely have time to squeeze in workouts and rules
about sexual misconduct pose barriers to romance in the workplace,
the Internet can be a fast and efficient way for single people to
find each other, say creators of these services. Many singles say
they post their ads on a lark, expecting little. They take
advantage of free trial memberships, yet concede that despite their
doubts, they wonder ``what if.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Knedlik, a lawyer in Kirkland, Wash., who specializes in
suing traditional dating services for fraud, is optimistic about
the potential for the Internet to accomplish successful
matchmaking. ``The Internet is changing the landscape and process
of the personals,'' Knedlik said. The print personals don't work
very well and the expense is very high, he added. ``With the
Internet, the cost is so much less and the transaction time is
shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Web has to distinguish it from more traditional
personal advertisements is the size of the dating pool. Match.com
president John Spottiswoode, (who, incidentally, met his wife in
junior high school), said his company registered its 2 millionth
subscriber in August.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company was acquired for about $50 million by
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch, which also purchased the Internet's
other largest personals matchmaking service, One and Only
(www.oneandonly.com). The two companies will eventually be merged
to chase after the 66 million single people in the country today
who are not only looking for love, but tickets to concerts, said
Charles Conn, chief executive of Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Internet's large dating services, American
Singles, (www.as.org), is a
not-yet-for-profit-but-soon-to-be-acquired company that has been
online since Valentine's Day 1994. It says it has 125,000 active
members.
</P>
<P>
   All these sites and more are also linked through Cupid Network,
which Bender, 38, started in 1995. (He met his wife through a
personals page on Prodigy nine years ago, and he also runs American
Singles.)
</P>
<P>
   At first, Bender said, Cupid Network listed only a handful of
sites. Today, the 2,500 linked sites are broken down by region,
religion, race, sexual preferences and even values, as evidenced by
a site called Singles With Scruples (www.singleswithscruples.com),
a free service that says it caters to singles with ``character,
integrity and service to others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Single people tell us that their No. 1 challenge is access to
finding other single people,'' said Trish McDermott, the online
dating coach for Match.com. She said she spent most days counseling
the company's clients through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the services, users fill out a questionnaire that
combines fill-in-the-blank descriptions with short personal essays.
On these forms, mate-seekers not only describe themselves in
exacting detail, but also choose _ frequently down to hair color _
what features they most desire in a soul mate. Many sites encourage
users to submit photographs, and some even offer audio samplings.
</P>
<P>
   The services use software to sort and match preferences of the
sort commonly expressed in personal ads: for nonsmokers, blonds,
lovers of cabernet, for example, or for bald but vigorous men who
like parasailing, Wagner and long walks in the country. Those
seeking a mate submit their forms with their preferences, then
receive a list of matches, which includes brief profiles and
anonymous e-mail addresses set up and run through the online dating
service.
</P>
<P>
   After a free weeklong trial, many services charge $10 to $20
monthly. Some services are always free.
</P>
<P>
   On Match.com, users can hide their profiles while doing their
searching or hang out their personal shingles to attract potential
dates. After scanning the list of matches, a date-seeker sends an
e-mail message to who they think might be the person of their
dreams and hope that their message will be answered with alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a full world of people on the Internet instead of the
few faces you see at work,'' said Julie Warren, 25, a consultant in
Falls Church, Va., who met her fiance, Scott Mastbrook, on American
Singles, after he posted an ad looking for someone to show him
around Phoenix when he was traveling there on business. Ms. Warren
was working in Phoenix at the time and had met other men through
the service.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Warren said she felt unencumbered by the usual stigma
associated with searching for love in the personals. ``I've met a
lot of neat people just talking in chat rooms,'' she said, adding
that using the service to find dates seemed natural to her.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships that begin online may have a better chance of
succeeding because they start from the inside, from communication,
and work their way out, says Dr. Andrea Baker, an associate
professor of sociology at Ohio University-Lancaster who studies
successful online romances and is gathering success stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, this does seem to work well in the sense of
focusing more on the thought processes and common interests before
they have appearance to distract them from how they feel about the
person,'' Dr. Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   But a romance cannot continue solely online forever. And, if a
suitor has built an e-mail house of cards, it will tumble on the
first date.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Dr. Maryanne Shiozawa, 26, a chiropractor in New
York, discovered when she finally dated a man she'd met through an
online dating service, one of two services that she had signed up
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person lied straight out, he wasn't as tall as he
described, he wasn't in as good shape as he claimed to be, he was
just painting a picture to impress me,'' she said. After their
date, Dr. Shiozawa sent her date a Dear John e-mail. Still, she
continues to meet men from from personals online because she says
she hates the bar scene and feels safe meeting men in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   For Robert Spradling, the house of cards fell apart later than
the first face-to-face meeting, and at great personal cost. He had
struck up an online romance with a Ukrainian woman whom he met on
American Singles. The woman immediately asked him for money to pay
the agency she was using to translate and send her romantic e-mails
back to him. There are many such agencies in the former Soviet
Union, Spradling said. Next, she told Spradling she wanted to start
her own matchmaking agency.
</P>
<P>
   Spradling, 42, an employee in the development office at Morehead
State University in Kentucky, footed the bill for that, too. After
sending her about $8,000, Spradling asked her to marry him, via
e-mail. She said yes and invited him to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you meet somebody and you think you're in love you never
see any faults,'' said Spradling, who said the couple made wedding
plans when he was visiting. After his return to the United States,
Spradling never heard from her again.
</P>
<P>
   He's sworn off finding love through the Internet for now. ``If I
paid twice as much, it would still be worth what I learned,''
Spradling said. ``I caution a lot of guys to be careful and keep
their head and learn a lot about who they're dating online.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for some the Web can work like a fairy tale. When Diana
Hathaway first spotted Greg Timmons, he was playing guitar in a
swing band at an outdoor concert in San Luis Obispo, Calif. She
called her sister by cell phone from the concert to tell her about
the cute guitarist. They planned to see the band play again at a
local club the following week so Ms. Hathaway, 39 and recently
divorced, could meet him. But she never put her plan into action.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Ms. Hathaway posted a personal ad on Match.com,
in which she wrote about how she was thinking of moving to a new
town for a fresh start. One of the e-mail responses she received
read, ``Before you go, there's a gentleman you might want to
meet.'' Eight quick e-mails later, the gentleman invited her to a
local club to see his swing band.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hathaway went, and there was that cute guitarist, Timmons.
Less than nine months later, they were married. For Christmas, Ms.
Hathaway filled a binder with the 339 e-mails the couple exchanged
while they were courting and labeled it ``We've Got Mail.''

<P>
   PERSONALS ONLINE: A USERS GUIDE
</P>
<P>
   Finding a soul mate on the Internet can be as random an
experience as bumping into that person in the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   To try to beat the odds, start with a service that has lots of
members. Or go to one that a specific target audience. Many people
try both, like placing different sorts of bets on a roulette wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast runs a free service, www.swoon.com/go/personals,
which it says has 125,000 active members. The site's irreverent
tone asks users to fill in profiles featuring a ``sin index,''
which is the standard drug, cigarette and alcohol-use questions
found on many of the services, and to catalog their pop culture
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The service at www.2ofakind.com has 150 categories users fill
out to start their matches. A free trial is offered, then the cost
jumps to $1 for each match.
</P>
<P>
   There is live chat on www.hugkiss.com, a page featuring virtual
animated hugs and kisses to use to seal e-mail after an online
romance has sparked. The site includes a column, ``Ask a Mom,''
offering advice on all matters of love.
</P>
<P>
   If romance blossoms online and you arrange a face-to-face
encounter, take precaution. Experts advise that first dates be held
in public, preferably in daytime. Park your car close to the
meeting place. Tell a friend where you are going and when to expect
you back. Despite the flurry of excitement you may feel if you
think you've found your soul mate, there is always the possibility
that your date can become ``the date from hell.'' More likely,
though, if you don't hit it off, it will simply be chalked up as a
bad date.

   Grub Problem? Maybe
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a lovely Malva in the garden, but unfortunately it
attracts Japanese beetles. Can Japanese beetles cause a grub
problem in the lawn?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The adult Japanese beetle's well-known appetite for leaves of
Malva, rose, grape, hollyhock, pussy willow and others is easily
matched by its larvaes' appetite for grass roots. Controlling grubs
successfully means planning your attack. Knowing when your enemy is
weakest is the key.
</P>
<P>
   First, scout out the situation to see if you have a grub problem
worth treating.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Rossi, assistant professor of turf grass science at
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said that Japanese beetle grubs
are commonly found in well-irrigated, shady sections of the lawn.
In early September, when the grubs are actively feeding on grass
roots, peel back some of the turf and look for one-half- to
one-inch-long, milky white grubs with brown heads. The problem is
not bad enough to treat if the population is below 10 per square
foot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More serious infestations should be treated when the larvae are
small and most vulnerable. In the Northeast, this period is from
early August, when the eggs hatch, into September, when the grubs
begin migrating down into the soil to avoid the colder weather.
They overwinter below the frost line and return to the surface in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Effective biological controls for grubs are a Holy Grail of
horticulture. Milky spore disease, which infects young larvae and
is passed on like an epidemic, can be applied now, but takes
several years to spread through a population and is rarely more
than 15 to 25 percent effective. Dr. David Smitley, professor of
entomology at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said that
the university was researching several other promising Japanese
beetle pathogens but that a commercial product was probably 10
years away.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Grub-X and Grub-B-Gone are newer insecticides
with lower toxicity than older products'. They attack the grubs
when they molt, and are effective, but have to be applied in
mid-May in order for them to be there at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, you can use a traditional lawn product
labeled for grubs. But take a peek under the lawn first. There may
not really be a problem worth worrying about.

   Watering Myths
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you please clarify the issue of keeping water off foliage
in full sun? I've been told that it is best to water from the base
of plants in full sun because water can act like a magnifying lens
and burn leaves. I can understand that base watering is the most
effective way to get the roots saturated, but why keep leaves dry
when they get wet naturally?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Along with those gift plants that suck the oxygen out of
hospital rooms, possibly suffocating their recipients, magnifying
water droplets are a most persistent horticultural myth. Water
droplets do magnify a bit, but not enough even to warm the leaves,
let alone burn them. Enjoy the glistening leaves without worry.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the little bit of truth that accompanies most
myths is that watering the soil at the base of plants really is
better because it is a more efficient use of water. Water that
lands on leaves evaporates before it reaches the ground, as does
some of the water thrown into the air by a sprinkler. Even before
summer droughts cause watering restrictions, it makes sense to
conserve by watering effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The smartest gardeners water at dawn or in the early morning.
With the whole day ahead, any water that does land on leaves has a
chance to evaporate long before sunset. It is best not to water in
the evening because leaves stay damp much longer, and damp leaves
are a terrific breeding ground for many fungus diseases.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the 2000 presidential race cranking up especially early,
the denizens of that fabled ZIP code, 90210, are beginning to do
what they do best in every election cycle: dust off their
checkbooks and let their money fly.
</P>
<P>
   If money is the mother's milk of politics, then 90210 is one of
the biggest cash cows around. That Beverly Hills ZIP code gave more
to federal candidates last year than any other in California, by a
long shot, and more than most other ZIP codes in the country. This
year, the rich and famous are starting early: Candice Bergen has
given the Gore campaign $1,000, Rob Reiner kicked in $2,000, Jack
Nicholson gave $250 and Hugh Hefner $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barbra Streisand, one of 90210's biggest givers in 1998, with
more than $38,000 in donations, has also given Al Gore $1,000 this
year, though she has since switched her address to Santa Monica
(90401). Warren Beatty, a 90210 resident who says some people are
urging him to run for president, has given nothing to anyone _
perhaps deciding to save his money for his own bid.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this information come from? The Web, of course, where
technology is shedding new light on political contributions. Once
hidden in dusty archives and often kept in hard-to-find spots that
politicians did not make any easier to locate, campaign finance
records on the state and national levels are now available on a
growing number of user-friendly Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it is not just the rich and famous whose
donations can be tracked but everyone's _ even yours and your
next-door neighbors'. All campaign donations are considered public
information, and the records are readily available for public view.
</P>
<P>
   This technological development is adding a new dimension to
political discourse. Where political races once focused primarily
on personalities, partisanship and issues, an awareness of _ and
concern over _ the role of money in politics has grown. In large
part, technology is driving and accelerating the debate by
providing more and more information.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone knew who gave money to Franklin D. Roosevelt or
Dwight D. Eisenhower or Harry S. Truman. But that ignorance _ which
was sometimes the result of political calculation _ has been
replaced by a new transparency.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is making it easy for journalists, competing
candidates and ordinary citizens to connect the dots between
politicians and their sources of money. And that has come about
despite efforts by many in Congress to keep the activities of the
Federal Election Commission, the government agency that collects
much of this data, to a bare minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people can sit at their terminal and pull up all this
information,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center
for Public Integrity, a policy research group in Washington. ``For
the presidential race, you don't have to leave your work station,
and this means the barriers to getting this information have been
substantially removed. This is an extraordinary development.
Anyone, anywhere in America, can click onto one of these Web sites
and see who is behind their lawmaker. And they couldn't five years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound pie-in-the-sky,'' continued Lewis, whose
group has state-level campaign finance information on its Web site,
www.publicintegrity.org. ``But this brings democracy and
accountability much closer to the average citizen. Frankly, it's
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, however, it is not so wonderful. As the availability of
financial records has grown, so have attempts to evade disclosure.
In the last few years, independent advocacy groups have cropped up
to to sponsor televised political attack ads that are not connected
with any candidate or party. These groups enjoy a legal loophole
that allows them to stay out of government records and spread their
money in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the unintended effects of this new visibility is a
growth in some of these subterranean activities,'' said Kenneth
Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in election law.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are around a half-dozen campaign finance Web
sites, each offering slightly different information or different
ways to connect candidates and dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites focus on the relationship between campaign donations
and votes on Capitol Hill. Others provide information on every
shred of campaign finance data filed with the government, including
exact copies of the often-obscure filings. Still others focus on
candidates at the state level, going into minute detail on the
sources of money for state legislative office-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero for all this information is the Federal Election
Commission. Each federal candidate and party must provide filings
with the commission on how much money is raised, who donated it and
how the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the information was stored on paper in one spot in
Washington or on computers that required a trip to the commission's
offices to use. But in the 1996 elections, the commission began
putting much of the information online, though the site was not
easy to use then.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance rules adopted after Watergate limit individual
contributions to $25,000 a year. They permit individuals to give no
more than $20,000 to a national party, $5,000 to a political action
committee and $2,000 to a candidate _ up to $1,000 for the primary
and $1,000 for the general election. Corporations and unions are
prohibited from donating to federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Those restricted contributions are often called hard money. By
contrast, soft money is the name often given to what individuals,
unions and corporations can give in unlimited amounts to national
party committees for ``party-building'' activities.
</P>
<P>
   These are the big-money donations. While ostensibly earmarked
for generic activities like voter-education programs, soft money
has become a way for big donations to go almost directly to
candidates _ an abuse that has led those concerned about campaign
financing to call for a ban on this type of contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Whether hard or soft, all donations must be reported to the
elections commission. Since it first listed donations online in
1996, the commission has vastly improved its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At www.fec.gov, everything anyone could possibly want to know
about federal election rules and donations is available. And,
borrowing some of the user-friendly techniques of campaign finance
Web sites run by public policy groups, the commission has made its
site much easier to navigate. It is now easy for anyone to punch in
a person's name under the View Contributions category on the home
page (try William Gates, for instance) and see their donations.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets a person view the actual documents filed by the
candidates (for instance, the page listing Gates' $3,000 donation
to the Republican Majority Fund, a political action committee, in
which Gates describes his occupation as ``CEO''). And, unlike on
other Web sites, all spending data and every document filed by
candidates and political committees with the government can be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought of ourselves as being responsible for
providing the basic raw material at this Web site,'' said Robert
Biersack, the site's Webmaster. ``We also want to provide a very
close, visible connection to the original source document. The
connection between computer data and the original document is very
important to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's also new is the way our data interrelates,'' Biersack
added. ``You can go to a candidate's filings and then find out who
else is giving to that candidate or committee in a
stream-of-consciousness way.''
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy of all independent campaign finance Web sites,
and perhaps the most comprehensive, is www.tray.com, which was set
up in 1996 by two former Federal Election Commission employees,
Tony Raymond and Kent Cooper, who formed a Washington research firm
called Public Disclosure Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Their site takes often-fragmented commission data and organizes
the information into an accessible, logical and simple-to-use
format. Whether it's following individual donations, looking at the
Clinton legal defense fund, tracking the 2000 federal candidates or
exploring soft money donations, the site is a one-stop shopping
center for campaign finance data.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the section about the 2000 presidential race, a
search for information about Dan Quayle shows not only donations,
but also transfers to his campaign from party committees as well as
all his disbursements and the locations of all his contributors.
The contributor list can also be sorted by employer and occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The page on Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, for instance, shows
donations dating to 1980 and links to all political action
committees that have given to him. It also includes money he has
given to other candidates and his personal financial statement. The
site has links to the actual documents filed with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in putting this information out without any
spin,'' said Raymond, ``because we feel the dollars speak for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond said the site averaged around 7,000 to 12,000 visits a
day earlier this summer, a number that he said would ``go through
the roof'' when the 2000 election got into full swing later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site for the Center for Responsive Politics
(www.opensecrets.org), the emphasis is on the correlation between
campaign contributions and votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The site has easy-to-read reports on different industry groups
and which candidates got their contributions. And its candidate
profiles are comprehensive, showing raw data for who gave money as
well as data for industry groups, presented with colorful graphs
and charts.
</P>
<P>
   The site shows, for instance, that Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the Republican presidential hopeful, is getting more money from
every sector of the economy _ except labor unions and lawyers _
than any other candidate, including Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic front-runner. While Bush has received more than $1
million from the oil and gas industry, Gore has received $56,700;
while the health care industry has given Bush more than $1 million,
Gore has received $340,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a sandbox for people to play in,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics.
``We want people to grasp things easily. That's why we use lots of
charts. We want people to see what they got from their candidates
from all this money spent. After any vote in Congress, we want
people to know whether money bought something or failed to buy
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Has all this disclosure and potential public scrutiny made some
donors squeamish? The answer is: sort of.
</P>
<P>
   And one side of politics that often does not show up on campaign
finance sites involves issue advocacy groups. In the last
presidential election, such groups poured millions of dollars into
television advertisements attacking candidates or praising them _
but without expressly advocating a candidate's election or defeat.
Because the groups operate independently of the candidates and
their ads do not contain the words ``vote for'' or ``vote
against,'' the law does not require that they register with the FEC
or list their donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that all this Internet data is leading to some of
the current pressure to move donations off the radar screen,'' said
Trevor Potter, a Washington lawyer and former Federal Election
Commissioner. ``A lot of people who didn't want their activities
disclosed in the first place are more threatened and trying more
vigorously to avoid that spotlight.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So this guy's got a saltwater fish tank in his house, and he's
got an octopus in there. And he's got another tank _ a freshwater
one _ in the same room. He notices the freshwater fish are
disappearing _ mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   No way, he thinks. It can't be.
</P>
<P>
   But he sets up a video camera and, check this out, the octopus
was actually crawling out of its tank in the middle of the night,
eight-legging it across the living-room floor, eating the other
fish and crawling back. You don't even want to know about the time
it screwed the lid off a Mason jar.
</P>
<P>
   Fish stories like these used to be the exclusive conversational
material of marine biologists and bald Bond villains. Now they
could be cocktail-party fodder, as saltwater fish tanks have become
increasingly dramatic home-design accouterments. And, according to
Frank Greco, a senior aquarist at the New York Aquarium in Coney
Island, the octopus has become something of a ``status fish.''
</P>
<P>
   In commercial spaces, elaborate, expensive fish are deployed to
wow and soothe at Barneys New York, Bloomberg, Wenner Media and,
soon, at the Russian Tea Room. When the new Tea Room opens in
October, it will have a revolving bear-shaped tank _ a 16-foot-tall
acrylic casting _ with hammerhead sturgeon milling around inside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these man-made water worlds have crossed over into domestic
decor. These are no mere glorified goldfish bowls. Saltwater fish
fans see their custom-made tanks as living art, with as much
life-and-death action as any home theater system, plus educational
value for the children, even as they bemoan them as maintenance
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The use of acrylic instead of glass means that bigger tanks can
be built, with bigger fish inside, like sharks. (The movie ``Deep
Blue Sea'' imagines the ultimate shark tank gone wrong.) Filtration
systems can be tucked away out of sight, so that the tanks blend
seamlessly into the decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've gotten into people actually making the aquarium the
focal point of their homes,'' said Sal Franzi, the owner of Total
Marine Paradise in New Rochelle, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   Ratifying the chic of underwater oddities, a long essay in ``The
Work of Charles and Ray Eames'' (Abrams, 1999) analyzes a short
film by these two legendary furniture designers made recording the
balletic movements of a hydromedusa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a little bit hip, unfortunately,'' said Aby Rosen,
a New York real estate developer whose 600-gallon L-shaped tank is
in September's Architectural Digest. ``But we always wanted to have
big fish.''
</P>
<P>
   He does: sharks, eels, yellow and blue tangs, rainbow and
parrotfish, four types of coral. The tank, about 8 feet long and 4
feet high, is built into the wall as a liquid room divider between
the kitchen and breakfast area in the Rosens' sleekly modern Park
Avenue apartment. Rosen said the tank cost about $30,000, not
counting the $200 to $300 monthly cleaning, feeding and fish
replacement bills. ``The maintenance is a killer,'' he said. ``It's
like buying a fancy car.''
</P>
<P>
   But worth it, he insisted. ``We thought of it as something
calming and relaxing,'' he said, ``and a breakfast room is where
you start the day off. The kids also love it. It quiets them
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect who designed the tank-divider, William Georgis,
described his creation in more poetic terms: ``To see nature in
your midst,'' he said. ``Without natural light, to have this window
onto nature and the underwater world is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly smitten aquaphiles are building fish tanks in
bedrooms, gyms, around fireplaces. Don and Carol Stern made their
new 600-gallon tank the centerpiece of their house in Mahwah, N.J.,
wrapping for 12 feet around a brick wall that encloses a spiral
staircase. Sharks, tangs and triggerfish swim behind two-inch
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color is so gorgeous,'' said Stern, the chairman of a
company that supplies sound, lighting and video equipment to
theaters around the country. ``And my wife is a decorator, so she
loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fish do seem to have swum upstream from tacky to tasteful.
``Fish tanks have gotten away from their usual appearance,'' said
Peter Pawlak, an architect at Gwathmey Siegel in New York. ``They
have become part of the wall. They have become room dividers and
integrated themselves into other pieces. And they have become
objects of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bray, the owner of the House of Fins in Greenwich, Conn.,
said he had recently installed five saltwater tanks in a house in
Armonk, N.Y., and is working on an $80,000 tank in Manhattan.
``There's always a $30,000 job going on,'' he said. Over the last
two years, the number of people he employs to service such
supertanks has grown from one to five.
</P>
<P>
   Other major fish-tank mongers all profess to be equally busy
trying to fill the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going crazy for them!'' said Craig Beital, whose
Beital Aquarium Sales and Service in Pearl River, N.Y., has built
and stocked 25 custom aquariums in the New York area since January,
among them Rosen's. ``Tanks are getting bigger and better by the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Saltwater's a lot prettier,'' said David Katz, the president
of Matrix Asset Advisors, who has a tank at his office and one in
his home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He defected from freshwater two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Victoria Rivamanti, a neural psychologist in New York,
described freshwater tanks as ``just kind of boring.'' The
custom-made, pentagon-shaped marine tank in her New York apartment
is filled with tangs, sailfins, anemones, living coral and colorful
little slugs called sea apples.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic attention spans of the fish fanatic is easily
challenged. Take Andrew Sandler, a 33-year-old portfolio manager in
New York who felt the need to upgrade to a reef tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, I found that with just fish tanks I get
bored,'' he said. In the 120-gallon mini-reef in his Manhattan
apartment, you can hardly see the triggerfish for the forest of
living coral. His Acropora, stony and a dozen other varieties of
coral require high-intensity blue fluorescent lighting, which
Sandler provides daily on a timer set from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's packed wall-to-wall,'' Sandler said of his dense coral
collection. ``They're stinging each other. I'm out of space!''
</P>
<P>
   There's a rule for crowding fish _ one five- to six-inch fish
per 10 gallons of water, but nothing hard-and-fast for coral. To
accommodate the overflow, Sandler is expanding to a 700-gallon reef
tank in the house he's building on Long Island, in Old Westbury.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Technicolor visuals, the allure of a big marine tank
is the constantly unfolding action on these underwater stages. The
fish friendships. The fin-to-fin combat.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Rivamanti said, ``When you put a new person _ a new
fish,'' she corrected herself _ ``in the tank, the other fish sort
of swim at them, because they're very territorial. If a fish is shy
or depressed, they could eat away at him, and he could die.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fish that are supposed to get along, don't always. At the House
of Fins, Bray watched an eel swim up to a new stingray, check it
out, then eat it. Lionfish will sometimes bite, or sting, the hand
that feeds them.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, perhaps, considering that these domesticated
fish are some of nature's toughest specimens. Much of the saltwater
trade comes from the Red Sea, Indonesia and the Philippines, where
the cyanide divers often use to stun the fish can have unfortunate
side effects, killing the fish, causing irreparable reef damage and
endangering the divers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Various estimates of the number of fish that don't survive
cyanide capture range from 50 percent to 90 percent, compared with
10 percent for net-caught fish. Last year, a group of scientists
organized Project Seahorse to draw attention to the dwindling
population of this popular fish, which is hunted for medicinal use
in China and for aquariums, public and private, in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Many fish that survive are still too fragile to be transported.
``Most of them die on the way over,'' said Greco of the New York
Aquarium. Or once they get here.
</P>
<P>
   Tish, the world's oldest goldfish, died this month in England at
the age of 43. Not many saltwater fish make it past 8 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be prepared for fish to die,'' said Scott Sanders,
the president of Mandalay Television who built a tank into the wall
of the bedroom in his apartment, using a plain wood frame that
makes it look like a wide-screen TV. ``When the fish dies, you're
the one that has to take it out of the tank.'' Sanders was
introduced to fish by his business partner, the producer Peter
Guber.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders linked his lifelong love of fish to his astrological
sign (Pisces). ``Even though it's expensive, so are great
paintings,'' he said. ``And it's a living painting.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a painting, a tank is a high-maintenance commitment
of feeding and cleaning. Water must be changed, algae scraped off
the tank, filters changed, saline levels checked and temperatures
maintained at a constant level, in the high 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you do it yourself or pay professionals $200 a month,
saltwater tank ownership is ``not to be taken lightly,'' Sanders
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure the tanks look great, but forget to secure the lid, and you
never know what might crawl out.

   As popular as the notion of wireless computing may be, there
remains one significant technical snag: speed. The state of the art
in sending data to and from mobile devices is woefully
molasses-like: around 9,600 bits, or 9.6 kilobits, per second. Even
those home computer users still using a 14.4-kilobits-per-second
modem are better off than anyone on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular carriers and other networking companies are rushing to
fix that. In the next five years, more than a dozen companies will
spend tens of millions of dollars to upgrade the nation's wireless
systems so they can handle data at higher speeds. The result should
be wireless data transmission for mobile computers that rivals many
of the high-speed lines currently used for computers that stay put.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, beefing up the wireless systems for data
means adding software and hardware to tens of thousands of the
cellular base stations dotting the landscape and to the networks
connecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many consumers in the United States have only
recently made the switch from analog to digital service and have
barely begun to use their new digital phones for two-way data
transfer and messaging, the changes are likely to mean that they
will need yet another new cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrades will arrive in piecemeal fashion _ much like the
way the current wireless systems came to be.
</P>
<P>
   For some carriers, the first step in the transition is an
increase to 14.4 kbps. Several companies, including Air Touch
Cellular, Sprint PCS and GTE, have announced such a service. The
first to introduce it was Air Touch, whose Net Access service costs
$4.99 per month; it requires the purchase of a $150 Qualcomm Thin
Phone or another compatible handset. Air Touch will be offering the
service in the next seven months in the 17 states where it
operates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Sprint PCS announced a 14.4-kbps service
called Sprint PCS Wireless Web, which will be available nationwide
Sept. 20. Mobile telephone customers will have access to some Web
content and will be able to use their phones to retrieve bits of
information, like stock quotes, from Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we'll find out from this introduction is how excited
consumers are about data,'' said Chuck Levine, the chief sales and
marketing officer for Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Even 14.4 kbps, though, is still antediluvian when it comes to
sending data. That speed does not allow much beyond transmitting
e-mail and files and checking Web sites for relatively small
amounts of information. But those who promote the new services say
it can make a huge difference to a harried executive to be able to
sit at an airport gate and check e-mail or a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a mobile professional whose only solution is to wait until
they get to the hotel, this is an incredible breakthrough,'' said
Jonathan Marshall, a spokesman for Air Touch.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001 or so, such services could be eclipsed by a system known
as 2001X, or 1X, which will use a standard called code division
multiple access, or CDMA. The standard has been embraced by
carriers like Sprint PCS and Bell Atlantic. The upgrade to 1X will
increase data speeds to 144 kbps. AT&AMP;T and other carriers are
supporting a technology with similar speed.
</P>
<P>
   After 1X will come 3X, also known as 3G, the true third
generation for high-speed wireless transmission, and speeds of up
to 2 megabits per second. At that speed, it would take 6 seconds to
download ``Moby-Dick''; at 14.4 kbps, it would take 15 minutes.
Forecasts vary, but 3G is expected to be up and running on a number
of cellular networks by 2003. It will arrive in Europe and Japan
much sooner, analysts say, because the transition to digital
wireless service there has come more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, full-scale deployment of 3G in the United States is not
certain. For one thing, incompatible and competing standards for
digital service are slowing the development of third-generation
service. Moreover, the third generation would require a much
heftier investment in network upgrades, which has made U.S.
carriers wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carriers are still building out their 2G networks in the U.S.,
and these networks are adequate for today's subscribers,'' said
Callie Pottorf, an analyst at International Data Corp., a market
research firm. ``It will take a lot to convince a bank they should
finance a wireless carrier's 3G build-out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And not all carriers are setting their sights on standardized
next-generation networks. One of the more intriguing alternative
plans comes from an alliance among MCI Worldcom, Vulcan Ventures
and Metricom, a Los Gatos, Calif., company that operates an
innovative network in a smattering of metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan Ventures, the venture capital firm run by Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen and MCI Worldcom each paid $300 million to
build Metricom's 128-kbps wireless Ricochet 2 network. Metricom has
partnerships with local utilities so radio transmitters can be
mounted on utility poles, and it plans to offer the service in 12
markets by next summer and in 21 markets by early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and industry executives are questioning the need
for ultra-high-speed data transfer over wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, What will customers do with such high speed
links for data?'' said Oliver Valente, vice president for advanced
systems development at Sprint PCS. ``It will depend on the market
we see for very high-speed data.''
</P>
<P>
   But those with fewer reservations propose a longer view of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of this isn't about communicating with your cell phone,''
said Craig Farrill, chief technology officer for Vodafone Air
Touch, which includes Air Touch Cellular. ``We're going to offer a
lot of different devices in the future. A cell phone is one device,
with a small screen.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It will be fun to see what people do with a million
bits per second. It will change lives more than mobile has.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Purdy, president and chief executive of Mobile Insights, a
market research company in Mountain View, Calif., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone will do a demo of a Palm VII in 2006 and it will be
called the comedy show,'' he said, referring to the new wireless
device from Palm Computing that retrieves information from the Web.
``And today it's called the innovative show.''

   &UR; Synchronize Briefcases &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I run Briefcase in Windows 95, any Excel files that I
have changed do not transfer. Instead, I receive a message that
says the ``file-name will not be updated because its merge handler
cannot be loaded.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. For those who haven't used it, the Briefcase in Windows 95
and 98 is a utility that lets you synchronize a file on different
computers over a network or direct cable connection. When you put a
file in the Briefcase on one computer, any changes you make to that
file will be updated on both computers so you do not have different
versions of the same document..
</P>
<P>
   A number of things could cause a merge-handler error when you
are trying to updating a file. You might get the error if you are
limited to read-only access for the network server the file is
stored on. Try copying the file to your hard drive before putting
it in the Briefcase. This error might also occur for files that
have the Read Only attribute checked. (To disable Read Only, select
the file in Windows Explorer, go to Properties under the File menu
and uncheck the Read Only box.)
</P>
<P>
   If the file is stored on a floppy disk, make sure that the tab
on the top of the disk is in the unlocked position. Having
different versions of Microsoft Excel on the two computers could
also cause the error, so try saving the file again in the later
version of the program.

SOMETHING SULTRY BENEATH THE PIN OAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had gone to Landcraft Environments, a wholesale nursery in
Mattituck, N.Y., to see hardy bananas I could supposedly grow in my
vegetable garden. And there they were, a whole grove, their bright
green paddle-like six-foot leaves swaying in the 100-degree breeze
as if they'd spent the last few million years evolving on sandy
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's root hardy to minus 10 degrees,'' Dennis Schrader said as
we stood under the welcome shade of the plants, Musa basjoo,
Japanese fiber bananas that can reach 16 feet in a single North
Fork summer. ``We let the whole top get hit by hard frost,'' he
added. ``Then we wrap the stem with straw and plastic and then
burlap, and then put a spackle bucket over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha ha. The bucket is a little salute to the Italian tradition of
wrapping your beloved fig tree, which, after all, is a
Mediterranean plant. So every fall, after a hard freeze, you wrap
your big baby, leaving a little vent at the top for those sunny
days in February when all that plastic turns into a solar
greenhouse. Then you put the beat-up bucket over its head to keep
out the icy rain and snow.
</P>
<P>
   But if you get a warm winter day, you take off the bucket. Such
tender loving care assumes that you are home all day long, making
pasta in the kitchen, changing diapers and so on, and can run out
to the yard every whipstitch to put the bucket on or take it off.
Same thing with a banana plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or,'' Schrader added quickly, ``you can just cut it down to
the base after a hard freeze. Mulch with about eight inches of wood
chips. The small pups come up in the spring.'' The pups are the
little shoots that rise off the rhizomes of the root-hardy plant,
forming big plants of their own. But that takes a while, so your
banana won't be as tall by frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wrap it,'' he continued, ``the leaves start growing
right from the stem. By May, we have leafy bananas 10 to 12 feet
tall.'' A tempting thought. But having killed enough figs for a
lifetime _ by forgetting the bucket _ I'll have to whack.
</P>
<P>
   We stood listening to the gentle crackling of those big green
paddles in the wind. I could picture my own banana grove down in
Maryland, looming like a mirage in the potato patch. The farmers
would think they were hallucinating in the drought.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me. Banana plants are water guzzlers. So if you
haven't had rain in a couple of years, go for agaves.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader and his partner, Bill Smith, started growing tropical
and subtropical plants, along with unusual annuals, 20 years ago
when they couldn't find the plants they needed for a growing
garden-design clientele. They soon filled the greenhouse behind
their house and started longing for something more rural, with a
view. They found it in 1992, in a rundown 1840s farmhouse on 17
acres of potato fields half a mile from Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven years later, they are growing 700 kinds of plants,
testing many of them in their trial gardens, which are occasionally
on the garden-tour circuit. But Landcraft is mainly a workhorse,
supplying plants for high-end nurseries, garden designers, public
gardens and zoos in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   You see tropical plants everywhere these days, from the banana
plants and giant elephant ears in elegant public gardens like Wave
Hill in the Bronx to those hideous, frilly coleus at Home Depot.
But at Landcraft, it's not a Victorian resurgence of ruffles and
chartreuse. It's as if all the plants in the world had been tossed
up in the air and landed among the oaks, the butterfly bushes, the
hydrangeas and roses in the mixed border.
</P>
<P>
   ``My design theory is just a matter of form, color and
texture,'' Schrader said. ``It doesn't matter what plant it is, as
long as its cultural requirements are met. If the color of a
tropical works with a native woodland plant, why not use it?''
</P>
<P>
   We stood by a pin oak underplanted with a six-foot Australian
tree fern and a sea of a fiery coleus named Alabama Sunset. Its
salmon leaves vibrated like tuning forks against the pink fur of
the tree fern's stems. And those banana plants were growing next to
holly trees! That seemed an almost perverse disregard for plant
communities, like making a cat sleep next to a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is becoming so global,'' Schrader said. ``I can fax
New Zealand and have seeds within two days, so why stick to native
plants? There's a French seed company on the Web, where you can
search for, say, plants with yellow flowers indigenous to Borneo,
and it spits out a list from its database.''
</P>
<P>
   I wandered around a bit, seeing which plants raised my heart
rate. Nine-foot lime-green elephant ears (Alocasia macrorhiza)
marching up the drive toward the house. Dracula-like Solanum
atropurpureum, its black thorns bristling over bright yellow
poisonous berries. Fragrant daturas, with eight-inch white trumpets
laced with lavender, surrounded by chest-high red millet.
Washingtonia palms rising out of blooming mint, yarrow and bronze
fennel.
</P>
<P>
   What mad plant lover could not fall down and worship here? I
loved the tropical Aristolochia littoralis, dangling its bawdy
veined pouches from a rustic arbor that faces a little pond full of
lotus, papyrus, waterlilies and frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith built it from a locust tree downed in a storm, and the
curving branches, raised like arms to support the top of the
pergola, evoke the saguaro cactuses of Arizona. Agaves and cycads,
those plants that survived the dinosaurs, coexist on the bluestone
terrace in an exhilarating confluence of climates and time zones.
</P>
<P>
   In other places, it feels like too many ingredients stirred into
the soup: the double border of peegee hydrangeas, David Austin
roses, variegated corn, pineapple lilies, Egyptian onions, red
cannas and Mexican feather grass, which looks like a mop of
bleached hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to throw out the rules and toss those pastel color
schemes and sedate native plants on the compost heap and create
something wild and riveting,'' Schrader and Susan Roth, a
photographer and garden designer, write in their book, ``Hot Plants
for Cool Climates,'' due out from Houghton Mifflin early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The book not only offers readers a taste of the best
tropical-style gardens in the country but also catalogs some 500
plants, complete with cultivation tips (how to wrap that banana,
for instance, or dig up those elephant ears and store them in the
cellar).
</P>
<P>
   If you are wondering about tropical plants invading the next
township, don't worry, the authors say: they die off after a hard
freeze. (So don't send any slips to Aunt Mabel in Louisiana, though
I know you will.)
</P>
<P>
   I still hate that blasted coleus, but I love the vision of black
elephant ears rising like African shields over my little bed of
ruby beets. Though this water issue troubles me. Maryland's corn
crop bit the dust this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader is quick to point out that many tropicals are desert
dwellers. So if global warming turns New York into some kind of New
Arizona, start thinking cycads and saracenia. Let's leap back a few
million years to plants that knew better than to grow leaves, much
less flowers and berries and stuff. It takes too much energy for a
world covered in dust.

 &HT;    DOG DAY CARE CENTER CARES FOR PETS OF WASHINGTON WORKAHOLICS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    BY JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yap-yap-yap.
</P>
<P>
   A record-setting summer drought had broken with a morning rain
shower. The familiar smell of wet dogs and the vague odor of guilt
floated around the entrance of a day care center a few blocks from
the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Dog-Ma, a relative newcomer in the growing pet day care
industry, was open for another day of cashing in on a peculiarly
Washington need _ that of guilt-ridden workaholics whose dogs get
too little attention because meetings that run long or reports that
have to be finished tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bisgyer, founder of the establishment, says her clients
range from congressional staffers to World Bank economists, from
lobbyists to a man whose responsibilities involve the protection
and mobility of a certain Very High Federal Official.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 a day, only a little more than a corps of ``dog
walkers'' charges for an hour-long afternoon stroll with a pooper
scooper and a plastic bag, Bisgyer offers constant supervision, a
midday nap and, best of all, the company of other canines.
</P>
<P>
   So, when their owners unhook the leash and hurry off for a day
of comparing perks and status, enrollees at Dog-Ma get right to the
business of making their own comparisons. Since most of Bisgyer's
charges are there only two or three days each week, the clientele
is constantly changing and a great deal of sniffing is required.
</P>
<P>
   A single woman unsnaps the leash, kisses her affable, 160-pound
English mastiff puppy on the nose, urges him to ``be a good boy''
and hurries off to her job. Sebastian doesn't even look back,
evidently aware that one of his favorite playmates, a chocolate
labrador named Nestle, has arrived ahead of him and will be ready
for a game of tug the rubber ring.
</P>
<P>
   He strolls over to where Nestle is standing on the picnic table,
already holding the ring. He takes the other side and effortlessly
snatches her off the table. Another labrador joins Nestle's side,
and Sebastian (who still has about 60 pounds of growth ahead of
him) stands and wags his tail while they struggle together in
ecstatic futility to take the ring away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just like kids,'' says Bisgyer, who left her own
long-hour job in Washington to start the business, partly out of
guilt over neglecting the needs of her two dogs. ``The come here in
the morning, play like crazy for a few hours, take a nap, and play
some more in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   She now runs the business with her husband, Nick Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress is in session and hours grow long, several Capitol
Hill staffers pick up their pets and take them back to the office
for a few more hours. That works because the dogs are usually
exhausted and are quite content to nap quietly while legislation is
analyzed and constituent mail is answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebecca is a savior,'' said Ginny Terzano, director of public
affairs for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. ``The
guilt factor of leaving Jack at home was so great. For someone like
me, with a high-stress, long-hours job, Dog-Ma is a way of sort of
getting off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the arrangement, Terzano said, is the fact that
at the end of the day, Jack is worn out from playing with other
dogs that ``we walk into my house and he just drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Former White House photographer Barb Kinney started taking her
red and white Siberian husky Kaya to Dog-Ma because of travel
demands. Now that Kinney has left the White House to free-lance,
she continues to take Kaya to the center from time to time, not for
convenience but as a treat.
</P>
<P>
   Bisgyer, 37, said dogs must be spayed or neutered, have an
up-to-date shot record and pass a brief temperament examination
before they will be admitted to Dog-ma. Border collies are the only
dogs that are ever a handful, she said, ``and that's because they
tend to be a lot smarter than other dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the dogs are fed in large cages _ and sometimes taken
there for a ``time out'' when they get too rambunctious _ the
operation is mostly cageless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture a pajama party for dogs,'' Bisgyer said.

   The best part of the arrangement, Terzano said, is the fact that
at the end of the day, Jack is worn out from playing with other
dogs that ``we walk into my house and he just drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Former White House photographer Barb Kinney started taking her
red and white Siberian husky Kaya to Dog-Ma because of travel
demands. Now that Kinney has left the White House to free-lance,
she continues to take Kaya to the center from time to time, not for
convenience but as a treat.
</P>
<P>
   Bisgyer, 37, said dogs must be spayed or neutered, have an
up-to-date shot record and pass a brief temperament examination
before they will be admitted to Dog-ma. Border collies are the only
dogs that are ever a handful, she said, ``and that's because they
tend to be a lot smarter than other dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the dogs are fed in large cages _ and sometimes taken
there for a ``time out'' when they get too rambunctious _ the
operation is mostly cageless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture a pajama party for dogs,'' Bisgyer said.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We remodeled part of our family room to serve as an office
and in the process had to move two electrical outlets and one wall
switch to a different wall. This left us with three rectangular
openings in the wall where the electrical boxes were previously
located. We are getting ready to repaint this room, but before we
do we would like to fill in or patch these holes so that the wall
is once again smooth and finished looking. What is the easiest way
for us to fill in these holes without doing an extensive drywall
repair job?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is one method: Use a sharp utility knife to trim away
the edges of the opening so that the edges of the hole are beveled
or tapered inward at about a 45-degree angle as shown in the
drawing. Then cut a scrap piece of drywall the same size as the
outside dimensions of the opening (after its edges have been
tapered). Now taper the edges of this piece to the same bevel on
all four sides, and test for a snug fit when used to cover the
hole. Keep trimming the edges of this patch with a knife or a
coarse piece of sandpaper until the patch fits neatly into the old
hole when pressed lightly into place. Spread a liberal layer of
joint cement over the beveled edges and press firmly into place in
the opening. When the joint cement dries, smooth on another light
coat of joint cement around the outside of the patch to conceal the
seams (if necessary sand a little with fine sandpaper when dry).
This will create a smooth finish ready for painting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 25-year-old house has one room with mahogany panels on the
wall. I recently removed some pictures and the wood in each place
where a picture was hung is now darker than the rest of the
paneling. How can I refinish these panels so the wood will be all
the same color?
</P>
<P>
   A: Without knowing what kind of finish the wood has it is hard
to say for sure, but chances are that the rest of the wood has
faded slightly, leaving darker areas where the wood was always
covered. The only sure way to correct this is to strip off all of
the old finish with a paint and varnish remover and then start from
scratch. If the discolored areas are still darker after the finish
has been stripped off then you may have to use a wood bleach to
lighten them _ or you can stain all the wood a darker color so that
the difference would be much less noticeable. After this you can
finish with two coats of a satin finish varnish, or use a pigmented
wood sealer as a combination stain and finish.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concrete floor in my basement is covered with vinyl
asbestos tile that was installed about 20 years ago. Some of these
tiles are cracked so I want to replace them but the dealer told me
that this particular brand is no longer made. Rather than recover
the entire floor I want to remove some of the good tiles from an
inconspicuous corner and use these to replace the damaged ones. Can
you tell me if this is possible?
</P>
<P>
   A: It may be, but it is hard to say for sure until you try one
or two. Start by using an electric heat lamp or hair blower (set on
LOW) to heat one tile carefully in order to soften it and make it
more flexible, but be careful to avoid scorching. After the tile is
warm use a sharp utility knife to cut into the seam or joint in one
corner, then carefully pry that corner up while still applying
heat. When the corner has been raised slightly slide a wide,
flexible putty knife under the tile and lift it slowly and
carefully. Chances are that you may damage the edges of this first
tile slightly, but subsequent tiles should come up more easily
after warming each one in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have several decorative boxes and other small items that I
want to paint with a shiny black enamel. When I tried painting one
or two with a brush I wound up with streaks and brush strokes that
ruined their appearance. I was told that spraying would give a much
smoother glossy finish, but I do not have a sprayer. Can I get
similar results with an aerosol spray can of paint?
</P>
<P>
   A: In many cases it is possible _ but only if you take the time
to practice on some scrap materials or surfaces beforehand. As with
any sprayer, remember to always keep the spray can moving while
paint is coming out and remember that two thin coats are better
than one heavy one. As you move the can keep it approximately the
same distance from the surface all the time, especially when
painting curved or round surfaces. To avoid a mess, set up a
``spray booth'' by cutting one side out of a large cardboard
carton, then set the objects inside this while spraying them. If
you also set the object on top of an inexpensive plastic ``lazy
susan'' you will be able to rotate the work and thus expose all
sides while you are standing in one place.

A COMPOSER WHO FOUND STRENGTH IN AN INNER VISION 
</HEADLINE>
 -$ADV29 -NYT  (For release Sun., Aug. 29) 
(jt) 
 By PABLO ZINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although centenary celebrations are common in music, the subject
is seldom alive to participate. The Spanish composer Joaquin
Rod-rigo came closer than most to celebrating his 100th birthday,
when he died last month. He was born on Nov. 22 (the feast day of
St. Cecilia, the patron saint of musicians), 1901, in Sagunto,
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo triumphed against remarkable odds. Afflicted with
diphtheria at 3, he lost his sight and nearly his life. He suffered
great penury abroad during the Spanish Civil War. Yet he went on to
produce a large body of music for a great variety of media,
garnering more prizes and honors than any other Spanish composer in
history _ even the title Marquis of the Gardens of Aranjuez _ and
achieving a worldwide popularity that far transcends the field of
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He maintained that it was blindness which led him to music,
giving him a greater inner world, and that he would probably not
have been a musician without it,'' his daughter, Cecilia Rodrigo,
said recently from Madrid. ``He had to write all his compositions
in Braille, then dictate them, note by note, bar by bar and
alteration by alteration to a copyist, and then revise them.'' His
output was so prolific and much of his music symphonically so
complex that his achievement can truly be called unparalleled in
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo's passion for music was ignited by early experiences,
including a concert by the great harpsichordist Wanda Landowska and
a performance of Verdi's ``Rigoletto.'' He took up the piano
eagerly. After studies in Valencia and the publication of some
early works, the promising young composer set out for Paris in
1927, escorted by Rafael Ibanez, an employee of his father. Ibanez
had learned musical notation from scratch just to write down the
young man's compositions. In Paris, Rodrigo studied with Paul Dukas
and met a host of musical personalities: not only Ravel,
Stravinsky, Poulenc, d'Indy, Honegger and Falla but also his future
wife and collaborator, the Turkish pianist Victoria Kamhi.
</P>
<P>
   Kamhi was already an admirer of the composer, thanks to his
short piano piece ``Preludio del Gallo Mananero'' (``Prelude to the
Morning Rooster,'' of 1926). The happiness of their meeting and
courtship (leading to marriage in 1933) was soon followed by their
darkest years. Their families fell on hard financial times and
could no longer support the young couple. Forced to retreat to
Spain, Rodrigo was determined to win a scholarship that would allow
him to return to Paris and rejoin his wife. Supporting himself
meagerly as a teacher at a school for the blind in Madrid, he
eventually won the scholarship, with a little help from his
supporter Falla.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Paris, but after the death of Dukas, the Rodrigos
traveled to Austria, Switzerland and Germany. In Baden-Baden, in
1936, they learned of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.
Rodrigo's scholarship was canceled, and they were caught penniless.
They sought refuge at an institute for the blind in Freiburg,
spending 18 months in utter hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Paris in 1938, after the difficult experience in Freiburg
and still in hardship, my mother lost the child she was expecting
and became extremely ill,'' Cecilia Rodrigo said. ``They did not
know where to turn. He was alone in a disastrous financial
situation, and when my mother left the hospital, they had to sell
the piano to pay for the hospital expenses.'' The Rodrigos decided
to settle in Spain, and the composer carried in his suitcase the
work destined to change his luck: the phenomenally successful
``Concierto de Aranjuez,'' for guitar and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Although tepidly received at its Spanish premiere in 1940,
``Aranjuez'' has taken in more royalties than any other Spanish
work, surpassing even Falla's immensely popular ``El Amor Brujo.''
In 1998 it trailed only the notorious ``Macarena'' and Ricky
Martin's ``Maria.'' It has been arranged for everyone from the
trumpeter Miles Davis (``Sketches of Spain'') and the pianist Chick
Corea (``Spain'') to the tenors Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras,
and the Swingle Singers. To top things off, it was one of the
pieces the astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz
Aldrin took to the moon in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo adamantly rejected the first, unauthorized arrangements
of ``Aranjuez'' and only later in life came to a grudging
acceptance of the quality of some of them (like the one by Davis
and Gil Evans). The work's formidable commercial success does not
in any case detract from its beauty, fine craftsmanship, superb
melodies and wise instrumentation, which made it a perfect vehicle
for the guitar at a time when that instrument was not considered a
worthy classical vehicle. The music's combination of optimism and
nostalgia belies the circumstances of its birth, between the
Spanish Civil War and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rodrigo did not lack detractors. ``He knew the tendencies
of the avant-garde, but he followed his own path, knowing that he
was criticized and sometimes even vituperated in Spain and abroad
by high-flying musicologists who maintained that music which seems
easy to the ear is `easy music,''' Cecilia Rodrigo said. ``But he
wanted to do what he liked, and he felt that he was on the right
road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to make Spanish music but not `espanolada,''' Ms.
Rodrigo continued, referring to the Spanish cliche of patriotic
pasodobles, ``music that was modern but not avant-garde, and he
suffered much because of this invective, of which he was very
aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo liked to answer such criticism, ``My cup may be small,
but it is from my own cup that I drink.'' Gilbert Chase, in ``The
Music of Spain,'' well summarizes Rodrigo's achievement: ``Stemming
directly from the line Pedrell-Albeniz-Falla, he has cultivated a
many-sided nationalism, drawing sparingly upon folklore but
endeavoring to embrace the whole tradition of Hispanic music and
the whole scope of Spanish culture, both in time (historically) and
in space (geographically).''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Rodrigo family boasts a well-organized publishing
house (Editorial Joaquin Rodrigo, based in Madrid), complete with
thorough catalogs and discographies and a Web site
(www.joaquin-rodrigo.com, directed by Cecilia Rodrigo. And the
family tradition of collaboration started by Victoria Kamhi
continues: Ms. Rodrigo's husband, Agustin Leon Ara, has recorded
the composer's violin music.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Rodrigo's own instrument was the piano, he left a
substantial body of idiomatic music for the guitar. His solo pieces
for the instrument range from the charming to the bewitching (as in
the ``Invocacion y Danza,'' of 1961, in homage to Falla).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Aranjuez,'' he wrote two other major pieces for
guitar and orchestra: the ``Fantasia Para un Gentilhombre'' (1954),
based on themes of Gaspar Sanz and dedicated to Andres Segovia, who
would not play ``Aranjuez'' since it had not been written for him;
and the less well-known ``Concierto Para una Fiesta'' (1982), a
late work featuring a hypnotic second movement in an unusually
effective sequence of meters (6/8, 3/4, 5/8). The plucked pleasures
are multiplied in the ``Concierto Madrigal'' for two guitars
(1968), a true compendium of Spanish dance rhythms, treated with
unsurpassed mastery and evocativeness, and the lusty ``Concierto
Andaluz'' for four guitars (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo's least successful concerto is the ``Concierto Heroico''
for piano (1942), a somewhat heavy-handed work that strives vainly
for grandeur. The two pieces for harp and orchestra _ ``Concierto
Serenata'' (1952) and ``Sones en la Giralda'' (1963) _ are as
charming and idiomatic as the guitar concertos.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Concierto Pastoral'' for flute (1978), dedicated to James
Galway, is an exhilarating virtuoso showpiece, and the ``Concierto
de Estio'' for violin (1943) is a jaunty jewel. The ``Concierto in
Modo Galante'' for cello (1949) is as splendid as it is subdued.
There is one more piece for cello and orchestra, the ``Concierto
Como un Divertimento'' (1981), dedicated to Julian Lloyd Webber.
</P>
<P>
   The strictly orchestral works show a more introspective and
far-ranging side of Rodrigo: the epic and somber ``Per la Flor del
Lliri Blau'' (``For the Blue Lily,'' of 1934); the haunting
``Musica Para un Jardin'' (1957), arranged from a set of piano
pieces based on children's songs, full of buzzing, shimmering
harmonies, and the existentially powerful ``A la Busca del Mas
Alla'' (``In Search of the Beyond,'' 1976), possibly a
contemplation of the composer's own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest pleasures of Rodrigo's music dwell in
his piano works. A pianist of considerable accomplishment, he
recorded a number of his own works, accompanied by his wife, in an
EMI release, ``Rodrigo Plays Rodrigo.''
</P>
<P>
   They range from easy children's pieces of considerable charm
(``El Album de Cecilia,'' of 1948, dedicated to his daughter) to
virtuoso masterpieces (``A l'Ombre de Torre Bermeja,'' ``In the
Shadow of Torre Bermeja,'' of 1943, a memorial to the pianist
Ricardo Vines) and the diabolically sensual ``Cuatro Estampas
Andaluzas'' (1946-52). One of his most successful sets is the
``Cinco Sonatas de Castilla con Toccata a Modo de Pregon'' (``Five
Castillian Sonatas With Toccata in the Mode of a Proclamation,'' of
1951), which make masterly use of rhythm, counterpoint and
controlled dissonance in an homage to Domenico Scarlatti and
Antonio Soler.
</P>
<P>
   The piano pieces for four hands are among the best in the
literature. They include the ``Cinco Piezas Infantiles'' (1928),
which achieve extraordinary pianistic sonorities of a genuinely
cinematic quality; the bitingly humorous ``Gran Marcha de los
Subsecretarios'' (1941); the alternately innocent and grotesque
``Sonatina Para Dos Munecas'' (``Sonatina for Two Dolls,'' of
1977), dedicated to and given its premiere by Rodrigo's
granddaughters, and ``Atardecer'' (``Dusk,'' of 1975), a
challenging virtuoso piece with superb overtones of light and dark.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo's attention to children's music is not surprising. A
devoted family man, he woke his daughter and grandchildren seven
days a week playing Bach preludes.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, some of the works both the composer and his critics
have considered his best remain unrecorded: among them, ``Ausencias
de Dulcinea'' (``Dulcinea's Faithful Wait,'' of 1948), for bass,
four sopranos and orchestra, on texts from Cervantes' ``Don
Quixote,'' and ``Musica Para un Codice Salamantino'' (1982), for
bass, mixed chorus and 11 instruments, on texts by St. Francis of
Assisi, one of Rodrigo's last works.
</P>
<P>
   Another unrecorded rarity is ``El Hijo Fingido'' (``The Feigned
Son,'' of 1955-60, based on plays by Lope de Vega), one of the few
viable zarzuelas written after the demise of the genre during the
civil war. ``El Hijo Fingido'' is scheduled to be produced by the
Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid in 2001, commemorating the
centennial of Rodrigo's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo's songs are also underperformed and underrecorded,
except for his ``Cuatro Madrigales Amatorios'' (1948), based on
ancient erotic texts.
</P>
<P>
   As, with his death, we contemplate his output, Rodrigo appears
to merit serious consideration as one of the greatest Spanish
composers of the 20th century. The proof is in the playing and the
listening. Let us take off from those aromatic gardens of Aranjuez
and fly over the distant lands of his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you are, Maestro Rodrigo, here is a toast: May you be
smiling and drinking, from a small cup of your own.

WHEN A REVOLUTION TOOK TIME OUT FOR ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug.29) 
(jt) 
 By ADAM SHATZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best bands to emerge in Cuba in the 1960s was a
doo-wop group called Los Zafiros (the Sapphires). Leoncio (Kike)
Morua, Miguel (Miguelito) Cancio, Ignacio Elejalde and Eduardo Elio
(El Chino) Hernandez were handsome, nattily dressed young singers
from Cayo Hueso, a barrio of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the electric guitar of Manuel Galban, the quartet
combined the suave vocal harmonizing of the Platters with the
sultry beats of bossa nova, calypso and rumba. Among its admirers
were the Beatles, who stuck around for another week in Paris in
1965 to hear the group at the Olympia theater. Because of United
States-Cuban hostilities, however, this splendid confection of
American and Latin pop _ call it nuevo doo-wop _ was seldom heard
outside of places like Poland and East Germany. The Cold War was a
strange time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Cubana,'' a compilation of the band's best work from the
1960s, provides a glimpse of an island obscured by political
sermonizing on both sides of the divide. It's a view of Cuba from
the beaches, not the barricades. The season is summer, and the
subject is love _ or rather the ardor felt by teen-age boys in
bathing suits, staring at a ``lovely mulatta'' walking by and
longing to be ``the sun/ that burns your body.'' Still, while
seemingly impervious to politics, ``Bossa Cubana'' (World
Circuit/Nonesuch 79572-2) is infused with the hopefulness
engendered by revolutions in their early, romantic days. The '60s
were the golden age of Fidel's Cuba: Despite the constant threat of
an American invasion, the new regime was confident of its future,
relatively tolerant and cheerfully cosmopolitan, and the enthusiasm
spilled over into Cuban literature, film and, of course, music.
</P>
<P>
   Los Zafiros was born in 1962 at a barber shop in Cayo Hueso.
Nestor Mili, a composer who had written for the great mambo singer
Benny More, was there to recruit an additional vocalist for a
doo-wop group he had formed with Miguelito and Kike. The
19-year-old Elejalde was among those auditioning. He performed the
``Cancion de Orfeo'' (``Orpheus' Song,'' one of the album's most
stunning tracks) with all the trembling volatility of a female
torch singer. It was the most astonishing voice Mili had ever
encountered in a man, an androgynously high instrument that fell
just south of a soprano. (When the Beatles met Elejalde in Paris,
they asked to look down his throat to see whether he was using a
device.) Elejalde joined the band, as did his friend El Chino, a
balladeer with a deep, smoothly debonair voice.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Mili was replaced as musical director by Galban,
but not before he had named the band after the sapphire ring he
apparently pawned to purchase its fabulous threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Cubana,'' like the Havana nightclubs at which the band
performed, is garishly seductive. The mood is set by imploring bass
lines and delicate, come-hither drumming. The oneiric Spanish
lyrics are not so much sung as caressed with melismatic grace
notes. The title track, a fast, saucy number punctuated with
squeals of pleasure, likens Cuban bossa to ``a young girl's kiss/
coquetish and full of love.'' But love is perhaps too sober a term
for this amour fou, which El Chino defines more precisely in ``La
Luna en Tu Miranda'' (``The Night in Your Eyes'') as a ``blue
madness.''
</P>
<P>
   No strangers to unruly passion off stage, Los Zafiros comported
themselves like most '60s rock stars: they drank a lot, gobbled up
groupies and destroyed hotel rooms. These were not the habits of
good Cuban revolutionaries, and by the late '60s, the band had
fallen out of favor with the authorities. In 1975, it split up. Of
the original members, only Miguelito, an expatriate in Miami, and
Galban, currently a member of the traditional Cuban band Vieja
Trova Santiaguera in Havana, are still living. ``Bossa Cubana'' is
an enchanting tribute to a wonderful group, and to the summer of
love and revolution that called it into being.

   AIRLINE-DRUGS (Miami) _ The smugglers moved with ease through
Miami International Airport and even made their way onto American
Airlines planes parked at the gates, stashing heroin in coffee
containers and hiding cocaine and marijuana in suitcases in the
jets' baggage holds. Investigators say the smugglers did not worry
about being caught by the airline. They were the airline. In a
sting operation that exposed embarrassing security lapses, federal
agents arrested more than 50 American Airlines baggage handlers and
food contract workers, charging them in multiple indictments of
drug and weapons trafficking. By Rick Bragg.

<P>
   GAY-LAWMAKER (Phoenix) _ By his own account, Stephen May knew
from the time he was a young teenager that he wanted to be a
politician, more specifically, a conservative Republican
politician. And everything seemed to be going just right after he
was elected last November, at the tender age of 26, to the Arizona
state legislature. Then earlier this year, May angrily spoke his
mind, this time not as a Republican, a Mormon, or a soldier _ but
as an openly gay man. His denunciation of an anti-gay bill and its
right-wing sponsor triggered one of the more unusual investigations
under President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy towards
gays in the military, and it now appears likely that May will be
discharged from the Army Reserve. By James Sterngold.

   TURNER-SIGN (Atlanta) _ All over Atlanta, urban designers and
architects are horrified by the prospect that downtown's new focus
of attention might become a giant six-story greeting card for Ted
Turner's new sports arena, festooned with corporate logos,
electronic geegaws, and a 25-foot clock that has already been
dubbed ``Big Ted'' after the city's best-known corporate
provocateur. By David Firestone.

<P>
   TEN-USOPEN-SCENE (New York) _ When they say U.S.  &UR; Open, &LR;  this
must be what they mean. Front-row seats are there for the taking,
close enough to lean over the court fence, reach out and put a hand
on the shoulder of the guy yelling ``Fault'' (probably not the best
idea). Stretch out, put your feet up on the bleachers, lay back and
catch a ray, there's plenty of room. Welcome to the U.S. Open
qualifying rounds _ known to insiders as ``qualis'' _ where 256 men
and women compete for 32 slots in the most important tennis
tournament in America, which starts for real on Monday. It is one
of New York's best-kept secrets _ and it costs nothing more than
the cost of a subway token. By Jodi Wilgoren.

   &UR; WASHINGTON  &LR; (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   TROOP-WITHDRAWAL (Washington) _ Under pressure from the Pentagon
and Republicans in Congress to reduce military commitments
overseas, the Clinton administration plans to withdraw the last 400
American troops stationed in Haiti, even though peace there remains
tenuous at best. The Pentagon is also pushing for other troop
reductions, including a sharp cut in Americans in Bosnia and a
pullout from the U.N. mission in the Sinai. By Steven Lee Myers.

<P>
   GORE-CHANGE-2000 (Undated) _ Tucked into Vice President Al
Gore's stump speech these days is the germ of an idea that his
aides say will grow into a full-blown campaign theme in the months
ahead _ that Gore will be the steward of change, and stability, as
the world hurtles into the next millennium. The theme is a bit
murky at this point because Gore is trying to convey two somewhat
conflicting messages. One is that his administration would be a
change from the Clinton administration and the nation's weariness
with the Clinton scandals. The other is that Gore would carry on
the successes of the Clinton years into a world that is rapidly
changing. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

<P>
   KOSOCO-COUNCIL (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ As more and more Serbs
leave Kosovo, the U.N. Special Representative in Kosovo, Bernard
Kouchner, has come under strong pressure from local Serb leaders to
consider the effective partition of the war-torn province. Kouchner
ruled out the idea at a tumultuous meeting with local Albanian and
Serb leaders on Wednesday. Yet in the face of the continuing
security problems for minorities in Kosovo, he has had to concede
the possibility of moving Serbs into ghettos for their own
protection. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   ERITREA-WOMEN-SOLDIERS (On the Badme Plain, Eritrea) _ Eritirea
is one of the few nations in the world where women fight
side-by-side with men, and in the 15-month war against Ethiopia,
they have killed and been killed like any other soldiers. There is
no novelty to it. In fact, some of them have powerful role models
in making war: Their own mothers, who fought in the 30-year war for
independence from Ethiopia. ``My mother said, `I am really proud of
you,''' said Yordanos Tekeste, a 21-year-old artillery-woman whose
mother and father were both soldiers in the war for independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Pat Pound started putting together information for a
history of disabled people in Texas, she wanted to get beyond
people like Erastus (Deaf) Smith and Thomas William (Peg-Leg) Ward.
</P>
<P>
   After all, just about anyone in Texas who completed seventh
grade would know of the men. Smith, a scout vaunted as the
``bravest of the brave'' during the Texas Revolution, lost his
hearing as a result of a childhood disease. Ward, who lost a leg to
a cannonball during the same revolution, went on to serve as mayor
of Austin and commissioner of the General Land Office.
</P>
<P>
   For several years Ms. Pound, director of the governor's
Committee on People with Disabilities, as well as others, gathered
details for the history. About two years ago, she hired a
researcher to help. But all the work seemed like duplicated effort.
</P>
<P>
   Then another committee worker stumbled across the online version
of the ``New Handbook of Texas,'' an encyclopedia of the state's
history, geography and culture. The discovery opened a whole new
world.
</P>
<P>
   The worker, Curtis Edmonds, soon found that he was able to
search efficiently in the handbook using terms that apply to
disabilities. He started coming up with material that likely would
not have been uncovered in the printed version of the handbook,
which has 24,000 entries in six volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the greatest blessing for us was when the
handbook went online,'' Ms. Pound said. ``The information had been
there, we just didn't have staff to read six volumes of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Although state and city encyclopedias, in printed form, have
gained in popularity since the publication of Kenneth T. Jackson's
``The Encyclopedia of New York City'' in 1995, only a few of the
publications are online in complete form. The historians who have
helped put those works on the Web have found that the online form
offers advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an endless Web,'' said John Grabowski, managing editor of
the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, which has been online since
1996 (http://ech.cwru.edu). ``It's a very plastic tool in terms of
our ability to enhance it and change it. You can almost shape it
anyway you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas State Historical Association was revising the
print version of the state handbook, ``we had in mind that we
wanted the text to be in electronic form so it could be updated and
corrected much easier,'' said Douglas Barnett, assistant director
of the association, which put the handbook online
(www.tsha.utexas.edu) with the help of the University of Texas at
Austin libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the corrections and updates come from other historians,
but some come from ordinary citizens. In Texas, the historical
association is receiving 30 to 40 e-mail messages a day from
readers who send corrections or who just want to share their own
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the handbook's compilers asked a California woman
to write about her recollections of life in Christoval, Texas,
where she moved when she was 8, after she e-mailed her thanks for
an article about the town in the handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Her observations are little more than snippets from a child's
life in a small Texas town in 1966; her impression of her house and
swimming and fishing in a nearby creek. But developers of the
handbook site see an opportunity to provide texture to the basic
encyclopedia and would like in the future to link such elements to
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Online versions also offer the luxury of space. When the
Cleveland work was first published in book form in 1987 (along with
a companion volume, ``The Dictionary of Cleveland Biography''), 300
articles had to be cut for lack of space. But with unlimited space
available for the online version, the articles were included, and
new ones added, including an article about the city's carriage
industry of the 19th century. Photographs that did not make the
print version were put online as well.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities of online encyclopedias are creating interest
in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Historical Society is currently working on an
encyclopedia with the Newberry Library, which they hope to publish
in 2001 or 2002. Simultaneously, they are working with Northwestern
University on technologies to create an electronic version of the
work, which they hope to bring out six months to a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have in mind an electronic encyclopedia more spectacular
than the print version,'' said Douglas Greenberg, president of the
society.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on vast collections of photographs, videos and audio,
researchers are working to create a ``guided tour through Chicago
streets at the turn of the century,'' Greenberg said. ``There will
be music from the history of jazz and blues, all sorts of things
from the collections in the Chicago Historical Society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest hurdles to such projects is finding money to
pay for them. Historical groups in both Texas and Cleveland have
been assisted by universities, which has helped to keep costs down.
Still, Barnett estimated that the two-year effort to get the Texas
site running cost about $100,000. Despite the costs, Greenberg said
``I think printed encyclopedias are dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting information online makes research quick and easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the finding is almost instantaneous and it's the using we
can give our energy to. That's the power of technology,'' he said.
``Certainly it's changed my job as head of an institution and it's
changed the way I do my work as a historian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes it out of the realm of that esoteric ivory tower,''
said Grabowski, an assistant professor of history at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland. ``It's like the History Channel,''
he said. ``A lot of people said that would never fly.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Pound, the online encyclopedia offered another advantage
over the printed version. She is blind, and the book is not
published in Braille. But the online handbook is accessible through
her screen-reader software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost flipped out,'' she said recalling a Saturday she sat
down to see if she could make it work. ``Five hours later my son
said, `What's so fun?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pound and her co-workers found all sorts of interesting
people through the handbook, particularly some from the 1800s that
were not in other sources. Blind Lemon Smith Jefferson is a good
example. A musician credited with being one of the creators of
blues, he was born blind in Coutchman, Texas, in July 1897.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond finding more people, the handbook also helped them to
draw some conclusions and give a sense of where Texans with
disabilities fit into history. For example, by searching the
handbook they were able to establish that at least eight counties
are named for people with disabilities, including Deaf Smith, Ms.
Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in April,
released its book _ ``From Isolation to Participation . . . A
History of Disability in Texas'' _ as part of the celebration. The
book was put online at www.governor.state.tx.us/disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pound said as the committee's history of disability was
getting ready to go to the printer she called Barnett at the Texas
historical association to thank him for putting the encyclopedia
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I'm a real life example of the kind of things that
can be done because you have the handbook on line.''

A NURTURING WEB SITE FOR WOMEN WHO DRUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jane Pirone has seen rock 'n' roll's future, and it's
www.drummergirl.com.
</P>
<P>
   And it's her future. Ms. Pirone, a resilient New York media
designer, has challenged one of the most sexist hearts _ percussion
_ of a notoriously male subculture _ rock bands _ and emerged
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   To say that this site, subtitled For Women Who Drum, raises
consciousness is like saying that Lucy Lawless demonstrates
attitude. But Drummergirl does it without bombast or self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   The site is filled with chat rooms, help-wanted and band-wanted
ads, equipment and technique tips and a host of interviews with
female drummers. The mood is enthusiastic: We understand, it's not
weird if you really like to do this, we think drumming's fun, too.
You can find a lot of friends and helpers here, and it's no big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   On one page, readers list drum stores that have taken them
seriously and treated them nicely. Another page has reviews of drum
instructional videotapes, as well as drum licks sent in by
contributors. There is a Listening Lounge and, of course, a T-shirt
order form.
</P>
<P>
   On the message boards, you can see threads of comment on ``the
shame of the teeny-bop girl bands,'' viewed as low in talent and
high in female dependence.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-grader named Linzie writes: ``Guys make fun of me for
being a drummer. They say that it is weird for me to be with all
guys. What can I do to make them stop?'' Her letter gets 15
replies.
</P>
<P>
   One, by Chia, says: ``I'm 30 and when I was in eighth grade the
same thing happened to me. I stayed with it and channeled my hurt
and anger into a positive form: practice.'' In high school, she
says, she was the highest sophomore on the drum line. ``All the
creeps that made fun of me didn't even make band. I'm still playing
and love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Profiles in Drummergirl describe situations any aspiring female
musician can learn from. Here's an excerpt from an interview with
Denise Fraser, who has played with Sandra Bernhard for more than 10
years:
</P>
<P>
   ``The one negative experience is when I was the drummer of a
band and knew the music and knew all the drum parts and some
producer came in and immediately took me off the drums and brought
in some guy. He didn't even want to hear me, didn't want to give me
a chance, and basically just looked at me and said, `No woman can
play the drums.' And I said, `You obviously never heard of Sheila
E.' And he said: `I don't care. No woman can play the drums.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive,'' she adds, ``is just the fact that I'm still
playing and that I love it so much. And I know that I have touched
people with my playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Drummergirl was founded in 1995 by Ms. Pirone, 30, who lives in
Darien, Conn., and who runs Happy Mazza Media, a software design
company in Manhattan. She named the company after her grandfather,
Dominic ``Happy'' Mazza, a confectioner who ran the Happy Mazza
Syrup Company in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper for a Rutgers University symposium last month on
women and technology, she wrote that Drummergirl.com was an
antidote to such frustrations as condescending sales people and
mainstream drum publications' denial of the contributions, in fact
the existence, of female musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a music trade poll indicating that more than two million
American women play the drums, she wrote: ``I knew, even without a
Gallup poll, that there were, in fact, many female drummers out
there. The problem wasn't whether we existed, just that nobody was
acknowledging our existence. This is what I wanted to change!''
</P>
<P>
   Her musical heroines include Maureen ``Moe'' Tucker, drummer for
the Velvet Underground. ``We had a really nice e-mail dialogue,''
Ms. Pirone said. ``We talked about both being procrastinators.''
</P>
<P>
   Another role model is Georgia Hubley of Yo La Tengo. ``And then
of course there are the icons like Karen Carpenter,'' she said,
adding: ``Rosie O'Donnell is a drummer, Tipper Gore is a drummer
and Jenny Jones is a drummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Money for the site is currently a problem, although you would
not know it from Drummergirl's enthusiasm. Ms. Pirone is trying to
get nonprofit designation and a sponsorship for the site. She says
that she is working on the fall issue and that she is determined to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do my best to keep it going even if the company can't
keep it going,'' she said, adding, ``I don't think it's too hard to
find people to help out.''

</P>
<P>
   THEATER-MUSICALS (New York) _ A handful of recording executives
seem determined to preserve the sound of American musical theater _
even in its lean years, and without necessarily making a sizable
profit. In musical terms, they want the song to continue, and they
want the public to hear it. By Barry Singer.
</P>

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-THEATER (London) _ Whatever else one thinks of that mix
of humidity, pelting rain, heat, chill and solar eclipse that has
been styling itself the English summer this year, one must admit it
has coincided with plenty of startling and disturbing theatrical
images. Here is an 80-year-old Jewish widow, her pliant, humorous
face icing over as she remembers the murder of her child during the
Holocaust. Here is the ultra-outrageous comedian Lenny Bruce,
babbling and dementedly muttering into his mike as drugs and
paranoia seep through his brain and onto his tongue. And here are
two Cleopatras, one of them played by a male actor, both wigless
and almost hairless as they prepare for death. By Benedict
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THARP-BROWN-DANCE (Undated) _ Two wonderful surprises danced
their way across stages this summer. The choreographers of both
took what seemed like foolhardy risks. Yet, instead of plummeting
into catastrophe, both Twyla Tharp and Trisha Brown managed to soar
creatively. Ms. Brown, in fact, even levitated a dancer. Ms. Tharp
wrestled with Beethoven, and she and Beethoven both emerged with
honor. By Jack Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-CUBA (Undated) _ One of the best bands to emerge in Cuba
in the 1960s was a doo-wop group called Los Zafiros (the
Sapphires). Leoncio (Kike) Morua, Miguel (Miguelito) Cancio,
Ignacio Elejalde and Eduardo Elio (El Chino) Hernandez were
handsome, nattily dressed young singers from Cayo Hueso, a barrio
of Havana. Among its admirers were the Beatles, who stuck around
for another week in Paris in 1965 to hear the group at the Olympia
theater. Because of U.S.-Cuban hostilities, however, this splendid
confection of American and Latin pop _ call it nuevo doo-wop _ was
seldom heard outside of places like Poland and East Germany.
``Bossa Cubana,'' a compilation of the band's best work from the
1960s, provides a glimpse of an island obscured by political
sermonizing on both sides of the divide. By Adam Shatz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-COMPOSER-RODRIGO (Undated) _ Although centenary
celebrations are common in music, the subject is seldom alive to
participate. The Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo came closer than
most to celebrating his 100th birthday, when he died last month.
Rodrigo triumphed against remarkable odds. Afflicted with
diphtheria at 3, he lost his sight and nearly his life. He suffered
great penury abroad during the Spanish Civil War. Yet he went on to
produce a large body of music for a great variety of media,
garnering more prizes and honors than any other Spanish composer in
history _ even the title Marquis of the Gardens of Aranjuez _ and
achieving a worldwide popularity that far transcends the field of
classical music. By Pablo Zinger.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-MOZART (Undated) _ A few pinholes in an old musical score
_ and a Canadian musicologist's passion for the chaotic world of
18th-century opera _ have led to the discovery of what appears to
be a long lost recitative by Mozart. Dorothea Link, a specialist in
the operas of Mozart and his contemporaries, came across the
setting for strings and voice, 35 bars long, in the Austrian
National Library in Vienna a few months ago. The recitative
precedes the well-known aria ``Vado, ma dove?'' (K. 583), which
Mozart wrote for the singer Luisa Villeneuve. Although the
recitative is not in Mozart's hand, all the evidence points to his
authorship. By Tamara Bernstein.
</P>

   &UR; ART/ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BILBAO-GUGGENHEIM-SCULPTURE (Bilbao) _ The most impressive
exhibition of contemporary sculpture in a decade, or maybe more, is
the show of Richard Serra's ``Torqued Ellipses'' here at the
Guggenheim. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-SERRA-GEHRY (Undated) _ Perhaps the sculptor
Richard Serra should not have been surprised when he recently spied
a woman who, thinking she was alone, danced through one of his
``Torqued Ellipses'' at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. His
rounded, listing, walk-in steel sculptures and the long arched
gallery of the architect Frank Gehry glide and curve together in a
pas de deux of balletic grace. Clearly she was inspired. The dance
between Serra's sculpture and Gehry's architecture is not simply
serendipitous. By Joseph Giovannini.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE-BRASSERIE (New York) _ Last June, American
architecture took a giant step into the present with the
announcement that Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, two
architects who practice together in New York, had been awarded a
fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation. This is the first time
that the coveted award has been presented to architects. By Herbert
Muschamp.

BERKELEY TEAM HAS NIGERIAN CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ There's already talk of a poster _ football
players in blue and gold posing under a banner reading: ``The
Nigerian Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably won't happen until these proud young men have
played in a game or two.
</P>
<P>
   This year's football team at the University of California at
Berkeley includes five new players _ four freshmen and one
sophomore transfer _ with deep roots in Nigeria. They join junior
starting cornerback Chidi Iwuoma in giving the Bears six
Nigerian-American players. Just two were born in Africa but all
were raised by Nigerian-born parents in a culture that values
education, family, religion and unity. Five are members of
Nigeria's Ibo ethnic group and one belongs to the Tiv ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The team runs from drill to drill at practice. Iwuoma will trot
over and say ``stay strong'' when he spots one of the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always told me that when you see another Ibo you
take care of them,'' Iwuoma said.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in speech, appearance or dress that sets the
Ibos or the lone Tiv, freshman running back Joe Igber of Honolulu,
apart from their teammates. They are typical young Americans,
distinguished by their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our family is, you always have to work really hard at
what you do,'' said freshman running back Joseph Echema of
Hawthorne, in Southern California. ``I try to live up to that
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen, to a man, were recruited by major football
programs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman defensive tackle Daniel Nwangwu of Sugar Land, Texas,
chose UC-Berkeley over Colorado, Kansas, Baylor and Northwestern.
The decision delighted his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my dad being Nigerian, education is a very important
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Echema, his parents only wanted him to attend one of two
schools _ UC-Berkeley or Stanford University in Palo Alto _ because
of the academics.
</P>
<P>
   When freshman safety Nnamdi Asomugha of Harbor City, in Southern
California, began getting letters from football coaches, his mother
got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom values education so much that she sorted through the
mail,'' he said. She made two piles, schools with excellent
academic credentials and a second with all the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd throw in the football part,'' Asomugha said. ``She didn't
even look at football.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Asomugha has been through this before. An older brother,
Chijioke Asomugha, is a second-year cornerback at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Asomugha was considered a top prospect, a
blue-chipper, and his recruiting was followed across the country. A
sports Web site persuaded him to announce his decision over the
Internet, where he accepted UC-Berkeley's offer and turned down
Colorado, Michigan, Notre Dame and the University of Southern
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his mother's early involvement, Asomugha made the
decision alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She set the standard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nwangwu made the decision alone, with some strong guidelines
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me to know the reasons why I did what I did,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Bill Dutton remembers going to Texas to
recruit Nwangwu. He said the family met in the sitting area of his
hotel room, with the father sitting across from Dutton and four
children seated to his right in descending order of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask the recruit a question and he would look over at
his dad for acknowledgement. Only then would he speak,'' Dutton
said. ``I'm his dad now and he gives me that same total respect.
He's a beautiful kid to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said he wasn't concerned that Nwangwu might be too ``nice
and polite'' for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will he dig down and gut-bucket?'' Dutton said. ``Oh yeah,
darn right he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Igber and Echema were born in Nigeria. The others and the sixth
team member with Nigerian roots, senior starting defensive end
Mawuko Tugbenyoh, were born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Holmoe said the Nigerian connection occurred
``coincidentally'' and was not planned.
</P>
<P>
   However, he acknowledged that he was delighted with the strong
values the new players brought to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these guys there is a standard that is set,'' he said.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHO NEEDS ORIGINALITY WHEN YOU HAVE SYNERGY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an author submits his most famous character to plastic
surgery, the reasons aren't likely to be literary. So the most
egregious thing in Thomas Harris' ``Hannibal'' _ and this is a book
with a major hanging-disemboweling sequence, not to mention one in
which a character is made to swallow a killer eel until ``blood
blew out'' of his ``nose hole and he was drowning'' _ is the face
lift of Hannibal Lecter.
</P>
<P>
   When Hannibal makes his entrance, disguised as an art expert in
Italy, he is said to look dimly like himself but also different,
thanks to the surgeon's knife. In her dreams Clarice Starling
envisions ``Dr. Lecter's old face,'' which he demolished at the end
of the last installment, as opposed to his new one. Translation:
Maybe Anthony Hopkins will want to do the movie, but let's keep our
options open if he says no.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tipoff to the hidden attitude at work in Harris'
amazingly nasty beach book and in so many other pop cultural
successes of the moment. It either can't or won't stand alone. And
it counts on other media, secondhand star quality, spinoffs or
tie-ins to help make its connection with popular tastes. That sets
it off from the more genuine, unencumbered work that needs no such
calling cards. Nobody could accuse the beguiling music documentary
``Buena Vista Social Club'' of cashing in because its elderly Cuban
stars have a hit record.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulated impact of this much stealth marketing, and of
the cultural cross-pollination that synergy entails, is to foster
an atmosphere of deep mistrust. All too rare is the pleasure of
reading, hearing or watching something that doesn't seem to have an
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Hannibal's nips and tucks are a tipoff to the kind of thinking
that makes Harris' latest Lecter thriller the kind of novel that
generates its own waves of queasiness, so different from the
others. Although he wrote ``The Silence of the Lambs'' with such
sharp, arresting detail that it felt like a film before it became
one, the ensuing popularity of the novel and Jonathan Demme's
expert film adaptation changed the game.
</P>
<P>
   Harris began thinking cinematically, to the point of devising
loony but visually striking scenes (like the quasi-fantasy sequence
that ends the book, setting it up for another sequel) and offering
descriptions that sound like stage directions. (``Click of a switch
and a low lamp comes on. Now we can see Dr. Lecter seated at a
16th-century refectory table in the Capponi Library.'') Once a
cinematic novelist, Harris now writes like a director without a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Blame demon synergy for poisoning the waters in this way. It
means that the free-standing pop-cultural enterprise is
increasingly difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are wallpapered with hit music, as if audiences could not
be trusted to like the film in its own right. ``Saturday Night
Fever'' is about to join ``Footloose'' as a Broadway show hitched
to the coattails of a nostalgic film hit. Talk magazine, with its
Miramax pedigree, has run several articles (about a Virginia
trailer park and a safari massacre) that won't seem fully realized
unless cameras roll. And the major cultural event of the summer has
been the way ``The Blair Witch Project,'' with synergistic
brilliance, has revolutionized movie marketing. The film itself is
modest, with an astonishing tail to wag the dog.
</P>
<P>
   With going to the movies becoming an increasingly synergistic
experience, it's easy to lose sight of the main event, since there
can be so much happening on the sidelines. The sales pitch at a
movie theater used to start at the front door, with posters meant
to build anticipation for next week's feature. Now, evidently, that
space is too valuable to be wasted on mere film imagery.
</P>
<P>
   So more and more poster frames carry outright advertising, and
more ads greet you when the lights go down. And they aren't simply
ads for soda pop and car dealers anymore. They're ads for
competitive enterprises that actually diminish your willingness to
leave your house.
</P>
<P>
   So movie theaters now carry spots for made-for-cable films (and
these often look more enticing than the feature film trailers that
surround them). There are ads for Web sites that have nothing much
to do with either film or television drama. At a recent showing of
``American Pie'' there was even an ad for a Web site allowing the
user to call up six-minute mini-dramas at random. That's the
equivalent of fast-food storytelling for those who find ``American
Pie'' too dramatically complex.
</P>
<P>
   The sensation evoked by anything like the recent ``Detroit Rock
City,'' an extended promotional tool for the ancient band Kiss, is
meant to be one of teen-age hedonism, but instead it prompts fury.
Why pay for the privilege of being inundated by hype and clobbered
by a Kiss-heavy soundtrack?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you can now buy T-shirts that simply say
``Millennium 2000,'' establishing you as a meaningless billboard
for an unfathomable event that hasn't occurred yet. We're much too
used to serving as walking billboards and, when it comes to
pop-cultural synergy, sitting ducks.
</P>
<P>
   It can be immensely gratifying when a film or book becomes a hit
the old-fashioned way, simply because people like it and tell their
friends. ``The Sixth Sense,'' about a boy with a special occult
power, is a corker of a ghost story with an ending that only a
sadist would spoil. And it arrived without benefit of synergistic
connection. Unless you count the presence of Bruce Willis, only the
marketing phrase ``I see dead people'' sold this idea. And yet
``The Sixth Sense'' is the biggest hit in the nation, for the
simple reason that it floors audiences, and they enjoy that
sensation. No whiff of product placement, sequel possibilities or
other synergistic possibility has a chance to spoil that.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer we were steamrollered by
$100-million-grossing nonentities like ``Wild, Wild West,'' ``Big
Daddy'' and ``The General's Daughter,'' from a novel by Nelson
DeMille. (DeMille has said that when he wrote the book, he
envisioned this story's hero as Willis, but then decided it worked
equally well for John Travolta. It's a new twist to find novelists
casting movie stars when they once created characters from the
ground up.) Each of these films drew audiences for reasons that
didn't have much to do with what was on screen.
</P>
<P>
   And when the sight of Adam Sandler urinating against a wall in
``Big Daddy'' qualifies as a winning sales pitch, perhaps Hollywood
is right to suppose that merely hooking audiences _ with a star, a
best seller or a Pavlovian stimulus, like Will Smith in anything on
the Fourth of July _ is enough to keep business booming.
</P>
<P>
   But now, post-``Blair Witch,'' that won't even be enough. The
``Blair Witch'' lesson is that synergy counts for even more than
previously suspected, as it transformed a great no-budget horror
idea into an impossible dream: the movie as near-afterthought in
the midst of brilliantly enterprising scuttlebutt. On its own
merits this shrewdly rough-edged movie just isn't the absolute
must-see experience that has been so widely celebrated. It isn't
even as spooky as ``The Sixth Sense,'' as a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the first film that has functioned so strikingly as
the gateway to a post-cinematic world: an interactive realm of
manufactured mythology, Internet chat and and tie-in materials that
will gladly envelop anybody who takes the bait. It's a staggering
synergistic coup: What ``Blair Witch'' is selling is a network of
associations and a feeling of connection, and the filmmakers have
achieved this so spectacularly that they leave us on the brink of a
new kind of film experience. It's only the inevitable copycats who
are liable to raise a hackle or two.
</P>
<P>
   Having harnessed the ubiquitous power of synergy, these
filmmakers still risk overplaying their extraordinary hand. How far
can their new process go? When will the bogus story of the three
lost filmmakers wear thin? We know only this much: The fictitious
witch has not been seen. If she ever starts looking like an A-list
movie star, there'll be trouble brewing.

DECADES HAVEN'T DULLED WIT OF SATIRIST STAN FREBERG
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by FREBERG-BEST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The record was called ``A Child's Garden of Freberg,'' a
collection of '50s song parodies and comic sketches. It had been in
the family since before I was born, played by three older siblings
until every track was scratched. At some point, the wear became so
bad that two songs on one side were unplayable. But every time we
played it, we laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The record remained with us until the early '80s, when it died
an unfortunate death after a young broadcasting student _ not
saying who _ left it in his truck on a Texas summer day, and it
warped into an expressionistic ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing it wasn't easy _ till this week, when Rhino Records
released ``Tip of the Freberg: The Stan Freberg Collection
1951-1998,'' a four-disc retrospective of one of the most
influential satirists of the second half of the century. But the
Freberg box is more than just a child's garden; it's a
plantation-size overview of Freberg's early parodies, radio shows,
musical-comedy productions and audio commercials. It also features
a video collection of many of Freberg's TV advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   You might not recognize Freberg's name, but you've probably
heard his voice and certainly encountered his legacy. Matt
Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons,'' has cited him as an
influence that can be heard in the show's voice work as well as in
its consistently hilarious songs.
</P>
<P>
   The Barenaked Ladies concert last Sunday at Dallas' Starplex,
with the band taking shots at a variety of pop acts, bore echoes of
Freberg's work. The ``Dudley Do-Right'' movie coming out this week
evolved from cartoons associated with Freberg. And commercial
campaigns such as the ``Got Milk'' series can trace their roots to
Freberg's earliest advertising work.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to vintage Freberg is to hear innocence, especially in
a comic world now laced with foul language and teen-agers getting
physically involved with apple pies. But in the '50s and '60s,
Freberg was considered subversive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very tough to get stuff through censors, lawyers,
vice presidents for network standards and practices,'' said
Freberg, 73, in a phone interview. ``It was never, never for doing
anything off-color. It was because of jokes that they considered
libelous.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't surprising, considering the zingers that Freberg
aimed at advertisers, other musicians (one reason Freberg's satires
worked is that he's an accomplished musician himself) and,
occasionally, the government. Freberg often worked with these
entities as well, but he has long been known for biting every hand
that feeds him, or, as he puts it, biting every hand that ``needs''
him.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Proctor of Firesign Theatre, a comedy troupe whose early
work was heavily influenced by Freberg, sees this side of Freberg
as being part of a long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most daring comedy writers usually behave in that
manner,'' Proctor said. ``In the evolution of society, the court
jester was given room and board and other rewards for making the
king laugh. Of course, that meant biting the hand that fed him, and
if you bite the hand that feeds you too often, you risk losing your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Freberg risked losing only sponsors, but that wasn't a problem
at the beginning of his career, when he released a series of 45s
lampooning TV shows and pop music. A favorite target was the
popular TV show ``Dragnet,'' which was the subject of three
parodies, including the hit ``St. George and the Dragonet,'' in
which the storied saint is a Jack Webb figure assigned to the case
of a maiden-devouring dragon. These bits featured voice actors such
as Daws Butler and June Foray, who would go on to provide voices
for Jay Ward cartoons such as ``Rocky &AMP; Bullwinkle'' and ``Dudley
Do-Right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Freberg really shined on the pop satires, which play well
even if you haven't heard the original songs. A fan of big band and
jazz, he was driven to near-apoplexy by gimmicky songs and
inarticulate singers, and this showed in his work. Unlike ``Weird
Al'' Yankovic, Freberg's songs weren't merely affectionate
parodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When rock 'n' roll came along, Freberg thought it was a
passing phase,'' said Barry Hanson, better-known as novelty-show
host Dr. Demento. ``He was not primarily a parodist. He was more
likely to take an existing work and make fun of it as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, this involved two-character skits in which
rebellious musicians or baffled producers bickered with the lead
singer (often, Freberg played both parts). Freberg's take on ``The
Great Pretender'' featured a beatnik pianist slipping into bebop
because he was bored with the ``plink-plink-plink jazz'' of the
song's one-chord piano part; in his ``Rock Island Line,'' an
impatient producer continually interrupts the song's overlong
spoken introduction, asking the singer if he's ever going to get on
with it.

UNDATED: on with it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The song parodies were a springboard for Freberg's other work,
which became increasingly political. Among the Rhino box's excerpts
from his 1957 radio show is a bit in which a censor consistently
interjects his opinions while Freberg attempts to sing ``Old Man
River,'' which becomes the more politically correct _ for the times
_ ``Elderly Man River.'' In another sketch, Freberg honors the
Father of the Year: Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The H-bomb would figure prominently in the first full flowering
of the surreal side of Freberg's humor, a one-act radio satire
called ``Incident at Los Voraces,'' in which warring Vegas casinos
(the El Sodom and the Rancho Gomorrah) try to one-up each other's
shows until the only thing left is for one of them to detonate the
bomb onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ```Incident at Los Voraces' shook the CBS building to its very
foundations,'' Freberg said. ``The brass didn't want to have
anything to do with the hydrogen bomb. They were acting like, `Gee,
if we don't mention it, it may go away.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rabble-rousing, Freberg's voice work caught the
attention of the advertising world. He loathed advertising and
commercialism; this was, after all, a guy who had done a piece
called ``Green Chri$tma$'' that was so blatantly anti-commercial
that Capitol Records almost refused to release it.
</P>
<P>
   Freberg still doesn't trust advertising, and this mistrust led
him to lampoon the industry's cynicism in his own ads, which were
likely to feature a sponsor character arguing with a writer who had
a shocking quality: integrity. Although the ads were amusing, they
often made fun of outrageous claims, thus pushing Freberg's beliefs
about truth in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the commercials are included on the Rhino box, as well
as a generous portion of Freberg's magnum opus, ``Stan Freberg
Presents The United States of America.'' Freberg, who found
high-school history to be boring, was inspired to write this
four-volume work-in-progress (only the first two volumes have been
completed) to prove that history can be interesting, if placed in a
humorous context. The box set includes such songs as the tokenism
satire ``Take an Indian to Lunch,'' sung by an important Pilgrim,
as well as songs about the Declaration of Independence, Betsy Ross
and Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``United States'' caused Freberg problems, and again,
they came from outside influences. After release of the first
volume in 1961, Broadway producer David Merrick wanted to turn the
piece into a Broadway musical. But his interference on the project
upset Freberg so much that the satirist quit. The last straw was
when Merrick demanded that Abraham Lincoln be removed from the
Civil War section. Freberg wouldn't return to the project till the
'90s, releasing the second volume in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Freberg hasn't exactly been quiet, but he did
slip behind the scenes, doing radio spots that were both anti-war
(a 1971 series of ads supporting a bill for early withdrawal from
Vietnam) and pro-Army; and filming TV commercials such as a famous
ad for Great American Soups, in which Texan Ann Miller answers her
husband's ``What's for dinner?'' query with a Busby Berkeley-esque
production number.
</P>
<P>
   Freberg's commercials continued into the '90s, with a series of
Encyclopaedia Britannica spots featuring his then-teen son Donavan
bantering with an off-screen narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been at this nearly 50 years, Freberg hasn't
stopped taking digs at pop culture. He says he has mellowed some on
rock music, but not on advertising. He continues to do radio work
and has even recorded a new song (included on the box) called ``The
Conspiraski Theory.'' It's an innocuous piece supposing that
because Monica Lewinsky, Tara Lipinski and Ted Kaczynski were all
in the news at once, a conspiracy must've been at hand. And yet,
when Freberg filmed the video (directed by son Donavan) in front of
a government building in Washington, D.C., ``men in black'' carted
him off (in a scene that was caught in the video). After nearly a
half-century, he's still sticking in the authorities' craw.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best Stan Freberg bits:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``John &AMP; Marsha'': A radio soap-opera parody that's nothing
but three minutes of two people saying ``John'' and ``Marsha,''
it's a testament to the power of audio, telling a story without
even using verbs. It's also hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Great Pretender'': Of the many '50s Freberg pieces that
lampooned pop-music trends, this may be the best. Freberg plays the
lead singer and the pianist who constantly interrupts him because
he can't believe he got stuck with a one-chord part.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Heartbreak Hotel'': Freberg amps the echo to absurd
proportions and rips his jeans in a letter-perfect takeoff on the
Elvis Presley hit.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Incident at Los Voraces'': A surreal 21-minute sketch about
warring casinos looking for the ultimate in entertainment and
finding it in the hydrogen bomb. This drove CBS censors bonkers and
laid the groundwork for such other audio comedy acts as ``Firesign
Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Stretching the Imagination'': To demonstrate the power of
radio, Freberg concocted this bit in which a giant mountain of
whipped cream is moved onto Lake Michigan, and airplanes drop a
10-ton maraschino cherry on it to the cheers of a thousands of
extras. Freberg did this all without multitracking, using seven
overlapping tape machines. According to the liner notes of ``Tip of
the Freberg,'' this commercial was an influence on Stephen King and
David Mamet.

SAVING CHILDREN FROM HYPER-CONSUMERISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Aug. 2)  
(mk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is my confession: My children have far too many toys.
Almost all of their friends do, too.
</P>
<P>
   And I know, even without the John Rosemond types telling me,
that it hasn't made them happy.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, in fact, they do a fair impersonation of whiny,
bored, what-have-you-bought-for-me-lately brats.
</P>
<P>
   I justify this in all sorts of ways. I buy many of their toys at
garage sales; they don't lack for love and family time; we eat
dinner together most evenings; they play outside a lot.
</P>
<P>
   But a troublesome feeling nags at me as I survey the overstocked
basement or navigate their possession-cluttered rooms. Where does
it end? With them buying into the myth of consumerism: He who dies
with the most toys, wins.
</P>
<P>
   Kids have gained this consumer mentality not only from evil
television commercials, but from their parents, like me.
</P>
<P>
   I like stuff myself, being a product of the 1960s ``nostalgia
through collectibles'' generation. I collect vintage lunch boxes,
old cameras, World's Fair plates...just about anything I take a
fancy to. Also, I'm big on impulse items from discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for a New American Dream is here to help.
</P>
<P>
   A new, nonprofit organization based in Maryland, the Center's
mission is to ``help people consume responsibly for our families
and the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The center states, with some pretty statistics to back it up,
that we are raising a cohort of hyper-consumers who have been
targeted from birth by ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of companies is to gain brand loyalty from ``cradle to
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies are even targeting the zero to 3 demographic, after
discovering that children can recognize and retain logos, mascots
and jingles before they can read or talk in complete sentences.
</P>
<P>
   By 3, children are requesting certain brands _ the ``nag''
factor. Kids direct about $188 billion of their parents' purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some steps the center (www.newdream.org) recommends to
concerned families who want ``More fun, less stuff:''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay attention to the flow of money and possessions in your own
life.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teach your children the value of money and the cost of
consumerism. Help them to understand that every product is made
from materials extracted from the earth and that material things
don't just disappear when the garbage is picked up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be a role model. Avoid impulse buying and recreational
shopping. Have a budget and a savings plan. Pick charities together
to donate to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage more time in nature, camping, hiking, pressing
wildflowers, singing, building things, sewing, listening to the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   _ Swap books, toys, games and sports equipment with friends,
teaching them the beauty of bartering.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to set limits and say no. If the item is really
something a child wants, though, talk about why it means so much to
him or her and whether it is really something worth having, before
saying yes or no. You may be able to diffuse the child's fixation
on the latest toy craze.
</P>
<P>
   I've had some success with the strategies of ``one in, one out''
(giving away one toy or item of clothing for every new item added),
taking children to the store with the advance knowledge that they
weren't going to get anything for themselves that trip, and
containing any ``impulse'' shopping to thrift, consignment or yard
sales with ``recycled'' products.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping to adopt the philosophy of a friend who recently
admired a mug at an art show, then put it down even though it was
well within his price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned,'' he said, ``that you don't have to own
everything to appreciate it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the second week of August, Las Vegas roasted slowly in
triple-digit heat. Miles from the main strip, in the half-light of
Jackie Gaughan's Plaza hotel, septuagenarians fed the slots. Time
was suspended; only the quarters seemed to slip away. Upstairs, for
a few hundred Gen-Xers, time stood still as well. But they had
better things to do than gamble.
</P>
<P>
   They had Pong. They had Space Invaders. They had tables and
tables of Atari 2600 cartridges, archivally preserved copies of
Electronic Games Magazine and a rare Vectrex tabletop arcade with
an extremely difficult-to-find dust cover and carrying case, not to
mention the CD re-release of Buckner &AMP; Garcia's 1981 novelty album,
``Pac Man Fever'' (www.bucknergarcia.com).
</P>
<P>
   For those registered at the Classic Games Expo, it was a chance
to pore over the video game consoles of yore, to fortify their
collections of Colecovision cartridges and to hear former Atari
employees tell stories from the old days, when they were young and
mustachioed and hacking away at Frogger, Pitfall and Tron Deadly
Discs. Classic games for classic machines, not like today's
fancy-pants consoles, with their fast processors and 3-D graphics
and surround sound, which will never ever  &UR; ever  &LR; be as good.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cross between a comic-book convention and a class
reunion. Industry veterans caught up with their erstwhile
co-workers, while their fans, a generation younger, ogled relics of
Reagan-era childhood with a proprietary sense of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really claim ownership over it, this stuff, in a lot of
ways, said George Jones, editor in chief of Computer Gaming World.
``It's a very hard-core, very niche-y community. When you really
get down to it, a lot of those games aren't as fun anymore so you
get a circle-the-wagon mentality. You're defending a way of life,
rather than an actual product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the games. It's about the subcommunity you fit
into. I felt very much like an outsider there, and I was viewed
very much as an outsider. I felt a little bit awkward wandering
around.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few through-the-looking-glass moments at the
conference when the classic game programmers seemed to be on the
outside looking in, fascinated and not a little intimidated by the
fervor their games had wrought. ``It's weird,'' said Rob Fulop, who
programmed Missile Command for Atari and later founded P.F. Magic,
the company that invented computer pets. ``It feels like a Star
Trek convention, and I'm Uhura.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the collectors' knowledge of vintage video games
far outstripped the memory of the games' inventors. ``Back then, we
didn't give a lot of thought to the historical significance of what
we were doing,'' said Keith Robinson, a former manager of
Intellivision (www.intellivisionlives.com) who has re-released the
company's old games on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we released Astrosmash, some of the games were released
through Intellivision and some were released through a company
called INTV, so we had to print up different boxes. Then later, we
had to do a smaller run, like maybe 5,000 copies, not enough to go
back to the printer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we needed some labels. So we went to the local print shop
and they had some blank labels left over from another job. So we
just used those, printed them up and slapped them on, just to get
them out the door. But these guys have  &UR; catalogued  &LR; this stuff:
Here's Astrosmash with the Intellivision label. Here's Astrosmash
with the INTV label. Here's Astrosmash with the rare  &UR; smaller
 &LR; label.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it seems peculiar that people attach so much
significance to the material artifacts surrounding these games.
After all, the games themselves were (and still are) strings of
ones and zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike baseball cards or comic books, the plastic casing of a
video game cartridge isn't content. It's just a shell around the
content, a husk for the code.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that game code has been re-released for today's
platforms. Dozens of golden-oldie video game compilations are on
the market. You can download coin-op games from the Internet and
play them on an arcade emulator, if you don't mind turning a blind
eye to copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it matters to people that they own the original
plastic, or that they can view the original cardboard box that held
the plastic. Because even though the old bits can bring back
memories, only the atoms can give you a tangible link to your past.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a digital era, but we are analog creatures. We want
things to hold _ even the horrible Intellivision controllers that
never worked. Perhaps if they weren't so horrible, they wouldn't be
so valuable.

`FLOWERS IN THE DUSTBIN': FROM LONG LIVE ROCK TO ROCK IS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most rock hits, ``Flowers in the Dustbin'' has a refrain:
``for better or worse.'' It's a phrase that keeps popping up as
James Miller sifts through the history of rock, focusing on pivotal
moments from the music's first three decades and finding
ambivalence at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   While rock ushered in new kinds of freedom, it also abetted
violence and self-destruction. Where rock helped break down racial
barriers, it also fed lingering stereotypes. As rock reshaped
taste, it also made way for incompetence and vulgarity. As rock
grew smarter and more self-conscious, it also became more mannered
and artificial. And for all rock's promises of rebellion and
idealism, its core has stayed commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the paradoxes that give rock its energy and
unpredictability, as well as its essential ability to annoy. But
they can also breed disillusionment in anyone who observes rock too
closely _ even, and perhaps especially, in someone for whom the
music was once revelatory.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's new book is an observant, meticulously researched
survey of rock's first decades that turns crankier as it approaches
the present. He declares that rock's glory days ended nearly 25
years ago. ``Its essential possibilities have been thoroughly
explored, its limits more or less clearly established,'' he
asserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers in the Dustbin'' is the latest traversal of rock
history by Miller, who has been writing about popular music since
1967; through the 1980s, he was the pop critic at Newsweek. He
edited the first ``Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and
Roll,'' a collection of critical essays on individual musicians.
His new book does not pretend to be comprehensive; it aspires to
the concision of a collection of three-minute singles.
</P>
<P>
   The book treats rock as a mosaic of recording sessions,
performances, movies, radio shows, television appearances,
technological innovations and business deals.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with Wynonie Harris' recording ``Good Rockin'
Tonight'' in 1947 and concludes with the short, farcical career of
the Sex Pistols and the death and posthumous apotheosis of Elvis
Presley. As its preface warns, it also virtually ignores broad
swaths of rock. Among them are girl groups, garage bands,
singer-songwriters, heavy metal, funk and country-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Each vignette becomes a parable. Little Richard's ``Tutti
Frutti'' lets a racial and sexual outsider clown his way to
mainstream popularity; David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust is a triumph
of hype. Many of the anecdotes _ Bob Dylan plugging in, Jimi
Hendrix burning his guitar at the Monterey Pop Festival _ are
already thrice-told tales, though Miller briskly separates facts
from legends.
</P>
<P>
   He writes with loving precision about the details of the music,
rediscovering, for instance, the startling immediacy of Frankie
Lymon, who ``used his wavering vibrato to deliver his lyrics with
an uncertain pitch and yaw that promised romantic shipwreck.''
</P>
<P>
   He also makes clear his distaste for performers like the
Grateful Dead and Bruce Springsteen. Although he understands how
rock upended the Tin Pan Alley aesthetics of older pop _
simplifying rhythm and lyrics, embracing noise and technology,
converting ugliness into stimulus _ he has little use for music he
calls ``simple'' or ``crude.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of musicians garner unmixed praise, notably Bob
Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, Bob Marley and the group that is
Miller's measure of what rock can be: the Beatles. He devotes five
chapters to the Beatles, following them from the Cavern Club to
``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.''
</P>
<P>
   After 1967, Miller shows rock heading downhill fast. Nihilism
and mere obnoxiousness start to replace rock's sense of
possibility. The music's private meaning is hijacked by hype, and
rampant commercialism destroys the last semblance of innocence.
``Nobody, young or old, could any longer experience the core
feelings _ of wonder and surprise _ that rock and roll had really
excited, once upon a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the book offers some glimpses of the world outside
rock, it can be curiously rockocentric; it rarely suggests that the
music might be affected by political and economic events.
</P>
<P>
   In his chapter about Altamont, he calls the corpses left at the
concert, and in 1968's worldwide student demonstrations, ``portents
of a potentially murderous descent into psychic as well as social
chaos that became, through the music and myth of the Rolling
Stones, an even more ominous feature of the cultural form.''
Powerful as the Stones myth may have been, other forces were also
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Miller writes eloquently about how rock elicits nostalgia, as
hit songs attach themselves to youthful memories. So it's odd that
he fails to see the mechanism working in himself. Miller is in his
50s, and ``Flowers in the Dustbin'' is a baby boomer's view of
rock. It peaks around the time he turns 20, then settles into
workaday routine, then sours; the loss of innocence is in the
listener along with the music.
</P>
<P>
   Miller may be unwilling to admit that he's now on the elder side
of a generation gap, out of touch with the codes of newer rock.
``The music I once found fraught with strange, even subversive
meanings now often seems to mean nothing at all,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when the Top 10 is divided among vacuous pop, the
violent and materialistic boasts of gangsta rap and the surly
machismo of rap-metal bands, dismissing rock's future might be
tempting. But rock's meanings and possibilities haven't
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   From pop superstars' large-scale image manipulation to hip-hop's
reshuffled texture and narrative, from the no-turning-back
prominence of women in rock to electronica's dismantling of the
star system to Internet music transmission, rock still has the
potential to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
   Rock has always been a collision of inspiration and commerce,
technology and dreams. In the early chapters of ``Flowers in the
Dustbin,'' Miller shows that everything from electronic gimmicks to
the threat of youth violence was part of rock from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed. But as ``Flowers in the Dustbin'' marshals
facts to back up its cynicism, it misses the sheer pleasure that
rock can deliver, and the way that pleasure can still transform a
receptive fan.

   WASHINGTON _ Dobie Gillis, eat your heart out.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV series from 1959 through 1963, Dwayne Hickman
portrayed Dobie as a cheerful young man who would appreciate a
little more respect, but got enough guidance from caring adults to
emerge triumphant from the academic and social pressures of high
school life.
</P>
<P>
   That's just how most American high school students feel today,
according to a national poll released Wednesday. It was conducted
in June for Shell Oil Co. by Peter D. Hart Research Associates,
using questions written with the help of the U.S. Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results should help destroy movie stereotypes of
today's high school as ``full of perky blonde cheerleaders, dumb
jocks, quirky nerds and teachers who haven't a clue,'' said
Education Secretary Richard Riley, who spoke at length about the
results to the Commonwealth Club in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may dress differently, look different, and listen to
music that is simply beyond us, but they are not a lost generation
or a negative generation,'' said Riley, 66.
</P>
<P>
   While a poll last year showed that most adults believe today's
teens are ``rude, irresponsible and wild,'' Riley said the poll of
teens shows that most are ``ambitious, striving and open to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how often they have various feelings, nine out of every 10
students said that ``most'' or ``some'' of the time they feel happy
(93 percent), cared about (91) and confident (86). They were more
likely to be bored (57) than to feel angry (37), depressed (24) or
lonely (23).
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to life after high school, 76 percent agreed
that ``I am pretty confident that things will work out for me,''
while only 21 percent said, ``I'm not sure how well things will
work out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they cope with pressures ``to get good grades'' (44),
``to get into college (32) and ``to fit in socially'' (29). Far
fewer said they had to deal with pressure ``to use drugs or
alcohol'' (19) or ``to be sexually active'' (13).
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom they turn to for support and guidance, a vast
majority said they rely ``a lot'' or ``a fair amount'' on their
parents (78) or friends (75). Fewer turn to a teacher (41), member
of the clergy (37) or school guidance counselor (31).
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 said they had a teacher they feel close to, and
nearly half said they have had a teacher who has changed their
life.
</P>
<P>
   They look forward most days to going to school, where 68 percent
say the best thing is seeing their friends, while only 21 percent
say the best thing is going to classes. Two common gripes: About
four in every 10 said their school is overcrowded, and nearly half
said theirs has too few small classes with personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   While 81 percent of white teens gave their school an ``A'' or a
``B'' on being a ``safe place, without violence,'' that was true of
only 69 percent of the Latinos and 58 percent of African-Americans
polled.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance, two-thirds of all students would award their
school a grade of ``A'' (17) or ``B'' (49) on how well it works.
Even the grumpy one-third had many gentle graders, with 26 percent
giving their school a ``C,'' only 6 percent awarding a ``D,'' and 2
percent saying ``Fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the high satisfaction? At one extreme, 90 percent gave their
school high marks on ``teaching basic academic subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, 81 percent plan to continue their education
immediately after graduating from high school. In reality, only
two-thirds are likely to do that.
</P>
<P>
   To which, most students say, ``So what?'' Asked to choose
between two attitudes toward setting goals for their themselves,
only 19 percent chose ``It's better to play it safe and not set
your sights too high so that you're not disappointed in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 79 percent instead chose, ``It's better to aim high
and have big ambitions so that you challenge yourself and achieve
new things.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,015 high school students was conducted between
June 8 and June 29, and had a sampling error of 3 percentage points
for the entire sample, and higher for sub-groups or for questions
asked of only half the sample.

PLAN AHEAD FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE TOASTING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EILEEN CLEGG   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa. Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Y2K panic buyers may have one more thing to
add to their millennium shopping list _ high-end champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkling wine producers say they are hoping to meet the
anticipated New Year's Eve demand for vintage bubbly, but there's a
limited amount to go around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of another time when there was such a demand
for one product around the world .... Everybody's got to toast,''
said Eva Bertran, executive vice president of Gloria Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the traditional method of making fine
champagne requires the wine to spend years in the bottle before
sediment is removed and the cork popped in. So there's no way at
this point to increase the amount of good champagne that will be
ready for cork-popping on New Year's Eve 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should have put more down, but we were limited by
grapes and by our production facilities,'' said Gary Heck,
president of Korbel Champagne Cellars. The bottlers are now
removing sediment and putting corks into wine put up 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Due to some millennium forethought, Korbel is operating at
capacity, two shifts a day, to produce a record amount of champagne
this year _ 1.45 million cases, compared to 1.2 million last year.
Still, Heck said he anticipates greater demand than supply.
</P>
<P>
   Heck just returned from an international wine symposium in
Florida where he learned that European champagne makers have
reached the limit for their 1999 U.S. sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the imported champagne has been stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco wine distributor Carol Hastings of Chambers and
Chambers said wise retailers among her customers put in orders for
specific wines early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great vintage stuff is getting gobbled up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she placed extra champagne orders over and above her
customers' requests for this year, but now believes she
underestimated demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had projected a 40 percent increase (in champagne demand)
for the millennium, but I think we are doing more like a 70 percent
increase,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, she said she was forced to say ``sorry'' to
those who wanted to add to their orders. Her three French champagne
suppliers are saying they cannot guarantee any more shipments than
those already promised.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Ferrer is in the same position, operating on what's known
in the trade as ``allocation'' _ supplying only those who already
have put in their orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have so much wine. Our Carneros Cuvee ages for seven
years and we only have what we bottled seven years ago,'' said
Bertran. ``When it's gone, it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   J Winery also is operating on allocations, and being sure to
save some for the tasting room, said spokesman Robin Oden.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne probably won't disappear from the shelves at the end
of the year, but wine makers say that selection will be more and
more limited as the months go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to have a big party, whatever champagne I
wanted I'd set aside by the first of November,'' Heck said.

   Wednesday, tropical storm Dennis slowly strengthened, producing
winds up to 65 mph as it stood nearly stationary 300 miles
southeast of the Bahamas. Thursday, Dennis is expected to become a
hurricane, bringing the threat of windswept heavy rain to the
Bahamas in the afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Bands of heavy showers and a few thunderstorms will circulate
through the Middle Atlantic States as humid air intercepts a
sluggish low pressure system. Heavy rain may cause local flooding
in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and southern New York. This
precipitation will reach southern New England by afternoon. Farther
north, partial sunshine will cover Maine as a wedge of dry air
persists over northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure and its attendant currents of subsiding air will
promote abundant sun across the Mississippi Valley and western
Great Lakes while searing heat continues to affect the western
Plains and Texas. Spotty afternoon thunderstorms may erupt in
Oklahoma and Arkansas as a weak jet stream disturbance crosses the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture from former Tropical Storm Bret will bring scattered
showers and thunderstorms to southern New Mexico on Thursday.
Spotty thundershowers will also form near some of the higher peaks
of the southern and central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny and hot conditions will cover the Pacific states Thursday,
with afternoon readings near 100 degrees in much of interior
California. As is often the case, onshore breezes will temper the
heat near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SPUTTERING DENNIS
</P>
<P>
   Though a hurricane is an intense low pressure system, it needs
high pressure at high altitudes in order to reach this status. The
past few days, Tropical Storm Dennis sputtered southeast of the
Bahamas because it lacked a high pressure system aloft. Such a
lofty high allows air that has risen to great altitudes around the
core of the storm to spread evenly outward from the center. Thus,
air cannot weightily accumulate aloft and prevent barometric
pressure from lowering. Thursday, Dennis will likely intensify into
a hurricane as high pressure becomes established above the storm. &QL;

 &HT;    GROUP SAYS PRIVATE LANDS THREATEN CHARACTER OF NATIONAL PARKS
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Park Trust called Wednesday for ``less
fast talking, more fast action'' on efforts to secure privately
owned land inside national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger that this land could be sold for development,
bulldozing, clear-cutting or for other destructive purposes
constitutes the single greatest threat to the nation's cherished
system of national parks,'' said Paul Pritchard, president of the
trust, a group committed to acquiring such properties, known as
inholdings, for parks.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard said the number of ``imminently threatened areas''
inside parks exceeds 220,000 nationwide. The National Park Service
has identified 20 ``high priority purchases,'' which include parks
in Arizona, California, Washington and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard said the group's acquisition efforts are greatly
undercut by a lack of support from Congress, inadequate funding and
time-consuming regulations. The trust called on Congress to make
the rules for the National Park Service ``less cumbersome'' and
provide more funds for land acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost impossible for the Park Service to acquire land
once private citizens get it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service requested $230 million in 1998 for
national park land acquisitions, but Congress allocated only $23
million. In addition, the long-term future of the Land, Water and
Conservation Fund, established in the late 1960s as a land
acquisitions trust, is not secure.
</P>
<P>
   On the state level, park agencies rarely have the authority to
stop private property from being developed or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard encouraged the public, legislators and governors to
take a greater interest in the fight to purchase properties at risk
of becoming the ``playgrounds of a select few.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight ``begins with private citizens. We can't just wait for
Washington,'' Pritchard said.

REVEALING THOSE YOUTHFUL INDISCRETIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, Aug. 27)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans (two, counting his wife) are angry at the press
for badgering George W. Bush about whether he used cocaine in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, only made matters worse by refusing to discuss
the issue while continuing to wear a small, silver spoon on a chain
around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just kidding with that last part, but the fact remains that
the press has set itself up for criticism by making a big deal out
of activities that politicians like to think of as ``youthful
indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   How would the press like it if it were subjected to the same
kind of scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of fairness, and more importantly to fill up the
remainder of this space, I am prepared to divulge the most
embarrassing of my youthful indiscretions, up to and including
those that happened just last week.
</P>
<P>
   I understand (and fervently hope) that these admissions may doom
my chances of being elected president or, for that matter, winning
a seat on the local Mosquito Control Board. I may not have the
power to raise your taxes or send your son or daughter off to war,
but I do have access to a word processor, and you, as a reader,
have the right to know who is pushing the buttons.
</P>
<P>
   My first admission is that, during the years 1957 to
approximately 1961, I participated, more than once, in a game
called ``Cowboys and Indians.'' The purpose of this ``game'' was to
repeatedly kill one another with cap pistols or pop guns.
(Disadvantaged children who lacked either a cap pistol or a pop gun
were allowed to point their finger and go BANG! BANG! as long as
they remembered to pause and reload after firing six shots. This,
by the way, was the original definition of the word ``handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the indiscriminate slaughter were not hurtful enough,
``Cowboys and Indians'' was also fraught with racial and ethnic
stereotyping, a horrifying breach of political correctness that I
did not comprehend at the time, possibly due to the fact that I was
only 5. I am ashamed to admit that, for me, the only thing better
than killing an Indian was being one, as I got to flap my hand over
my mouth and go WOOWOOWOO! just before rushing in to scalp the dead
cowboys with my rubber tomahawk.
</P>
<P>
   I felt so guilty about having played ``Cowboys and Indians''
that, at the age of 17, I committed Youthful Indiscretion Number 2:
I started smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. I've tried nicotine and, in a moment of weakness, I
even experimented with tar. I took it any way I could get it:
Filtered, unfiltered, mentholated, soft pack, hard pack, you name
it. I smoked on the school bus, in the bathroom, in restaurants, in
my bedroom _ basically whenever and wherever I chose. I gave no
thought to the poisons I was spewing into the atmosphere or to the
effect of the secondhand smoke I was inflicting on innocent
bystanders. The fact of the matter is _ and it causes me great pain
to admit it _ I was hooked. Years later, when I realized the cost
of smoking ($2 a pack), I quit. Then, of course, I started again.
Then I quit again. Then I started again, then ...well, you get the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   So how long has it been since I last used nicotine?
</P>
<P>
   I will only say, like George W. Bush, that a White House
background check will (probably) reveal nothing and, while I'm on
the subject, I'd also like to say that I've been faithful to my
wife for the past 20 years, even though we've only been married for
15.
</P>
<P>
   And, besides, I may have tried cigarettes once or twice, but I
never inhaled.

   Personal tragedies inevitably rearrange the way we think about
our world. One aspect of life I began to re-examine after an
unexpected personal sorrow a year ago was the phenomenon of the
``virtual community.'' In recent years, the importance and value of
online communities, often populated by people who have never met in
person but who share a common interest, has captured the public
imagination. Stories abound of online communities helping people
regain a sense of belonging to something, somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the circumstances of dealing with tragedy changed the way I
think about how people come together in cyberspace and in
geographical communities.
</P>
<P>
   One day last August, I called my father, Everett Hafner, for our
usual weekend phone chat. We talked about his life, my life, his
work, my work, our family. I told him a joke, and we both laughed.
He had bread in the oven he needed to tend to. We said goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   The next night my sister called. She sounded out of breath, but
she was in fact having trouble forming the words to tell me that
the small plane my father had been flying that afternoon had
crashed. He and his passenger, Neil Hammer, a photographer who had
gone with him to take aerial photographs, had died.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, I flew across the country to Williamsburg,
Mass., a town of 2,500 people in the Berkshire foothills. By the
time I arrived, a shrine of sorts had been erected in front of the
library, on a board normally reserved for announcements of
readings. It read: ``We Love You Everett and Neil.'' I hadn't met
Hammer, but I soon learned that he was a gifted photographer who
lived with his wife, Tamara, a few houses up the street from my
father. His photographs were in the bank, the library, people's
living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Williamsburg residents started putting flowers from their
gardens next to the sign. In the next few days, the buckets and
vases multiplied. People not only left them there but returned to
straighten them up and freshen the water. Everywhere I went, I felt
not just my own shock and grief but the shock and grief of an
entire town.
</P>
<P>
   The week I spent in Williamsburg just after the crash was a
blur. But what did stay in sharp focus were the faces and voices of
the people who came to the door or stopped me on the street to tell
me they had known my father. They knew his comings and goings, his
eccentricities. They had been to his house for dinner and heard his
stories, his endless repertory of jokes, his theories. They had
known when he had visitors and when he was out of town. They knew
that he had been growing tomatoes and that he had worried that the
tomatoes wouldn't ripen before the first frost. They had argued
with him at town meetings and read the letters he sent to the local
paper.
</P>
<P>
   I had been to Williamsburg, a beautiful and unspoiled slice of
historic New England, many times since my father moved there nearly
20 years ago to escape the busier pace of Amherst and Northampton,
which are close. But I had felt little interest in knowing the town
itself or the people who lived there.
</P>
<P>
   I had grown up in Amherst, and as a teen-ager, like many of my
friends, I couldn't wait to get away from the area. Now, at this
time in my life, in this circumstance, I didn't want to leave. What
I once would have found to be suffocating was suddenly a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Being near the people who knew my father kept me warm. Even if
they hadn't known him well, they had seen him in his everyday life.
In some ways, they knew him better than I did. When I did leave,
although I stayed in touch with many of these same people by e-mail
and telephone from Northern California, I felt too far away and
wanted to return.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in the plane crash weren't the only ones to shock
Williamsburg last summer. An elderly woman was killed in a car
accident, and her husband was badly hurt. The 3-year-old child of a
woman who worked in the bank drowned. ``It just seemed so
relentless,'' said Lisa Wenner, the director of the Williamsburg
library. ``It seemed like nothing good was going to happen, only
bad things.'' Professional grief counselors went to the town and
held sessions at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the hole these deaths left in the heart of Williamsburg
made me question the degree to which I, and many others, have
accepted the idea that virtual communities approximate the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous online community is the Well, a
conference system in Sausalito, Calif. Now owned by Salon magazine,
it was set up 14 years ago as a social experiment. The intense
connectedness fostered by the Well is extraordinary by any
standards and prompted me to write a history of its development for
Wired magazine in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Well has been admired and studied as a model for online
communities, which have sprung up in many places in the past two
years or so, catering to every possible special interest. An online
community can take the form of a mailing list on, say, the topic of
rare coins, or it can be a Web site with chat rooms for real-time
discussions of the New York Knicks. Geocities and iVillage have
distinguished themselves as online communities.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``community'' has itself been elevated _ some might say
corrupted _ in the world of online business. Executives at America
Online, with its base of millions of users, and at countless other
online venues have all tried to divine the magic of community. In a
business sense, the word community is now synonymous with keeping
people tied to a Web site. The longer people stick around, the more
likely they are to click on advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the course of writing about the Well, I saw people there
grieve for their fellow members when they died and marshal support
in an emergency. I saw intense commitment to the community. I
watched online flirtations turn into real-life marriages. I saw
emotions flare and barbs fly.
</P>
<P>
   But my experience in Williamsburg was of a different order, and
it convinced me that the real and virtual communities are
fundamentally different.
</P>
<P>
   While virtual communities are by definition intentional _ you
almost always join for a reason _ there is a lovely haphazard
quality to the way the people in a place like Williamsburg came to
live there. Even in a general Net community like the Well, members
have a variety of other places to choose from, without the need to
move physically or find jobs. People in a town live there for many
reasons. Some may be attracted to the setting or social atmosphere.
But others have jobs or family in the area, or they live there by
virtue of birth or marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of how it is that people really come
to know one another. Because virtual communities are based on words
alone, they have a lot to do with how people think about one
another intellectually. In places like Williamsburg, there is a
kind of nonverbal knowing that evolves from seeing and interacting
with someone over time _ at the post office, the library, the
grocery store, the dump or the restaurant where locals often eat.
``There's something about actually seeing people and experiencing
whatever it is they're carrying with them that gives you a sense of
how they're feeling that day,'' Ms. Wenner said.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone in a town has a fund of incidental knowledge about
their neighbors. In a virtual community, people know only what you
tell them. But people in Williamsburg, as in many small towns, know
one another's business. They know whose children have perfect
teeth. They know who bought a new car. They know who is sick. When
romances become entangled, they are discussed one on one, not in
groups. And when bad things happen, the whole town feels it.
``You're more vulnerable,'' said John Merritt, a Williamsburg
native. When my father died, people helped in ways that no one
could have online.
</P>
<P>
   The town has been cleaved by controversy, like a protracted and
bitter debate over proposed zoning changes. Anger can fester, but
for the most part, people move on once an issue has been decided.
``I can disagree terribly with someone on one issue, and then work
with them as a team on something else,'' said Heidi Johnson
LeBaron, a paper hanger who has lived in Williamsburg for 12 years.
It's a lot easier to leave a virtual community.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people in Williamsburg remain resolutely off the
Net, others say they now have the best of both worlds. They use the
Net for e-mail and research and for staying connected in their
various fields. Ms. Wenner, for instance, subscribes to a mailing
list for librarians in western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But having the real thing eliminates much of the need for a
virtual equivalent. ``Virtual communities are risk free because you
can always back out anonymously,'' said Fred Goodhue, a social
studies teacher who is the chairman of the board of selectmen.
</P>
<P>
   People in Williamsburg told me that my father had grown more
involved in town politics in his last years. I found evidence of
that while seated at his computer one day after the accident,
trying to figure out what he had been working on. I stumbled across
a lengthy, painstakingly written document that was his own attempt
to draft a new zoning bylaw for the town.
</P>
<P>
   I can't ask him, but I'm guessing that for some reason, my
father had been thinking about what I was now pondering. For on his
desk next to the computer was a piece of his familiar green
stationery, and on it, in his small, unmistakable handwriting, was
a quotation from the city planner and social critic Lewis Mumford:
``Democracy, in any active sense, begins and ends in communities
small enough for their numbers to meet face to face.''

THE POP LIFE: THE THREE FACES OF RUBEN BLADES; HUTCHENCE ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gabriel Garcia Marquez once said that the
Panamanian musician Ruben Blades was the most popular unknown he
had ever met. What he meant was probably not that Blades was an
obscure figure, but that all the work that Blades had done was not
necessarily synthesized in his image or reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It often seems as if there are three very busy and separate
incarnations of Blades: the politician who started his own party
and ran for president in Panama in 1994 (he placed a respectable
third), the actor who appears regularly in Hollywood films, and the
musician who constantly challenges his audience with his artistic
twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   Though Blades (pronounced blades) is responsible for one of
Latin music's most popular albums, ``Siembra,'' recorded with
Willie Colon in 1978, his legacy of imbuing infectious salsa with
social and political commentary has not exactly been handed down to
the Latin performers whose more carnally minded songs are crossing
over in America today. Yet Blades, who has roles in forthcoming
movies by Tim Robbins and Billy Bob Thornton, tries not to
disparage them. ``I don't knock it,'' he said of popular
contemporary Latin music. ``These approaches have brought into the
fold of Latin music a generation that had been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of capitalizing on the trend himself, Blades, in a
manner that has become his trademark, looks in the exact opposite
direction on his new album, ``Tiempos'' (Sony Tropical), his first
recording in three years. While the music crossing over in America
tries to fill Top 40 pop with a molten Latin core, Blades
collaborates with the Costa Rican group Editus on pan-Latin music
with a core that has been hollowed out and filled with European
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour that takes Blades to Manhattan in early October (as
well as to television with an hourlong broadcast of the show
``Sessions at West 54th'' on PBS on Oct. 2), he said he planned to
expand his work with Editus, looking further beyond Latin music's
African roots with a follow-up album exploring the Celtic, Arabic
and Hindu influences on the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to Hindu music, you're going to find the
patterns there,'' Blades said. ``It's a very romantic music, and a
lot of Hindu songs have a clave buried under them. The Celts were
also in that area: they were all over the place. The thing is, this
hasn't really been explored. The way the industry is being run,
what you're listening to is pretty much formula on the Latin side.
And I'm not interested in that so I have to create my own direction
to keep myself in the business. Otherwise I'll just quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album, Blades writes in the liner notes, was not so much
written as it was born like a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing it I was at one point going through my
divorce, which was very difficult emotionally, especially because
there was real love and affection involved,'' Blades said. ``And
then, politically, in Panama the internal fighting led to the loss
of the image that we had, which was very difficult to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   It also proved difficult to glue together all that he had
recorded into a strong musical arc.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted is a record with an evocative world-embracing
sweep often reminiscent of film music. Blades said he was trying to
create songs that would tap into an ancestral memory he believed
people had but didn't always recognize. Lyrically, the record
captures the same grandiosity and inevitability: It begins with a
song of birth, reflecting on the lack of choice we have over the
conditions and environment into which we are born, and ends with a
song of death, reflecting on the powerlessness we have about when
we go and what we can take with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take what you know at the end,'' Blades said. ``You don't
take your BMW and they don't bury you in your house. If your
knowledge is one that makes you feel sorry that you wasted your
life, then that's hell. You want to be sure that in those three
seconds of lucidity before you go that you can crack a smile and
say, `I did the best I could.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is Blades sure he could say that? ``Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah,''
he replied, repeating the words more quietly and convincingly each
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchence Album
</P>
<P>
   The first solo album by Michael Hutchence of INXS is being
completed this week, nearly two years after his death. The album,
simply titled ``Michael Hutchence,'' is to be released on Oct. 23
on V2 Records. Joe Strummer of the Clash sings on the album and
Bono of U2 contributed vocals to a song that may also be included.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchence was found hanged by a leather belt in a hotel room in
Sydney, Australia, in November 1997. A coroner ruled that the cause
was suicide, though his girlfriend, Paula Yates, is contesting the
ruling, saying that he died of auto-erotic asphyxiation. At his
death, Hutchence had spent more than two years working piecemeal on
a solo record. Six tracks were finished and another six were close
to completion, said Danny Saber, a producer of the solo album.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the more libidinous upbeat pop of INXS, this
album is much darker and more introspective, with an undercurrent
of contemporary electronic dance music replacing the shiny funk
overlay of INXS. At times, Hutchence's voice seems to speak from
the moment of death, with the chorus of ``just keep breathing'' or
``I just want to slide away and come alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   The record's release was delayed, Saber said, so that it would
not seem exploitative of the singer's death and so the missing
elements of the album could be inserted in a way that would be
consistent with his original vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record was essentially done before he died,'' Saber said,
brandishing a final mix of the record in his hands. ``People will
hear it and know it's for real.''

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Memories of the movie house
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Tony Garrett
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas _ I went recently to the new 30-plex that has
opened here in Mesquite, a Dallas suburb where I live. I think my
mind is now clear enough to tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty movies playing at one time. Entertainment is fine, but
can you say overkill?
</P>
<P>
   I stood in front of the box office trying to determine which bit
of two-hour mindlessness I would waste my money on. After deciding,
it was on to the snack bar. But they're not called snack bars
anymore. It's a deli bar.
</P>
<P>
   Did I want the $5 nachos? It certainly looked tempting, two-bits
worth of chips drowned with artificial orange cheese sauce.
</P>
<P>
   How about a $3 hot dog? Or pizza? You had your choice of five
different kinds of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   I went for something safe: the horsebucket-size popcorn ($3.95)
and a Coke with too much ice and not enough syrup ($2.95).
</P>
<P>
   After finally making my way through a vast array of marketing
and finding my theater, I tried the popcorn. Something was wrong.
No salt. I made my way back to the deli bar and asked for the salt
shaker.
</P>
<P>
   It took the fellow at the counter awhile to find it. ``Most
people don't ask for it,'' he said. ``You know, healthy eating and
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving home after the movie, I couldn't help thinking about the
little theater we used to go to in Greenville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was called The Texan, located downtown on the main drag just
up from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   There were no big decisions about what you would see: One
screen, one choice.
</P>
<P>
   Not so many choices, either, at the snack bar. Popcorn came in
two sizes, large and small, as did soft drinks. Then there was the
candy selection: Goobers, Raisinettes, malted milk balls. Giant
pickles were a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie, while on your way out past the box office, the
manager would always say, ``See you next week'' or ``Y'all come
back now, you hear?'' That isn't done at the 30-plex in Mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   The little downtown movie houses have all but gone the way of
the drive-ins.
</P>
<P>
   A huge multi-screen theater in a nearby big city opens. People
think how handy they are, right next to a mall. Do the shopping and
walk next door to see a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the little hometown theater sits empty on Friday and
Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the projector makes that funny clicking noise. The
snack bar doesn't offer pizza. The seats don't recline. Who wants
to go there anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling through the eastern part of the state last month, I
decided to stop in a small town and see a movie at the tiny theater
where I had been a dozen times before.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be. A hand-lettered sign out front announced the sad
news: ``Now Closed. Thanks For Your Years Of Patronage.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like The Texan and hundreds of others. Maybe they'll turn
it into a coffee bar. Then everybody will show up.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of Americana has passed on. So bang the drum
slowly. And pass the salt.
</P>

BACON'S PAINTINGS DELVE INTO THE DARK SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Think of British artist Francis Bacon as the
anti-Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Auguste Renoir painted the sunny side of life and, for
that, he is beloved. Bacon, on the other hand, was a nihilist who
hardly understood happiness. And, for that, he is an artistic
unknown, compared with the warm, fuzzy Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth is staging a major
exhibition of Bacon's work, inviting us to give it due
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing through Oct. 15, ``Francis Bacon: A Retrospective
Exhibition'' represents almost 60 years of productivity on the part
of a man whose life vies with his art in terms of morbid
fascination. And this exhibit makes a solid case for viewing his
work as both painfully personal and perhaps more universal than
many of us would care to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon was born in Dublin in 1909, into genteel circumstances.
But his parents seemed incapable of caring for the boy. Sickly and
reared indifferently, Bacon received almost no formal academic
education, or, for that matter, training in art.
</P>
<P>
   To boot, Bacon was forced to leave home after his parents
discovered he was homosexual. Still, his mother gave him a small
allowance that permitted Bacon to travel a bit. After he saw
Picasso's work in a 1927 Paris exhibition, he took up painting.
</P>
<P>
   And, from that time until his death, from a heart attack linked
to asthma, in Madrid in 1992, Bacon never stopped making art. He
may have lived a debauched life _ he drank excessively, slept
little and had an insatiable taste for the low life _ but Bacon
conducted his career with strict discipline. He refined his
technical skills, constantly expanded his peculiar sources of
inspiration and put in long hours in his studio.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, Bacon's artwork caused a sensation. Some
critics dismissed his horrific imagery as being too akin to Picasso
_ or as a failed attempt at surrealism. But others saw his
paintings of outraged and outrageous creatures (often rendered with
explicit religious overtones) as honest and unique expressions of
the despair that held sway in England and Europe in the wake of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Bacon attracted steady patrons and began
selling paintings, to private collectors and museums. Over the
decades, his significance steadily has been supported by the art
establishment. Very few British artists are considered of much
importance to modern art: Bacon likely tops that list.
</P>
<P>
   Just since 1990, there have been four important, international
retrospectives of Bacon's art, as well as a focused presentation of
his ``screaming popes'' series in San Diego this year. The Modern
is the fourth stop for a show that also has toured to New Haven,
Conn., Minneapolis and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of institutional recognition, though, will be resisted
by everyday people more inclined to dismiss Bacon as a painter of
depressing and perverted pictures. After all, his work has nothing
in common with the way they view life or want to view art. Even
cynics or viewers accustomed to extremes of movie violence might
find Bacon's pictures too despairing, might wish the guy had known
how to lighten up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming popes, gay men suffering acute discomfort, dismembered
female bodies? We don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   But go anyway and, if necessary, keep this in mind: You can
respect Bacon's vision without agreeing with it or feeling that
your own beliefs have been violated. Because, regardless of what
you go away thinking, the work merits consideration.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Bacon pulls together, then transcends,
innumerable art and literary references, historical and
contemporary. He recaps many and anticipates perhaps even more _
serving as a sort of one-stop cultural shopping place, which is no
small thing in today's culturally degraded world.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   For example, in his paintings of the naked human body, there are
hints of Michelangelo's drawings and Eadweard Muybridge's studies
of animal motion, Hans Bellmer's grotesque dolls and Kiki Smith's
explorations of physical humility.
</P>
<P>
   In his paintings of screaming businessmen and popes, we see
Velasquez's Pope Innocent X and Andy Warhol's figure in an electric
chair, as well as the mortally wounded nurse from Sergei
Eisenstein's ``Battleship Potemkin.''
</P>
<P>
   We also, without realizing it, are exposed to nonartistic visual
references, including Bacon's cherished book on diseases of the
human mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a homage to van Gogh and an arrangement of figures
recalling Matthias Grunewald's ``Isenheim Altarpiece.'' There are
hints of scenes from Samuel Beckett, Aeschylus and Shakespeare.
There is a glimpse of Max Beckmann's voyeur in a bowler hat,
perhaps even Chaim Soutine's lurid paintings of animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if you want a more immediate reference, consider Bacon's
use of photographs as ``models,'' rather than working from live
models. He didn't pioneer the practice, but he brought it to a new
level of importance.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Bacon's independence, which contradicts just about
every major ``ism'' of the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon started painting about the same time as Jackson Pollock,
making small, figurative paintings when Pollock was making
mural-sized abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   When pop art came in, with its cynical celebration of
superficial consumer culture, Bacon continued to draw on the
profound legacy of dead white men.
</P>
<P>
   While other major artists were abandoning paint and canvas in
the 1970s, Bacon stuck to those basics.
</P>
<P>
   When Julian Schnabel, Georg Baselitz and other neoexpressionists
hit it big in the early '80s, Bacon maintained that his art wasn't
expressionist; it was realist.
</P>
<P>
   When artists started cooling down in the late '80s, they put
every other work under glass and invoked the detachment fostered by
television. Bacon put glass on his pictures so people could get
close to them without damaging them; and he employed massive gold
frames to invoke historic presentations of art.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the paradox intrinsic to the works themselves. Not
all are great paintings: Indeed, probably half of the images in
this exhibition seem glib, too suave by half. Almost all are truly
beautiful, though.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be? How can paintings of mangled faces, contorted
and dismembered bodies, and claustrophobic spaces be remotely
beautiful?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has to do with mystery.

   Bacon would say his pictures were realistic _ maybe not
naturalistic, but realistic in an intensified way. He said his art
was about appearance and had nothing to offer about a subject's
psyche or spirit. He said he didn't spend time interpreting his
art, that there was nothing to interpret, no symbolism or mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But the mystery, the paradox, the ambiguity or whatever you want
to call it may come in with how strongly many of us believe that
Bacon had it wrong. There is more to reality than he perceived, and
there is more to his work than he intended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of his work appearing ruthlessly real, it acquires a
tragic and poignant dimension. Instead of stirring repugnance, it
elicits compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's vision may have been limited, but he communicated it
with a skill and often with a depth unmatched by many modern
artists. As such, it gives us much and rewards those of us willing
to be receptive.

`IN TOO DEEP' OVERCOMES SHALLOW PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
 DEEP-MOVIE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The problem with ``In Too Deep'' is that the script
and directing are way too shallow.
</P>
<P>
   But adults should see it still, simply to revel in visceral
cinematography and the crafty performances of Omar Epps and
(surprise!) LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   Epps is Jeffrey Cole, a green Cincinnati cop who somehow talks
his way undercover the day he earns his badge.
</P>
<P>
   His assignment is to infiltrate the drug traffic of the PJs, a
task never before satisfactorily accomplished by the legions of
more experienced, trained officers who preceded him. (See what I
mean by a shallow script?)
</P>
<P>
   During his dabbles on the dark side, Cole, disguised as the
bejeweled J. Reid, struggles to remain a man on a mission instead
of becoming one of the men who are the mission.
</P>
<P>
   He's won over, as am I, by his target: Cool J's drug lord,
``God,'' a fascinating mix of meanness and affection that runs
Ohio's $11 million drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a story we've heard before. ``Heart of Darkness,''
anyone? It's even a story we've seen set in American poverty
before. The script does nothing to make it original and the
directing is simplistic and sometimes a little confusing.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh! that acting. Epps takes a character poorly painted (we
know little of his personal past in the projects, for example) and
rises above to make two characters out of scratch: a cocky,
soft-hearted policeman and a drug lord who worships ``God.'' The
way he softly shifts from persona to persona and mixes the men
where they shouldn't ever meet is a feat and a gift to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   As for LL Cool J, I snickered when I heard this baby-face was to
play a mean drug machine. But this gives his cruel character
much-needed depth and an unexpected level of audience empathy.
``God'' is the perfect foil to Cole; each of them is at war with
that weakness that is kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Ellery Ryan's cinematography somehow manages to make the 'hoods
of Ohio (Ohio? Ohio? Can you relocate this, please?) look elegantly
edgy. She even makes the gratuitous violence appear as some sort of
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' is rated R for heavy profanity, sexuality and
violence and a terrible, unneccessary scene where violence and
sexuality combine for a moment no one under age 17 should see. 3
stars. &QL;

<P>
   Video might have killed the radio star, but what about the
pinball manufacturer? Ever since Pong entered the arcades and bars
nearly a quarter-century ago, skeptics have been predicting
pinball's last big tilt.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, pinball has declined in popularity. One
of the two main manufacturers of the machines, Williams
Electronics, said it had released only half as many new games last
year as it did in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is facing a crossroads, but Williams Electronics
and its major rival, Sega Pinball, are taking different
technological paths, with one embracing and the other rejecting the
video-game age.
</P>
<P>
   After 57 years in the business, Williams Electronics, based in
Chicago, recently announced that it would no longer produce
traditional pinball machines. Instead, it will manufacture a new
generation of pinball-video game hybrids, part of its Pinball 2000
system.
</P>
<P>
   The first such game, Revenge From Mars, was introduced in London
in January. While video glitz has been used for a while to dress up
pinball games, Revenge From Mars is the first to incorporate video
images into the action, allowing the player to interact with
virtual, as well as physical, targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intertwining video and pinball is the next evolutionary
phase,'' said Roger Sharpe, director of licensing for the pinball
division at Williams Electronics. ``It's the perfect blend of new
technologies without losing the essence of what pinball has meant
for so many fans of the medium for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Stern, owner of Sega Pinball, is skeptical. His
company, which creates many licensed games, like Jurassic Park and
South Park, remains committed to the classic electromechanical
action of bumpers and wire ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams is trying to get a video game player to play pinball,
but the video game player is at home playing Dreamcast,'' Stern
said, referring to the new home console system from Sega of America
(which is part of Sega Enterprises, as is Sega Pinball).
</P>
<P>
   Pinball has been around for 128 years, but this debate did not
begin until video games took off in the early 1980s. In the
beginning, pinball was based only on gravity. It originated in
Cincinnati as a tabletop version of a French game, bagatelle. The
player shot a ball into a slanted play field, where the ball would
randomly bounce among a series of pins (thus the name).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Harry Williams _ the future founder of Williams
Electronics _ invented a game called Contact, which included the
first battery-operated feature: a scoring cup that automatically
kicked out a ball that landed in it.
</P>
<P>
   As a joke, Williams connected the cup to a telephone so the
phone rang every time the ball went in the cup. Legend has it that
his unsuspecting business associate spent much of the day sprinting
across the room to answer the phone each time it rang.
</P>
<P>
   The flipper was introduced in 1946. The next major technological
innovation came in the mid-1970s, when pinball's electromechanical
elements were augmented with electronics. That allowed machines to
have more dazzling features, like digital scoring, speech and
synchronized light shows.
</P>
<P>
   The first threat from video games came around the early 1980s,
during the explosive era of arcade hits like Pac-Man and Space
Invaders. Faced with this formidable competition, pinball
developers experimented with hybrid designs in games like Caveman
and Baby Pac-Man.
</P>
<P>
   These machines embedded video game displays within the game so a
player would switch, rather awkwardly, between pinball and video
maneuvers. By all accounts, the early hybrids were a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinball 2000 hybrid is different, Sharpe said, because the
video elements are seamlessly integrated into the pinball action.
When the ball passes various sensors on the playing field,
corresponding video images are projected on the glass. In Revenge
From Mars, for example, a player may have to shoot video images of
six Martians who sit at a happy-hour bar.
</P>
<P>
   Stern argues that such flashy techniques can be too much of a
good thing. ``Hybrids tend to be dismal because the average player
gets confused by all the action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of pinball is its simplicity, he said, because
players, most of them men 18 to 35 years old, come to the games for
fast and intuitive play. ``We don't want our players to think too
much,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   But changes are necessary, Sharpe counters. The business has
``been in a downward spiral for the past three or four years,'' he
said. ``Before we pull the plug,'' Sharpe said, ``we want to see if
we can pull off a miracle.''

<P>
   Arms manufacturers have developed laser-guided bombs and other
so-called smart weapons that use advanced technology to reach the
intended target. But getting emergency supplies to troops or
civilians is still often done the old-fashioned way, by dropping
them out of a plane on a parachute and hoping they land in the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several companies are trying to bring the air drop into the
digital age, combining advances in parachute technology with
satellite-based navigation units. The companies say that with the
new systems, military or aid groups will be able to drop cargo
where it is intended to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come as close as dead-on in tests,'' said Barry Van
Buskirk, vice president of SSE Inc. ( &UR; www.sse-inc.com &LR; ) in New
Jersey, which designs and manufactures guidance systems for use in
airdrops.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the Pioneer Aero Corp., a Connecticut parachute
manufacturer, SSE is now marketing a system that uses a parafoil, a
boxy, wing-like parachute that is highly steerable and able to
glide much farther than conventional parachutes. From an altitude
of 25,000 feet and a horizontal distance of 10 miles or more, a
bundle weighing of 100 to 42,000 pounds can be dropped to land
within about 100 yards of a designated target.
</P>
<P>
   The system includes a small computer, a compass, an altitude
sensor and a Global Positioning System unit that uses timing
signals from satellites to determine latitude and longitude. The
payload's location is constantly calculated as it falls, and the
computer uses the information to control the parafoil's steering
gear to keep it headed for the target.
</P>
<P>
   The system also includes software with which operators, using a
computer on the ground or on board the plane, can program the
latitude and longitude of the target and up to five ``waypoints''
to guide the parafoil-cargo package into the target area and take
advantage of wind conditions. The software also allows personnel in
the plane or on the ground to control the drop manually.
</P>
<P>
   Using the system, operators can drop the cargo at night, from
higher altitudes and at greater horizontal distances from the
target. In an area where there is a risk of enemy fire, these are
all important advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that during the war in Bosnia, they were dropping
supplies at night to avoid enemy fire on aircraft, and they were
missing villages completely,'' said Steve Hintzke, president of
Pioneer Aerospace  &UR; (www.pioneeraero.com/gpads.htm) &LR; . ``This is the
type of thing that could overcome some of these hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   SSE also works with Strong Enterprises, based in Florida, to
create the systems. Strong Enterprises  &UR; (www.strongparachutes.com &LR; 
markets a GPS-based airdrop system in two sizes and weight loads.
SSE has sold 12 units to the Australian Army, and others to the
United States Army and the Indonesian Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hintzke said a small system that is capable of carrying loads up
to 1,500 pounds cost about $30,000 to $40,000. ``They are reusable
if you can get in there and get it back,'' he said. That would be
unlikely in a war zone, he added. The high cost means that such
systems are probably not affordable for many relief groups, at
least for now. Therefore, the major market is the military, Van
Buskirk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot less expensive from a military standpoint to glide
in without a radar signal than to put planes in the way of enemy
fire,'' Van Buskirk added.  &QL;

 &HT;    Scrapping U.S. tax system may be tough sell
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the evidence of recent polls, taxes are not as
big an issue in these boom times as they once were. But polls that
show the magnitude of public concern don't measure the intensity of
emotion those three fateful letters, I, R and S, still generate in
a portion of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   There was clear evidence of this Tuesday night in Cobb County
when an audience of several hundred turned out for a town hall
meeting of the Americans for Fair Taxation, hosted by Rep. John
Linder and his Democratic counterpart from Minnesota, Rep. Collin
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Linder and Peterson are co-sponsors of the bill that is the
vehicle for the Fair Tax group's proposal to scrap the federal tax
system as we know it and replace it with a 23 percent sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the feds would contract with the states to
collect the revenues and kick back a monthly ``universal rebate,''
which backers claim would ensure that the poor and elderly would
not be taxed unfairly for the cost of necessities. Though the
concept might be simple, it would take some getting used to: A new
home or automobile would incur the tax, for instance, while an
older home or used car would not.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Tax idea began as the brainchild of a group of wealthy
Texans, including construction magnate Leo Linbeck and investor
Jack Trotter, who briefly had the ear of Ways and Means Chairman
Bill Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Linder's involvement in this cause, now that Archer is headed
toward retirement, represents an interesting segue from his job as
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which
he lost after the GOP's disappointing 1998 showing. With Newt
Gingrich departed from the scene and hopes for a larger leadership
role diminished, Linder has reverted to a role more in line with
his conservative ideology.
</P>
<P>
   With congressional Republicans working to build support for
their $792 billion tax cut plan, the Republican presidential
candidates promoting their own garden of tax proposals and
questions already being raised about the validity of the numbers
behind the Fair Tax plan, it might seem to be a nonstarter.
</P>
<P>
   But at the least, it's a nonstarter with a lot of money. Linder
said the group will spend $20 million on an ad campaign to start
around the beginning of the year, in advance of March hearings on
the bill. The Minnesota twins (Linder hails originally from Deer
River, Minn.) are trying to build up grass roots support this week
on a tour that also includes Houston and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if we can't engage you, there's no chance of
passing it. There's no sense in trying,'' Linder told his
supportive audience Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That engagement depends largely on whether dissatisfaction with
the present system is enough to inspire a leap of faith into a plan
that promises a 20 percent reduction in wholesale prices reaped
through the increased efficiencies in the tax system, and more jobs
and investments supposedly gained by the competitive advantage it
would give the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you all have to do is forget about the
current tax system,'' Peterson said in response to a question from
the audience about how this would affect those who already have
paid taxes on money put into their Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   There are many who might want to forget about it, but it will
take quite a sell to convince them they can.

   BISHOP, Calif. _ Classical music concerts are rarer than summer
rainstorms in this isolated high desert town a few hundred miles
north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a ripple of excitement in the audience of about 250
in the gymnasium of the town's Calvary Baptist Church when Laura
Spitzer strode out beneath the basketball hoop, seated herself at a
grand piano placed before the waiting Eastern Sierra Symphony
Orchestra and began Grieg's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in A
minor. Playing in such a remote rural town is nothing new for Ms.
Spitzer, who has made a career of performing classical music far
off the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old pianist, who studied music at the Mozarteum
University in Salzburg, Austria, and the Peabody Institute at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, has spent almost two decades
traveling across the United States and Canada, usually toting along
a seven-foot Steinway grand piano in her Ford van, playing in small
towns like Chewelah, Wash., or Pioche, Nev. (population 924).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitzer, a native of Syracuse who now makes her home in Van
Nuys, Calif., has played solo classical piano concerts in small
cities and tiny backwaters in almost every state in the West and
others in the Midwest and East, trundling her piano as far from
home as Plymouth, N.H. She has also given more than a thousand
music programs for children, playing in schools across the United
States and Canada and teaching young people about classical music.
</P>
<P>
   The pianist has performed in large concert halls in the United
States and Europe, but she said she played solo recitals in rural
towns not only to spread a greater appreciation of classical music
beyond the big cities, but also to make a living, although a modest
one, performing the classics. ``I wanted to know it was possible,''
she said. ``For me, it was a test of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Her appearances in small towns have not exactly been glamorous.
In addition to performing in gymnasiums, churches, museums and
school auditoriums, she has played Chopin, Debussy, Mozart and
Ravel in retail stores, a train depot, a converted auto garage. Her
performance in Pearsall, Tex., was announced on the marquee of one
of the town's fast-food chicken franchises, and in Norway, on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, she was sponsored by the local Dairy
Queen. She has also played solo concerts in housing projects,
hospitals and youth halls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ms. Spitzer has developed a singular performance
style. She began introducing pieces with colorful stories about how
they were written, perhaps throwing in a few jokes, more like a
folk musician or a cabaret performer. During intermissions, she is
likely to mingle with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitzer is a performer with a dramatic flair. ``She plays
convincingly in a great many styles,'' said Marienne Uszler, editor
of Piano and Keyboard magazine and emeritus professor of keyboard
studies at the University of Southern California. ``She has a very
highly developed technique. Technically she can do an enormous
amount of things, and she is a very colorful player.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist started on her unusual career after she moved to Las
Vegas in 1979 to be with the man she later married, and wanted to
find a way to make a living in the area as a classical pianist.
After playing sporadic engagements that did not bring in much
income, she received the first of four grants from the Nevada State
Council on the Arts to give piano recitals in small towns across
the state. She has now played in 50 of them, in Nevada alone, she
estimated, and has received the state's Governor's Arts Award.
</P>
<P>
   She began hauling her own Steinway, which weighs almost 1,000
pounds, because in the small towns ``there weren't any
concert-worthy grand pianos,'' she said. ``I would call these towns
and say, `What have you got to play on?' and they would say, `An
old upright in the elementary school that's been played on for 50
years and was tuned in, um ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spitzer's first road concert, in the early 1980s, was in
Panaca, Nev., a town of fewer than 600 people. ``The day that I got
there, there was a blizzard,'' she said. ``Yet 200 people showed
up, a full house. There is very little that goes on those towns.
They were starved.''
</P>
<P>
   The wandering musician said one of her strangest experiences was
performing in Caliente, Nev. She had set up to play on the steps of
an old railway depot. ``They had a pig wrestling contest across the
street,'' she said. ``People would come with their boots all
mud-splattered from the pigs, and they'd just sit down and listen
to a classical piano concert. As I was starting the story about the
`Rhapsody in Blue,' a 92-car westbound freight train barreled by
and just stopped the concert.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when she first started touring rural areas she was
surprised by the response. ``I didn't think people cared about
classical music. I didn't think people would show up.''
</P>
<P>
   But people came for the recitals and often seemed unexpectedly
moved. ``Truck drivers in cowboy hats would come up with tears in
their eyes,'' Ms. Spitzer said. ``It made me feel like there was a
reason to do what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the pianist has settled down a bit,
spending most of her time working on a doctorate at the University
of Southern California and performing only in California. Last
year, Ms. Spitzer, who is now divorced, also went to Guangzhou,
China, and adopted a daughter, Anna. She still drives hundreds of
miles for appearances, sometimes taking the child, who is 2{, with
her. She plans to resume wider travels after she receives her
doctorate next year.

 &HT;    Classical music strengthens skills in children, not necessarily
inteligence
 &HT;    By Diane Lore

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two new studies report listening to classical music
does not boost intelligence, challenging the popular notion of
``The Mozart Effect'' that drove three states, including Georgia,
to offer classical music CDs and tape recordings to mothers of
newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to classical music is probably good for kids _ good
for reasons other than it's going to make them smarter,'' said
Harvard Medical School researcher Christopher Chabris, who
published his findings in today's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Chabris, who analyzed 16 studies on music and intelligence,
found that IQ improvements from listening to Mozart were not
statistically significant. And in an accompanying study in Nature,
other researchers said they tried to reproduce the results of a
1993 study linking music and intelligence and failed.
</P>
<P>
   In that earlier study, college students were shown to
temporarily gain up to nine IQ points after listening to a Mozart
piano sonata. That study, along with others, spawned an industry of
supposedly mind-enhancing recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Shaw, a physicist at the University of California at
Irvine who co-authored the 1993 study, called it ``premature'' to
conclude that the new research challenges the validity of the 1993
findings.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, former Gov. Zell Miller pushed in 1998 for the
creation of ``Build Your Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music,''
an album of classical music on CDs and tapes distributed to
hospitals as gifts to newborns' mothers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gov. Roy Barnes continued the project, buying 120,000
CDs from Sony at a cost of $102,000. Next year, the program will be
re-evaluated, said Scott Frederking, the policy coordinator for the
state's Office of Planning and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we will be discussing this program,'' he said. ``But
there's not a social program out there where scientists aren't
disagreeing how effective it is.''
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota and Tennesee also gives away classical CDs to new
mothers. So does the National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences
Several ``Mozart Effect'' CDs have been on the Billboard classical
charts since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chabris' analysis examined the findings of 16 studies -
involving a total of 714 people - and found no significant
improvement in either broader abstract reasoning or spatial
thinking. The participants were tested before and after listening
to Mozart. On average, Mozart listeners' scores were enhanced by
1.4 IQ points. In the paper-folding test, scores increased by 2.1
points. Both numbers fall below the 4.5-point difference that would
be expected of anyone taking the test twice on the same day,
Chabris said. But other respected researchers have found music can
strengthen a host of skills in children linked to analytical and
academic performance, such as concentration, memory and spatial
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   One study, published in March in the journal Neurological
Research, found that piano lessons, joined with computer work on
specific types of mathematical puzzles, improved elementary school
children's scores in math skills such as fractions by 27 percent.

   At a news conference scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday, NASA plans
to unveil the first images taken by the Chandra X-Ray observatory.
Chandra, which was put into its elliptical orbit by the space
shuttle in July, will transmit images of distant cosmic phenomena
such as exploding stars, black holes and colliding galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   NASA won't say exactly which distant cosmic phenomena it will be
showing in photographs, but it promises that the first images will
be posted to the Chandra Web site (chandra.nasa.gov) after the
press conference. The site will be updated throughout the
satellite's expected five years of service.

   A Pen That Can Read as Well as Write
</P>
<P>
   A new device could cut down on tedious note taking. The C Pen,
from the Swedish company C Technologies, works like a digital
variation on the popular yellow highlighter except that this
highlighter also absorbs information like a digital scanner,
carries information like a personal digital assistant and records
handwritten words as you write them.
</P>
<P>
   When the C Pen's tip is dragged over typed text, a tiny camera
takes 50 pictures a second. It translates the pictures into plain
text and displays the words, two rows at a time, on a small display
screen on the pen's side. Magnus Manhem, the company's vice
president for marketing and sales, calls it ``a pen that sees.''
</P>
<P>
   The text can be edited by pressing a button on one end of the
pen. The pen uses flash memory to store two megabytes of data and
uses infrared signals to transmit captured text to a laptop or PC.
</P>
<P>
   It can also detect handwriting: Hold it as you would hold a
traditional pen, press it against a textured surface with
variations that can be read by the camera and spell out letters.
The movement will be captured by the pen and translated into
plain-text characters.
</P>
<P>
   The contraption, which weighs a little more than five ounces and
includes an address book, will be available in electronics stores
nationwide next month. Starting Monday, it can be ordered for $200
at www.cpen.com.

   Newspaper Web Sites That Look Like Print
</P>
<P>
   Now that most newspapers regularly post at least some of their
articles on the Web, an Israeli company wants to make your computer
screen look more like a newspaper. Newzprint, a new service from
Infopager technologies, downloads news from more than 30
publications, then reformats it into something that resembles a
newspaper on your monitor, with columns, bold headlines and even an
illustrated pair of thumbs holding the paper aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages aren't simply esthetic, said Drew Tick,
Infopager's chief executive. The desktop paper can be customized
with, for example, the front page of The Miami Herald, the business
section of The San Jose Mercury News and science news from New
Scientist and the sports section of The Washington Post. And, like
any newspaper, the Newzprint edition is delivered every day. Unlike
most papers, it arrives at whatever time the user chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Free downloading is available from www.newzprint.com, although
the company does want to charge for the service in the future.
Newzprint does not, it should be stressed, reprint the entire
contents of the source publications, but only the portion the
publication puts on the Web. Paid services can't be viewed through
Newzprint, which means no access to The Wall Street Journal, for
example.

   Reverse Miniaturization

   The word ``bloatware'' isn't just for software anymore. The new
softcover manual ``Using Microsoft Office 2000: Special Edition''
has 56 chapters, 1,473 pages and weighs in at a hefty five pounds.
(By comparison, the hardcover edition of the Websters New World
Third College Dictionary is a relative lightweight, at 3 pounds,
13.5 ounces.) IBM's new Thinkpad 240 weighs only three pounds,
which means that manuals now outweigh some of the machines that
will run the programs.

   Music listeners who use the Liquid Audio system will be able to
hear MP3 files on the newly released Liquid System 5.0. Liquid
Audio had been popular with the music industry because the
downloaded files cannot be copied, but it was not nearly so popular
with the online music crowd as MP3. ``We're seeing a trend right
across software companies, that they're becoming format
agnostics,'' said Lucas Graves, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications in New York. ``To make online music ready for
prime-time, consumers should not even need to be aware what format
the music is coming in.''

   Better Sound on the Computer
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who enjoys playing music while using the computer but
detests the sound of the less-than-A-list stereo speakers that
commonly come with computers, SRS Labs says it has created a sound
idea that can help.
</P>
<P>
   SRS, an audio technology company based in Santa Ana, Calif., has
developed Wow Thing, a collection of hardware and software audio
enhancements that trick modest sound systems into producing richer,
bolder tones. The hardware version, yet another blue translucent,
plastic box about the size of a cigarette holder that operates on
its own power, is plugged in between the computer and its external
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   When switched on, the sound is expanded, with heavier bass and a
more three-dimensional sound. Similar sound improvements can be
achieved by plugging stereo headphones into the $29.95 device, said
Jennifer Drescher, the company's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   A software version of Wow Thing that works with the Winamp Media
Player, a popular player on the Internet, is free. The hardware
version goes on sale on Sept. 13 at www.wowthing.com. ``Our goal,''
Ms. Drescher said, ``is to make music you hear on the computer
sound like that in a movie theater.''

   A New Way to Protect Your Computer's Hard Drive
</P>
<P>
   OK, your expensive new computer has just been stolen and your
stomach has more knots than a Boy Scout jamboree. It isn't so much
the loss of the $3,000-plus machine that is raising a nervous sweat
but the thought of the sensitive data inside _ proposals, financial
statements, contracts, personal e-mail _ falling into the wrong
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Passwords usually merely slow thieves from gaining access to
computer hard drives and the information they contain. Now Curtis
Computer Products is offering another solution: the Qualtec Data
Defender. Appearing to be little more than a computer parallel port
plug, the Data Defender, using its own software, is a lock-out key
that prevents unauthorized access to a computer's hard drive, said
Ken Bernstein, director of Qualtec Security Systems at Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the hard drive is removed, the Data Defender, which
retails for $149.95, will not allow the the drive to work without
its key in place.
</P>
<P>
   First put out late last year as the Lap Jack Data Security
System by Lap Jack Systems, the product is being re-released by
Curtis.

   Basic E-Mail Service, Cheap and Lightweight
</P>
<P>
   If millions of Americans are spending thousands of dollars for
computers primarily for e-mail, will they spend less than $100 just
for e-mail? It sounds like a shaky premise, but several companies
are banking on it and producing e-mail-only devices.
</P>
<P>
   The latest company is Vtech Industries, the manufacturer of
electronic learning toys and cordless telephones. Next week, the
company's U.S. division will introduce two lightweight and
simple-to-use devices that, once connected to a telephone line
through a local or toll-free call, aim to be the e-mail machines of
the mass market. A slew of new wireless devices, including some
pagers and telephones, can also send and receive e-mail, but they
usually limit the length of messages and can be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Vtech machines cost less than $100. Each looks like a
keyboard with a small LCDscreen.
</P>
<P>
   The Vtech e-mail Postbox, the larger of the two at just over two
pounds, has full-size keys and displays eight lines at a time. It
can send and receive messages of up to 5,000 characters (larger
messages are broken up) to or from any e-mail address. It can also
store an average of 400 moderate-size messages at a time. Among its
features is an address book, a calendar and stock phrases like
``good to hear from you'' for less-nimble typists.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail Express, a handheld device that weighs about seven
ounces, packs similar features plus games. It operates on two AA
batteries (the Postbox uses two C batteries or an AC adaptor).
</P>
<P>
   Both machines link to an e-mail service that costs about $10 a
month. (The Vtech machines cannot get access to e-mail accounts
like Hotmail but can receive and send messages to and from them.)
The user need not bother with access numbers, said Jude Dieterman,
vice president of Vtech. With the touch of a yellow button, the
device dials an embedded access number; the user is only required
to input the telephone number from which the call is being made.
</P>
<P>

Dieterman said. The Vtech machines go on sale Sept. 1 on the

   NEW YORK _ You can see people staring at them on the subway,
finding it hard to look away from the images of women's battered
faces and the numbers illustrating a chilling statistic: ``Every 12
seconds, another woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, which feature the phone number for the
domestic-violence hot line run by Victim Services, a nonprofit
agency, (800-621-HOPE) are the latest in an annual series of public
information efforts started in 1994. The current ad is the first to
take up the entire length of a subway car.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of the women in the ads seem gritty and raw, as
though they were taken in a police station or a hospital, or at the
scene of a crime. In fact, the women are actresses, friends of the
photographer, Alastair Thain; Their welts and bruises are the
make-up artistry of Vicky Slack, a stylist who usually works on
horror films.
</P>
<P>
   The copy on the ad was created by a couple of young men who
usually work on ads for fancy windows, drugs, and soda.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the Victims Service hot line have jumped 14 percent
since the ads began running in June, according to Victim Services _
although the agency said it is not possible to know how many of
those calls were prompted by the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were created by Young &AMP; Rubicam New York, which donated
its services, worth about $200,000. The ad space, which cost about
$250,000, was paid for by the Starr Foundation, a New York-based
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who started the ad campaign for the
agency in 1994, soon after he took office, went to Young &AMP; Rubicam
because his former adviser, David Garth, knew an executive there.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ilene H. Rosenthal, 42, a senior vice president at
Young &AMP; Rubicam who has overseen the account from the beginning,
the early campaigns focused on such aspects of domestic abuse as
the cycle of violence in a family and among teen-agers. This year,
the team decided to turn to the core issue: violence against women
by their partners. Ms. Rosenthal said the ad team approached the
campaign the same way it would any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much like we do to revive old brands, sometimes you decide
maybe we need to go back to the essence of the brand,'' she said.
So, she explained, the ad's creators focused on ``the core issue of
domestic violence, which is, women are most often the victims and
don't know where to go.
</P>
<P>
   Then they talked about a strategy to make the ads effective,
using a Young and Rubicam formula: ``what do people believe now,
and what do we want them to believe,'' Ms. Rosenthal said. ``The
hard part of the strategy'' is getting people to change their
minds, meaning, in this campaign to convince people that abuse is a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   They first came up with what the agency calls ``a
differentiating proposition.'' In the case of AT&AMP;T, for example,
whose ads Ms. Rosenthal worked on, the differentiating proposition,
she said, was that ``AT&AMP;T is your communications partner to help
you succeed in your life and business. The tag line that resulted
was ``AT&AMP;T It's all within your reach.''
</P>
<P>
   For the subway campaign, Ms. Rosenthal said, the creative team
wanted to focus attention on the word violence in the phrase
domestic violence. ``People weren't seeing it,'' she said. Thus,
the differentiating proposition also wound up as the tag line:
``Violence is violence and violence is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Rosenthal, when she was in college, had helped start a
battered women's shelter in Worcester, Mass., the other people from
Young &AMP; Rubicam on the project had had no direct experience with
domestic violence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two 29-year-old men who created the ads, Stuart Garrett, an
art director, and Ted McCagg, a copy writer, said they got their
ideas from looking at pictures of battered women and from reading
about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and Ms. Mitchell had also made it clear that they
wanted something powerful _ the ``gasp factor,'' Ms. Rosenthal
calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The creative team first came up with an ad featuring a
photograph of a baseball bat with the tag line, ``When his baseball
team loses, unfortunately, so does she.'' But the agency decided to
depict more plainly what battery actually looks like.
</P>
<P>
   Subway riders can often be found studying the portraits of
misery, like the woman with a bruised elbow, or the one with
mascara-blackened tears running down her face. ``They are better
than words,'' said Nava Levy, 37, a tourist from Israel. ``You look
up at the pictures, you can know how these people feel. A lot of
sorrow and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at Young &AMP; Rubicam said the campaign was a welcome
change of pace. ``When you do Jell-O and telecommunications and
pharmaceuticals,'' Ms. Rosenthal said, ``it's nice to do something
that reminds you about the real part of the world and advertising's
ability to make a difference.''

FIRED PHOENIX COLUMNIST MULLING SUIT, LAWYER SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   A battle is brewing in Phoenix, where Arizona Republic columnist
Julie Amparano, fired last week for allegedly fabricating sources,
is denying the charges and threatening to sue the paper.
</P>
<P>
   According to executive editor Pam Johnson, on Aug. 18 a
senior-level editor informed her of some newsroom fears that
Amparano might be inventing characters in her new ``Conversations''
column. An internal examination of the sources in 11 of her columns
turned up 20 names that could not be traced. ``During the
investigation, Julie offered contradictory statements about her
work that raised futher doubts,'' said a statement issued by
Johnson. ``She also described her reporting methods, which fell far
short of accepted journalistic practices.'' She was fired on Aug.
20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had a lot of fondness for (Amparano),'' Johnson said in
an interview. But ``nobody is bigger than our public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano, 39, is a regional director for the National
Association of Hispanic Journalists and a five-year Republic
veteran. Her attorney Stephen Montoya offered a ``flat out denial''
of wrongdoing, saying, ``The practices that Julie employed in
writing her feature column are employed throughout the paper.''
Montoya adds that he and Amparano are searching for the sources in
question and ``weighing our options. The possibility of a
defamation action . . . is definitely there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, however, the Amparano furor does not seem to have
stirred up much passion outside the newsroom. As of Wednesday,
Republic reader advocate Richard de Uriarte said he'd received only
about 20 public comments on the firing. ``In comparison to the loss
of a bridge column, it's nothing,'' he says.

DECADES HAVEN'T DULLED WIT OF SATIRIST STAN FREBERG
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by FREBERG-BEST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The record was called ``A Child's Garden of Freberg,'' a
collection of '50s song parodies and comic sketches. It had been in
the family since before I was born, played by three older siblings
until every track was scratched. At some point, the wear became so
bad that two songs on one side were unplayable. But every time we
played it, we laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The record remained with us until the early '80s, when it died
an unfortunate death after a young broadcasting student _ not
saying who _ left it in his truck on a Texas summer day, and it
warped into an expressionistic ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing it wasn't easy _ till this week, when Rhino Records
released ``Tip of the Freberg: The Stan Freberg Collection
1951-1998,'' a four-disc retrospective of one of the most
influential satirists of the second half of the century. But the
Freberg box is more than just a child's garden; it's a
plantation-size overview of Freberg's early parodies, radio shows,
musical-comedy productions and audio commercials. It also features
a video collection of many of Freberg's TV advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   You might not recognize Freberg's name, but you've probably
heard his voice and certainly encountered his legacy. Matt
Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons,'' has cited him as an
influence that can be heard in the show's voice work as well as in
its consistently hilarious songs.
</P>
<P>
   The Barenaked Ladies concert last Sunday at Dallas' Starplex,
with the band taking shots at a variety of pop acts, bore echoes of
Freberg's work. The ``Dudley Do-Right'' movie coming out this week
evolved from cartoons associated with Freberg. And commercial
campaigns such as the ``Got Milk'' series can trace their roots to
Freberg's earliest advertising work.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to vintage Freberg is to hear innocence, especially in
a comic world now laced with foul language and teen-agers getting
physically involved with apple pies. But in the '50s and '60s,
Freberg was considered subversive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very tough to get stuff through censors, lawyers,
vice presidents for network standards and practices,'' said
Freberg, 73, in a phone interview. ``It was never, never for doing
anything off-color. It was because of jokes that they considered
libelous.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't surprising, considering the zingers that Freberg
aimed at advertisers, other musicians (one reason Freberg's satires
worked is that he's an accomplished musician himself) and,
occasionally, the government. Freberg often worked with these
entities as well, but he has long been known for biting every hand
that feeds him, or, as he puts it, biting every hand that ``needs''
him.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Proctor of Firesign Theatre, a comedy troupe whose early
work was heavily influenced by Freberg, sees this side of Freberg
as being part of a long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most daring comedy writers usually behave in that
manner,'' Proctor said. ``In the evolution of society, the court
jester was given room and board and other rewards for making the
king laugh. Of course, that meant biting the hand that fed him, and
if you bite the hand that feeds you too often, you risk losing your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Freberg risked losing only sponsors, but that wasn't a problem
at the beginning of his career, when he released a series of 45s
lampooning TV shows and pop music. A favorite target was the
popular TV show ``Dragnet,'' which was the subject of three
parodies, including the hit ``St. George and the Dragonet,'' in
which the storied saint is a Jack Webb figure assigned to the case
of a maiden-devouring dragon. These bits featured voice actors such
as Daws Butler and June Foray, who would go on to provide voices
for Jay Ward cartoons such as ``Rocky &AMP; Bullwinkle'' and ``Dudley
Do-Right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Freberg really shined on the pop satires, which play well
even if you haven't heard the original songs. A fan of big band and
jazz, he was driven to near-apoplexy by gimmicky songs and
inarticulate singers, and this showed in his work. Unlike ``Weird
Al'' Yankovic, Freberg's songs weren't merely affectionate
parodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When rock 'n' roll came along, Freberg thought it was a
passing phase,'' said Barry Hanson, better-known as novelty-show
host Dr. Demento. ``He was not primarily a parodist. He was more
likely to take an existing work and make fun of it as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, this involved two-character skits in which
rebellious musicians or baffled producers bickered with the lead
singer (often, Freberg played both parts). Freberg's take on ``The
Great Pretender'' featured a beatnik pianist slipping into bebop
because he was bored with the ``plink-plink-plink jazz'' of the
song's one-chord piano part; in his ``Rock Island Line,'' an
impatient producer continually interrupts the song's overlong
spoken introduction, asking the singer if he's ever going to get on
with it.

SALE WOULD STREAMLINE FASHION PRESS OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding; fashion, name of magazine, in 12th graf is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine one corporation controlling virtually every American
magazine. To the dismay of some, that's actually happening to the
fashion press.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. has agreed to sell its Fairchild
Publications subsidiary to Advance Publications, parent company of
archrival Conde Nast Publications, in a deal that could mean the
birth of a new fashion empire. Fairchild produces W and Jane
magazines and the influential trade publications Women's Wear Daily
and the Daily News Record, while Conde Nast's list includes Vogue,
GQ, Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed but previous reports put the
value at close to $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, subject to regulatory approval, will merge two of
fashion's most powerful publishers and assure Conde Nast virtual
control of industry coverage and a lion's share of fashion
advertising and readership. Indeed, Hearst Magazines' Harper's
Bazaar and Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines' Elle will be two of the
few national fashion titles to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months ending June 30, Vogue's paid circulation was
1.1 million, Mademoiselle's was 1.1 million and GQ's was 707,000,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. W's circulation was
412,000, it said.
</P>
<P>
   From January to July 1999, Vogue earned $85 million from its
advertising while W earned $46 million, according to the Publishers
Information Bureau. Industrywide, apparel and accessories
advertising totaled $536 million.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers might be offered package deals for placements in
several Conde Nast magazines at once, said Tom Julian, fashion
trend analyst for New York ad agency Fallon McElligott. So the
merger ``could be better for advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry is abuzz with concerns about objectivity
and preferential treatment. ``Why must a big conglomerate come in
and control everything?'' said Boston fashion photographer Elie,
whose work has appeared in W and GQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say blue is it this year, nobody is going to be able
to say otherwise. They can trash anyone. They can promote some
unknowns and not others. It's not fair. . . . It's better to have
more voices.''
</P>
<P>
   As a professional photographer, Elie has other concerns as well.
``It was always hard to break into (the Vogue level). . . . I
assume it will be even harder now. Photographers like Bruce Weber
will probably cover three magazines at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive, explained
the sale by saying in a statement that ``despite Fairchild's
strengths, Disney is focused on the long-term growth of our core
brands and entertainment assets.'' The Los Angelas Times reported
recently that Disney is looking to sell its Anaheim Angels baseball
and Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey franchises as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nash Yacoub, editor and publisher of the Boston-based fashion
magazine platinum, said consumers should expect ``bigger and
better'' from Conde Nast. ``I imagine that their editors in chief
will still maintain the identity of their magazines, since they
will all be competing against each other for newsstand sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston designers Alfred Fiandaca and David Josef contend that
the sale won't impact their lives much; the New York fashion press
is too subjective to be relevant anyway, they maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they love you, it's the greatest thing in the world,'' said
Josef. ``If they don't know you, you can't get any exposure. If
you're a young upstart in the business who is not wining and dining
the editors, it doesn't matter what you produce. It's all about who
they love and who they want to push.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fiandaca: ``I think the fashion press has always been
slanted and jaded. So what difference does it make who owns them. .
. . Vogue is a magazine that I would say for the past seven years
hasn't had a good slant on fashion. I don't think it's in touch
with fashion divas and it's not in touch with subway girls. Women's
Wear and W have the credibility and Vogue doesn't. Obviously, Conde
Nast felt they needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Calderin, an instructor of fashion design at Lasell College
and founder of Boston Fashion Week, said that regardless of Conde
Nast's growing stable of titles, it must still contend with a
larger threat: the Internet. ``Some of the most interesting things
going on in fashion media are not neccessarily coming out of those
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers are putting their collections on line, and you have
access to pictures that might not make it into Vogue . . . so you
can interpret collections yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magazines have gone the route of designers. Designers no
longer dictate. Designers have become a niche personality market.
And most of the magazines have become really specialized, too. The
reason to pick up Allure, for example, is beauty. Each magazine has
a focus and a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who have canceled tons of subscriptions of
magazines because they became useless after a while,'' said
Calderin. ``If you're really into fashion, you can become really
well-informed on the Internet _ for a fraction of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in response to this, Disney said in its announcement
that it will retain certain non-exclusive rights for its Internet
group to publish content from W, Jane, and Women's Wear Daily.
Disney and Advance also agreed to explore forming an Internet joint
venture.

UNDATED: on with it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The song parodies were a springboard for Freberg's other work,
which became increasingly political. Among the Rhino box's excerpts
from his 1957 radio show is a bit in which a censor consistently
interjects his opinions while Freberg attempts to sing ``Old Man
River,'' which becomes the more politically correct _ for the times
_ ``Elderly Man River.'' In another sketch, Freberg honors the
Father of the Year: Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The H-bomb would figure prominently in the first full flowering
of the surreal side of Freberg's humor, a one-act radio satire
called ``Incident at Los Voraces,'' in which warring Vegas casinos
(the El Sodom and the Rancho Gomorrah) try to one-up each other's
shows until the only thing left is for one of them to detonate the
bomb onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ```Incident at Los Voraces' shook the CBS building to its very
foundations,'' Freberg said. ``The brass didn't want to have
anything to do with the hydrogen bomb. They were acting like, `Gee,
if we don't mention it, it may go away.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rabble-rousing, Freberg's voice work caught the
attention of the advertising world. He loathed advertising and
commercialism; this was, after all, a guy who had done a piece
called ``Green Chri$tma$'' that was so blatantly anti-commercial
that Capitol Records almost refused to release it.
</P>
<P>
   Freberg still doesn't trust advertising, and this mistrust led
him to lampoon the industry's cynicism in his own ads, which were
likely to feature a sponsor character arguing with a writer who had
a shocking quality: integrity. Although the ads were amusing, they
often made fun of outrageous claims, thus pushing Freberg's beliefs
about truth in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the commercials are included on the Rhino box, as well
as a generous portion of Freberg's magnum opus, ``Stan Freberg
Presents The United States of America.'' Freberg, who found
high-school history to be boring, was inspired to write this
four-volume work-in-progress (only the first two volumes have been
completed) to prove that history can be interesting, if placed in a
humorous context. The box set includes such songs as the tokenism
satire ``Take an Indian to Lunch,'' sung by an important Pilgrim,
as well as songs about the Declaration of Independence, Betsy Ross
and Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``United States'' caused Freberg problems, and again,
they came from outside influences. After release of the first
volume in 1961, Broadway producer David Merrick wanted to turn the
piece into a Broadway musical. But his interference on the project
upset Freberg so much that the satirist quit. The last straw was
when Merrick demanded that Abraham Lincoln be removed from the
Civil War section. Freberg wouldn't return to the project till the
'90s, releasing the second volume in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Freberg hasn't exactly been quiet, but he did
slip behind the scenes, doing radio spots that were both anti-war
(a 1971 series of ads supporting a bill for early withdrawal from
Vietnam) and pro-Army; and filming TV commercials such as a famous
ad for Great American Soups, in which Texan Ann Miller answers her
husband's ``What's for dinner?'' query with a Busby Berkeley-esque
production number.
</P>
<P>
   Freberg's commercials continued into the '90s, with a series of
Encyclopaedia Britannica spots featuring his then-teen son Donavan
bantering with an off-screen narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been at this nearly 50 years, Freberg hasn't
stopped taking digs at pop culture. He says he has mellowed some on
rock music, but not on advertising. He continues to do radio work
and has even recorded a new song (included on the box) called ``The
Conspiraski Theory.'' It's an innocuous piece supposing that
because Monica Lewinsky, Tara Lipinski and Ted Kaczynski were all
in the news at once, a conspiracy must've been at hand. And yet,
when Freberg filmed the video (directed by son Donavan) in front of
a government building in Washington, D.C., ``men in black'' carted
him off (in a scene that was caught in the video). After nearly a
half-century, he's still sticking in the authorities' craw.

   The best Stan Freberg bits:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``John &AMP; Marsha'': A radio soap-opera parody that's nothing
but three minutes of two people saying ``John'' and ``Marsha,''
it's a testament to the power of audio, telling a story without
even using verbs. It's also hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Great Pretender'': Of the many '50s Freberg pieces that
lampooned pop-music trends, this may be the best. Freberg plays the
lead singer and the pianist who constantly interrupts him because
he can't believe he got stuck with a one-chord part.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Heartbreak Hotel'': Freberg amps the echo to absurd
proportions and rips his jeans in a letter-perfect takeoff on the
Elvis Presley hit.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Incident at Los Voraces'': A surreal 21-minute sketch about
warring casinos looking for the ultimate in entertainment and
finding it in the hydrogen bomb. This drove CBS censors bonkers and
laid the groundwork for such other audio comedy acts as ``Firesign
Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Stretching the Imagination'': To demonstrate the power of
radio, Freberg concocted this bit in which a giant mountain of
whipped cream is moved onto Lake Michigan, and airplanes drop a
10-ton maraschino cherry on it to the cheers of a thousands of
extras. Freberg did this all without multitracking, using seven
overlapping tape machines. According to the liner notes of ``Tip of
the Freberg,'' this commercial was an influence on Stephen King and
David Mamet.

BACON'S PAINTINGS DELVE INTO THE DARK SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Think of British artist Francis Bacon as the
anti-Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Auguste Renoir painted the sunny side of life and, for
that, he is beloved. Bacon, on the other hand, was a nihilist who
hardly understood happiness. And, for that, he is an artistic
unknown, compared with the warm, fuzzy Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth is staging a major
exhibition of Bacon's work, inviting us to give it due
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing through Oct. 15, ``Francis Bacon: A Retrospective
Exhibition'' represents almost 60 years of productivity on the part
of a man whose life vies with his art in terms of morbid
fascination. And this exhibit makes a solid case for viewing his
work as both painfully personal and perhaps more universal than
many of us would care to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon was born in Dublin in 1909, into genteel circumstances.
But his parents seemed incapable of caring for the boy. Sickly and
reared indifferently, Bacon received almost no formal academic
education, or, for that matter, training in art.
</P>
<P>
   To boot, Bacon was forced to leave home after his parents
discovered he was homosexual. Still, his mother gave him a small
allowance that permitted Bacon to travel a bit. After he saw
Picasso's work in a 1927 Paris exhibition, he took up painting.
</P>
<P>
   And, from that time until his death, from a heart attack linked
to asthma, in Madrid in 1992, Bacon never stopped making art. He
may have lived a debauched life _ he drank excessively, slept
little and had an insatiable taste for the low life _ but Bacon
conducted his career with strict discipline. He refined his
technical skills, constantly expanded his peculiar sources of
inspiration and put in long hours in his studio.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, Bacon's artwork caused a sensation. Some
critics dismissed his horrific imagery as being too akin to Picasso
_ or as a failed attempt at surrealism. But others saw his
paintings of outraged and outrageous creatures (often rendered with
explicit religious overtones) as honest and unique expressions of
the despair that held sway in England and Europe in the wake of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Bacon attracted steady patrons and began
selling paintings, to private collectors and museums. Over the
decades, his significance steadily has been supported by the art
establishment. Very few British artists are considered of much
importance to modern art: Bacon likely tops that list.
</P>
<P>
   Just since 1990, there have been four important, international
retrospectives of Bacon's art, as well as a focused presentation of
his ``screaming popes'' series in San Diego this year. The Modern
is the fourth stop for a show that also has toured to New Haven,
Conn., Minneapolis and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of institutional recognition, though, will be resisted
by everyday people more inclined to dismiss Bacon as a painter of
depressing and perverted pictures. After all, his work has nothing
in common with the way they view life or want to view art. Even
cynics or viewers accustomed to extremes of movie violence might
find Bacon's pictures too despairing, might wish the guy had known
how to lighten up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming popes, gay men suffering acute discomfort, dismembered
female bodies? We don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   But go anyway and, if necessary, keep this in mind: You can
respect Bacon's vision without agreeing with it or feeling that
your own beliefs have been violated. Because, regardless of what
you go away thinking, the work merits consideration.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Bacon pulls together, then transcends,
innumerable art and literary references, historical and
contemporary. He recaps many and anticipates perhaps even more _
serving as a sort of one-stop cultural shopping place, which is no
small thing in today's culturally degraded world.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   For example, in his paintings of the naked human body, there are
hints of Michelangelo's drawings and Eadweard Muybridge's studies
of animal motion, Hans Bellmer's grotesque dolls and Kiki Smith's
explorations of physical humility.
</P>
<P>
   In his paintings of screaming businessmen and popes, we see
Velasquez's Pope Innocent X and Andy Warhol's figure in an electric
chair, as well as the mortally wounded nurse from Sergei
Eisenstein's ``Battleship Potemkin.''
</P>
<P>
   We also, without realizing it, are exposed to nonartistic visual
references, including Bacon's cherished book on diseases of the
human mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a homage to van Gogh and an arrangement of figures
recalling Matthias Grunewald's ``Isenheim Altarpiece.'' There are
hints of scenes from Samuel Beckett, Aeschylus and Shakespeare.
There is a glimpse of Max Beckmann's voyeur in a bowler hat,
perhaps even Chaim Soutine's lurid paintings of animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if you want a more immediate reference, consider Bacon's
use of photographs as ``models,'' rather than working from live
models. He didn't pioneer the practice, but he brought it to a new
level of importance.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Bacon's independence, which contradicts just about
every major ``ism'' of the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon started painting about the same time as Jackson Pollock,
making small, figurative paintings when Pollock was making
mural-sized abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   When pop art came in, with its cynical celebration of
superficial consumer culture, Bacon continued to draw on the
profound legacy of dead white men.
</P>
<P>
   While other major artists were abandoning paint and canvas in
the 1970s, Bacon stuck to those basics.
</P>
<P>
   When Julian Schnabel, Georg Baselitz and other neoexpressionists
hit it big in the early '80s, Bacon maintained that his art wasn't
expressionist; it was realist.
</P>
<P>
   When artists started cooling down in the late '80s, they put
every other work under glass and invoked the detachment fostered by
television. Bacon put glass on his pictures so people could get
close to them without damaging them; and he employed massive gold
frames to invoke historic presentations of art.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the paradox intrinsic to the works themselves. Not
all are great paintings: Indeed, probably half of the images in
this exhibition seem glib, too suave by half. Almost all are truly
beautiful, though.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be? How can paintings of mangled faces, contorted
and dismembered bodies, and claustrophobic spaces be remotely
beautiful?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has to do with mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon would say his pictures were realistic _ maybe not
naturalistic, but realistic in an intensified way. He said his art
was about appearance and had nothing to offer about a subject's
psyche or spirit. He said he didn't spend time interpreting his
art, that there was nothing to interpret, no symbolism or mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But the mystery, the paradox, the ambiguity or whatever you want
to call it may come in with how strongly many of us believe that
Bacon had it wrong. There is more to reality than he perceived, and
there is more to his work than he intended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of his work appearing ruthlessly real, it acquires a
tragic and poignant dimension. Instead of stirring repugnance, it
elicits compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's vision may have been limited, but he communicated it
with a skill and often with a depth unmatched by many modern
artists. As such, it gives us much and rewards those of us willing
to be receptive.

LOOKING FOR ANTIQUES? FORNEY, NEAR DALLAS, IS THE PLACE TO GO
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by FORNEY-HOW TO) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORNEY, Texas _ The waitress looked perplexed; she wanted to
help, she really did. But no, she had no idea why there was a
miniature Statue of Liberty lighting the way into downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Paris,'' she offered, by way of explanation; Paris
is, after all, more than 100 miles away from the
just-east-of-Dallas burg of Forney. And then, after checking with
the kitchen staff: ``Nobody else knows why it's there, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame them. Nobody comes to Forney to look at the
Mini-Me Statue of Liberty, or, for that matter, at the giant carved
jack rabbit that looms over downtown, or even at the fancy
stone-and-wrought-iron fence that encloses the old city cemetery,
and which was brought to town from the Capitol grounds in Austin,
Texas, by former Gov. Bill Clements, who has family roots here.
</P>
<P>
   People come to Forney to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they come to Forney to shop for antiques; not for
nothing was the town proclaimed the Antiques Capital of Texas in
1987. Town officials claim there are more than 200 antiques shops
in the Forney area, a number impossible to verify but hard to
dispute, considering that each mall is home to dozens of vendors.
(If you're just counting buildings, however, the number seems
closer to 25.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest concentration of antiques in Texas,
probably in the whole country,'' said Glenn ``Red'' Whaley, who
started the whole thing in 1968 when he relocated his antiques shop
from Irving to Forney, on a stretch of land just north of U.S. 80.
He still presides over Red's Antiques, a warehouse stuffed with
rows of bronze statues, reproductions of French and American
antiques, paintings, cut glass, beveled mirrors, cement birdbaths,
and other odds and ends.
</P>
<P>
   If East Texas is well-stocked with antiques shops _ and it is,
from Gladewater to Jefferson _ Forney is the grand staging area,
the focal point of the bargain-hunter's pilgrimage. But the town of
5,500 got a relatively late start in the business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Whaley opened up shop, some didn't understand
exactly how he planned to make a living from selling a bunch of
other people's old stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all thought, `We don't want antiques, we live with that
stuff every day' '' said his son, Richard Whaley, who now runs his
own oversized antiques shop, Little Red's Antiques, in front of his
dad's. ``They didn't think Forney was big enough to support it, and
they didn't think anybody would come all the way out here to
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1973, Whaley's first business was successful enough that
he started building new warehouses for other vendors; Clements
Antiques, an established Dallas dealer, was the first to join him.
Others followed.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a veritable Euro Mall of antiques, with shopkeepers
from Holland, England and, of course, Texas, selling goods from
Belgium, France, England, Italy, Mexico and from all over the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for an oak roll-top desk in perfect condition? (Try the
Cotton Gin Antiques Mall near downtown, where such a desk was
listed at $3,950 earlier this month.)
</P>
<P>
   For a framed picture of Queen Elizabeth? (It's at Victory
Antiques on U.S. 80, a smallish store owned by recent transplants
from Sheffield, England. Their store is filled with tasteful
English chairs and tables, armoires and bureaus and old British
maps.)
</P>
<P>
   For a pair of 10-foot-tall carved wooden cowboys, sporting vests
worn over bare chests that make them look vaguely like giant
Village People? (Those are at DeRidder Antiques, also on U.S. 80.)
</P>
<P>
   DeRidder, like most of the other stores, is a compelling mixture
of the exquisite and the kitschy, genuine antiques and
mass-produced accessories. Its two huge warehouses are stuffed
floor to ceiling with buys: piles of carved wooden tulips,
crucifixes, tin lampshades, Coca-Cola signs, hand-woven baskets,
old suitcases, antique armoires, Turkish rugs, sleigh beds, Tiffany
lamps, wooden Buddhas, carved, painted pigs and Santa Clauses.
Overhead, the ceiling drips with old canoes, bicycles, paintings,
airplane propellers, cane snowshoes and anything else that can be
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores specialize in larger pieces, such as Clements',
where wealthy matrons wander, trailed by their designers, trying to
decide between the Asian-influenced buffet and the slightly subtler
English one. And others function more to sell collectibles, like
Snooper's Paradise, a U.S. 80 mall that offers pottery, cookie
jars, Depression glass, and salt and pepper shakers in addition to
its French and American furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback to Forney is that there's little else to do
besides shop. There is a handful of restaurants, a smattering of
stately Victorian homes (though none is open for tours except
during the every-other-year Christmas homes tour) and just one
motel, a relatively new Super 8. The town's only bed-and-breakfast
closed a couple of years ago and hasn't found new owners.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet, however, is in keeping with the town's humble roots.
Forney made its fortune first from cattle and hay and later from
cotton. The town at one time had eight cotton gins; one of the old
ones, a series of charming restored tin buildings, is home to the
Cotton Gin antiques mall and a newly opened children's clothing and
furniture store, Berkeley's Closet.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the area was allegedly known for jack rabbits, too,
though there's no sign of live ones now. The jack rabbit is still
the high school mascot and the namesake of the football stadium and
of the annual Jack Rabbit Stampede and Festival, a fall party built
around a bicycle race. (The race is Sept. 11, but the festival was
canceled this year.) There's even a jack rabbit flavor at the local
snow-cone stand, Kris' Hawaiian Ice on Broad Street downtown. (For
the curious, it's a combination of root beer and ice cream flavors;
you might be better off getting strawberry.)
</P>
<P>
   But nothing about the town is as hard to get a handle on as that
Statue of Liberty. Though a plaque at the brick plaza says
something about American Legion Post 591 and a December '86
dedication, nobody seems exactly sure why it's there _ not
waitresses, not mini-mart attendants, not the Chamber of Commerce.
Even Weldon Adams, proprietor of Forney Auto &AMP; Hardware for more
than 35 years, isn't sure, though he thinks antiques dealer Red
Whaley had something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Deep inside a thick book on Forney's history, on
display at a florist shop downtown, there's a reasonable
explanation. It seems that John Wein Forney, the railroad promoter
and journalist for whom the town was named, was a leader in helping
to raise money for the real Statue of Liberty in New York. Of
course! What a fitting tribute!
</P>
<P>
   But confronted with that theory, Red Whaley looks a little
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard that. I just thought it was beautiful, and I
thought it would be something beautiful for Forney,'' he explains,
confirming that he'd donated the statue years ago. Then he smiles;
the man knows what sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's a good story.''

<P>
   Robert K. Mueller of Lincoln, Mass., former chairman of the
board of directors of Arthur D. Little Inc., died Tuesday in
Suburban Manor in Acton, Mass. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mueller was chairman of the board of the Cambridge
consulting firm from 1977 until his retirement in 1986. He joined
the firm in 1968, becoming a vice president in 1973 and a director
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Arthur D. Little, he was a chemist at Sinclair
Refining Co. and a vice president of Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist on the government of corporations who lectured
internationally, at one time Mr. Mueller was a member of the board,
or an incorporator of 87 subsidiaries or affiliates of
international firms. He was the author of 18 books, including
``Behind the Boardroom Door,'' ``Board Life: Realities of Being a
Corporate Director,'' and ``Board Compass: What a Director Needs to
Know in a Changing World.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the Globe on May 29, 1977, he discussed
his philosophy of coporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sorts of legal, social and moral penalties hang over a
director when he accepts election to a board,'' he said. ``He has a
statutory fiduciary role. He has to perform in the interests of the
shareholder. He is legally liable.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet these responsibilities, he said, ``He must exercise
dilligence; attend meetings regularly, be familiar with the current
financial status of the corporation, give each problem presented to
the board his best judgment, make inquiries and suggestions and
register dissent for the record when he disagrees with the
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mueller was born in St. Louis. He graduated from Washington
University, earned a master's degree in chemical engineering at the
University of Michigan, and completed the advanced management
program at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, the former Jane Konesko; two daughters, Lucy
White of Northampton, Mass. and Patricia Hilpert of Dover, Mass.; a
son, James A. of White River Junction, Vt.; and three
grandchildren.

SALE WOULD STREAMLINE FASHION PRESS OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding; fashion, name of magazine, in 12th graf is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine one corporation controlling virtually every American
magazine. To the dismay of some, that's actually happening to the
fashion press.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. has agreed to sell its Fairchild
Publications subsidiary to Advance Publications, parent company of
archrival Conde Nast Publications, in a deal that could mean the
birth of a new fashion empire. Fairchild produces W and Jane
magazines and the influential trade publications Women's Wear Daily
and the Daily News Record, while Conde Nast's list includes Vogue,
GQ, Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed but previous reports put the
value at close to $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, subject to regulatory approval, will merge two of
fashion's most powerful publishers and assure Conde Nast virtual
control of industry coverage and a lion's share of fashion
advertising and readership. Indeed, Hearst Magazines' Harper's
Bazaar and Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines' Elle will be two of the
few national fashion titles to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months ending June 30, Vogue's paid circulation was
1.1 million, Mademoiselle's was 1.1 million and GQ's was 707,000,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. W's circulation was
412,000, it said.
</P>
<P>
   From January to July 1999, Vogue earned $85 million from its
advertising while W earned $46 million, according to the Publishers
Information Bureau. Industrywide, apparel and accessories
advertising totaled $536 million.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers might be offered package deals for placements in
several Conde Nast magazines at once, said Tom Julian, fashion
trend analyst for New York ad agency Fallon McElligott. So the
merger ``could be better for advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry is abuzz with concerns about objectivity
and preferential treatment. ``Why must a big conglomerate come in
and control everything?'' said Boston fashion photographer Elie,
whose work has appeared in W and GQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say blue is it this year, nobody is going to be able
to say otherwise. They can trash anyone. They can promote some
unknowns and not others. It's not fair. . . . It's better to have
more voices.''
</P>
<P>
   As a professional photographer, Elie has other concerns as well.
``It was always hard to break into (the Vogue level). . . . I
assume it will be even harder now. Photographers like Bruce Weber
will probably cover three magazines at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive, explained
the sale by saying in a statement that ``despite Fairchild's
strengths, Disney is focused on the long-term growth of our core
brands and entertainment assets.'' The Los Angelas Times reported
recently that Disney is looking to sell its Anaheim Angels baseball
and Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey franchises as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nash Yacoub, editor and publisher of the Boston-based fashion
magazine platinum, said consumers should expect ``bigger and
better'' from Conde Nast. ``I imagine that their editors in chief
will still maintain the identity of their magazines, since they
will all be competing against each other for newsstand sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston designers Alfred Fiandaca and David Josef contend that
the sale won't impact their lives much; the New York fashion press
is too subjective to be relevant anyway, they maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they love you, it's the greatest thing in the world,'' said
Josef. ``If they don't know you, you can't get any exposure. If
you're a young upstart in the business who is not wining and dining
the editors, it doesn't matter what you produce. It's all about who
they love and who they want to push.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fiandaca: ``I think the fashion press has always been
slanted and jaded. So what difference does it make who owns them. .
. . Vogue is a magazine that I would say for the past seven years
hasn't had a good slant on fashion. I don't think it's in touch
with fashion divas and it's not in touch with subway girls. Women's
Wear and W have the credibility and Vogue doesn't. Obviously, Conde
Nast felt they needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Calderin, an instructor of fashion design at Lasell College
and founder of Boston Fashion Week, said that regardless of Conde
Nast's growing stable of titles, it must still contend with a
larger threat: the Internet. ``Some of the most interesting things
going on in fashion media are not neccessarily coming out of those
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers are putting their collections on line, and you have
access to pictures that might not make it into Vogue . . . so you
can interpret collections yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magazines have gone the route of designers. Designers no
longer dictate. Designers have become a niche personality market.
And most of the magazines have become really specialized, too. The
reason to pick up Allure, for example, is beauty. Each magazine has
a focus and a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who have canceled tons of subscriptions of
magazines because they became useless after a while,'' said
Calderin. ``If you're really into fashion, you can become really
well-informed on the Internet _ for a fraction of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in response to this, Disney said in its announcement
that it will retain certain non-exclusive rights for its Internet
group to publish content from W, Jane, and Women's Wear Daily.
Disney and Advance also agreed to explore forming an Internet joint
venture.

FBI ADMITS FIRING INCENDIARY DEVICES AT WACO COMPOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Wire clients)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of denials, the FBI admitted Wednesday
that its agents fired two incendiary tear gas canisters on the last
day of the Branch Davidian siege that ended in a deadly inferno in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   However, bureau officials, who asked not to be named, maintained
that the agents did not start the fire that consumed the Branch
Davidian compound outside Waco, Texas, killing the group's leader
David Koresh and about 80 of his followers. The April 19, 1993,
blaze ended a 51-day siege that started when federal agents tried
to serve a warrant for Koresh's arrest on firearms and explosive
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here continues to be that the Davidians set
that fire and that law enforcement did not set that fire,'' said
one of the officials.
</P>
<P>
   He and another official said FBI agents did launch two military
tear gas canisters, but that these incendiary devices were fired
not at buildings in the Branch Davidian compound where people
lived, but at a bunker nearby. They said the canisters bounced off
the bunker's concrete roof but did not enter any structures.
</P>
<P>
   They added that the flammable canisters were fired around 6
a.m., nearly six hours before the fire that destroyed the compound
started. Other tear gas canisters used by federal agents throughout
the day were not flammable or potentially explosive, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the FBI and the Justice Department were
planning to release a statement confirming that incendiary tear gas
canisters were used.
</P>
<P>
   The admission came in response to a story about the devices in
Wednesday's Dallas Morning News. It represented a reversal from the
federal government's adamant, long-held position that the FBI used
no device capable of sparking a fire on the day the Branch Davidian
compound burned.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Danny Coulson, a former deputy director of
the agency, as saying that potentially flammable tear gas grenades
were fired into the bunker, an underground structure that had
tunnels leading to the compound's living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Coulson's statement marked the first time that a former or
current federal law enforcement official publicly acknowledged the
government's use of pyrotechnic devices during the siege. However,
Coulson, who also was founding commander of the FBI's hostage
rescue team, said the grenades played no role in starting the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, as the newspaper's report became public, the
U.S. Justice Department, the FBI's parent agency, began backing
away from the long-held denial.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Myron Marlin said then, ``We've seen the
reports that pyrotechnics may have been used, and we're trying to
get to the bottom of them.'' He declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the FBI confirmed that its agents did use the two
M-651 grenades on April 19th, 1993. Officials said they were fired
into a construction pit that contained the bunker. The officials
said the devices were fired at 6:07 a.m., just after tanks began
spraying tear gas into the compound. The M-651s were used because
nonpyrotechnic gas rounds known as ``ferrets'' were not adequately
penetrating the area, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began Feb. 28, 1993, when Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agents, trying to search the compound and
arrest Koresh on the weapons charges, engaged in a shootout with
Davidian sect members. Four BAFT agents were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward BAFT and FBI agents set up camp around the compound in
a standoff that ended seven weeks later after the government
launched its tear gas volleys and moved in the tanks to tear down
the sect's buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI officials said they were still trying to determine who
gave permission for members of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team at the
compound to use the devices and why their use was not revealed
before now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this didn't come up because it was at 6 in the morning,
six hours before the compound burned, and maybe it was because (the
grenades were) fired away from the (main buildings in the)
compound,'' one FBI official said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is sensitive because of a pending wrongful death
lawsuit against the government by surviving Davidians and families
of those who died. That suit is scheduled to go to trial in Waco in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials said they do not believe the use of the
devices will change official conclusions that the Branch Davidians
started the deadly fire that ended the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by a panel of independent arson experts
concluded that the April 19 fire began simultaneously just after
noon in three separate places inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   FBI bugs intercepted Branch Davidians' discussions of spreading
fuel and planning a blaze for hours before the compound burned.
Arson investigators also found evidence that accelerants, including
gasoline, charcoal lighter fluid and camp stove fuel, had been
poured in the compound.
</P>
<P>
   However, court and congressional records suggest that the arson
investigators' conclusion that the FBI's tear gas played no role in
the fire was partially based on the FBI's assurance that it used no
pyrotechnic devices on April 19.

TREASURIES RALLY ON PROSPECT THAT THE FED IS DONE RAISING RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities rallied Wednesday on the prospect
that the short-term interest rate increase announced by the Federal
Reserve on Tuesday could be the last of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Yields were down to a one-month low even after the government
reported Wednesday that July durable goods orders rose 3.3 percent,
far exceeding expectations. Combined with upward revisions to
already healthy results in May and June, orders have now risen for
three consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
   June existing home sales, which were also released Wednesday,
showed that the housing industry was still healthy, despite this
year's rise in mortgage rates. Although sales dipped slightly last
month, it was from a record in June. This and other economic data
continue to indicate that the economy may refuse to slow enough to
alleviate the Fed's concerns about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond was up 1 5/32, to 103 29/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.85 percent,
down from 5.93 percent on Tuesday and the lowest since 5.77 percent
on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts caution that Tuesday's neutral Fed statement still
left open the possibility of further increases if the economy does
not slow down enough to suit the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the current economic expansion began more than eight years
ago, the Fed has taken a neutral stance each time it raised rates,
including a string of increases in 1994 and early 1995, a single
quarter-point increase in 1997 and another last June. But that has
not prevented the Fed from raising interest rates at its next
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe, however, that the Fed might be leery
about raising rates at its next policy meeting on Oct. 5 because
that could add to market turmoil arising from the onset of Year
2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``Now that the much-heralded Fed tightening has become a
reality and passed on into the history books, market attention is
once again focused on the economic data.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the degree and direction of economic growth and the rate
of inflation would be the ``primary determinant'' of Fed policy
decisions between now and the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said the economy ``still has plenty of oomph that seems to
be supporting further increases in gas prices at the pump, an
inflation signal that should never be overlooked.'' And, he added,
``market observers certainly did not need a microscope to see the
strength in July durable goods orders.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fine said, investors seemed to be so comforted by the
Fed's statement on controlling inflation that they were
``impervious to strong economic news.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a two-year note auction that was not nearly as good as
hoped, analysts said, Treasuries were busy making fresh highs on
continued short covering and technical buying, which was the
catalyst behind the short covering.
</P>
<P>
   Government issues also received a little added boost from a $1.5
billion offering from Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in the morning that was
doubled as demand improved because of investor optimism that
another rate increase would not come this year.
</P>
<P>
   The offering by Wells Fargo, the seventh-largest U.S. banking
company, through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, was done in two parts, with $750 million of a
two-year floating rate note priced to yield 20 basis points more
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, and $750
million of a straight debt two-year note priced to yield 6.614
percent, or 91 basis points above a comparable Treasury security.
</P>
<P>
   The Wells Fargo sale attracted investors who were ready to buy
even though one of its competitors, Bank One Corp., warned
Wednesday that its 1999 earnings would be lower than analysts'
forecasts. In the improved environment after the Fed rate action,
more new corporate issues could follow. Still expected this week is
a $1.5 billion to $2 billion deal by Tyco International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes, the
securities were awarded at a high yield of 5.557 percent, which was
near the low end of Wednesday's range in when-issued trading. The
bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with the total
amount being sold, was considered low at 1.87 to 1, the third
lowest this year.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How to get there: Forney is about 12 miles east of downtown
Dallas on U.S. 80.
</P>
<P>
   Why go: It's the unofficial _ and, since 1987, official _
Antiques Capital of Texas, with more than 20 antiques malls and
shops, selling everything from Depression-era glassware to $7,000
18th-century English armoires to $250 reproduction French night
stands to $20 plastic Urkel dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way: Warm up for the shop-a-thon by stopping at the
Jot 'Em Down Store in Sunnyvale, about five minutes west of Forney.
At 100,000 square feet, and including a newly opened hardware
section selling reproduction parts and refinishing materials, it
claims to be the state's biggest antiques store, a claim we're not
inclined to dispute. Info: (972) 226-0974.
</P>
<P>
   When to go: Shops are generally open from 9 or 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily year-round; a few close on Sunday and others on random days.
Be forewarned: Many of the larger warehouses are not
air-conditioned, and they can get broiling hot in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the kids?: At your own risk. They'll probably get bored
fast, as there's not much geared toward them. And the displays they
``will'' like _ antique toys, carved merry-go-round animals _
aren't intended to be played with.
</P>
<P>
   Snack break: Locals swear by the chicken-fried steak and the pie
at Gossett's Kountry Kitchen downtown; for about $5, you can get a
good burger, order of fries and a soft drink at Ernie's Restaurant.
Despite all the antiques shops, there's but one tearoom, inside
Memories Etc. in the antiques strip on U.S. 80; it serves
sandwiches, soups and salads, but it's closed Tuesdays and
Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Special events: More than 500 bike riders descend on the town
for the annual Jack Rabbit Stampede, scheduled for Sept. 11. The
Candlelight Christmas Tour of Homes in December allows a peek at a
church and six historic homes, from Victorian to prairie-style, all
decked out for the holidays. It's $8 for adults, $5 for senior
citizens, $3 for children; it's 5-9 p.m. Dec. 11, and 2-6 p.m. Dec.
12. Tickets are at Bow Wood Florist, (972) 564-1071.
</P>
<P>
   More info: Call the Forney Area Chamber of Commerce, (972)
564-2233.

IN MEDITERRANEAN PARADISE IT'S EASY TO FORGET U.S. POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ To paraphrase Shakespeare, a politician
would, by any other name, smell as sweet or as or sour.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on the hypnotic shores of the Mediterranean, where
America's presidential race is not a matter of great interest,
names that we associate with the quest for the presidency retain
their original meaning.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bush is a shrub that grows in a garden or sprouts
up in a lonely field. A dole is the English equivalent of America's
welfare system. A bauer, when it is spelled bower, is a playing
card. A gore is a wound a ferocious bull tries to inflict on a
matador. A quayle, or quail, is a bird that hunters flush from the
underbrush and shoot from the sky. A hatch is a door on a sailing
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes. One person's bush is another's presidential hopeful.
People in the exotic lands bordering the Mediterranean appear to
have little interest or understanding of the strange, colorful
drama that has begun in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Americans, who are inundated with news and questions
about the likes of George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole, Gary Bauer, Al
Gore, Dan Quayle and Orrin Hatch, they are unconcerned with the
political fate of the men and one woman who aspire to live in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if they read the International Herald-Tribune or watch CNN,
as touring Americans do, they might ask questions similar to those
that fill our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Did the dashing governor of Texas comport himself in an
irresponsible and possibly illegal manner during the days of his
wild youth? If so, why won't he discuss those actions in detail or
explain more fully his positions and policies on key public issues?
</P>
<P>
   Will the bubbly woman who used to head the American Red Cross
and two Cabinet agencies and who also is the wife of unsuccessful
1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, make it to the GOP
finish line in Philadelphia next July? Will she win a place on her
party's presidential ticket?
</P>
<P>
   Will Gary Bauer be able to parley his support among religious
rightwingers into something more than a third- or fourth-place
showing in the primaries?
</P>
<P>
   Will Al Gore overcome his unjust reputation as the dullest
presidential hopeful since Herbert Hoover and excite the electorate
with his knowledge of issues and plans for dealing with them?
</P>
<P>
   Will Quayle, the former vice president who placed eighth in the
much-touted but highly overrated Iowa straw poll, soon follow Lamar
Alexander and John Kasich into oblivion as a disappointed former
presidential contender?
</P>
<P>
   Will Orrin Hatch be able to project his status as one of the
pillars of the Senate into something more than an also-ran status?
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens of Tangier in Morocco may recognize the name of
Malcolm Forbes Jr. because his late father owned a showplace home
near the casbah there. The name of Bill Bradley may mean something
to sports enthusiasts because of his long-ago prowess on the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that not many individuals, including American
tourists, show great interest in the presidential battle back home.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from all over the world demonstrate far more interest
in the great cathedrals, the mighty forts, the architectural gems
that are a legacy of the Moorish influence on Spain and Portugal
and the many shops filled with colorful products and equally
colorful entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, which once stagnated under the iron rule of Generalissimo
Francisco Franco, now appears to be flourishing as a democracy and
a member of NATO. A similar situation exists in Portugal, which
began to enjoy a new birth of freedom when dictator Antonio Salazar
was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Gibralter, a last vestige of an empire that once stretched
around the world, is still an imposing symbol of Britain's long-ago
presence in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   In the cathedral of the majestic city of Seville, tourists can
gaze in awe at the tomb that supposedly holds the remains of the
intrepid navigator who first charted the route across the Atlantic
from the old world to the new: Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca, a handsome Moroccan city on the Atlantic, bears
little, if any, resemblance to the set created on the Warner
Brothers lot in Hollywood nearly six decades ago for the immortal
story of love and wartime intrigue that starred Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Malaga, Almeria, Mallorca and Menorca are delightful ports on
the Costa del Sol. All are bustling modern communities steeped in
the legends and deeds of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But none is more fascinating than Barcelona, the great trading
center that boasts a fabulous heritage and has in the past been a
creative home to such artists as Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and
Joan Miro and cellist Pablo Casals.
</P>
<P>
   Festooned with sycamore trees and brilliant oleander and
bougainvillea blossoms, Barcelona contains one of the world's most
stunning architectural masterpieces, Antoni Gaudi's Church of the
Sagrada Familia. This elegant city is alive with the activities of
the '90s while proudly protecting a past that reaches back to the
pre-Christian era.
</P>
<P>
   It is refreshing to view ancient cultures that have kept up with
the times and vibrate with modernity. It also is refreshing to
escape for a short period the obsession with a presidential race
that will not reach its climax until November 2000.

Supervisor is Pat Ryan (888-346-9867).

<P>
   KOSOVO-COUNCIL (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ As more and more Serbs
leave Kosovo, the U.N. special representative in Kosovo, Bernard
Kouchner, has come under strong pressure from local Serb leaders to
consider the effective partition of the war-torn province. Kouchner
ruled out the idea at a tumultuous meeting with local Albanian and
Serb leaders on Wednesday. Yet in the face of the continuing
security problems for minorities in Kosovo, he has had to concede
the possibility of moving Serbs into ghettos for their own
protection. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-DEBT (Tokyo) _ One of the striking paradoxes of Japan is
that this is a country with the greatest savers in the
industrialized world, and yet everywhere one looks there is debt.
The debt situation is now so precarious that there are growing
doubts about how long Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi can continue to
spend furiously in hopes of reviving the economy. By Sheryl WuDunn
and Nicholas D. Kristof. 1,800 words.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   TROOP-WITHDRAWAL (Washington) _ Under pressure from the Pentagon
and Republicans in Congress to reduce military commitments
overseas, the Clinton administration plans to withdraw the last 400
U.S. troops stationed in Haiti, even though peace there remains
tenuous at best. The Pentagon is also pushing for other troop
reductions, including a sharp cut in Americans in Bosnia and a
pullout from the U.N. mission in the Sinai. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-DRUGS (Miami) _ The smugglers moved with ease through
Miami International Airport and even made their way onto American
Airlines planes parked at the gates, stashing heroin in coffee
containers and hiding cocaine and marijuana in suitcases in the
jets' baggage holds. Investigators say the smugglers did not worry
about being caught by the airline. They were the airline. In a
sting operation that exposed embarrassing security lapses, federal
agents arrested more than 50 American Airlines baggage handlers and
food contract workers, charging them in multiple indictments of
drug and weapons trafficking. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ERITREA-WOMEN-SOLDIERS (On the Badme Plain, Eritrea) _ Eritirea
is one of the few nations in the world where women fight
side-by-side with men, and in the 15-month war against Ethiopia,
they have killed and been killed like any other soldiers. There is
no novelty to it. In fact, some of them have powerful role models
in making war: Their own mothers, who fought in the 30-year war for
independence from Ethiopia. ``My mother said, `I am really proud of
you,''' said Yordanos Tekeste, a 21-year-old artillery-woman whose
mother and father were both soldiers in the war for independence.
By Ian Fisher. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   With photo and map.
</P>
<P>
   GAY-LAWMAKER (Phoenix) _ By his own account, Stephen May knew
from the time he was a young teen-ager that he wanted to be a
politician, more specifically, a conservative Republican
politician. And everything seemed to be going just right after he
was elected last November, at the tender age of 26, to the Arizona
state legislature. Then earlier this year, May angrily spoke his
mind, this time not as a Republican, a Mormon, or a soldier _ but
as an openly gay man. His denunciation of an anti-gay bill and its
right-wing sponsor triggered one of the more unusual investigations
under President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy towards
gays in the military, and it now appears likely that May will be
discharged from the Army Reserve. By James Sterngold. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-FIRES (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Hundreds of man-made
wildfires are burning again in remote areas of Indonesia,
blackening vast areas of rain forest and sending a fog of pungent
smoke across parts of several nations. By Seth Mydans. 600 words.
</P>
<P>
   With map.

</P>
<P>
   OHIO-SCHOOL-VOUCHERS (Cleveland) _ In Cleveland on first day of
school when thousands of children had no school to go to because a
federal judge blocked a voucher program that would have sent them
to private, mostly religious, schools. By Dirk Johnson.

   FBN-COWBOYS-OFFENSE _ WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys have
never been judged accurately by preseason nonsense, a fact any
football nut memorized long ago, according to one of the NFL's
brightest stars. Why should this year be any different? The summer
is a time for experimenting with new players, new schemes, Troy
Aikman said. Mistakes in July and August have no relevance to what
will happen during the season. ``I can't spell it out any clearer
than that,'' Aikman told a reporter, apparently agitated by another
inquiry about the offense. ``If you don't understand that, you
shouldn't be covering the game.'' Aikman's classless response is a
slap at anyone who has seen the Cowboys and believes they are not
remotely close to being ready for their Sept. 12 opener in
Washington. (Cantu, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   FBN-BENGALS-SMITH _ GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ Something magical must be
happening to the Bengals because something mystical already has. On
quarterback Akili Smith's first trip to Cincinnati _ April 9, 1999
_ a tornado struck the city. When he arrived to sign a 7-year, $56
million contract on Tuesday, rain drenched this sleepy Kentucky
town for the first time since Aug. 1. The Bengals waited 25 days
through drought conditions for their football savior to arrive at
training camp. When the big day finally came, they had to wait some
more as lightning delayed the start of practice by a half hour.
Even the sky cried tears of joy when the No. 1 draft pick finally
ended his holdout. Just call this former University of Oregon
touchdown passing machine ``The Rainmaker.'' (Ludwig, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

   FBC-NEW-COACHES _ Resurrecting a struggling program can be a
hairy experience for a new coaching staff, more at some schools
than others. Three coaches are undertaking the task this year in
the Big 12. Two _ Bob Stoops at Oklahoma and Gary Barnett at
Colorado _ are trying to recapture past glory. Then there's Kevin
Steele at Baylor, trying for starters to simply reacquaint the
Bears with some degree of consistent success after the disastrous
two-year reign of Dave Roberts. (Riggs, Austin American-Statesman).

<P>
   FBC-DUKE-PREVIEW _ The Road to College Football travels to Duke,

in the past four seasons. (Arey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

<P>
   FBC-UTEXAS-NUNEZ _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Rocky Mountains called
Ryan Nunez's name in 1996. He wishes now he hadn't answered. Nunez,
projected as the University of Texas' starting split end this
season, committed to the Longhorns in 1996 after a standout high
school career. He abruptly changed his mind about Texas, though,
and signed with Colorado. After an uneventful freshman season in
which he played in all 11 games, he transferred to Texas and sat
out his sophomore year. (Estwick, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

MENDING AMERICA'S ACROPOLIS, THE MISSION SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. _ Perched on a scaffold five stories
above the ground, Gerald J. Miller surveys the crumbling mortar and
flaking brick, the jagged six-inch cracks and the scars of
swallows' nests dotting the underside of a sagging stone dome, and
marvels aloud, ``You wonder what the hell is holding this up.''
Quickly and ruefully, he answers himself, ``It's held up by faith
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the administrator of Mission San Juan Capistrano, the
landmark relic long known as the jewel of California's 21
Spanish-Colonial missions, and it is his job to make sure that what
he calls ``the most important ruin in North America'' is soon held
up by a whole lot more. For the last six years, this former
investment banker has overseen an ambitious conservation plan
budgeted at almost $10 million and aimed at stabilizing and
preserving the remnants of the mission's Great Stone Church, which
was finished in 1806 and destroyed just six years later by an
earthquake that killed 40 worshipers in the middle of a morning
mass.

<P>
   Since then, the fragmented walls of what was once the largest
stone building west of the Mississippi River, have stood in
romantic decrepitude, ravaged by weather, scavenged by vandals,
invaded by vines, yet luring artists, students, tourists and _ like
clockwork each spring _ the flocks of cliff swallows immortalized
in Leon Rene's 1939 standard, ``When the Swallows Come Back to
Capistrano.'' (``That's the day you promised to come back to me.'')
</P>
<P>
   Largely ignored for much of the 19th century, in which their
ownership was ceded for a time to private landlords, the California
missions and their accompanying myths were revived in the 1880s
when Helen Hunt Jackson published her sentimental mission novel
``Ramona,'' and Protestant real estate boosters appropriated the
string of outposts that stretch from San Diego to Sonoma County as
symbols of the state's storied past. Over the next 50 years,
countless numbers of public buildings in the Golden State, from
churches, to train stations and post offices, were built in one
mission motif or another, and the style's ersatz echoes are seen in
the suburban shopping malls of today.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, the missions have alternately been celebrated
as the high-water mark of Spanish civilization in the New World and
condemned as the apogee of 18th-century cultural imperialism, in
which tens of thousands of Native Americans, pressed into the
service of crown and church, were decimated by European diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, a lot of people are very hostile to the missions,
because I think they ascribe a level of intent to the padres about
the absolutely devastating effects of Spanish diseases and a sort
of anthropological obtuseness,'' said Kevin Starr, the state
librarian of California. ``On the other hand, the missions do have
a spell, a hold, over California, and today as we become
increasingly a Latin or a Spanish nation again, we begin to
appreciate Spanish history as part of our history. The missions in
that way are emblems of the future.''
   San Juan Capistrano was in its heyday among the most successful
outposts in the chain. Its surviving chapel, named for the chain's
founder Father Junipero Serra, dates to 1777 and is the oldest
building in California. Even now, 500,000 visitors a year make the
mission Orange County's third most-popular destination, after
Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, though tourists have long been
banned from standing under the ruined dome for safety's sake.
</P>
<P>
   But about a decade ago, it became clear that the site that
former Gov. Pete Wilson of California called the American Acropolis
could not survive without a major effort. Miller arrived in 1992 to
help the nonprofit organization that runs the mission figure out
how to repay an earlier $3 million bank loan used for seismic
retrofitting of the mission's intact cloister and restoration of
the Serra Chapel, which had survived only because a 19th-century
secular owner used it to store hay and so kept its roof in good
repair. The Roman Catholic Church still owns the land under the
mission but gives it no financial support, concentrating instead on
ministering to the social needs of its parishioners. Mission
officials say it is simpler for them to raise money from donors who
may not want financial ties to organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I might be here three to six months,'' Miller, who
courted his wife, Elizabeth, in the mission ruins years ago, said
the other day. ``So here I am, six and a half years later. It
became to me like a tar baby.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, financed by $600,000 in private contributions, work
began on the most daunting job yet: stabilization of the sanctuary
dome, one of seven that once topped the big church, but is now
riddled with cracks. The dome lists down toward the ruins of the
nave below, and the scaffolding that has laced inside it for nearly
a decade deters even the swallows from nesting.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1890s, an early group of mission preservationists known
as the Landmarks Club buttressed the church's surviving structures
with poured concrete cornerstones and metal rods called turnbuckles
that held the remaining walls together like a house of cards. But
those efforts have outlived their time; the threads on the
turnbuckles are stripped, and walls, made of locally fired bricks
that never quite finished baking inside, are crumbling from within
and weakened by creeping vines that have left massive root balls
the size of a six-foot man.
</P>
<P>
   So the conservation team of John C. Loomis, an architect from
nearby Newport Beach, and Nels Roselund, a structural engineer in
South San Gabriel, near Pasadena, have been forced to devise new
and creative approaches, not to rebuild the structure, but to
preserve it as the ghostly ruin it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no handbook for how to do this,'' said Roselund.
</P>
<P>
   To hold the dome together, masons will attach high-strength
steel rods in a square linking the three walls surrounding the
ruined altar, and then at each corner, dozens of smaller steel rods
will be embedded in cone-shaped patterns into the curving dome
above, like mollies in a wall. Traditional high-speed drills and
water would turn the walls to mush and cannot be used. Instead, the
construction team will have to use a slow-speed, diamond bit drill.
At the same time, conservationists working with infrared lights
have been striving to find and preserve remnants of decorative
floral motifs painted on the dome's plaster lining, some depicting
native plants and vines. They were painted by San Juaneno Indian
craftsmen in collaboration with the church's master builder, a
Mexican stone mason named Isidro Aguilar, who died part way through
the construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to really respect what Native Americans did 200
years ago, because this thing was amazing,'' Loomis said. ``Anyone
who thinks that this collapsed because it wasn't well built is
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is that the church walls, faced in a soft
fieldstone called volcanic tuff, were supposed to be covered with
plaster and protected by a roof that has been gone for nearly 200
years. The first stage of the conservation was intended to address
such damage. This phase, costing $1.8 million, stabilized the
almost freestanding walls of the long nave by embedding a flexible
column of reinforced, non-crumbly concrete around a core of
epoxy-coated steel in the east wall.
</P>
<P>
   This sturdy new internal buttress, built in links from the top
down like a spine, is masked from view by a new pilaster carved in
a soft Mexican stone that mimics the originals nearby, and a
protective coating of lead covers the jagged tops of the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like we did anything, right?'' Miller says
proudly. ``That's the idea.''

   This month, the project received a $1 million state grant, the
first public funds appropriated for the mission, and that money and
more than $5 million more is needed to finish all that Miller has
in mind, including restoring the dome and sacristy that adjoin the
main church and stabilizing the campanario, or bell wall, where the

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The fighting in Dagestan, in the Russian Caucasus,
appeared to be over Wednesday as federal troops raised the Russian
flag over mountain villages seized three weeks ago by Islamic
militants who had crossed the border from Chechnya, the
secessionist republic to the west.
</P>
<P>
   But even Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev was reluctant to declare
victory in Russia's first military conflict since the 1994-96
Chechnya war, which weakened Moscow's control over the volatile
region and gave rise to a militant brand of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said Wednesday that while federal forces, relying
heavily on air strikes, had driven the rebels from the Botlikh
district in Dagestan, the threat posed by the Islamic militants
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a danger that in moving to partisan actions, they
will try to carry out terrorist acts in the region,'' Sergeyev said
in an interview with Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were led by a Chechen field commander, Shamil
Basayev, and Wednesday night a spokesman for Basayev said the
militants were preparing for a clandestine phase in their fight to
free Dagestan from Russian rule. Basayev, who is now presumed to
have returned to Chechnya, announced three days ago that he was
withdrawing his commandos from Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be everywhere and nowhere,'' the rebel spokesman,
Magomed Tagayev, said of the militants, according to a report by
the Interfax news agency. ``Purely military methods will give way
to military-political ones.''
</P>
<P>
   By pushing the Islamic militants into Chechnya, Russian military
commanders were able to deliver on a promise made by the new prime
minister, Vladimir V. Putin, a tough-talking former KGB officer who
said when he took office on Aug. 9 that the operation in Dagestan
would be over in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Russian goal was to crush the rebels, that has yet to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basayev walked away,'' noted Aleksandr Iskandarian, director
of the Center for Caucasian Studies in Moscow. How damaged
Basayev's forces were by the fighting is one of the many questions
that remain unanswered after a war that has been marked by
conflicting reports from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the war in Chechnya, which ended in a humiliating defeat
for Russian forces, the operation in Dagestan had broad political
and popular support in Russia, even in Dagestan, a province the
size of Austria and home to more than 30 ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main difference is that the Chechens were fighting for
independence,'' said Aleksei Malashenko, an expert on the North
Caucasus at the Moscow office of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. ``The Dagestanis don't want independence. They
are a multiethnic, multinational society. For them, a struggle for
independence means civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the rebels were reportedly Dagestani, Basayev's
commandos did not get any significant support from the local
population around Botlikh. His declaration of an independent
Islamic state in the early days of the fighting seemed to fall on
deaf ears, as hundreds of Dagestani men lined up to collect weapons
distributed by local authorities, ready to join the fight against
the Chechen-led militants.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the battle was waged by Russian military forces,
which continued to fly fresh troops into the region as late as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Casualty reports were conflicting. Russian military spokesmen
put Russia's losses at 59 dead and 210 wounded, while reporting
that more than 1,000 rebels had been killed. Rebel spokesman said
they had lost 37 men, while reporting that Russian losses were over
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Chechnya, where Russian planes bombed the civilian
population, including Grozny, the capital, killing tens of
thousands, the casualties in this war were limited to combatants.
Residents of most of the embattled villages fled or were evacuated
early in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the day of Aug. 24, all villages seized by the
rebels were liberated and handed over to local administrations,'' a
Defense Ministry spokesman said Wednesday in Makhachkala, the
provincial capital. ``The remains of bandit units are trying to
flee the region in small isolated groups.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last days, two villages were completely leveled by air
strikes and artillery fire, the spokesman said. ``The two hamlets
were unfortunate to be situated on top of the hills overlooking the
area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In mounting what Russian military commanders said was a
well-armed campaign that had been prepared for months, Basayev,
backed by a Jordanian-born guerrilla of Chechen descent who goes by
the name Khattab, said his goal was to establish an independent
Islamic state, linking Chechnya to the oil-rich Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the 1994-96 war, Chechnya has slipped out of
Moscow's control, sinking deeper into poverty and lawlessness. Its
president, Aslan Maskhadov, struggles to defend his own authority
against challenges from warlords like Basayev.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say Basayev, seen at home as a hero of the earlier
war, may have intervened in Dagestan to raise his profile and
re-establish his credentials as a fearless warrior against Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he succeeds will depend not on the real outcome of the
conflict but on the propaganda war he is able to wage within
Chechnya,'' Iskandarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, who distanced himself from the Dagestani operation,
may end up benefiting from Basayev's withdrawal from Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The open-ended fight against Islamic fundamentalism is also
politically useful to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very convenient for the Kremlin to show the danger
coming from Chechnya, to show Dagestani officials that they have to
stay close to Moscow,'' said Malashenko, of the Carnegie office.
``From that point of view, Moscow is interested in maintaining a
kind of tension in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   But the key issue for Moscow remains its ability to restore
stability and prosperity to a region that has been torn apart by
war and neglected by Russia's own enfeebled government. The
challenge remains particularly acute in Dagestan, where local
authorities are notoriously corrupt and the people increasingly
open to the hopes held out by Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political role of Islam will increase,'' said Malashenko.
``It doesn't mean that will explode into a struggle for
independence, but people will begin to think in terms of Islamic
alternatives.''

COMMENTARY: A NATION LOOSENING ITS BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Words in boldface in 12th graf are in italics.) 
(jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the bitter cold of a January day in 1961, with snow on the
ground and a crystalline sky overhead, a day on which the world's
most powerful men were dressed in morning coats and top hats, a
young president declared that the ``torch has been passed to a new
generation of Americans,'' and he urged his fellow citizens, the
young in particular, to join with him in the great work of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   You could still talk like that in 1961. Idealism had not yet
suffered the near-fatal wounds of the decades that followed. An
awful lot of people, young and old, found themselves responding as
John F. Kennedy said, ``With a good conscience our only sure
reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth
to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but
knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Kennedy drew a whole generation to public service,'' said
Patricia McGinnis, who heads the Council for Excellence in
government, a nonpartisan group in Washington that works to improve
the quality of government and the relationship between government
and the people it serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kennedy encouraged people to participate, and I
think that was his greatest legacy,'' she said. ``Where is that
leadership now?''
</P>
<P>
   A national poll sponsored by the council and released last month
found that a large majority of Americans now feel disconnected from
government. And in what appears to be an ominous trend, it's the
younger Americans who feel the most estranged.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Democratic pollster Peter Hart and
Republican pollster Robert Teeter. It found that more than twice as
many Americans (64 percent) feel ``distant and disconnected'' from
government than feel ``close and connected'' (30 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Americans for the most part view government, especially the
federal government, as remote and far more responsive to special
interests than to the public interest. And the scandals that have
erupted around one top official after another _ from Watergate to
Monicagate and beyond _ have further turned people off.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hart: ``Voters see all of the transgressions or supposed
transgressions going on in political life and they say, `Why should
I participate?'''
</P>
<P>
   What is most pronounced in the poll is the degree to which
younger Americans feel out of touch with the government. A report
that accompanied the poll said, ``(The) gulf between the citizens
and their government grows larger with each successive
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lowest age group surveyed, 18 to 34 years old, 68 percent
of the respondents said they felt disconnected from government.
</P>
<P>
   The authors warned: ``If each new generation continued to form a
weaker attachment to government than the one before, the country
would fairly soon find that only a small minority of citizens was
connected to and involved with government.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is titled ``America Unplugged _ Citizens and Their
government.'' It found that a majority of Americans tend to think
in terms of  &UR; the &LR;  government as opposed to  &UR; our &LR;  government, and
said: ``To talk about government as ``ours'' is to state _ even if
unconsciously _ a sense of ownership, and perhaps also a sense of
belonging or involvement. People who think in terms of  &UR; the &LR; 
government, by contrast, are revealing their feeling that
government is not accountable to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over several decades in this century Americans were drawn into
closer contact with the government, and to a certain extent each
other, by major crises, including two world wars and a Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government was very important to people,'' said Teeter.
``Almost anything people wanted, whether it was the civil rights
movement or the environmental movement or whatever, government was
what they turned to as the vehicle to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no sense of crisis at the moment. The economy is
humming, the stock markets are high and inflation is low. But there
is more to the life of a great nation than the bottom line. We have
shown that we can be prosperous, but it's hard to imagine how we
can be better without more citizen involvement in what John Kennedy
saw as a great and joint endeavor.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MENDOZA, Argentina _ The sound of tractors and earth-levelers
can be heard virtually all around the once-sleepy town of
Tupungato, a traditional walnut-growing area nestled in the
foothills of the Andes near the Argentine city of Mendoza.
 &HT;    Where the machines have finished their work, laborers are busy
sinking stakes and tending wires. On other properties, that job has
been completed and the owners are more concerned about eradicating
the ants that have been the first to profit from the sea of vines
covering the region.
 &HT;    While the workers are mainly Argentine, many bused in from the
country's northern provinces because of a growing shortage of
locals, the owners of these newly bustling properties are truly
international. Chandon, one of France's great champagne producers,
is already harvesting grapes in a 300-hectare strip of land that
stretches from the town's main highway to the horizon. Dutch,
Italian, Spanish, Chilean and U.S. investors have also flocked to
the area in the last four years.
 &HT;    Argentina is already the world's fourth-largest wine producer
after Italy, France and Spain. But it is the country's coming of
age as a fine wine producer that has made Tupungato and neighboring
Tunuyan the hottest properties in Latin American wine.
 &HT;    With Argentine wine consumption down by more than 50 percent
since 1972, the emphasis has turned to higher quality exports,
which have soared from $19 million in 1995 to $103 million last
year. As a result, the best grapes today trade at a considerable
premium.
 &HT;    ``A few years ago, there was not much difference in price
between ordinary grapes and fine varieties,'' explains Miguel
Gibson, estate manager for los Montes Negros, just one of the newly
established local vineyards. ``But you could get four times the
more common grapes from the same land.'' According to Gibson, the
emphasis on quality means the finest varieties fetch more than $100
for 100 kilograms of grapes, compared with less than $15 for their
lowlier cousins.
 &HT;    Within this newly accentuated hierarchy, Tupungato's unique
agricultural conditions make its grapes the most highly prized. For
one thing, the area's poor soil makes its vines work harder, which
translates into lower yields but higher quality. The fast-draining
sandy soil is also good for the root of the vine. For reds, the
rocks and stones that litter the surface favor production because
they heat up during the day and continue to release heat throughout
the night, which helps to prevent the fruit from catching a chill.
 &HT;    But perhaps the area's major attraction is its location, which,
at slightly over 1,000 meters above sea level, is considerably
higher than traditional wine-growing areas. At such altitudes,
there is a variation between daytime and nocturnal temperatures of
as much as 20 degrees, key to producing a grape with a fine
bouquet, natural acidity and tannins that make the wines linger on
the palate.
 &HT;    Indeed, the thirst for property in Tupungato has pushed prices
through the roof. Land that was changing hands for as little as
$150 a hectare four years ago is now worth as much as $8,000 a
hectare _ if you can find it. ``All the land has been sold. There
is nothing left,'' Gibson says with a shrug. ``In 1995, nobody
imagined it. The land was worth nothing.''
 &HT;    But acquiring the land is just the start. ``It's not enough to
buy it, you have to fix it up,'' says Ricardo Reina, another local
grower. He reckons that costs, including planting, machinery and
raising the vines for three years before production starts, add
another $30,000 a hectare.
 &HT;    While many of the landowners are neophytes who have plowed their
money into the land as a simple investment, others have
considerable experience in identifying top wine-producing country.
These include several French chateaux as well as Kendall Jackson,
one of the top U.S. producers.
 &HT;    But experience isn't everything. Many locals believe Kendall
Jackson may have been poorly advised in acquiring some of the
highest land in the district _ at 1,400 meters above sea level _
with little water.
 &HT;    The Chileans, who have built their own successful wine industry
over the last decade, have also been tempted across the Andes. They
are led by Santa Carolina, which has acquired more than 1,000
hectares, while other major wineries such as Santa Rita and Concha
y Toro have bought smaller plots at around 150 hectares each.
 &HT;    Although Chile has a longer international track record, such
purchases bolster Argentines' belief that their wines will
eventually be recognized as clearly superior to those of their
neighbors. While the Argentine side of the Andes suffers hailstorms
that can wreak havoc with the harvest, it has the advantages of a
greater variation in temperatures and less rain, as well as simply
having more land suitable for producing fine grapes.
 &HT;    After initial problems with exports of highly variable quality,
the Argentines also seem to have sorted out their marketing efforts
and their wines already ship at a higher average price per bottle
than Chile's. ``The Chileans positioned themselves at the low end
of the market and they're having difficulty moving up,'' sums up
Carlos Bassos, one of the owners of los Montes Negros.
 &HT;    Local producer Reina expects Tupungato to eventually become one
of the world's great wine-producing areas. He compares it to the
discovery of the Napa Valley in the 1960s, as growers moved uphill
from the San Joaquin Valley, which produced table grapes. He
contends that Argentina already produces a fair vintage. ``But
these will be better,'' he boasts, surveying his newly planted
vineyards. ``These will be highest-quality wines.''
 &HT;    Only time will tell if he's right.

 &HT;    MENDOZA, Argentina _ The sound of tractors and earth-levelers
can be heard virtually all around the once-sleepy town of
Tupungato, a traditional walnut-growing area nestled in the
foothills of the Andes near the Argentine city of Mendoza.
 &HT;    Where the machines have finished their work, laborers are busy
sinking stakes and tending wires. On other properties, that job has
been completed and the owners are more concerned about eradicating
the ants that have been the first to profit from the sea of vines
covering the region.
 &HT;    While the workers are mainly Argentine, many bused in from the
country's northern provinces because of a growing shortage of
locals, the owners of these newly bustling properties are truly
international. Chandon, one of France's great champagne producers,
is already harvesting grapes in a 300-hectare strip of land that
stretches from the town's main highway to the horizon. Dutch,
Italian, Spanish, Chilean and U.S. investors have also flocked to
the area in the last four years.
 &HT;    Argentina is already the world's fourth-largest wine producer
after Italy, France and Spain. But it is the country's coming of
age as a fine wine producer that has made Tupungato and neighboring
Tunuyan the hottest properties in Latin American wine.

BANKING SCANDALS IN THAILAND AND INDONESIA SAID LIKELY TO WORSEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Banking scandals have rippled across Indonesia and
Thailand this month, and bankers and securities analysts predict
that they are likely to worsen, intensifying pressure on the two
countries' governments and providing a growing source of
consternation to lenders at the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai central bank, after providing 185 billion baht ($4.83
billion) to the country's second-largest financial institution,
Krung Thai Bank, this week dismissed all but one of Krung Thai's
board members amid disagreement over how to proceed with its
rescue. There have been accusations of mismanagement in a scandal
that has involved the country's finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, officials prepared to expand an investigation of
questionable payments by Bank Bali to include that country's
central bank, after an IMF request that they do so. The Bank Bali
scandal has involved Indonesia's president and his brother and
provoked calls for the resignation of the nation's top financial
officials.
</P>
<P>
   IMF and World Bank officials have sounded stern warnings that
Indonesia needed to clear up the Bank Bali mess expeditiously. On
Tuesday, the World Bank's country director, Mark Baird, said it
would be difficult to continue providing funds if Indonesia did not
resolve the case to its satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's Asia-Pacific director, Hubert Neiss, said in Jakarta
on Wednesday that a lingering scandal could be ``a disaster
scenario.'' He declined to speculate further or in any detail at
this stage.
</P>
<P>
   But bankers who have weathered the Southeast Asian financial
crisis of the last couple of years said that further disclosures of
questionable transactions and misconduct may be inevitable as
regulators go through the painstaking process of restructuring
banks and uncovering years of mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tip of the iceberg'' is what Akio Takeuchi, general manager
for Southeast Asia for Fuji Bank of Japan calls the current state
of events in Jakarta and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice president for East
Asia and the Pacific, speaking at a conference in Jakarta on
Tuesday, tried to place the seemingly deteriorating situation in
Indonesia against the background of the region's transformation.
The good news in the Bank Bali case, he said, is that the matter
came to public attention at all.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree but warn that the political consequences of these
scandals could threaten the Thai and Indonesian governments'
commitment to press on with economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have the political will to open what could be a
considerable can of worms?'' asked Donaldson Hartman, an analyst
with Salomon Smith Barney. ``These situations will touch a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the latest scandals so troubling to the IMF and the
World Bank is that they have touched some of the people and
institutions they have been using as agents of reform _ in Jakarta,
the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, and in Bangkok, Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda. The IMF is leading a $17.2 billion
rescue of Thailand's economy and a $42.3 billion rescue of
Indonesia's, both of which include billions in World Bank funds.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals at the government-owned Krung Thai Bank followed
the leaking of an audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers saying that the
bank had weak lending standards and that as much as 84 percent of
its loans might be delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among those dismissed was the bank chairman, Mechai
Viravaidya, a former Thai telephone regulator and respected
campaigner against the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Differences had also risen over how to dispose of Krung Thai's
bad loans, with the Finance Ministry arguing for the establishment
of an outside company for the task.
</P>
<P>
   Local news media have also accused the bank's board members of
leaking the audit report, which opposition politicians have been
using to attack Tarrin. The finance minister's younger brother was
president of Krung Thai for seven years until he resigned in
January.
</P>
<P>
   After initial successes, efforts to raise funds to help
rejuvenate Thailand's economy by selling bad loans or collateral
has provoked a nationalist backlash.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, an opposition legislator accused the government of
conspiring with the World Bank to sell Krung Thai to foreign
investors after using taxpayers' money to strengthen the balance
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has done just what the foreigners told it to
do, like it wanted to give this country to foreigners,'' asserted
Chalerm Yubamrung, a member of Parliament from the opposition New
Aspiration Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, accusations that a vice chairman at the bank
restructuring agency helped broker a deal under which Bank Bali
paid $71 million to a company owned by the deputy treasurer of
President B.J. Habibie's political party has led to calls for the
resignation of Finance Minister Bambang Subianto and the bank
restructuring agency's chairman, Glenn Yusuf. Dismay over the
scandal has battered the Indonesian currency.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Hundreds of man-made fires are burning
again in remote areas of Indonesia, blackening vast areas of rain
forest and sending pungent smoke across several nations.
</P>
<P>
   The fires, mostly set by owners of large plantations to clear
land on Borneo and Sumatra, reached a peak two years ago, when
thick smog dimmed the sun in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand
and the Philippines, as well as Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Now some environmental groups are warning that this could be
another disaster year, and officials from 10 countries in the
region met in Singapore Wednesday to press Indonesia to take
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we hope that it will not be worse than it was two
years ago,'' said Dedi Jefri, an official of Indonesia's leading
private environmental group, Walhi. ``But actually if the
government does not take preventive action, it could be at least as
bad this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report this month, Walhi said at least 441 fires were
burning as the dry season got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Though the smog is far thinner than at its peak two years ago,
it has already caused some airlines to divert flights and is blamed
for a collision of a barge and a tanker off Sumatra two weeks ago
that cost 10 lives.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be little anyone can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure, Indonesia passed laws in 1997
forbidding the use of fire to clear land during the dry season,
from July through October. Officials said 176 companies were
suspected of using the method. But so far, not one has been
successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   With the government weak and distracted by politics and
continuing outbreaks of violence, a former official said, there was
little hope of effective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The companies involved are powerful and well connected, and the
revenue from the plantations is desperately needed as Indonesia's
economy continues to founder, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A British environmental group, Down to Earth, said in a recent
report, ``The forest fires are a symptom of the crisis in
Indonesian politics, economics and forestry policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups estimated that the fires in 1997 destroyed
25 million acres of forest land and caused losses to Indonesia of
nearly $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore this week, Emmanuel Nabet, managing director of
Spot Asia, an international supplier of geographic information,
said nearby countries were losing patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to see a very interesting meeting because
Indonesia's neighbors seem to be fed up with the situation,'' he
said in a report by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The smog has been most troublesome to Malaysia, where in 1997 it
turned noon into dusk and forced residents of the capital, Kuala
Lumpur, to wear surgical masks.
</P>
<P>
   For fear of scaring off tourists, the response in Malaysia this
year has been to declare that there is no smog. On Aug. 5 the
government there announced it would no longer publish regular
updates of its pollution index. Malaysian officials blamed the smog
for a 13 percent drop in tourists in 1997, to 6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing alarming,'' said Environment Minister Law
Hieng Ding. ``Why do you all trust CNN? People can see for
themselves.'' CNN and foreign newspapers and magazines have shown
pictures of Kuala Lumpur's skyline blurred by smog.

 &HT;    MENDOZA, Argentina _ El ruido de los tractores y de las
niveladoras se oye practicamente en todo el pueblo de Tupungato,
hasta hace poco un lugar somnoliento al pie de los Andes, cerca de
la ciudad argentina de Mendoza. En este pueblo, tradicional
productor de nueces, cuando las maquinas paran de trabajar los
obreros colocan postes y tienden cables. En otras propiedades, esa
tarea ya ha concluido y los duenos se dedican a eliminar las
hormigas, las primeras en aprovechar el mar de viqedos que cubre el
distrito.
 &HT;    Los trabajadores son en su mayorma argentinos, y a muchos los
traen en autobus desde las provincias septentrionales debido a la
escasez de mano de obra local. Pero los duenos de estas
florecientes propiedades son de distintos paises. Chandon, uno de
los grandes productores franceses de champana, ya cosecha uvas en
una franja de 300 hectareas que se extiende desde la calle
principal del pueblo hasta el horizonte. En los ultimos cuatro anos
tambien han llegado inversionistas holandeses, italianos,
espanoles, chilenos y norteamericanos.
 &HT;    Argentina es el cuarto productor de vino del mundo, despues de
Italia, Francia y Espana. El reconocimiento del pais como
fabricante de excelentes vinos ha convertido a Tupungato y a la
vecina Tunuyan en las propiedades mas codiciadas del sector
vinicola latinoamericano.
 &HT;    El consumo de vino en Argentina ha bajado mas del 50 por ciento
desde 1972, y la produccion ha girado hacia la exportacion de vinos
de gran calidad, que subio de US$19 millones en 1995 a US$103
millones el ano pasado. Este aumento ha causado que por las mejores
uvas haya que pagar una prima considerable.
 &HT;    ``Hace unos anos, no habia gran diferencia entre el precio de
las uvas comunes y las variedades mas finas,'' explica Miguel
Gibson, gerente de Los Montes Negros, uno de los nuevos vinedos de
la zona. ``Pero en terrenos de la misma area se podia cosechar
cuatro veces mas uvas ordinarias,'' Segun Gibson, el infasis en la
calidad significa que las mejores variedades cuestan mas de US$100
por 100 kilogramos, mientras las de calidad inferior cuestan menos
de US$15.
 &HT;    En esta acentuada jerarquia, las singulares condiciones de
Tupungato hacen que sus uvas sean las mas cotizadas. Por ejemplo,
la pobreza de los suelos dificulta el cultivo, lo que baja el
rendimiento pero hace aumentar la calidad. El suelo arenoso, que
absorbe rapidamente el agua, tambien es bueno para las raices de la
vid. En el caso de los vinos tintos, las rocas que abundan en la
superficie son beneficiosas para la produccion porque se calientan
durante el dia y liberan calor por la noche, lo que impide que la
fruta se hiele.
 &HT;    Pero quiza el mayor atractivo de la zona es su ubicacion a poco
mas de mil metros sobre el nivel del mar, mucho mas alto que los
vinedos tradicionales. A esa altura, la variacion de temperatura
entre el dia y la noche puede ser hasta de 20 grados, ideal para
producir una uva de gran bouquet, acidez natural y taninos que da
un vino de alta calidad.
 &HT;    La sed de propiedades en Tupungato ha catapultado los precios.
Los mismos terrenos que costaban US$150 la hectarea hace cuatro
aqos, hoy valen US$8.000 la hectarea, si quedan. ``Toda la tierra
se ha vendido. No queda nada,'' dice Gibson. ``En 1995, nadie podia
imaginarse lo que iba a pasar. La tierra no valia nada.''
 &HT;    Pero adquirir el terreno es solo el principio. ``No es solamente
comprar. Tambien hay que vestirlo,'' dice Ricardo Reina, otro
cosechero de la zona. Reina calcula que el costo de sembrar, de los
equipos y el cultivo de las vides tres anos antes de comenzar la
produccisn, sumado a otros costos, anade otros US$30.000 por
hectarea.
 &HT;    Aunque muchos terratenientes no saben nada del giro, otros
tienen una gran experiencia, entre ellos varios chateaux franceses
y Kendall Jackson, uno de los principales productores de Estados
Unidos.
 &HT;    Pero no basta con la experiencia. Muchos vecinos de la zona
creen que a Kendall Jackson no lo aconsejaron bien porque adquirio
los terrenos a mas altura en todo el distrito (1.400 metros sobre
el nivel del mar) y con poca agua.
 &HT;    Los chilenos, que en la ultima decada fomentaron su exitosa
industria vinicola, tambien se han sentido tentados a cruzar los
Andes. Los encabeza Santa Carolina, que ha adquirido mas de 1.000
hectareas. Otros grandes fabricantes como Santa Rita y Concha y
Toro han comprado terrenos menores, de unas 150 hectareas cada uno.
 &HT;    Aunque Chile tiene mas historial de ventas internacionales, esas
adquisiciones fortalecen la opinion de los argentinos de que a la
larga se reconocera que sus vinos son muy superiores a los de sus
vecinos. En el lado argentino de los Andes hay tormentas de granizo
que pueden destruir las cosechas, pero tiene la ventaja de una
mayor variacion de las temperaturas y menos lluvia, a la vez que
tiene mas tierra apta para cultivar buenas uvas.
 &HT;    Despues de sufrir al inicio varios contratiempos con
exportaciones de calidad muy variable, los argentinos parecen haber
resuelto sus problemas de mercadeo y sus vinos ya se exportan a un
precio promedio por botella mas alto que el de los vinos chilenos.
``Los chilenos se posicionaron a un precio muy bajo y les esta
costando leventarlo,'' senala Carlos Bassos, uno de los duenos de
Los Montes Negros.
 &HT;    Reina espera que Tupungato llegue a ser una de las grandes
regiones vinicolas del mundo. La compara con el descubrimiento del
Valle del Napa en los anos '60, cuando los cultivadores subieron
desde el valle de San Joaquin, que producia uvas para vinos de
mesa. Reina sostiene que Argentina ya da una buena cosecha. ``Pero
estas seran mejores,'' afirma mientras examina sus nuevos vinedos.
``Seran vinos de la mas alta calidad.''

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's little of the great 17th-century cabinets of
curiosity, from hand-shaped carrots to human-faced pigs, that Joe
Coleman, an artist, can't match in his 20th-century version. He
owns a pair of Fiji mermaids and a two-headed prairie dog. He has a
framed piece of embroidery sewn by a 19th-century woman in Sag
Harbor, who had no hands: Mlle. Tunison, ``World's Greatest
Phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   If the island of Dr. Moreau had had a visitors' center, it might
have looked like Coleman's four-room apartment in Brooklyn Heights,
the living room which houses his Odditorium, a natural descendant
of the great specimen collections. The armadillo was the most
popular quadraped of the 17th-century curiosity cabinets; Coleman
has a Tiffany-like table lamp, the carapacious shade of which is an
armadillo's shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rooms that make me the most uncomfortable are these really
minimalist rooms,'' Coleman said, at home, standing at the center
of what looked like a carousel of lost souls: a wax Chinese
prisoner being eaten by rats, a pre-Columbian mummy and an
encephalitic baby floating in a jar. ``With white walls, just one
chair here, one table there. I'm really frightened in those
places.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, ``Joe Coleman/Matrix 139,'' an exhibition of his
paintings, will open at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.
Selections from his Odditorium will be on display. The temporary
removal makes him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having your children go away to summer camp,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who lives with his fiancee, Whitney Ward, a
photographer, is a small, meticulous man, dressed in formal,
frontier-town 19th-century black, hair combed back in slick waves
with Top Brass. When he smiles, two square, slightly fanned front
teeth appear, like playing cards stuck up a sleeve. An alligator
paw hangs on his waistcoat, below a blue enamel pin of Little Boy,
the first atomic-weapon deployed in war. As a teen-ager, Coleman
strapped fireworks to his chest beneath his shirt, pretending to
blow himself up at parties.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 43, collects the arcane: religious reliquaries, freaks
of nature, carnival sideshow memorabilia and artifacts like letters
and paintings of the criminally insane, which he finds at auction
houses, like Guernsey's in Manhattan, and antiques shops, like the
Wandering Dragon, also in Manhattan. The drapery material came from
La Lame Inc. in Manhattan, which sells clerical cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like living in my work,'' said Coleman, whose
paintings are elaborate, iconographic depictions of stories, often
biographies. Those portrayed have included Jayne Mansfield, Edgar
Allan Poe and Carl Panzram, an American serial killer who taught
himself to read in prison and whose favorite authors were Nietzsche
and Schopenhauer. Coleman considers his subjects the Odditorium's
household saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing world, modeled on dime museums,'' said Jim
Jarmusch, the filmmaker, who commissioned a painting of New York's
Lower East Side at the turn of the century (Coleman's paintings,
acrylics on masonite, now sell for more than $30,000). ``It's one
of the world's great collections of extremely weird _''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio, the actor, is another collector who has
stopped by. He named Coleman's stuffed South Seas snapping turtle
Happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tradition among artists of collecting things that
are bizarre or morbid, objects that disturb,'' said Nicholas Baume,
the curator of contemporary art at the Wadsworth Atheneum, who is
organizing Coleman's show. ``Certainly the Surrealists and Dadaists
_ Andre Breton had a fascinating collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman has strong tastes, but he also has a strong sense of
what a home can be, and of what it can do. It is a heart of
darkness. More than his castle, the Odditorium is his kingdom: part
one-room schoolhouse, part chamber of horrors. Coleman lives like a
king who has been buried with the things he will need to make it to
the next world, or Orpheus, as a man who went to the underworld and
stayed, seeking not Eurydice but himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a way to possess your fears,'' he said of his
belongings, which he likened to prayers, ``in the same way that
primitive tribes will make fetish objects. A hundred years from
now, my collection might give an indication of our fears and
obsessions and perversions and lusts and anger. It preserves these
things that are inside all of us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he thought the Odditorium, with its representations
of the sciences of pathology, the fringes of society, the variety
of death and the admiration of mayhem, was like a Rorschach test.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's reactions are interesting,'' he said. ``Certain
things are very disturbing, and then others not. A friend of mine
who's a cop on the third floor _ he loves it here. His wife makes
lemon meringue pies to bring up. They're very neighborly.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's apartment is also a rat's nest of Freudian
associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, I lived across the street from a cemetery,'' he
said. ``I would find things and bring them home. This is stuff that
I've been searching for my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman grew up in Norwalk, Conn., the son of an alcoholic war
veteran who failed in his ambition to become a painter, and a
beautiful woman who never became the movie star she thought she
would be. A divorced Catholic, she was excommunicated for marrying
Coleman's father, he said. As a boy, he bought duplicates of
plastic model kits, including Frankenstein and the Wolf Man, using
the extra parts to make more monstrous monsters. In paintings, he
has twice burned down his childhood house.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy was shot on Coleman's eighth birthday. He sold
his first painting to Lady Bird Johnson when he was in the third
grade. ``I had done this painting of garbage,'' he said. ``She was
traveling around at that time, sponsoring this Beautify America
campaign. She saw my painting as a great indictment against litter.
She was my first collector.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s, Coleman worked as a performance artist as
he developed his extreme-comics, folk-art, tattoo-parlor painting
style.
</P>
<P>
   As the acquisitions director of the Odditorium, which he created
in 1994, Coleman has had his bargain days. He was able to get Greta
and Edna, two Fiji mermaids with impeccable provenance (constructed
of monkeys' heads, antlers and human hair, they came, with papers,
from the collection of Jack Lambert, who was a ticket agent for
P.T. Barnum) for just less than $1,000 at an auction in Fishkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they opened the box, they gasped,'' he said of the
auctioneers, ``so I knew I would get them cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   But collecting has come at the cost of some convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only throw away furniture,'' Ms. Ward said, dressed in black
tulle and five-inch black heels. ``We're down to a sofa and a
wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   She nodded at a Victorian wicker coffin propped against the
wall: ``The guest room,'' she said. In the kitchen, the
underfrosted depths of the refrigerator's freezer compartment
contained a polar diorama of Alaska, created with toy figures. In a
shadow, Coleman's telephone rang. A machine picked up the call,
answering with a clip from ``Nightmare Alley,'' a 1947 film noir
about carnivals. ``When you been around this carny a little
longer,'' the barker says, ``you'll learn to quit asking
questions.''

LANDING SITE SELECTED FOR MARTIAN PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A broad, gently rolling plain near the south pole of Mars, where
layered accumulations of ice and dust preserve a history of
planetary climate change, has been selected as the landing site for
the Mars Polar Lander spacecraft, on its way and scheduled to
arrive on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and mission officials announced the selection
Wednesday after a close examination of pictures and altimeter data
gathered by another spacecraft, the Mars Global Surveyor, which is
already orbiting and mapping the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., where the mission is being directed, are radioing
instructions to the Polar Lander craft for a maneuver next
Wednesday to take aim on the target: a rectangular area 125 miles
long and 12 miles wide near the edge of the southern polar
landscape, at 76 degrees south latitude, 195 degrees west
longitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have the site that will accomplish our
scientific objectives,'' Dr. Richard W. Zurek, the mission's chief
scientist, said at a news conference at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander will be the fourth spacecraft to touch down on
Mars, but the first to go to a polar region.
</P>
<P>
   When the robotic spacecraft reaches Mars, it will be the end of
spring in the planet's southern hemisphere. The landing site, on a
smooth plateau, will be well north of the thick polar ice cap, in
seasonal retreat, and presumably free of ground frost. Drilling
into the surface, the spacecraft should be able to investigate
subterranean water ice and the details of the layers of dust and
ice deposited there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this layered terrain is a record of climate change
on Mars,'' Zurek said. ``In a sense, digging into its surface will
be like reading tree rings or layers in an ice core.''
</P>
<P>
   The landing site will be in perpetual sunlight, critical to
operations of the spacecraft's solar-powered systems for a minimum
of about 90 days. One factor in the site selection was finding a
broad area with slopes no steeper than 10 degrees, reducing the
risk of the spacecraft's tipping over or tilting so severely that
its solar panels might be left in partial shade.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander's studies of the icy terrain will be
supplemented by two basketball-size microprobes. They are to be
deployed about five minutes before the spacecraft enters the
Martian atmosphere and should land in the same target region. Their
main purpose is to drill below the surface and take soil samples to
be heated and examined for emissions of water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander was launched on Jan. 3 as part of the expanded
robotic exploration of Mars. A companion craft, Mars Climate
Orbiter, departed a few weeks earlier and is scheduled to go into
orbit of the planet on Sept. 23, to survey weather and climate
conditions and act as a communications relay for Polar Lander.

<P>
   Video might have killed the radio star, but what about the
pinball manufacturer? Ever since Pong entered the arcades and bars
nearly a quarter-century ago, skeptics have been predicting
pinball's last big tilt.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, pinball has declined in popularity. One
of the two main manufacturers of the machines, Williams
Electronics, said it had released only half as many new games last
year as it did in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is facing a crossroads, but Williams Electronics
and its major rival, Sega Pinball, are taking different
technological paths, with one embracing and the other rejecting the
video-game age.
</P>
<P>
   After 57 years in the business, Williams Electronics, based in
Chicago, recently announced that it would no longer produce
traditional pinball machines. Instead, it will manufacture a new
generation of pinball-video game hybrids, part of its Pinball 2000
system.
</P>
<P>
   The first such game, Revenge From Mars, was introduced in London
in January. While video glitz has been used for a while to dress up
pinball games, Revenge From Mars is the first to incorporate video
images into the action, allowing the player to interact with
virtual, as well as physical, targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intertwining video and pinball is the next evolutionary
phase,'' said Roger Sharpe, director of licensing for the pinball
division at Williams Electronics. ``It's the perfect blend of new
technologies without losing the essence of what pinball has meant
for so many fans of the medium for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Stern, owner of Sega Pinball, is skeptical. His
company, which creates many licensed games, like Jurassic Park and
South Park, remains committed to the classic electromechanical
action of bumpers and wire ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams is trying to get a video game player to play pinball,
but the video game player is at home playing Dreamcast,'' Stern
said, referring to the new home console system from Sega of America
(which is part of Sega Enterprises, as is Sega Pinball).
</P>
<P>
   Pinball has been around for 128 years, but this debate did not
begin until video games took off in the early 1980s. In the
beginning, pinball was based only on gravity. It originated in
Cincinnati as a tabletop version of a French game, bagatelle. The
player shot a ball into a slanted play field, where the ball would
randomly bounce among a series of pins (thus the name).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Harry Williams _ the future founder of Williams
Electronics _ invented a game called Contact, which included the
first battery-operated feature: a scoring cup that automatically
kicked out a ball that landed in it.
</P>
<P>
   As a joke, Williams connected the cup to a telephone so the
phone rang every time the ball went in the cup. Legend has it that
his unsuspecting business associate spent much of the day sprinting
across the room to answer the phone each time it rang.
</P>
<P>
   The flipper was introduced in 1946. The next major technological
innovation came in the mid-1970s, when pinball's electromechanical
elements were augmented with electronics. That allowed machines to
have more dazzling features, like digital scoring, speech and
synchronized light shows.
</P>
<P>
   The first threat from video games came around the early 1980s,
during the explosive era of arcade hits like Pac-Man and Space
Invaders. Faced with this formidable competition, pinball
developers experimented with hybrid designs in games like Caveman
and Baby Pac-Man.
</P>
<P>
   These machines embedded video game displays within the game so a
player would switch, rather awkwardly, between pinball and video
maneuvers. By all accounts, the early hybrids were a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinball 2000 hybrid is different, Sharpe said, because the
video elements are seamlessly integrated into the pinball action.
When the ball passes various sensors on the playing field,
corresponding video images are projected on the glass. In Revenge
From Mars, for example, a player may have to shoot video images of
six Martians who sit at a happy-hour bar.
</P>
<P>
   Stern argues that such flashy techniques can be too much of a
good thing. ``Hybrids tend to be dismal because the average player
gets confused by all the action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of pinball is its simplicity, he said, because
players, most of them men 18 to 35 years old, come to the games for
fast and intuitive play. ``We don't want our players to think too
much,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   But changes are necessary, Sharpe counters. The business has
``been in a downward spiral for the past three or four years,'' he
said. ``Before we pull the plug,'' Sharpe said, ``we want to see if
we can pull off a miracle.''

 &HT;    Bradley, Gore vie for union support
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pitching hard for labor votes, Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Bradley told trade union leaders
Wednesday that as president he would bar companies that broke labor
laws from receiving government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said he would promote laws that awarded punitive
damages and triple back pay to employees improperly fired for
seeking to organize a union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to help working families, you start with the
unions,'' Bradley said. ``And when you start with the union, you
start with organizing. ... The law is tilted to the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley delivered his remarks to the Washington meeting of 900
delegates of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied
Trades, representing about 105,000 union workers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also was invited to speak, but declined
due to scheduling conflicts, said Bill Anderson, the union's
political representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a tremendous amount of work to support the vice
president, and we are surprised,'' Anderson said, venting some
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said the vice president, who was
endorsed by the United Transportation Union on Tuesday, couldn't
speak to the union because of a previously scheduled vacation with
his family in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley received a standing ovation from the delegates both
before and after his speech. He was frequently interrupted by
applause, and delegates chanted ``Bradley, Bradley'' as he exited.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO and an
influential voice in the labor movement, declared afterward that
Bradley delivered ``perhaps one of the best speeches I've heard a
politician give on workers' behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trumka said if votes were held today, Gore would probably
win a union straw poll by a margin of two to one. ``People have
dealt with him and worked with him for eight years,'' Trumka said
of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Bradley has not received a single union endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, has collected more than a dozen endorsements
from unions around the country, including the United Federation of
Teachers and the Communication Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   While serving in Congress, both Bradley and Gore voted almost
identically on union issues, according to the AFL-CIO. Bradley's
lifetime voting average on union issues was 86 percent, while
Gore's was 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore, however, support free trade agreements
with other countries, positions vigorously opposed by unions.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Bradley avoided mentioning his trade
position, but underscored his personal connection to the labor
movement, noting that he served as shop steward to the NBA player's
association while a New York Knick. Bradley's wife, Ernestine, a
college professor, is a member of the American Federation of
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I are the only union couple ever to run for
president of the United States,'' declared Bradley, adding that he
also draws a union pension.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley is eagerly courting union votes, spokeswoman Anita
Dunn said the campaign would be just as happy if the nation's
unions opted not to endorse either candidate until after the
nomination battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have support, but we are also practical,''
Dunn said.

HOLBROOKE INFORMALLY VISITS U.N. BEFORE HEADING TO BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard Holbrooke made a low-key first
appearance at the United Nations on Wednesday, a moment delayed by
nearly a year because of congressional roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, fresh from an Alaskan break after months of
grueling hearings in the Senate, he signed on as chief
representative of the United States with an oath administered by
the U.S. Mission's top administrative officer, arranged a few
things in his office, crossed the street to drop in on U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette and made some diplomatic house
calls on other envoys.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial events will have to wait a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke plans to leave Friday for a quick tour of the Balkans
_ visiting United Nations and NATO operations in Kosovo and
checking on developments in Bosnia _ before returning to work here
after Labor Day. He is expected to present his credentials to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Sept. 7, and be sworn in at the
White House at about the same time as the representative here and a
member of the president's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   On his European trip, Holbrooke is also to visit Albania and
Macedonia to thank Kosovo's neighbors for their assistance in
dealing with the huge refugee influx earlier this year, said U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, Holbrooke will now be closely involved with both
Kosovo, which the United Nations will administer when NATO forces
leave, and Bosnia, where fighting ended and reconstruction began
because of the 1995 Dayton accords, which he shaped and negotiated
with the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton is remembered here with mixed feelings because, United
Nations officials and diplomats say, Holbrooke went out of his way
to exclude the United Nations from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials believe there will also be tensions over Kosovo
if the United Nations is judged by Washington as not moving fast
enough to install a civilian administration and an effective police
force. The organization is constrained by severe budget problems as
it prepares for Kosovo while also planning wider operations in the
Congo, Sierra Leone and the Ethiopia-Eritrea border area.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and officials are waiting to see if Holbrooke, a
former ambassador to Germany and a distinguished Foreign Service
officer whose career began in the Vietnam War years, will be able
to persuade Congress to release enough money to pay even a portion
of the $1.6 billion the United States owes the United Nations. The
figure amounts to more than 60 percent of the regular budget
arrears of all member nations.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials and a General Accounting Office
report on July 28 said that even if the Senate's authorization in
July of $926 million emerges intact from a House-Senate conference,
the total would fall short _ by more than $150 million _ of what is
needed to avoid losing the United States' vote in the General
Assembly on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The House did not act on the arrears before its summer recess,
in part because of a proposed amendment by Rep. Christopher Smith,
R-N.J., that would tie the money to an anti-abortion clause. A
similar clause last year provoked Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate also want to attach numerous
amendments in the name of various reforms, but these cannot be met
unless other member nations agree to changes. Sympathy for the
United States is at a very low ebb here, and there is a general
sense, shared by the secretary-general, that the United Nations has
made all the cuts in budgets and staff that it can.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress decided in 1995, contrary to U.S. treaty
obligations, that the United States would reduce the percentage of
its contribution to peacekeeping operations to 25 percent, from
31.4 percent, the gap between U.S. payments (or plans for payments)
and the organization's tally of what Washington owes grows wider
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also wants to cut U.S. contributions to the regular
budget, to 20 percent, from 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But when Holbrooke was asked Wednesday what his first priority
would be, his mind was not on the United Nations' prime topic,
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said many times that our highest sustained priority is
going to be U.N. reform,'' he said, perhaps with an eye on
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats expect Holbrooke to serve only a short time here,
seeing him as an experienced diplomat who would stand a good chance
of becoming secretary of state if Vice President Al Gore is elected
president next year. A secretary of state also requires Senate
confirmation.

BAY STATE UPHOLDS $19.2M JUDGMENT AGAINST CHRYSLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' highest court upheld Wednesday a jury
verdict ordering Chrysler Corp. to pay $19.2 million to a Belmont
man whose wife and three children were killed when their 1986
Plymouth Voyager veered into oncoming traffic on a slick New
Hampshire road.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court also affirmed the Suffolk Superior
Court jury's 1996 finding that Chrysler was grossly negligent in
designing the brakes of the vehicle, one of the country's
best-selling minivans, which Paul J. Santos Jr. said locked
improperly as he was returning from a family ski trip on Feb. 24,
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Black, Santos's attorney, said he was ``obviously
delighted'' by the high court's decision, which he said exonerates
Santos of Chrysler's claim that the accident was caused by driver
error in hazardous winter weather.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ``reaffirmed the jury's conclusion that this was the
responsibility of Chrysler,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Chrysler, the nation's third-largest auto
manufacturer _ which in November merged with Daimler Benz AG to
form Daimler Chrysler _ insisted Wednesday that poor driving, not a
mechanical defect, caused the fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed all along, and still believe today, that this is
an issue of personal responsibility, not an issue of product
liability,'' said Chrysler spokesman Jay Cooney, speaking from the
company's world headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident occurred because Mr. Santos slammed on his brakes
while traveling 45 miles per hour on an icy, snow-covered road in
the middle of a blizzard in February,'' Cooney said. ``There's
absolutely nothing wrong with the brakes in this vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 30-page ruling, the SJC rejected several of Chrysler's
challenges to the verdict, including an argument that a trial judge
erred by allowing Santos's attorney to make an improper closing
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The company also contended that the trial judge improperly
allowed Santos's attorneys to introduce certain evidence, such as
the recalls of 1984 and 1985 Chrysler minivans to add a shield to a
brake mechanism. Santos's 1986 van did not have the shield.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the six-member court, Justice Ruth Abrams said, ``We
have held that, if a defect that was the subject matter of a recall
was present in the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the accident,
evidence of the recall is admissible to show that the defect was
present in the plaintiff's vehicle when it left the hands of the
manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also argued on appeal that the trial judge had
improperly blocked Chrysler's attorneys from introducing certain
evidence, such as expert testimony that Chrysler minivans were no
more prone than other vehicles to fatal accidents on icy roads due
to skidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a verdict against us because the jury decided this
case based on emotion and because the plaintiff's attorneys were
able to inflame and upset the jury with improper and irrelevant
evidence,'' said Cooney. ``If the jury had used common sense, we
wouldn't be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the trial judge's decision to exclude Chrysler's
expert witness, Abrams noted that the witness ``had no expertise in
engineering or accident reconstruction. She said she used her
common sense as a driver.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place on Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, also
known as Franconia Notch State Parkway, as Santos and his family _
his wife, Robin, 46, and their children, Christine, 16, Paul, 12,
and Peter, 8 _ were returning from a ski trip in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   During a four-week trial, Santos testified that he had pumped
the brakes when a car in front of him slowed abruptly and, when
that did not slow the van enough, jammed his foot to the brake
pedal. The minivan then fishtailed and crossed the center lane into
the path of a Ford Bronco, which broadsided his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony indicated that Santos was driving about 45 miles an
hour, well within the speed limit, and that he and his three
children were wearing seat belts. Santos's wife had injured her leg
while skiing and was resting in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Santos sued Chrysler for negligence, wrongful death,
and breach of warranty, contending that the van's braking system is
designed so the rear brakes tend to lock before the front brakes,
causing the vehicle to spin.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Chrysler argued that the van is free of defects.
They also suggested that Santos may have played a role in the
accident, noting that the van's windshield washer was broken,
possibly reducing visibility.
</P>
<P>
   After finding Santos 10 percent at fault in the accident, and
Chrysler the rest, the jury awarded Santos $12.8 million in
compensatory damages, plus interest. Jurors also awarded him
$15,705 in punitive damages, the price of the van.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney said Chrysler is considering a federal appeal of the
SJC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through his lawyer, Santos, an electrical
engineer who works in the Boston area, said he hopes to become ``a
powerful voice to advocate for greater corporate responsibility
among automakers.'' He also said he plans to write a book about the
accident and ensuing legal case.

BAY STATE REGULATORS PURSUE LARGE DAY TRADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In their ongoing campaign against abuses in
daytrading, Massachusetts regulators have turned their attention to
the big, anonymous clearinghouses that record and process millions
of stock transactions performed by day traders.
</P>
<P>
   The state securities division, which has led a nationwide
crackdown on daytrading abuses, has asked for documents from two
clearing houses, Dallas-based Oxford Holdings Inc. and JB Oxford
Holdings Inc. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses processed trades for Massachusetts day-trading firms
where regulators found rampant problems such as forged documents
and altered trade confirmation statements.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the securities division said they plan to
``take a long, hard look'' for evidence that the clearinghouses
knew or should have known of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about day trading, not just because of
the hazard to individual investors but because of the potential for
instability in the market,'' said Massachusetts Secretary of State
William F. Galvin, whose office includes the securities division.
``After looking so hard at the firms themselves, the logical next
step is to go up the chain to the clearinghouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The move has potentially national implications for the
regulation of day trading. Clearinghouses _ which are typically
independently owned and process trades for many investment firms,
not just day-trading boutiques _ have until now been considered off
limits to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators are reassessing that assumption after Bear
Stearns earlier this month agreed to pay $38.5 million to settle
civil charges that it ignored signs of stock manipulation while
processing stock trades for a client brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how the implications of that are going to shake
out yet,'' said Matt Nestor, Massachusetts director of securities.
``And we're not saying that anybody's done anything wrong. We don't
know that. But depending on what we find out, we could end up with
some rule changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading _ known in some circles as the X Games of investing
_ is an increasingly popular and controversial form of stock
trading. Dedicated traders work eight hours a day, five days a week
in specialized boutiques, where they often make hundreds of trades
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled over sophisticated computer equipment that flashes
market activity, they dart in and out of the market, betting on
minuscule movements in stock prices. Hundreds of day-trading
offices, which charge large commissions to their day-trading
customers, have cropped up in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the industry largely escaped regulatory scrutiny. But
when state and federal regulators began taking a closer look, they
found rampant abuses at some firms. And they found many traders,
instead of getting rich, became buried in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more egregious problems, regulators have said, were
illegal loans between day-trading customers. The loans, often
arranged by the firms, helped customers who ran out of money to
continue trading, sometimes with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   The loan schemes involved forging customer signatures on
transfer authorization forms. Massachusetts regulators will comb
the clearinghouse documents to see if the clearinghouses knew of
the problems. They said they will also examine the possibility that
clearinghouses have an obligation to review new account forms to
judge whether certain customers have enough money to engage in the
practice and that they are aware of the risks.

POWER GRID MEMBERS OFFERED LOW-USAGE BONUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Hoping to ease periodic power crises that have plagued
the New England electric grid this summer, grid managers have
quietly resumed an old program under which big power users can get
cash bonuses for ramping down electric usage during periods when
rolling blackouts are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows big commercial and industrial power users and
government agencies to get $8,000 per megawatt of demand they
reduce during so-called Operating Procedure 4 events, when grid
managers are allowed to order plants to produce power regardless of
market prices and may impose rolling blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   Grid managers with ISO-New England, the Holyoke entity that runs
the electric grid and wholesale power market, have had to appeal
for electric cutbacks four times this summer when demand threatened
to overwhelm available power supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that voluntary appeals were beginning to lose their
effect, ISO managers earlier this month got federal approval to
offer cash bounties for voluntary power conservation. A similar
system was in place during 1996 and 1997, but was abandoned when
the power grid moved in May to a competitive auction system for
buying electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ISO spokesman James B. Sinclair said Wednesday enough government
agencies, factories, and large commercial users have since signed
up for the program that grid officials are confident they can get a
``cushion'' of 400 to 500 megawatts to shave demand by a crucial
2.5 percent on heavy-demand days.
</P>
<P>
   Participants, signed up through their utilities, get $8 a
kilowatt of electricity they conserve during ``OP 4'' crisis times,
compared to historic demand, regardless of how long the crisis
lasts. The cost of the bounties is paid by wholesale power traders,
who generally would have to pay as much or more to buy power at
peak levels as to pay someone not to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the same check whether it's a four-hour event or an
eight-hour event, as long as you sustain the reduction in demand,''
Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary reduction plan is likely to be needed only a few
times between now and October, as cooler temperatures ease demand
for air conditioning. As officials continue to fine-tune the new
auction system for wholesale power, which has periodically led to
prices soaring to 30 times normal levels, Sinclair said they will
review whether bounties for voluntary conservation are still needed
next summer.

JONES FAILS TO FINISH IN 200 METER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Instead of four gold medals at the World
Championships of Track and Field, Marion Jones will probably leave
town with just one after collapsing during her 200-meter semifinal
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who won the 100-meter gold medal Sunday and was a heavy
favorite in the 200, began the race well but appeared to stop
accelerating about two-thirds of the way through the curve. By the
time she hit the straightaway she was fading, a look of worry on
her face; with about 50 meters to go she grabbed her back on the
lower left side and crumpled slowly to the track, where she stayed
as the race concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was still being examined, indications were that
Jones was suffering from back spasms and cramping. While she had
planned on running either the 4 x 100 or 4 x 400 relay next Sunday,
the last day of the competition, Jones is likely to miss the
remainder of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to let her compete in the rest of the
championships,'' her coach, Trevor Graham, told Reuters. Asked
about the rest of the season, Graham said, ``I haven't made up my
mind yet. She could wake up tomorrow feeling fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Said American Kevin Little after his 200-meter semifinal moments
after Jones went down: ``It just goes to show how tough the
conditions are, the hard track and the heat.'' It was 92 degrees at
the start of the race.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones was wheeled off the track her husband, C.J. Hunter,
hurried down from the stands of Estadio Olimpico and walked briskly
alongside the stretcher. Moments earlier Hunter had angrily pounded
the seatback in front of him as he watched his wife fall to the
track. Earlier this week, the couple had celebrated together when
Hunter, a shot putter, and Jones had won gold on consecutive
nights.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the president of the international track
and field federation reflected the global stature the 23-year-old
Jones has already attained in the sport. ``I was deeply affected by
the injury sustained by Marion Jones, and I am sure that millions
of fans around the world share this sentiment,'' said Primo
Nebiolo, head of the IAAF. ``I am sure that Marion will face this
difficult moment with great courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who owns the second-fastest times in history at both 100
and 200 meters, had already seen her historic bid for four gold
medals fall short when she finished third in the long jump.

BAY STATE UPHOLDS $19.2M JUDGMENT AGAINST CHRYSLER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' highest court upheld Wednesday a jury
verdict ordering Chrysler Corp. to pay $19.2 million to a Belmont
man whose wife and three children were killed when their 1986
Plymouth Voyager veered into oncoming traffic on a slick New
Hampshire road.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court also affirmed the Suffolk Superior
Court jury's 1996 finding that Chrysler was grossly negligent in
designing the brakes of the vehicle, one of the country's
best-selling minivans, which Paul J. Santos Jr. said locked
improperly as he was returning from a family ski trip on Feb. 24,
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Black, Santos's attorney, said he was ``obviously
delighted'' by the high court's decision, which he said exonerates
Santos of Chrysler's claim that the accident was caused by driver
error in hazardous winter weather.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ``reaffirmed the jury's conclusion that this was the
responsibility of Chrysler,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Chrysler, the nation's third-largest auto
manufacturer _ which in November merged with Daimler Benz AG to
form Daimler Chrysler _ insisted Wednesday that poor driving, not a
mechanical defect, caused the fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed all along, and still believe today, that this is
an issue of personal responsibility, not an issue of product
liability,'' said Chrysler spokesman Jay Cooney, speaking from the
company's world headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident occurred because Mr. Santos slammed on his brakes
while traveling 45 miles per hour on an icy, snow-covered road in
the middle of a blizzard in February,'' Cooney said. ``There's
absolutely nothing wrong with the brakes in this vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 30-page ruling, the SJC rejected several of Chrysler's
challenges to the verdict, including an argument that a trial judge
erred by allowing Santos's attorney to make an improper closing
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The company also contended that the trial judge improperly
allowed Santos's attorneys to introduce certain evidence, such as
the recalls of 1984 and 1985 Chrysler minivans to add a shield to a
brake mechanism. Santos's 1986 van did not have the shield.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the six-member court, Justice Ruth Abrams said, ``We
have held that, if a defect that was the subject matter of a recall
was present in the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the accident,
evidence of the recall is admissible to show that the defect was
present in the plaintiff's vehicle when it left the hands of the
manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also argued on appeal that the trial judge had
improperly blocked Chrysler's attorneys from introducing certain
evidence, such as expert testimony that Chrysler minivans were no
more prone than other vehicles to fatal accidents on icy roads due
to skidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a verdict against us because the jury decided this
case based on emotion and because the plaintiff's attorneys were
able to inflame and upset the jury with improper and irrelevant
evidence,'' said Cooney. ``If the jury had used common sense, we
wouldn't be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the trial judge's decision to exclude Chrysler's
expert witness, Abrams noted that the witness ``had no expertise in
engineering or accident reconstruction. She said she used her
common sense as a driver.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place on Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, also
known as Franconia Notch State Parkway, as Santos and his family _
his wife, Robin, 46, and their children, Christine, 16, Paul, 12,
and Peter, 8 _ were returning from a ski trip in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   During a four-week trial, Santos testified that he had pumped
the brakes when a car in front of him slowed abruptly and, when
that did not slow the van enough, jammed his foot to the brake
pedal. The minivan then fishtailed and crossed the center lane into
the path of a Ford Bronco, which broadsided his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony indicated that Santos was driving about 45 miles an
hour, well within the speed limit, and that he and his three
children were wearing seat belts. Santos's wife had injured her leg
while skiing and was resting in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Santos sued Chrysler for negligence, wrongful death,
and breach of warranty, contending that the van's braking system is
designed so the rear brakes tend to lock before the front brakes,
causing the vehicle to spin.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Chrysler argued that the van is free of defects.
They also suggested that Santos may have played a role in the
accident, noting that the van's windshield washer was broken,
possibly reducing visibility.
</P>
<P>
   After finding Santos 10 percent at fault in the accident, and
Chrysler the rest, the jury awarded Santos $12.8 million in
compensatory damages, plus interest. Jurors also awarded him
$15,705 in punitive damages, the price of the van.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney said Chrysler is considering a federal appeal of the
SJC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through his lawyer, Santos, an electrical
engineer who works in the Boston area, said he hopes to become ``a
powerful voice to advocate for greater corporate responsibility
among automakers.'' He also said he plans to write a book about the
accident and ensuing legal case.

U.S. LAWMAKER CRITICIZES JAPAN FOR HALTING FOOD TO NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (th) 
 By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A U.S. congressman sharply criticized Japan on Wednesday
for cutting off food aid to famine-stricken North Korea as millions
of tons of surplus rice are sitting in Japanese warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, who has a long history of fighting
world hunger, passed through Tokyo on Wednesday on his way to North
Korea, where he plans to begin an unofficial visit on Thursday to
survey the famine situation and deliver medicine donated by U.S.
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea has sent out an SOS that it can't feed its people,
and Japan, the world's largest donor, is ignoring that cry for help
because of political reasons,'' Hall said in a meeting with
reporters. ``The Japanese are sitting on a tremendous amount of
food which they are using as a weapon while millions of people are
starving.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that Japan had stockpiled between three million tons
and five million tons of rice after having a bumper crop. He
suggested that Japan sell the rice surpluses at ``friendship
prices'' to international aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanitarian aid should be given in an unconditional way,''
Hall said. ``If any of you have seen people starve to death, you'll
never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government ended its relief aid to North Korea last
August after North Korea test-fired a medium-range ballistic
missile that flew over the Japanese mainland and into the Pacific
Ocean. A spokesman for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Japan had
no plans to resume food aid to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for a constructive signal coming from North
Korea to improve the bilateral relationship,'' said Akitaka Saiki,
a deputy press secretary. ``So far, that signal has not come from
the North Korean capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1998 missile launching, Japan supplied North Korea
with 500,000 pounds of rice and a $500,000 contribution to U.N. aid
organizations in 1995; $6 million to international aid agencies
like the World Food Program in 1996; and $27 million to the food
program and $841,389 in medical assistance to the International Red
Cross in 1997, according to the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Agriculture Ministry, who requested
anonymity, said that bumper crops during the last four years had
allowed Japan to stockpile almost three million tons of rice. The
official said the ministry planned to reduce those reserves to
about two million tons of rice by the end of this year through crop
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that such large surpluses of rice are not
necessarily available for donation, as Japan often uses them to
offset shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's comments on aid echo those of Catherine Bertini,
executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, who after a
recent trip to North Korea said that there were signs the famine
situation was improving but that people were still starving and
that more aid was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bertini called on the United States, Japan and other
countries not to end their aid to North Korea, even if it launches
another missile.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have estimated that between two million and three
million people, mainly old people and children, died during the
worst years of the famine, from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Hall was critical of Japan, he also had strong words for
North Korea. He said said that he would use his fifth visit to the
Communist-run country to warn officials that if they proceed with
plans to test-fire a new long-range missile their country would
suffer dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to North Korean officials will be very simple,''
Hall said. ``Don't fire the missile. You'll be really, really
hurting yourself if you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which Hall said supplied 83 percent of all
aid to North Korea last year, has threatened to end its assistance
if the missile is fired. South Korea said it would end its
agriculture and economic development programs to the North, while
Japan has threatened to cut off the flow of financial remittances
from North Koreans living in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he was convinced that if North Korea proceeds with the
missile launching, the Republican-controlled Congress will suspend
all U.S. aid to the country. ``The votes are already there and I'm
afraid there wouldn't be much we could do to stop it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said that on his last visit to North Korea, last
year, he saw North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding
bones, open sores and signs of severe malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government was distributing what officials there
called ``substitute food'' _ dried leaves and straw, so coarse that
even cattle would not eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that medicine and medical supplies were so scarce in
North Korea that many operations are conducted without electric
lights or anesthesia and that gauze and cotton balls are washed and
reused.

BUSH PROMOTES FREE TRADE ON CAMPAIGN STOP IN SOUTH CAROLINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Speaking in a state well aware of the effects
of free trade, Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday that all trade
tariffs and barriers should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free trade is healthy for our economy,'' Bush said following a
speech in this historic East Coast city. ``Trade works both ways.
It's very important for a president to reduce barriers and tariffs
everywhere. I'd like to see them eliminated, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is on a three-day swing through South Carolina, North
Carolina and Georgia, raising money and making a series of speeches
on familiar themes.
</P>
<P>
   Trade tariffs are of particular importance in the Carolinas
because cheap overseas labor markets have devastated the textile
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know NAFTA has been good for (Texas),'' Bush said. ``NAFTA
also is important for Mexico. We want Mexico to succeed, not fail.
We want Mexico to be a vibrant, strong economy. After all, they are
our friend, and we want our friends to succeed in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, sidestepped two other issues important to South
Carolinians _ whether the Confederate flag should continue to fly
over the state capitol and whether the state should join the ranks
of those with lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina voters face a constitutional question of whether
to create a lottery to help fund education in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues, Bush said, are local and can best be handled by
South Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good people of South Carolina can figure out how to solve
that issue,'' he said of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People have called for tourism and economic boycotts of
South Carolina until the flag is removed from government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second trip Bush has made to South Carolina. His
supporters say Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., could be Bush's biggest
challenger in the state for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has spent a lot of his resources here,'' said Henry E.
Brown Jr., an eight-term Republican state representative who is
running for U.S. Congress from the 1st District. ``He's got a team
in place. He's well organized, I think he's going to make a
difference.''

 By SHERYL WuDUNN and NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ One of the striking paradoxes of Japan is that this is a
country with the greatest savers in the industrialized world, and
yet everywhere one looks there is debt.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese savers are famous for their ability to salt away money
for the future, but as a nation, this country has some of the worst
accounts in the industrialized world, and its debt trajectory
increasingly looks like that of a third world country like
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the public debt, which totals about $5.3 trillion, was
taken on at the urging of the United States to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's debt situation is now so precarious that there are
growing doubts about how long Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi can
continue to spend furiously in hopes of reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to adjust the fire carefully so that you
don't ruin the fish,'' said Sadakazu Tanigaki, a vice minister of
finance. ``The weight of the debt is extremely large. It is obvious
that we can't leave the current situation as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are difficult to gauge, and if Japan's incipient
recovery gains momentum, profits may flow in around the country and
the nation's debt problems could diminish. That is the gamble that
American officials, who transformed their own yawning budget
deficit into a surplus, have prodded Japan to take.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Japan's debt is not only tarnishing the government's
reputation as prudent proprietor of the world's second-largest
economy. It is also raising troubling questions that extend far
beyond Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no end in sight to the buildup of debt,'' said
Vincent J. Truglia, managing director at Moody's Investors Service,
which has downgraded Japan's formerly pristine credit rating, an
important sign of diminished foreign confidence in its financial
stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just concerned that Japan has already entered the
highest levels of debt of an industrialized country,'' Truglia
said, ``and soon will be entering unprecedented levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, rising debt levels will tend to lead to
higher long-term interest rates in Japan. The effects of those
higher rates may nudge up lending rates around the world, possibly
threatening the economies of Asia that are trying to climb out of a
financial crisis that is now two years old.
</P>
<P>
   Higher lending rates could also ripple across the Pacific to
raise business costs in California and mortgage rates in Florida,
undermining the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japan goes through a period of fiscal paralysis or outright
crisis, then it's going to have a very negative impact on global
financial stability,'' said David L. Asher, a specialist on Japan
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``They've already
broken a lot of world records for debt management in postwar
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a default by the Japanese government is remote, but
there are anxieties here that rising debt levels could lead to a
confidence crisis, provoking a flight of capital and currency
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan's troubles have not hurt America so far, a sudden
shift to safe assets in the United States could send the dollar
soaring in value against the yen and hurt American exports by
making them more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are difficult to gauge, partly because if Japan's
economy recovers strongly and remains vigorous, then many of its
debt problems will diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the debt is an astonishing contrast to Japan's reputation
for thriftiness. Japanese citizens have amassed a pool of $6.2
trillion in household savings, which appears at least on the
surface to be more than enough to pay off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that the domestic savings and foreign
assets held by private citizens are exactly that: private. The
debt, by contrast, is held mostly by the government, and the
government can hardly seize the savings of private citizens to pay
it off.
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration in Japan's finances has been amazingly rapid,
a result of tax cuts and spending increases that have resulted in
annual budget deficits that now amount to 10 percent of its economy
_ or 13 percent, if nationalized railroad debts are included. Even
the lower figure is the highest among the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1992 the Japanese government's gross debt
amounted to just 70 percent of its gross domestic product, a ratio
only a bit higher than that of the United States. This year,
Finance Ministry figures show, the debt will reach 120 percent,
exceeding that of Italy, which for many years has been by far the
worst among the Group of Seven industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2003 the
Japanese ratio will rise to 138 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Moody's estimates that the government may also have to
absorb additional debts equivalent to between 30 and 40 percent of
gross domestic product from the banking system, postal system loans
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   That would take Japan's debt to around 170 or 180 percent of
GDP, a figure about three times the level of the United States debt
in the 1980s, when American budget deficits and mounting public
debt were the talk of the world.
</P>
<P>
   These days in Japan, the central government's tax money cannot
even cover the bills for debt service and entitlements like
pensions, let alone payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Its debt-to-revenue ratio, which measures potential fiscal
problems by comparing a nation's debt burden to its annual cash
intake, is quickly approaching 1,400 percent, far worse than that
of other industrial powers. That means that Japan must repay 14 yen
for every yen it takes in from taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts Obuchi in a bind. He has managed to restore growth
to the Japanese economy this year, but only by huge stimulus
measures that add to the debt. And there is widespread apprehension
that the economy will run out of momentum when the extra government
spending fades this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Already, after raising about $1.3 trillion since 1992 to boost
the economy, the scorecard shows a massive pile of debt on one side
and on the other seven years of minuscule annual growth that may
not be self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, officials worry, the debt will get so high that
the benefit of any further stimulus will be outweighed by rising
long-term interest rates. Already, long-term rates are nearly 60
times the level of short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ichizo Ohara, an influential member of parliament, said he had
warned the prime minister against bowing to pressure from President
Clinton for a new supplementary budget to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would raise interest rates and knock stock prices down,''
Ohara said.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi is moving to introduce, probably by autumn, yet
another giant supplementary stimulus package that could reach $45
billion or more, adding to the mountain of debt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Japan's central government that is vastly
overextended. Debts are emerging everywhere else as well.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The local governments of Japan's top four most populous regions,
including Tokyo, have declared a fiscal emergency, and to stabilize
themselves they must lay off large numbers of workers or get a
central government bailout. Already, local governments around Japan
have amassed $1.4 trillion in debt, a staggering sum that is
greater than the assets of any bank in the world.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate sector, the bad debt problems of the banks are
well publicized and by some estimates may still amount to hundreds
of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's insurance companies invested in many of the same
foolish property ventures as the banks, yet the insurance companies
so far have barely faced up to their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Countless other companies, engaging in construction, real estate
and even in autos and technology, also are mired in bad debts
because Japanese companies historically have financed themselves
through bank loans. Many of the companies have used permissive
accounting rules to hide the obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Mikuni &AMP; Co., Japan's only independent credit rating agency,
assesses the risks of Japan's top 1,000 bond issuers _ the
country's corporate equivalent of prime real estate. Even looking
at just those elite companies, Mikuni rates about two-thirds of
them BB _ junk status _ or below.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is very scary,'' said Akio Mikuni, who runs
the rating agency and expects many corporate defaults to come. ``So
far in Japan, the government has avoided bankruptcies. But this
system cannot be continued. It is impossible. So the probability of
bankruptcies is quite significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Mikuni expects those bankruptcies to help strengthen
Japan's economic efficiency by clearing away weak, money-losing
businesses. But the more immediate result may be that defaults will
ripple through the economic system, adding to unemployment and
exacerbating the sense of economic despair.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese officials deny that the problem is so serious.
They note that Japan's ``net debt'' figures, which take into
account the country's social security assets, look much better than
the gross figures usually cited.
</P>
<P>
   But economists are nearly united in agreeing that the net
figures are misleading, because social security accounts are
themselves in disastrous shape. While there is a surplus today, the
social security system is projected to run out of money by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Economists estimate that the public pension system may be
severely underfunded. Corporations are in the same position, and
Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. has estimated that pension plans at
major corporations are underfunded by $714 billion _ making the
corporate problem one of roughly the same scale as the banking
system debts that have hobbled the Japanese economy in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of what has been done with the funds
that come from deposits at the government-run postal savings
system. Japanese post offices accept cash deposits in a system that
if it were counted as a bank would be the biggest one in the world
_ and perhaps one of the worst-run.
</P>
<P>
   The government has used those funds, a total of about $3.7
trillion, for pumping up the economy by lending to small businesses
or for building bridges and tunnels around Japan. The government
has also used public pension contributions and postal life
insurance premiums on similar projects.
</P>
<P>
   Many people worry that much of the money has been squandered,
though the government denies it. The upshot is that when losses in
these areas are finally acknowledged, the government will have to
absorb them and its debt levels will rocket even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many politicians and officials acknowledge that
Japan's finances are spinning out of control, they say it will be
difficult for the political process to correct the problem any timesoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gap essentially must be bridged with taxes,'' Kaoru
Yosano, the minister of International Trade and Industry and a
senior member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in a
somber interview in his spacious office. ``But the Liberal
Democratic Party and all other political parties are enormously
wary, even frightened, of raising taxes. Accordingly, politically
speaking, it has become a taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosano paused and added, ``I think that this can be
characterized as a lack of courage among the political parties.''

FACTORY ORDERS JUMP 3.3 PERCENT IN JULY 
</HEADLINE>

(th) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orders to U.S. factories jumped 3.3 percent in July, but
analysts said the sharp increase did not suggest inflationary
pressures of the kind that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve
moved to head off earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in production of such durable goods as cars, airplanes
and computers, reported by the Department of Commerce, was offset
by a drop of 3.9 percent in the sale of houses.
</P>
<P>
   While the decline in housing sales, reported by the National
Association of Realtors, tells only part of the story because
residential real estate represents a much smaller portion of the
economy than does manufacturing, analysts said Wednesday that
several other factors left them optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against the idea of significant new pressures on
inflation, for example, Chris Varvares, the president of
Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis noted that the rise in orders
for factory goods was coming as the overall economic growth rate
appeared to be moderating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3.3 percent rise is not particularly worrisome with
respect to prospects for inflation,'' Varvares said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly delighted by the July figures, David Huether, the
director of economic analysis at the National Association of
Manufacturers, said orders fluctuate greatly from month to month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next month,'' he said, ``I would say it's probably going to
cool down to 1.5 percent or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend in recent months has been good for the manufacturers.
``The main thing here, is that manufacturing is coming back,'' said
David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Boston.
``Manufacturing has been soft most of the last year. But we've been
seeing it pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Huether said he believed many of the new orders were coming from
American business. But Wyss said he believed at least part of the
upturn reflected the economic recovery under way in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Wyss said that while rising orders could force manufacturers to
hire more workers in an already tight employment market, with a
potential inflationary push, American manufacturers' pricing has
been restrained by increased exports from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a recession in Asia and they've got supply coming
out their ears,'' Wyss said. ``Our manufacturers can't push up
prices or the imports will take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Huether said that much of the long-term growth in manufacturing
has been in the computer industry. Computers have led to increased
productivity, he said, and that has offset rising wages as a check
on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, brushing aside arguments from farmers, labor unions,
some political leaders and the manufacturers that there was no
inflation to fight, the Federal Reserve, led by Greenspan, raised
interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, the second
increase in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed raised the main rate it controls, the Federal funds
target rate on overnight loans among banks, to 5.25 percent from 5
percent. It also raised its more symbolic discount rate on loans to
banks from the Federal Reserve system to 4.75 percent from 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Banks quickly raised their prime lending rate to 8.25 percent
from 8 percent, a step that will lead to higher rates on some
consumer and small business loans.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase earlier this year and the anticipation of the
rise this week played a role in the decline in housing sales, the
analysts said. Rates for mortgages just before the Fed's most
recent action, for example, had risen to a little more than 8
percent, up from just under 7 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are beginning to see higher interest rates beginning to
slow demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors like housing,''
Wyss said, ``which is what the Fed has been hoping for.''

 &HT;    ENVIRONMENTALISTS SUE TO STOP 'OPERATION RIO GRANDE'
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three environmental organizations filed suit
Wednesday to block the Border Patrol's ``Operation Rio Grande''
against illegal immigration on the lower part of the river that
separates Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court here, the Sierra
Club, Defenders of Wildlife and the Frontera Audubon Society
charged that use of floodlights and proposals to resurface roads
and install boat ramps on the river violate the Endangered Species
Act and the National Environmental Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   Land along the river provides habitat for the ocelot and the
jaguarundi, two endangered cats rarely seen by humans.
</P>
<P>
   Named as defendants in the suit were the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), the Department of Justice and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The three environmental organizations in wrote to INS in April,
demanding a halt to work on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS and the Army Corps have legal obligations under the
ESA and the NEPA that they have not lived up to,'' said Roger
</P>
<P>
   Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife. ``These folks
are supposed to be protecting us and our borders, not destroying
rare cat habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Operation Rio Grande, INS has proposed resurfacing roads,
clearing vegetation and building boat ramps along about 50 miles of
the Rio Grande in Starr, Hidalgo and Cameron counties.
</P>
<P>
   The suit charges that a draft environmental assessment and a
biological assessment filed by the INS, as required by the National
Environmental Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act, are
deficient and error-laden.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ocelots and jaguarundis, the region is home to
Aplamado falcons and piping plovers. All four species are on the
brink of extinction, the plaintiffs charge.
</P>
<P>
   INS and the Corps of Engineers have said they complied with both
statutes in the project.

APPARENT IRA KILLING PUTS PRESSURE ON PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Pressure to punish the Irish Republican Army and its
political allies in Sinn Fein grew Wednesday after Ronnie Flanagan,
chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said the Northern Ireland
police had evidence that the IRA had killed a Belfast man last
month.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the BBC, Flanagan refused to say whether
the IRA's alleged involvement in the murder of Charles Bennett
constituted a violation of its cease-fire, saying that was a
political decision that had to be made by Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   But Flanagan's comments give Mowlam little wiggle room as the
British and Irish governments try to keep the stalled peace process
from further deteriorating. Mowlam was expected to issue her
decision on the status of the IRA cease-fire this week.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists who represent the Protestant majority in Northern
Ireland immediately seized on Flanagan's comments to argue that
Mowlam had no alternative but to declare the IRA had violated its
cease-fire and to issue sanctions, including the halt of early
releases for IRA prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinn Fein leaders insist the IRA's cease-fire is still
intact and said if sanctions are issued for unproven allegations
against the IRA, the party would boycott the review of the peace
process that former US Senator George Mitchell of Maine is
scheduled to convene beginning Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a rift between Dublin and London emerged when Irish
foreign minister David Andrews said his government believed the IRA
cease-fire remained intact. But Mowlam, who was addressing a group
of reporters with Andrews, immediately contradicted her Irish
counterpart. She said she still needed information from the Irish
police and authorities in the United States about whether the IRA
was involved in a gun-smuggling plot discovered last month when
weapons bought in Florida were seized in Ireland and England.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Bennett, 22, reputedly an IRA member, was found July
25. In a killing that bore the hallmarks of an IRA execution, he
had been gagged, bound and shot in the back of the head. No one has
been charged with his murder.
</P>
<P>
   There have been conflicting reports about a possible motive for
the murder. Some have claimed Bennett was suspected of being a
police informer. Some republican sources have suggested that
Bennett was shot because he had taken weapons from an IRA arms dump
and was aligned with a group of dissidents who oppose the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Bennett was killed because he posed a threat to the
cease-fire, Mowlam faces accusations that she is turning a blind
eye to murder if she decides that the IRA's killing of its own does
not amount to a violation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has studiously avoided use of the word ``cease-fire,''
saying only that it has halted ``military operations,'' meaning
attacks on British security forces. While the IRA has not
explicitly said so, it is widely believed that the IRA believes
that its use of violence against its members and so-called
``antisocial elements'' in its community is not a violation of its
commitment. The IRA and its loyalist counterparts have continued to
dole out beatings to petty criminals and others who run afoul of
the paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Flanagan's comments, Andrew Mackay, the Conservative
shadow secretary for Northern Ireland, called on Prime Minister
Tony Blair to halt the early release of IRA prisoners mandated
under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 that Mitchell brokered in
an effort to end 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinn Fein's national chairman, Mitchel McLaughlin, said
Flanagan's opinion had been proven wrong before. Sinn Fein was
temporarily excluded from the negotiations that led to the Good
Friday Agreement after Flanagan concluded that the IRA had murdered
a Belfast man last year. The charges against three IRA men for that
murder were subsequently dropped.

EMPLOYERS ARE RESORTING TO UNUSUAL APPEALS TO ATTRACT WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The sack from a drive-through window at
Winstead's held a hamburger, a napkin and a flier urging me to work
there.
</P>
<P>
   At a Chili's restaurant I hoisted my ice water and read ``Would
you like a job with that?'' printed on the drink coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Help-wanted signs in windows and employment ads aren't filling
the jobs that need filling, especially in the service industry. So
employers are resorting to unusual appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sabina, area director for Chili's restaurants, says it's
hard to know if coaster messages attract workers, ``but at least
they give people something to think about.'' That may be half the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda LeMaster, Winstead's district manager, thinks her sack
fliers work. ``They'll take 'em home and two or three days later
we'll get a call,'' she said. ``I've hired two managers that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hirers are advertising incentives such as tuition
assistance and quick vesting in profit-sharing plans. And starting
pay often works out to be about $7 an hour; employers say they
can't attract good workers at the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for employees isn't limited to entry-level service
industry work, though. At American Century Investments, employees
are earning bonuses of $250 to $10,000 for helping the company fill
positions. Yes, $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what an ``architecture and data warehouse'' job in
the information technologies field entails, but if I did _ and if I
worked at American Century _ I could get $10,000 for finding the
right person for that job on the company's critical-need list.
</P>
<P>
   Employees last year earned $400,000 in referral bonuses for
successfully suggesting 270 persons for job openings at the mutual
fund company. So far in 1999, they've earned $89,000 for 123
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Employees get half the bonus after the new hire has completed 30
days on the job and half after the new hire completes a year _ just
to make sure the referral lasts.
</P>
<P>
   John Guzman, who provides customer service and technical support
for American Century's Web site, is $2,500 richer for referring
five new employees. The company's reigning referral king, Guzman
said he really hadn't become a headhunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know me and know my seven years in the financial
services industry could tell that I thought I was in a more
pleasant place to work,'' said Guzman, who has been at American
Century two years. ``When they're looking for a job, they give me
their resumes, I give them to the right people, and all but one of
the people I referred were accepted and ended up working here.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman proves that the best employment advocates are people who
like working there. Having a friend say, ``Come work here,'' is
more direct than hoping strangers respond to pieces of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bartlett, American Century senior vice president-human
resources, said the company ran the numbers and the referral
bonuses ``are far and away the most cost-effective return on our
investment'' in terms of looking for and hiring workers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, everybody benefits when 3,000 employees become
employment ambassadors.

 &HT;    Federal government should keep its nose out of schools
 &HT;    By Jim Wooten
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Standing resolutely in the schoolhouse doorway, his
jaw fixed, President Bill Clinton refuses to budge, to move an
inch, until America admits the federal government to the
neighborhood classroom.
</P>
<P>
   He is beside himself with dejection and frustration, determined
that sooner or later the public will see that the federal
government belongs in what is, has been and should remain, a state
and local issue.
</P>
<P>
   The latest pretense for federal intervention is a report from
his education department that public and private school enrollment
in grades K-12 will total 53.2 million, up half a million over last
school year. Immigration and a 1980s rise in births are the
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   That rise, as Clinton sees it, is cause for the federal
government to invent a program _ though during the baby boom years,
when state and local governments were strapped for cash to meet
exploding demand, Congress properly declined to intervene.
Traditionally, the federal role has focused on disadvantaged
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our lifetime we have never had a better chance to prepare
American children in American schools for the next century,'' said
Clinton. ``Unfortunately, the congressional majority wants to back
off the commitment we made to hire new teachers and build new
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Those darn Republicans. They prefer to send money to state and
local schools without federal instructions attached.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants federal subsidies for $25 billion in school bonds,
which finance construction of 6,000 new school buildings. ``If the
federal government can help build prisons and roads, there is no
excuse for refusing to provide critical assistance to modernize up
to 6,000 schools,'' said Clinton's education secretary, Richard
Riley. The adminstration and education workplace unions want the
federal government to hire 2.2 million new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Even without federal intervention, spending for school
construction and repair reached a record $17 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, as elsewhere, local school boards and local voters
are managing affairs quite adequately. We responsibly vote to tax
ourselves when the needs are explained. There's not a single
contribution the federal government can bring, except money, and
that it showers foolishly and ineffectively. It is, of course,
money taken from us and returned, minus the cost of agenda-drivers,
regulation-writers and quota-checkers _ none of them locally
located or accountable to the people who are.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow the work of Gov. Roy Barnes' education review
commission and listen to any day's testimony, it is obvious that
there's a plentiful array of expert insight and problem analysis
out there. What's needed is boldness, resolve and a commitment to
tackle any number of related problems _ testing, parental
involvement, choice, new school models, teacher education, teaching
as a second career and dozens more.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Hodges, a 16-year-old junior at Westside High School in
Macon, offered the commission an observation about the HOPE grant
program encouraging students to take easy courses that bears a
look. Physics teacher Jamie Akin had an interesting point to make,
too, about the way we test.
</P>
<P>
   Education doesn't need another chief defining problems, setting
priorities and allocating resources. It needs local people
determined to use their creativity to make one school work. That
can be anybody local. It can't be Washington. And it can't be Bill
Clinton.

NORTH AMERICAN `ICE MAN' DISCOVERED IN GLACIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The hunter appears to have come to a horrible end.
</P>
<P>
   A slip of the foot on a frozen trail _ perhaps just as he was
about to hurl his spear into the flank of some thick-furred quarry
that would have fed his wandering clan _ and the hunter plummeted
to his death in a deep glacial crevasse.
</P>
<P>
   The prehistoric drama might have occurred several thousand years
ago, although, for now, scientists eager to study the human
remains, discovered this month at a receding glacier in British
Columbia, will only speculate that the hunter died before the
arrival of Europeans to the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   His bone knife, spear-thrower, carved walking staff and
woven-cedar hat, all in near-perfect condition, belong to the stone
age.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutchone-speaking Indians of the remote region have given
the ill-fated wanderer a name: ``Kwaday Dan Sinchi,'' or Long Ago
Person Found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the discovery of the hunter _ along with scraps of
leather clothing, weapons, and even a pouch containing dried fish
for a meal never consumed _ in a remote spot on the high barrens in
the extreme northwestern corner of the province has sent a
thunderbolt of excitement through the archaeological world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely appears precontact, definitely before Europeans
reached this part of the world, and definitely an extremely rare
find, perhaps one of the most important ever in northern Canada,''
said Knut Fladmark, professor of archaeology at British Columbia's
Simon Fraser University.
</P>
<P>
   The glacier also disgorged the frozen body of a moose that may
have died at the same time as the ancient hunter, and researchers
are intrigued by the possibility that the creature was the hunter's
prey, and that the deaths of man and beast in the depths of the ice
crevasse are intertwined and will tell a gripping tale.
</P>
<P>
   Implements at the site include the knife, a carved walking
staff, pieces of leather clothing, including fur-lined mittens or
moccasins, and what appears to be a throwing stick used to increase
the velocity and range of a hunting spear.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flesh, muscles, and organs of only the lower
portion of the hunter's torso were preserved by the centuries of
cold, it is most unusual to find ancient human remains with any
soft tissue intact. So Canada's ``Long Ago Person'' is being
compared with the famous 5,000-year-old ``ice man'' discovered in
1991 in the Italian Alps, as well as to more recent finds of
flash-frozen ancient humans in Peru and Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of the first step in the writing of a
history,'' said Greg Hare, archeologist for the government of
Canada's Yukon Territory, shortly after making the trek this week
to the site and assisting in extracting the remains and artifacts
from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Canadian scientists involved seem rather reluctant to
discuss it. Partly, it appears, they simply do not want to
exaggerate claims before starting scientific analysis and
procedures to date the tissue and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   But the reticence of scientists also reflects concern for the
sensitivities of Indians in the region, who have taken a
proprietary view of the corpse, even though it may not belong to
direct ancestors
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, archeology takes a back seat to politics if First
Nation issues are even remotely involved,'' said a scientist close
to the discovery, using the Canadian term for Indians. ``There are
extremely delicate political and legal ramifications to this kind
of discovery. For us, obviously, it's an exciting find that can
advance human knowledge. But some First Nations people might see it
as desecration, and could put up hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of hunter and moose were airlifted by helicopter
Monday from the glacial fields and flown to Whitehorse, Yukon, for
safekeeping in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   The melting blue-ice face of the Tatshenshini-Alsek glacier
yielded the remains on Aug. 14 to a trio of modern-day hunters, all
schoolteachers from British Columbia, who were slogging through the
rugged ice fields 4,921 feet above sea level in quest of dall
sheep, prized for their curly horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a stick where there should have been no stick, realized
it had native markings. . . .Then, on the edge of the glacier, I
saw a tattered human torso,'' said Warren Ward, 52, of Nelson,
British Columbia. ``It sent a chill down my spine, this human
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward and his two companions, Bill Hanlon and Michael Roch, hiked
for two days out of the wilderness to take word of their find to
the Yukon Heritage Branch in Whitehorse.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery site lies within a provincial park, but the
ice-locked realm is recognized as ``traditional territory'' of
Yukon's Champagne-Aishihik tribal band, who number 1,129
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Band leaders journeyed to the site along with archelogists and
other scientists, and uttered traditional prayers over the hunter's
headless remains before the body was delicately prized from the
ground and transported to Whitehorse. Swift action was necessary
because the flesh was starting to decompose, and scavenging animals
also posed a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Although the band wants the body to receive respecful burial in
a traditional ceremony _ and reserves a ``native right'' to ensure
that scientific tests are conducted with dignity _ leaders say they
do not want to block research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person will have much to tell us, to help us understand
our past, and the history of our homeland,'' said Bob Charlie,
chief of the band. ``We should use this situation, what appears to
be an ancient tragedy, to learn more about this person.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's cooperative stance has encouraged scientists who were
made anxious by a 1996 controversy in which US Indians blocked
attempts to analyze a skeleton found near Kennewick, Wash., and
thought to be 9,000 years old. Indian activists insisted the
remains were sacred and that tests by scientists represented an
affront by an alien culture.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, it will be months and perhaps years before scientists
can answer questions about who the mysterious hunter might have
been and when he died, which should be narrowed down to within a
century or less.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis now is that the remains probably date to at least
1500 B.C., and are probably much older. The curious cedar hat, for
example, is similar to one discovered in Washington state and dated
to about 2000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remains could be several thousand years old, but it's way
too soon to pin down,'' said Al Mackie, a government archeologist
who was among the first scientists to the site. ``Obviously, we're
very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Another assumption is that the hunter was an aboriginal. The
Champagne-Aishihiks are claiming him as one of their own, although
tribal history prior to this century is oral and vague as to dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is one of our ancestors no matter how old he
might be,'' said Ron Chambers, a council member, noting that
present-day hunters of the band still use a foot trail that passes
near the discovery site. ``Time goes on forever with our people.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the material used in the hunter's clothing or tools
hints of any influence from European visitors, so archeologists are
confident the remains are at least several centuries old. Knowledge
of the region's prehistory suggests it is unlikely the remains go
back farther than 10,000 years, at the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is no way to pin down a date until tests are
done, and scientists have yet to agree with tribal elders on what
sorts of analysis can be completed. DNA testing, pollen analysis,
and carbon dating are the most probable possibilities.

BUSH ATTORNEYS TO QUESTION FIRED TEXAS FUNERAL DIRECTOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a new tactic to fight an unwanted subpoena,
attorneys for Gov. George W. Bush are seeking to interrogate fired
Texas Funeral Service Commission director Eliza May and force her
to reveal any damning evidence against the governor, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The motion filed this week by Attorney General John Cornyn
asserts that May should be questioned immediately to reveal the
factual basis of her whistle blower lawsuit, which has garnered
national media attention in recent weeks because of Bush's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   May sued the agency and others in February alleging she was
wrongfully terminated after aggressively pursuing regulatory
matters involving funeral executives who are political allies of
Bush. The charges are denied by the state agency and defendants,
including Houston-based funeral services provider Service
Corporation International and chief executive officer Robert
Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing has been set for Friday in Travis County district
court to review the unusual request from Bush, who is not a
defendant in May's lawsuit. Another hearing is set for Monday to
determine whether May can force Bush to give a deposition in her
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliza May has no evidence for her motion'' to compel a Bush
deposition, said Cornyn spokesman Ted Delisi. ``We want to talk to
her about her so-called evidence. That's why we're expediting the
process before Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state stands ready to defend Gov. Bush from this frivolous
lawsuit,'' he said, adding, ``the evidence she cites are newspaper
articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Delisi said ``you can expect the state to forcefully argue this
case, and possibly to argue for sanctions against Ms. May for
filing a questionable motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, in addition to filing a motion seeking
Bush's sworn testimony, May asked a judge to hold Bush in contempt
of court for submitting what she called a false statement in
connection with litigation. Bush filed an affidavit swearing he
knew nothing about the regulatory disputes that led to May's firing
by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   May contends that Bush was aware of the dispute and demonstrated
that knowledge last year when he made a quick comment to SCI
representatives who were visiting his staff. One of the SCI
officials recounted the conversation to Newsweek, causing May's
attorney's to assert that Bush was lying in his recent sworn denial
_ a charge also denied by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorney, Charles Herring Jr. of Austin, could not be
reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, May's lawyer has filed new subpoenas seeking to
compel Bush, one of his spokesmen and two SCI representatives to
attend Monday's court hearing.

NEW MASSPORT CHIEF HAS NO AVIATION EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Virginia Buckingham, soon to become chief executive of
the state agency that runs Logan International Airport, the eighth
largest in the country, has no experience in aviation nor managing
a large business.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Massachusetts Port Authority, long known as a bastion
of political patronage and intrigue, Buckingham will follow a
string of predecessors who had no prior knowledge of running an
airport, either.
</P>
<P>
   Recently ousted Peter Blute fit that profile. So did Stephen
Tocco and Al Raine, who held the job before Blute.
</P>
<P>
   To some aviation consultants and others with on-the-tarmac
experience, however, an airport background is not as important as
political savvy, skillful negotiating, and a quick brain to pilot
the agency through the state's tricky bureaucratic waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive director's job at Massport is one where, I
think, the top qualification is to be politically astute in terms
of how you get things done in the commonwealth,'' said Kevin
Dillon, who recently resigned as Massport's director of aviation
operations to become chief executive at Manchester Airport in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's a requirement to have specific knowledge
of airport operations. You have a lot of officials at Massport who
have that knowledge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham, chief of staff for Governor Paul Cellucci, certainly
has political connections. She also served former Governor William
F. Weld as chief of staff, managed his unsuccessful challenge
against US Senator John F. Kerry, and previously served as press
aide for both Weld and Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   And Buckingham, 33, says she also has the ability to learn on a
grinding job that mixes politics, high finance and numbing
technical detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I'm a quick study,'' Buckingham said. But more
importantly, she added, the agency ``needs a leader who can
communicate its agenda effectively and bring consensus around those
objectives. I'm first and foremost a communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical expertise needed to run Logan Airport and the port
of Boston is vested in other administrators, Buckingham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Massport needed was someone who was steeped in
that side of the business and would have failed at the
communication and political side,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But other aviation consultants and observers argued that
knowledge of the aviation industry, even if learned for the job, is
also a vital piece of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand what the airlines are trying to do. You
have to understand that Massport's trying to rebuild the airport,
and what that means to people coming to the airport. You have to
understand the Federal Aviation Administration,'' said Bob Weiss,
editor of the independently published Boston Airport Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely complex job. It's a job that, to a degree,
she'll have to learn as she goes along. The landscape changes all
the time. It's a 24-hour-a-day job,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Blute, added Weiss, Buckingham appears to have the skills
to be effective. But Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant from
Colorado who has done work for several major US airports, said that
her political appointment is ``outrageous'' for a facility as large
and important as Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the biggest problems we have with airport
authorities: They become picnic grounds for political patronage,''
Boyd said. ``That doesn't take away anything from the woman
involved, but managing an airport takes a tremendous amount of
strategic planning. It takes a great deal of technical expertise.
And if you have someone who is dancing to a political tune, the
result will be political.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Boyd said, placing airports under independent
authorities is gaining momentum around the country.

LAWSUIT CLAIMS U.S. BORDER OPERATION HARMING ENDANGERED WILDCATS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ A trio of environmental groups sued the
federal government Wednesday, contending a U.S. Border Patrol
containment operation using high-intensity lights and other tactics
along the Rio Grande is harming two endangered wildcats who prowl
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit to protect ocelots and jaguarundi, filed by the
Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club and the Frontera Audubon
Society, opposes an expansion of Operation Rio Grande, including
brush removal, road paving, fencing and permanent installation of
stadium lights along a 50-mile stretch of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting up these lights along the river disturbs these
nocturnal cats . . . since they carry on their living at night,''
said Mary Lou Campbell, conservation director of the Frontera
Audubon Society. ``When the lights are turned on they are confused.
It disturbs their ordinary patterns of travel, feeding and
hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Operation Rio Grande was launched in August 1997 and greatly
increased the Border Patrol's presence along the river in South
Texas. Hundreds of new agents have been hired to stand watch on
river levees, brush has been cleared, boat ramps cut into river
banks and a network of mobile light stations have been trained on
the riverside at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fences and lights are going to prevent the remaining wild
ocelots and jaguarundis in the region from dispersing and
increasing their population sizes,'' said a statement from Dr.
Melissa Grigione, a conservation biologist with the Defenders
group.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charges the Justice Department and a subordinate
agency, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, along with the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has violated the Endangered Species
Act and the National Environmental Policy Act by not considering
the impact their border enforcement activities have on endangered
species in the areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks are supposed to be protecting us and our borders,
not destroying rare cat habitat,'' said a statement by Roger
Schlickeisen, president of the Washington-based Defenders of
Wildlife. ``INS and the Army Corps have legal obligations under the
ESA and the NEPA that they have not lived up to, and we intend to
make sure they do.''
</P>
<P>
   INS spokesman Russ Burgeron said the agency would not comment on
the lawsuit, but local Border Patrol officials say they have
received no complaints from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't even called us to ask us about it, or voice their
concerns,'' said Letty Garza, the spokeswoman for the McAllen
sector of the Border Patrol. ``Our chief has an open-door policy,
and he is willing to sit down and listen to their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We understand, and don't want to destroy our
environment, but we want to protect our community. We think that's
just as important. We don't want border bandits, we don't want
smugglers _ both alien and drug smugglers _ to overrun the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, questioned the priorities of
the environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine a group that would value the habits of a
nocturnal ocelot over keeping drugs out of our country that are
preying on our children,'' Hutchison said Wednesday. ``The INS is
trying to put controls up at the border that would keep illegal
drugs and illegal aliens from encroaching on our people and our
country, and we have got to have the ability to control our
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison stressed the endangered cats are not being killed by
the border control project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty miles of floodlights along the Rio Grande will impact
everything from moths to butterflies to birds, bats and cats,''
said Jim Chapman, chairman of the Lower Rio Grande Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the border operations could harm the Lower
Rio Grande Valley Wildlife corridor _ an expensive and lengthy
effort to create a wildlife refuge along the river _ and the
millions it generates from tourists interested in birding and other
wildlife watching.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the Interior Department has spent millions of
dollars to purchase more than 130,000 acres currently a part of the
four-county refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize they (Border Patrol) have a mission. What we want
them to do is not to tear down something that has been built over
several decades,'' said Campbell, the Audubon official, referring
to the wildlife corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there are better ways, more sophisticated ways of
dealing with the lighting issue other than burning a light. There
is infrared (surveillance equipment) which doesn't seem to bother
the cats, and electronic sensors,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990's, the Frontera Audubon Society and the Sierra
Club filed suit to halt brush-clearing operations along sections of
the Rio Grande corridor by the International Boundary and Water
Commission. The lawsuit was settled after the IBWC agreed to limit
the brush cutting, part of a flood control project.
</P>
<P>
   The clash over the river will doubtless be raised during a Sept.
1 visit by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, who travels to
Brownsville to speak at the two-year anniversary of Operation Rio
Grande.

NASA CHOOSES SPOT FOR MARS PROBE TO LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a high plateau near the south pole of Mars, where thick
deposits of dry ice form every winter and evaporate every spring, a
NASA spacecraft called Mars Polar Lander will touch down gently
this December, if all goes well.
</P>
<P>
   There on that plateau, the Lander will try to unlock the
mysteries of the planet's enigmatic polar terrain, with its
hundreds of alternating layers that testify to a long history of
dramatic shifts in climate.
</P>
<P>
   Mars, which today has air so thin that it approximates a vacuum,
and whose surface is almost always colder and drier than any place
on Earth, was once a much wetter, warmer place, it seems; ancient
river channels and slushy craters appear to dot and cross the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The planet's changing climate may have gone through thousands of
dramatic cycles _ perhaps similar to Earth's ice ages _ over the
eons, but nobody is quite sure when these changes took place, or
what caused them.
</P>
<P>
   Polar Lander's job is to try to begin the job of figuring out
the answers, which may provide insights about climatic shifts on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after a process of analyzing pictures and topographic
data from the Mars Global Surveyor, an orbiting craft that began
its formal mission in March, NASA announced its selection of the
site, which is near Mars' south pole. The lander is scheduled to
touch down there on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists spent months evaluating the information,
trying to balance the need for a smooth, safe landing site with the
scientists' eagerness to get as close as possible to the polar ice
cap and its enigmatic features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a landing site that we believe will accomplish our
scientific objectives,'' a Polar Lander project scientist, Richard
Zurek, said at a press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainties of how the thin Martian air will
slow the craft as it makes its initial descent by parachute, the
landing could take place anywhere along an ellipse about 120 miles
long, Zurek said. But the site selected, he said, is so smooth that
its altitude never varies by more than 120 feet throughout that
area.
</P>
<P>
   The landing trajectory would bring the craft right on the polar
region's layered terrain, which consists of hundreds of alternating
light and dark horizontal bands, like an oversized layer cake.
</P>
<P>
   These bands on the edges of the plateau, first visible in
relatively low-resolution images taken by the twin Viking orbiters
in 1976, are so numerous and so thin that every new camera capable
of showing greater detail has revealed more and more of them. They
are believed to be made up of differing proportions of ice, sand
and dust, apparently deposited over millions of years of cycles of
freezing and thawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this layered terrain is a record of climate changes
on Mars, and in a sense, digging into its surface will be like
reading tree rings or layers in an ice core,'' Zurek said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the lander itself, as it approaches Mars, Polar
Lander will also deploy two penetrating probes about the size of
lawn darts. The two probes will bury themselves in the Martian soil
through the force of impact, each about 30 miles away from the
lander. There, they will study the water content of the soil and
radio back information.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the lander, these ``microprobes'' will provide
basic information about three different spots near the pole, in
case there turn out to be large differences between nearby places
in the complex terrain.
</P>
<P>
   In its three months of operation, which will take place in a
period of perpetual sunlight in this polar region, the craft will
also take samples of soil and test their composition and water
content. This could reveal the presence of minerals that were
formed in bodies of standing water.
</P>
<P>
   If such signs are found, it would be the first direct proof that
such bodies of water did exist for extended periods in the early
history of Mars _ and thus could improve the odds that life may
have arisen there.
</P>
<P>
   Polar Lander will arrive in the local late spring, soon after a
layer of frozen carbon dioxide _ dry ice _ has evaporated away from
the landing site. (Dry ice turns directly into vapor, instead of
melting to a liquid first, a process technically known as
``subliming.'') The craft will cease operation about three months
later, when the seasons progress and darkness returns to the site
and leaves its solar panels unable to provide enough power.
</P>
<P>
   But just before that happens, Zurek said, ``we may see the first
returns of the seasonal carbon dioxide ice.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the primary landing site, the scientists also
chose a backup site nearby, and they will continue to monitor new
pictures sent back by Mars Global Surveyor. If any unexpected
problems show up in the primary landing site, such as sharp peaks
or deep valleys not seen in the earlier images, it would still be
possible to switch to the backup site as late as mid-October, they
said.

CRITICS PAN `MOZART EFFECT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The much-ballyhooed ``Mozart effect,'' a reported boost in IQ
test performance after listening to the 18th-century master's
elegantly ordered music, has come under sharp attack.
</P>
<P>
   In critiques published Thursday, a Harvard psychologist and a
North Carolina group have concluded that the ``Mozart effect'' is
much smaller than its discoverers and proponents have claimed, if
it exists at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A requiem may be in order,'' the North Carolina researchers
concluded after failing to replicate the Mozart effect in three
different trials.
</P>
<P>
   At most, listening to Mozart increased college students'
performance on certain tests of geometric reasoning tasks by only
2.1 IQ points _ well below the normal variation one might expect if
the same person took the same test on two occasions _ said
Christopher Chabris, a Harvard Medical School psychologist who
analyzed 16 different studies of the Mozart effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the mother of the Mozart effect, University of Wisconsin
psychologist Frances H. Rauscher, criticized her critics, claiming
that the debunking studies were themselves flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because some people cannot get bread to rise does not negate
the existence of a `yeast effect,' '' Rauscher writes in the
current issue of the British journal Nature, which published the
critical studies.
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher's original study on the Mozart effect, published in
1993, found an 8- to 9-point jump in such spatial test scores after
subjects listened to 10 minutes of a Mozart piano sonata (but not
after 10 minutes of silence or a relaxation tape). The effect wore
off quickly, but the observation led to an explosion of studies and
claims about the beneficial effects of Mozart and other classical
music on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher acknowledged in an interview that popularizers have
taken her findings on the Mozart effect to silly extremes. A
veritable industry of publishers and pundits has sprung up to
convince parents they are remiss if they don't expose their
toddlers to Mozart. Three states (Georgia, South Dakota, and
Tennessee) currently send new mothers home from the hospital with
classical music CDs on the assumption that doing so will produce
smarter citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has gone wild producing music for babies,''
Rauscher said, adding that merely listening to music _ as opposed
to playing an instrument or singing _ is unlikely to produce ``any
lasting effect'' on intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nicer to see the money spent on music education
programs,'' Rauscher said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Rauscher's early studies on the Mozart
effect turns on such questions as whether she and her colleagues
claimed an across-the-board improvement in IQ scores from music
exposure. Chabris said they did, so he included studies that tested
music's effect on general IQ. Rauscher asserts they didn't make any
claims about general IQ effects, but restricted their claims to
tests of spatial skills of the sort used in playing chess, drawing,
or designing buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Chabris also said any slight effect of music on cognitive test
scores should be attributed to a general arousal of attention that
occurs when one is engaged in a pleasurable activity _ not to a
``priming'' of specific brain circuits involved in mental imagery
that are also stimulated by Mozart's well-ordered music, as
Rauscher theorizes.
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher counters that recent experiments by herself and others
makes Chabris's ``enjoyment arousal'' notion implausible. For
instance, she has reported that rats exposed to Mozart before birth
and for the first 60 days of life ran mazes faster and with fewer
errors.
</P>
<P>
   John Hughes of the University of Illinois, Rauscher notes, has
found that Mozart calms abnormal EEG patterns in the brains of
comatose epilepsy patients, an effect that could not be caused by
emotional state or arousal.
</P>
<P>
   Chabris Wednesday shot back that ``neither studies with rats and
comatose patients, nor references to yeast and bread, are
relevant'' to his analysis of 16 studies involving more than 700
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is likely to go on, given the interest that
Rauscher's studies have aroused.
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher and her colleagues have devoted their recent attention
to the effect of musical training on children's mathematical and
geometric skills. She reported this week at the American
Psychological Association meeting in Boston that studying piano for
at least a year enhances young children's ability to understand
mathematical concepts such as ratios and geometric proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really worried that people will lump together the Nature
papers with new studies that are quite robust showing that music
instruction improves children's spatial-temporal abilities,''
Rauscher said.

   ATLANTA _ The economic collapse of Southeast Asia shocked the
world two years ago, creating fears of a worldwide depression. Now
the news is how strongly that region has recovered, according to
The Economist (Aug. 27).
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines
have ``genuine and quite vigorous'' economic recoveries, the
magazine says. Even Indonesia, which has had the worst experience,
shows glimmers of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   As for how these countries rebounded so rapidly, The Economist
points out that while they slumped, the United States continued to
boom and to consume their products.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the world's money markets adjusted to the situation and
not only restrained the spread of Asia's problems but moved
investment capital back into the region.
</P>
<P>
   How high the Dow?
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing Wall Street analysts agree on is that
common stocks are highly valued, meaning they are selling at prices
that may not be justified by corporate profit growth, and
vulnerable to a sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, says The Atlantic Monthly (September). If stocks were
accurately valued, the Dow Jones industrial average would be
trading far above its current level.
</P>
<P>
   The article is authored by two members of the American
Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, who say stocks are
``in the midst of a one-time-only rise to much higher ground.''
</P>
<P>
   They criticize traditional methods of valuing stocks, such as
the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, as outdated. Their substitute
is a formula based on how much money a stock is expected to earn
for its owner over a period of time, which produces what they call
the stock's ``perfectly reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   Using their method, they figure today's Dow should be between
27,000 and 54,000.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning
</P>
<P>
   _ Women aren't the only ones struggling to balance work and
family, says Forbes (Sept. 6). What are employers doing to help men
suffering from ``daddy stress''? The phenomenon has occurred as
more men divide their time between work and family, as their
spouses were doing. It is one cause of corporate turnover, Forbes
says.
</P>
<P>
   _ After three straight years of dismal performance, most mutual
fund managers are finally doing what they get paid to do _ beat the
market _ Smart Money (September) says in a special mutual funds
edition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Junk bonds got a bad name in the 1980s, which most Wall Street
pros think was undeserved. Bloomberg Personal Finance (September)
profiles Merrill Lynch's junk _ or high-yield _ bond mutual fund,
which, it says, may reduce risk when added to an investment
portfolio.

mind, this time not as a Republican, a Mormon, or a soldier _ but
as an openly gay man. His denunciation of an anti-gay bill and its
right-wing sponsor triggered one of the more unusual investigations
under President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy toward

UNDER PRESSURE, WHITE HOUSE TO PULL TROOPS FROM HAITI
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from the Pentagon and Republicans in
Congress to reduce military commitments overseas, the Clinton
administration plans to withdraw the last American troops stationed
in Haiti, even though peace there remains tenuous at best, Defense
Department and administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American troops _ 480 people, including engineers, doctors
and nurses and a security force from the Army's 82nd Airborne
Division _ are the remnants of the force of 20,000 that occupied
Haiti beginning in September 1994 to restore the elected government
of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House has not yet announced its decision, a
withdrawal of the remaining force, which cost more than $20 million
a year, is expected to be completed by the end of the year, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the Pentagon will continue to send smaller
contingents of reservists and national guard members to Haiti each
year on short, temporary assignments, like those in other Caribbean
and Central American nations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller U.N. contingent of roughly 400 peacekeepers acting as
advisers to the Haitian police will not be affected. But the troop
withdrawal will end a continuous American military presence in
Haiti, something that officials in Haiti and advocates in
Washington consider important to help Haiti's troubled democratic
transition succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very large number of troops, but it's not the size
that is critical,'' said Donald E. Schulz, a former analyst at the
U.S. Army War College who has long studied Haiti. ``It's the
psychological presence. It can be argued that it is a deterrent to
those who would try to destabilize the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission in Haiti is only one of several international
military operations that the Pentagon has pressed the
administration to reduce. With the nation's armed services having
shrunk to 1.3 million men and women on active duty, a 36 percent
drop from a decade ago, senior commanders have begun warning that
the frequency of operations _ from Korea to Kosovo _ is stretching
the military thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concerted effort all over the world to look at our
commitments and ask ourselves, `Do we still need to be there?'''
Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, the Pentagon has drawn up plans to reduce the
American peacekeeping force to fewer than 4,000 troops, compared to
6,200 today. That reduction is part of a larger NATO plan, expected
to be completed next month, that would reduce the number of
international troops in Bosnia to 18,000 or 19,000, from more than
30,000 today and 60,000 when the NATO-led force first went there in
December 1995 to help stabilize the region after several years of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is also pressing the administration to scale back
the American role in the long-standing multinational observer force
in the Sinai Peninsula, where about 900 soldiers help monitor the
peace treaty Egypt and Israel signed in 1982. A decision on that
mission is not expected soon and probably would not come without a
breakthrough in the Middle East peace process, one defense official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose the reductions say the administration is
sacrificing its own foreign policy objectives to pressure from
Pentagon commanders overly worried about the strain on the military
and the drain on its budget, and from Republicans lawmakers who
consider peacekeeping missions a distraction from traditional war
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Hooper, the executive director of the Balkans Action
Council, said that the reductions in Bosnia could undercut progress
in bringing about a lasting peace, just at the point when
international administrators are making a push to have thousands of
Bosnian refugees return to their homes before the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enough to keep the lid on Bosnia so the war doesn't begin
again,'' Hooper said of the Pentagon's plan for a smaller
contingent. ``It's not enough to accomplish their mission, which is
to create a unitary Bosnia state that allows all the refugees to
return home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Bang-Jensen, a lawyer with the Coalition for International
Justice in Washington, said a reduction would make it even less
likely that all the war-crime suspects still at large in Bosnia
would be arrested. ``I don't know anyone who thinks the job is
done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, too, the job is far from done. Although the American
intervention five years ago forced the military junta led by Lt.
Gen. Raoul Cedras to step aside and allow Aristide to take office,
little has happened since then to reverse Haiti's standing as the
poorest country in the hemisphere and one of the least stable.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Aristide's successor as President, Rene
Preval, dissolved the country's parliament and began ruling by
decree. The political instability has also been matched by an
increase in violence and, according to intelligence reports, drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the commander of American forces in Latin America,
Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm of the Marine Corps, recommended
withdrawing the last of the American military force because of the
increasing political turmoil. At the time, he warned of an
increased risk to the troops from shootings and other violence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the United States has steadily reduced its military
presence. The 480 troops left operate primarily in Haiti's capital,
Port-au-Prince, maintaining a small base at the airport and running
a hospital. Most of the troops are engineers, who in the last year
built or rebuilt seven schools, or medical personnel, who last year
treated 45,000 Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials said that the decision to
end the permanent presence in no way reflected a lessening of
American interest. The reserve and guard units will continue to go
to Haiti for periods of a week or two at a time to provide medical
care, build roads or offer other humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Although no schedule has been set, the officials said that
perhaps six detachments would be sent to Haiti next year as part of
the Pentagon's ``New Horizons'' missions across Central America and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Quiqley, the Pentagon spokesman, said the United States would
have ``a frequent presence, thought not a continuous one.'' He
added that the reserve and guard missions could expand humanitarian
projects to more sites across the country, including rural areas
not reached now by the American force, which remains close to
Port-au-Prince because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of troops in Haiti is a mere fraction of the
1.3 million men and women now on active duty, the deployment has an
impact nonetheless on the military's readiness, Pentagon officials
said. For every soldier stationed overseas, there is another who
has just returned and another getting ready to go _ and still more
devoted to providing transportation, supplies or other
administrative needs. In many cases, sending troops overseas can
break up large units, as is the case with the soldiers from the
82nd Airborne.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of operations growing since the end of the Cold
War, highlighted most recently by the deployment of 7,000 soldiers
and marines in Kosovo, senior officials at the Pentagon, starting
with Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, have become more vocal
in pushing for an end to long-running missions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is also facing pressure from Congress. In the
case of Haiti, Republicans in the House approved an amendment to
the defense authorization bill in June that would have mandated a
withdrawal by December. While the Senate did not include the
provision, negotiators have agreed on language to force a
withdrawal by next May and expect both houses to approve it when
Congress returns next month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House's Select
Committee on Intelligence, said the decision to withdraw reflected
``a belated dawning'' on the administration that the mission in
Haiti was now simply draining resources that could be better spent
elsewhere.

$20 MILLION SEIZED IN RUSSIAN MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About $20 million has been seized in two Bank of New
York accounts linked to what authorities believe is a major
money-laundering operation, law enforcement officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that both accounts had been opened under the
name of Benex, which investigators believe has ties to Russian
organized crime. One account held about $16 million, and the other
held about $4 million, they said. Law enforcement officials believe
that more than $4.2 billion was funneled through Benex accounts at
the Bank of New York from last October to March.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the accounts were seized on Monday afternoon
by officers with the Russian Organized Crime Task Force, a
long-standing partnership between the FBI and the New York City
Police Department. The task force is looking at other accounts at
the bank, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies refused to comment on the seizure. Joe Valiquette,
a spokesman for the FBI, said he could not even confirm any
money-laundering investigation, and Frank Scarangella, a spokesman
for the Bank of New York, said he could not comment ``on anything
related to the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the bank said in a statement that it ``has
been cooperating with the office of the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York in a confidential investigation of
the use of bank facilities to transfer funds from Russia to other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the bank, nor any of its employees, has been accused of
wrongdoing, and the bank has continued to operate as usual. Since
the bank confirmed the investigation last Wednesday, its stock
price has risen $1, closing Wednesday at $38 7/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior bank employees _ Lucy Edwards of London and Natasha
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky of New York _ have been suspended pending the
outcome of the investigation. Both have declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, a vice president in the Eastern European division,
is married to Benex's owner, Peter Berlin. The company went into
business in London as Benex Worldwide Ltd. in May 1998 and almost
immediately attracted attention from British investigators. By last
June, British authorities had contacted the FBI about possible
money-laundering through Benex accounts at the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, 44, appears to have operated his company in part from a
telephone and personal computer in a house in Queens. Efforts to
locate him have been unsuccessful.

JUDGE DELAYS DECISION ON DEFENSE MOTIONS IN DRAGGING DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A state judge has delayed consideration of a
defense motion to throw out a statement made by one of three white
men charged with capital murder in the brutal dragging death of a
black man.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden also said Wednesday he will
delay a defense motion to remove Jasper County District Attorney
Guy James Gray as lead prosecutor in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Golden delayed the rulings after Gray said he doesn't know if he
will introduce the statement during the trial of Shawn Allen Berry,
24, which is scheduled to begin in October.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn said the statement
made by Berry early the morning after he was arrested in the June
7, 1998, murder of James Byrd Jr. was tainted because Gray had
offered Berry special treatment if he made a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Co-defendants John William ``Bill'' King, 24, and Lawrence
Russell Brewer Jr., 32, never made any statements to investigators.
King was sentenced to death in February. Jury selection in Brewer's
trial begins next week in Bryan. Gray said he is also seeking the
death penalty in the remaining trials.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said it was highly unusual for the district attorney to
be at the sheriff's office at 4:30 a.m. while a defendant is being
questioned. Gray said in small counties like Jasper County, the
district attorney's staff often works closely with local law
enforcement to help prosecute cases.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said no promises of special treatment were ever made to
Berry.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sheriff Billy Rowles did tell Berry that at that time
investigators thought the dragging death might be prosecuted as
some sort of federal civil rights case. Rowles told Berry that the
person who first cooperates with investigators usually got the best
shake when it comes to prosecution. The sheriff promised that if
Berry cooperated he would tell federal prosecutors about the
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's statement was used by investigators to draft a
show-cause statement to seek search and arrest warrants for the
three defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In it Berry gives a chilling account of picking up Byrd as he
stumbled home from a party. A witness later said he saw Byrd in the
back of a pickup occupied by two or three white persons.
</P>
<P>
   Berry told of going to a remote spot in the woods and of the
other two defendants savagely beating Byrd and chaining him to the
back of the pickup. He first said he ran away from the scene and
later said he tried to keep the others from beating Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he may never introduce the statement. He said he has
enough DNA and other evidence to convict Berry without the
statement. The statement will only be used if Berry testifies, Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said he now plans to call Berry to the stand during his
trial. If what he says disagrees with the written statement, Gray
said, prosecutors will introduce the statement to show Berry lied.
</P>
<P>
   But Hawthorn said that if the state tries to introduce the
statement, he will call Gray to the stand to testify about promises
that may have been made to induce Berry to give it. Gray would then
be disqualified because he can't be both a prosecutor and a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he could only be called to testify if the statement is
introduced without Berry's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As lawyers argued about the issues, Berry sat looking like a
young college student, wearing a tie, dark blazer and khaki
trousers instead of the Jasper County Jail overalls he has worn
since his arrest the night after Byrd's decapitated body was found
on a rural road about 15 miles from Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Several friends and family members sat and offered support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look like he belongs here,'' said his fiance,
Christie Marcontell, mother of their 2-year-old son. The pair were
to have been married Aug. 22, but put off those plans after the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not like those other two,'' she said. ``He's not a
racist. He's not a murderer.''

WHITE HOUSE WARNS OF CONSEQUENCES OF GOP TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Republicans are using the waning days of the
summer to woo Americans with their $792 billion tax cut proposal,
the White House responded Wednesday by saying the GOP plan, among
other dire consequences, would force $41 billion in Medicare cuts
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would ``leave America permanently in debt''
and would siphon nearly $100 billion from such voter favorites as
Medicare, farm support, child support enforcement and veterans'
benefits, President Clinton said in letters sent Wednesday to House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, citing figures from a White House budget office
report, was in response to a letter from Hastert and Lott last week
urging Clinton to support the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeated his threat to veto the tax package, which
passed Congress earlier this month. ``It would be irresponsible''
to sign it, wrote Clinton, who is vacationing on in Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that Americans deserve a tax cut, and that the
country _ with a robust economy and an estimated $3 trillion budget
surplus over the coming decade _ can afford to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says the budget can't bear the hit of a $792
billion cut, and is proposing a tax cut of about $250 billion over
10 years. Clinton says the surplus money should be used to shore up
Medicare and Social Security and reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is set to resume in earnest when Congress returns
Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   What their opponents call ``Mediscare'' campaigns may have
helped the Democrats win votes in the past, some analysts say, but
the tactic might not work as well in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cutting-Social Security-and-Medicare bogeyman doesn't have
the same resonance it used to have,'' said Glen Bolger, a
Republican pollster. ``People have become inured to these kinds of
scare tactics after all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the analysis of the Republican tax cut bill released
Wednesday by the Office of Management and Budget alarmed the
Massachusetts Hospital Association, whose members are still
suffering from about $2 billion in Medicare cuts from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more example of why a massive tax cut would be
an irresponsible act,'' said Judy Glasser, a spokeswoman for the
hospital group. The Medicare cuts of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act
``have had a devastating effect,'' and the full impact has not even
hit yet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The OMB report was simply a routine report on the budget, OMB
director Jacob Lew told reporters Wednesday. Several times a year,
the agency projects what, if any, budget cuts must be made to
comply with the legally mandated budget targets. The government
cannot pick and choose which items must be cut; budget laws require
across-the-board cuts if certain spending limits are exceeded.
Medicare and other social programs are at the top of the list,
under the law, Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there is no need to trim budget items to comply with
the mandated budget targets, Lew said. But the Republican bill
would trigger $99.3 billion in cuts, the greatest single cut being
$41.4 billion from Medicare, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a shell game,'' Lew said. ``It would mean that
we'd have debt going into forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's office said the OMB analysis was wrong, since Social
Security and Medicare would be protected by a ``lockbox''
preventing the government from drastically depleting the two
popular programs. The ``lockbox,'' in fact, has passed the House
but has not yet been approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House ``is walking down a very dangerous path by
trying to scare seniors,'' said Hastert spokesman Pete Jeffries.

<P>
   ON THE BADME PLAIN, Eritrea _ Like many other women who fight,
Senait Tekleab, a 19-year-old machine-gunner, gets a little bored
with outsiders who ask too many questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the enemy carries flashlights?'' she asked
impatiently, sitting yards away from the front-line trenches here,
not bothering to look up when gunfire went off. ``They are holding
guns so I have to kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tekleab then fired off two rounds from her AK-47, just to
show she knew exactly what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a nice shot, huh?'' one of the men commented.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea is one of the few nations in the world where female
soldiers fight side by side with men, and in the 15-month-old war
against Ethiopia, they have killed and been killed like any other
soldiers. There is no novelty to it. In fact, some of them have
powerful role models in making war: their own mothers, who fought
in the 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia, which was won in
1991. Eritrea became its own nation two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, `I am really proud of you','' said Yordanos
Tekeste, a 21-year-old artillery-woman whose mother and father were
both soldiers in the war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liberated the country,'' she said her mother told her.
``Now you are the ones who have to defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in the minds of many of this second generation of women
warriors, they are also the ones to take Eritrea further down the
road toward sexual equality. The first war helped propel women into
the National Assembly and other positions of political power,
partly because of their role in the fighting. Today, the new
ambassador to the European Union and the ministers of justice and
labor are women _ and military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But, even if it is less true here than in other African nations,
Eritrea remains a largely traditional society: Women are raised to
be shy and defer to men. Although the new government has outlawed
female genital cutting, it is still widely practiced. Despite
prominent exceptions, men still dominate politics and business
here, as they do around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Saba Habte, 19, who handles an AK-47 on the front here, said
that traditional male domination is unacceptable to her generation,
which has fought in some of Africa's bloodiest battles ever. (It is
estimated that at least 10,000 people died in each of two major
battles this year, at Badme and Tsorona.) The role of women, she
said, ``is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like my mother accepted it to be at home waiting for
their ``People like my mother accepted it to be at home waiting for
their husbands,'' she said. ``We can't do that. We know men very
well. We did what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   And if women in the West worry about whether they can be both
good mothers and have fulfilling careers, women here say they
expect few problems achieving both.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything I have done here,'' said Tsega Tesfay, 22,
``I am sure everything else will be easier.'' She wants to be a
nurse and have a family.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Fawzia Hashim said she had no doubts the
younger generation would carry on what she and other women warriors
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see they will retain their confidence,'' she said. ``They
will depend on themselves and they will have had exposure to the
negative and positive sides of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The war, she said, ``is affecting each and everyone in the
society. The war will be a continuation for them of what they
inherited from their sisters.''
</P>

<P>
   In Eritrea, men and women alike are required to participate in
national service, which includes six months of military training.
Living side by side in military camps, men and women learn to
handle weapons, and study military tactics and survival techniques.
(The last part of the training is a month-long trek through
Eritrea's rugged countryside, an exercise called, with cheery
understatement, ``Get to know your country.'')
</P>
<P>
   In peacetime, they perform public works like building roads or
planting trees. But when the conflict with Ethiopia began in May
1998 _ with a border dispute that escalated into all-out war _ they
went to the front, men and women alike.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea has not released casualty figures, so it is impossible
to know how many women have died in the fighting. In the war for
independence, it is estimated that one third of the 65,000
Eritreans who died over 30 years were women.
</P>
<P>
   Both men and women on the front deny strenuously that there is
any difference between them _ though in three days of interviews on
two battle-lines, more women than men seemed to cook and make tea.
While many male soldiers in the United States resist the idea of
women in combat, Eritrean men seem overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 30 years' struggle for freedom, there were ladies,''
said Daniel Gitensae, 23, speaking bravely in English. ``So the
ladies must now be with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry rocket-propelled grenades,'' he said. ``They carry
bombs and machine guns.''
</P>
<P>
   He said sexual relations at the front are not unknown, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the interest of the girl,'' he said gallantly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the Tsorona front, one woman, Hiwet Yonanes, 21, said she has
noticed one major difference: Women rarely take prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are very bad,'' she said. ``They don't capture at all.
Most of the Ethiopians know that.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also said the Ethiopians, who do not have women in
combat, treat the female Eritrean soldiers differently than the
men. On the second day of a huge battle at Tsorona in March, she
said, five Ethiopian soldiers tried to take her prisoner _ but
without drawing their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it would be easy to capture me,'' she said. ``It
was very stupid of them. I didn't see them but my friends did and
shot them right before they got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the war is over, Ms. Tekeste said, she will think about
getting married and starting a career. But she said the fact that
she fought was still not enough to make her, or any woman, equal.
It is only a start, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect anything from anybody,'' she said. ``When I get
back _ if I get back alive _ I have to keep working hard. I have to
work hard to respect myself.''

TONY ROBBINS SELLING INSPIRATION, AND MILLIONS ARE BUYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Self-help guru Tony Robbins says my life cannot be
filled with passion if I'm slumped over, breathing shallowly and
feeling rumpled and morose, if I'm balled up in the fetal position,
wracked by self-doubt and woe-is-me-itis.
</P>
<P>
   It is the wee hours of morning and his chiseled jaw of positive
thinking is glowing in the corner of my dark Seattle flat, telling
it like it is.
</P>
<P>
   He wants me to BELIEVE in myself, to know that the power of
CHANGE lies WITHIN, to pick myself up by my Converse laces!
</P>
<P>
   I'm listening like a paper-trained pug.
</P>
<P>
   Tony - he makes me feel we're first-name buds - needs me to dial
his personal line, toll free, and say those 16 magic digits (of my
nearly maxed credit card) and he'll deliver hope - in the form of
books or tapes - in two days via Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Who believes this boob-tuber anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of folks, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is pre-millennial angst. Or cash-flush Americans with
Internet riches to burn.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Robbins and his empire of tapes (``The
Personal Power''' series) and chock-full seminars (from Australia
to Wales to Fiji this year alone) have created a captive - and
paying - audience, to the tune of $80 million-plus a year.
</P>
<P>
   Those cash registers were ka-chinging this week when Robbins,
who has been dubbed the Mick Jagger of motivational speaking,
rolled into Seattle' KeyArena on Wednesday for Results 2000, a
seminar that drew thousands of souls seeking to become happier,
shinier people.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as Barnum &AMP; Bailey meets Dale Carnegie meets a
church revival.
</P>
<P>
   The light-a-fire-in-your-belly speakers scheduled included
Robbins, Joan Lunden (former co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America''), CNN's chatty Larry King (via satellite) and superstar
shortstop Alex Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Yo, A-Rod . . . wassup with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Tony Robbins,'' Rodriguez explained before
Monday night's game with the Cleveland Indians that ended on, well,
a positive note, with a Mariners win. ``I read a few of his books
and listened to his tapes. I was honored to be asked (to speak) and
I think I'll benefit from the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'll never hit a grand slam at Safeco Field. Hey, I can't
even smuggle in a bottle of water. But if hip A-Rod is going to bat
for Results 2000 - he's getting paid an undisclosed amount for his
appearance - then there must be something about Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Note to self: investigate.
</P>
<P>
   I plow through reams of clips and background material. I channel
surf and Web browse.
</P>
<P>
   I learn that Robbins is a hope broker. He sprints through
audiences, high-fiving people as if he were on a Pez-induced buzz.
</P>
<P>
   He believes we should associate pleasure with positive behavior
and pain with negative acts in order to get results.
</P>
<P>
   (Makes sense, though it does not take a rocket scientist to
figure that out.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Robbins showed up at Mariners spring
training. More recently, he has appeared on TV talk shows,
including one network gab-fest in which he kicked it with rocker
Courtney Love.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for her phone number. He got it.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth!
</P>
<P>
   Still, I don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Why do people adore Robbins so? Why would they spend an average
of $65 - and more than triple that if you wait to buy at the door -
to go to KeyArena in the twilight of a Seattle summer to hang out
with a guy whose face is seemingly everywhere. (Robbin's publicist
has said his TV infomercials have aired on average every 30
minutes, 24 hours a day somewhere in North America since hitting
the airwaves in 1989.)
</P>
<P>
   My friends say Robbins is like those snake-oil salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Then - voila! - it hits me. Robbins was once a loser, and
therein lies part of his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a California family from which his father bailed.
His mother divorced and remarried a few times. From his late teens
he was on his own. He became an assistant for the authors of the
``Fit for Life'' diet book series, which later spawned popular
dieting seminars.
</P>
<P>
   After triumph in his early 20s, he crashed. Success, he has said
in interviews, went to his head, and he became a broke, overweight
failure. He was living in a funky little apartment, feeling bad
about himself and working as a janitor, when he decided to change.
</P>
<P>
   He says he willed it.
</P>
<P>
   He mapped out strategies that later became the basis of his
best-selling book ``Awaken the Giant Within.'' (Fireside, 538
pages, $13).
</P>
<P>
   He is a messenger who has lived his message. And America loves
an underdog whose life theme is echoed in Hollywood, politics and
sports: The Comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Robbins' message hits home for people who may feel
marginalized by society, in need of inspiration or hunger for
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   And they have lapped him up.
</P>
<P>
   He has sold 25 million personal development tapes and reached
more than a million people at his seminars. His message brings hope
to cocaine-addicted kids in the South Bronx and to members of
Britain's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   No longer overweight, he is a buff 6-foot-7-inch motivating man
whose mantras ring of Ben Franklin's ``Little strokes fell great
oaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins recently told Tycoon magazine: ``If you're on the river
of life, it's likely you're going to hit a few rocks. The key is
that when you do run aground, instead of beating yourself up for
being such a failure, remember that there are no failures in life.
There are only results.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If you didn't get the results you wanted, learn from
this experience so that you have references about how to make
better decisions in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, holed up in my cramped apartment, feeling bad because
the rent is due and creditors are circling and my twentysomething
friends just cashed their Internet stocks and are looking to
retire, I see the writing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   I find myself thinking WWTD - What Would Tony Do?
</P>
<P>
   I know he would ask himself a series of questions:
</P>
<P>
   What can I learn from this?
</P>
<P>
   What's great about this, or what could be great about this?
</P>
<P>
   What's not perfect yet?
</P>
<P>
   What am I willing to do to make it the way I want it?
</P>
<P>
   What am I willing to not do to make it the way I want it?
</P>
<P>
   How can I enjoy doing the things necessary to make it the way I
want it?
</P>
<P>
   . . . I think I'll sleep on it.

SCIENTISTS PICK SPOT TO LAND MARS PROBE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have selected a frigid plateau layered with dust and
ice near the south pole of Mars as the December landing site for
the Mars Polar Lander, NASA said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in early January, the polar lander and a pair of small
spear-like probes are to touch down Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope a robotic digging tool on the lander and tiny
drilling excavators on the spears will reveal whether there is ice
in the subsoil.
</P>
<P>
   With their findings, scientists hope to learn more about the
climate history of the planet. Now cold and dry, some experts
believe Mars may have once been warm and wet enough for life.
</P>
<P>
   The probe's target is a rectangular area 124 miles long and
slightly more than 12 miles wide a little more than 500 miles from
the permanent ice cap at the Red Planet's south pole.
</P>
<P>
   It was selected from a handful of prospects because of its lack
of steep slopes, jagged peaks or meteor craters and because of the
curious lapping of ice upon dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this layered terrain is a record of climate changes
on Mars, and in a sense, digging into its surface will be like
reading tree rings or layers in an ice core,'' said Richard Zurek,
chief project scientist from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena. Calif., which mounted the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of fine layers of dust and ice with varying
thickness will indicate changes in weather patterns and layer
formation that have been repeated in recent history,'' Zurek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, we may find evidence of soil particles that
formed in ancient seas on Mars and were later blown into the polar
regions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first attempt by any country to attempt a landing
at one of the Martian poles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike NASA's Mars Pathfinder, which bounced to a landing in
1997 in what appeared to be an ancient, rock strewn watershed in
the planet's equatorial belt, the Polar Lander will employ braking
rockets for a much gentler descent onto the softly folded terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Like the successful Pathfinder, the camera-equipped Polar Lander
will rely on a shell-like heat shield and parachute to slow its
initial descent into the thin Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   As it begins descent, the Polar Lander will deploy a pair of
basketball-sized companion probes that were designed to smack into
the surface without parachutes at velocities of about 400 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The impact will thrust 4-inch penetrators about three feet into
the subsoil to look for ice.
</P>
<P>
   The companion probes should hit about 30 miles to 40 miles from
the host lander and within seven miles of one another.
</P>
<P>
   The landing site for the spacecraft was selected with images
taken by the Mars Global Surveyor, an orbiting robotic spacecraft
launched in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Global Surveyor began a two-year Mars surface mapping mission in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mars Climate Orbiter, launched from Earth last
December, is to reach Mars on Sept. 23. After firing braking
rockets, the Climate Orbiter will slip into a looping orbit around
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   After gradual maneuvers that will round its orbital trajectory,
the Climate Orbiter will begin a two-year study of seasonal weather
changes.

them work at company headquarters here. The others are based at
Able's offices in Tampa, New Jersey and Nebraska. The company
installs fiber-optic cable lines and designs highway toll systems.
</P>
<P>
   Able said Wednesday that the move to Roswell, Ga., has many
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta area is an important center for the
telecommunications industry, a financial center and a convenient
location for domestic and international travel,'' Able Chief
Executive Billy Ray said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hines, senior vice president at the Business Development
Board of Palm Beach County, said Able officials didn't ask the
economic
</P>
<P>
   development group for a deal that would keep it in West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to lose a company, whether its 1,000 jobs or 10
jobs,'' Hines said. But the county's fast-growing economy will have
no trouble replacing the 10 lost jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Able Telcom, a 12-year-old firm, suffered its share of setbacks.
Its volatile stock ranged from $1.75 to nearly $13 in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Able saw a rapid succession of CEOs and was plagued by
short-sellers, shareholder suits and fines over a long-delayed
highway toll collection system.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Ray became Able's fifth CEO in 1998 alone. In 1997,
Able ousted then-CEO William Mercurio, who went on to start Orius
Corp., a West Palm Beach-based installer of cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than 2 million of Able's 11.8 million shares are
held by short sellers, who bet that a company's stock will go down
rather than up. Wall Street analyst Manuel Asensio, a prominent
short seller, has tirelessly criticized the company.
</P>
<P>
   Able ran into trouble after it bought MFS Network Technologies
from WorldCom (later MCI WorldCom) in April 1998. Four groups of
shareholders later sued, saying Able misrepresented the MFS deal.
</P>
<P>
   When it bought MFS, Able inherited a project that racked up $4.6
million in fines from five toll road authorities in New Jersey, New
York and Delaware. The electronic toll-collection system was to be
ready by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But delays meant fines of $25,000 a day for lost tolls. The
meter ran from Jan. 21 through July 23, when the system was
launched.

WHITE HOUSE STEPS UP BATTLE AGAINST PROPOSED GOP TAX PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration escalated its battle
against proposed GOP tax cuts Wednesday, releasing new figures
showing the plan would force the government to slash almost $100
billion from popular federal programs, including Medicare, farm aid
and veterans benefits.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made it clear he plans to veto the $792
billion tax package when Republican leaders send it to him after
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   And in the weeks leading up to that expected confrontation both
sides have been engaging in public relations campaign to convince
voters that the tax bill is either a foolish or wise way to spend
an anticipated surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, Clinton renewed his criticism
of the Republican tax package, arguing it would make it harder to
fund crucial government programs and would threaten the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax bill passed by Congress would reverse the fiscal
discipline that has been absolutely critical to making the American
economy the strongest it has been in generations,'' Clinton wrote
in letters to House Speaker Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also dismissed a provision of the package that calls for
the expiration of the tax cuts after 10 years, saying ``such a
scenario would create uncertainty and confusion for taxpayers and
it is highly unlikely that it would ever be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the president said that if the tax cuts remained in
place after 10 years the exploding costs would likely impose major
strains on the federal treasury at a time when Medicare and Social
Security face insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your tax bill becomes law,'' Clinton wrote the Republican
leaders. ``It would leave Americans permanently in debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert responded that the surplus is ample to keep Social
Security and Medicare solvent and fund their tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand why the president would want to stand
between the taxpayers and well-deserved tax relief to keep the
economy growing,'' he said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its case, the White House asked reporters to a
meeting in Washington with Office of Budget and Management Director
Jacob Lew who detailed the programs that would automatically face
cuts or elimination if the tax cut were to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's analysis found that the tax cut would
trigger $99.3 billion in program reductions between 2000 and 2004.
Of those cuts, the largest amount, $41.1 billion, would come from
Medicare. Farm safety net programs would face $19 billion in
reductions, and fees for student loans would be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs facing cuts that ensure their elimination include
child support enforcement, Social Services block grants,
immigration support, mineral leasing act payments, and veterans'
education and readjustment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said that because of budget rules put in place by Congress,
the administration has little latitude in determining what face
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While those budget rules can be waived by lawmakers, he said
there is little chance the Senate could muster the 60 votes
necessary to set aside the reduction unless some of the 45
Democratic senators cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said that the Democrats were likely to agree to change the
budget rules only if Congress can reach a bipartisan consensus that
includes a smaller tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed a $250 billion tax cut
while Senate Democrats have crafted a $298 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said he hoped the Republican lawmakers would return from
summer break having heard from constituents who demand ``common
sense'' in the budget deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have been using the summer break to sell
their tax cut across the country. They have been explaining the
complicated legislation at press conferences and town hall meetings
in their district.
</P>
<P>
   Polls shows that while the tax issue does resonate among some
voters, particularly Republicans, it is not an overriding public
concern.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of likely voters by Zogby International released
Wednesday found that such voters were evenly split among those who
felt a tax cut was the best way to use the surplus and those who
believed such a cut would jeopardize government funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting thing about their campaign is they seem
to have gone out to America and found out something that I think we
already knew, that the public agrees that we want first things
first,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans point to several new polls showing that taxes
have risen on voters' priorities in the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris poll released Wednesday found taxes ranked second
behind education as the most important issues that government
should address. In June the poll found taxes ranked fourth,
trailing crime and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely on people's radar screens,'' said Pete
Jeffries, a Hastert spokesman.

IN ATLANTA, ONE MAN'S MARQUEE IS AN ABOMINATION TO MANY OTHERS

 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Years ago, the dome of the Georgia State Capitol was
Atlanta's golden signature, serenely gleaming above a modest
downtown. The hypergrowth of the last decades, however, obscured
the dome's glint with a series of undistinguished office towers,
leaving the Old South's most prominent city without a man-made
identifier so beloved of television backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   That may be about to change, thanks to the city's best-known
corporate provocateur, Ted Turner. All over town, urban designers
and architects are horrified by the prospect that downtown's new
focus of attention might become a giant six-story greeting card for
Turner's new sports arena, festooned with corporate logos,
electronic geegaws, and a 25-foot clock that has already been
dubbed ``Big Ted.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign, still under construction, has already created a furor
in the week since the City Council hastily approved it, in a vote
that came after workers began erecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turner officials insist the marquee, as they call it,
will animate the neighborhood and become a ``downtown icon,'' its
design and its location across the street from the popular
Centennial Olympic Park have drawn little but jeers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an abomination, a `sign in full,''' said Paul Muldawer, a
leading architect who designed the modern annex to City Hall,
alluding to Tom Wolfe's unflattering novel about Atlanta.
``Unfortunately, it's a pretty accurate display of culture in our
city. We tear down our history and our past, and we put up this
cartoon architecture that's all about advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, usually a reliable civic
booster, has editorialized bitterly against the billboard and the
lack of public discussion about its design.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would-be focal point for downtown looks as though it was
assembled by a refugee from Turner's Chimp Channel, flinging
corporate logos about like so many banana peels,'' said one
editorial in the Constitution last week.
</P>
<P>
   The unappreciative reaction has deeply distressed officials at
Turner Sports and Entertainment Development, who fear it may
overshadow the opening on Sept. 18 of Philips Arena, where Turner's
Hawks will play basketball and Turner's Thrashers hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The arena _ named for Philips Electronics in exchange for $180
million _ was intended to be the real landmark in a huge burst of
construction that Turner is undertaking in and around his CNN
Center. In front of the arena, 56-foot steel trusses in the shape
of the word Atlanta will hold up the facade and will shine either
blue or red depending on which team is playing.
</P>
<P>
   But the $213 million arena is set back from the park and main
entertainment center of downtown by more than a block, and Turner
Sports decided it needed to announce the arena more forcefully by
moving the main entrance sign nearly a quarter-mile from the arena
doors, where more people could see it.
</P>
<P>
   The sign, 55 feet tall by 150 feet wide, repeats the Atlanta
motif of the arena trusses, but adds a blue logo for the arena, a
22-by-17-foot video screen and an advertising panel, a scrolling
electronic zipper sign and a clock larger than London's Big Ben
perched on a far top corner.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Marie Smith, the president of Turner Sports, said the
monumental size of the billboard was chosen to hide a parking
structure behind it, and said the advertising elements were typical
of most new entertainment complexes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to go on the defensive with it, because I really do
think it's a wonderful way of combining a bunch of otherwise
disparate elements to make something that really will be much
better than the sum of its parts,'' said Ms. Smith, who also helped
plan the design of the acclaimed old-fashioned ballparks for the
Baltimore Orioles and the Atlanta Braves. ``For a building we put
this much energy into making beautiful, we didn't want to just put
up a sign on a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Turner has removed 12,400 square feet of old
billboards as part of the arena project, while the new sign is only
4,546 square feet. Considering the benefits to the city of the new
arena and the renovated CNN Center, she said, she was surprised and
disappointed that the billboard was causing such a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that the sign would have received a great deal less
attention if it were not directly across the street from Centennial
Olympic Park, a popular public space that is the principal jewel
retained by the city from the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Eplan, the former city planning commissioner who served
during the Olympics, said the park was ``the first grand space''
that Atlanta has built for itself, and lamented the intrusion and
embarrassment that the billboard would cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city spent a great deal of money fixing sidewalks and
improving streets to make downtown a more inviting place to live,
and putting this monster there is going to diminish that effort,''
Eplan said. ``It's so crass that I can't understand why the Turner
people would want this to be their image, across from that
beautiful park.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign is especially painful to the many architects and
critics who have bemoaned the city's unimaginative corporate
skyline, skewered by Wolfe in his novel, ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, most of the new construction in Atlanta has not
been up to the standards the city should have,'' said Keith
Summerour, a local architect. ``That tends to be typical of a
fast-growing city, but unfortunately people just seem to accept it.
It would have been better to concentrate on a downtown where people
could really afford to live, with a real city center.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Downtown Atlanta and its surrounding residential districts have
actually become more desirable in the last year or so, with lofts
and apartment buildings attracting new tenants, as many residents
tired of the region's increasingly congested commutes.
</P>
<P>
   The new arena and a remodeled glass facade for the CNN Center _
which have been praised by many of the sign's critics _ were
intended to enhance the sense of downtown as a destination, for
both residents and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But the vehemence generated by the sign seems likely to deflate
some of that excitement, as pundits outdo each other to spray it
with rhetorical graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a street floozy, flashing its wares, rolling its
high-tech ticker, seductively undressing in the public space,
inviting our attention to its inartful tease,'' wrote Jim Wooten,
the editorial page editor of The Atlanta Journal. ``My goodness,
man, is there anything we won't do for a dollar?''

NEWS PRIMER ON: MINORITIES ON TELEVISION 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights.

<P>
   What's the buzz?
</P>
<P>
   Television executives are scrambling to add minority characters
to television shows scheduled to start in September. The flurry of
activity comes after the major networks were criticized by minority
groups about the lack of African-Americans, Asians, American
Indians and Hispanics on television comedy and drama programs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue dominated discussions during last month's TV Critics
Press Tour, a 20-day conference in Pasadena, Calif., for
journalists who write about what's on TV and the television
industry. The critics questioned network executives, producers and
actors about the failure of television to mirror the society it
serves.
</P>
<P>
   What sparked the discussion?
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP), the nation's oldest civil-rights organization, announced
July 12 that:
</P>
<P>
   _The group is outraged at the television networks for lack of
diversity among actors on major TV shows;
</P>
<P>
   _The group plans to encourage a boycott of companies that
advertise during network shows;
</P>
<P>
   _The group plans to monitor diversity in the television and film
industry by opening a Hollywood office in October;
</P>
<P>
   _The group might take its concerns to court. It is studying
whether the U.S. Congress' 1934 Communications Act that decided
that the airwaves belong to the public can be used as a basis for a
lawsuit. The act also created the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to regulate broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the announcement, a national coalition of 10
Hispanic civil-rights groups called for a ``brownout'' of
television, urging viewers to turn off their sets during the week
of Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   How diverse is television?
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the 26 new shows beginning next month on the four
major television networks _ ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox _ has a minority
actor in a starring role.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the television-viewing public sits down to watch the new
prime-time shows scheduled for this fall's lineup, they will see a
virtual `whitewash' in programming,'' NAACP President Kweisi Mfume
said in a statement. ``This glaring omission is an outrage and a
shameful display by network executives who are either clueless,
careless or both,''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, Alex
Nogales, told reporters, ``If you don't want us, Hollywood, if
you're not going to hire us, Hollywood, then we're not going to
consume your products.''
</P>
<P>
   Shows with leading minority characters are more prevalent on the
smaller networks, such as the WB and UPN, and on cable stations.
</P>
<P>
   Why do some think TV needs more minorities?
</P>
<P>
   The lives of minorities need to be portrayed accurately, and too
often television viewers see minorities cast only as criminals or
people in the background, groups allege.
</P>
<P>
   ``People build perceptions of the world around them based in
part by what they see on television. We want a balanced picture,''
said Raul Yzaguirre, president of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking minority television executive told the
critics that a more accurate portrayal of minorities is important.
</P>
<P>
   NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa, who is Asian, remembers
being upset as a child seeing a white actor playing a Chinese man
on ``Kung-Fu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You not only want to see someone that looks like you on TV,
you want to see someone that is a role model. Someone you want to
be with, someone you want to be like,'' Sassa said.
</P>
<P>
   What character additions and changes are being made?
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, producers said they were working to add minority cast
members to shows before the criticism began. Black characters are
being added for the new ``Wasteland'' and ``Once and Again,''
according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, minority characters have been added to ``Suddenly
Susan''; ``Law &AMP; Order'' and its new spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order:
Special Victims Unit''; ``Jesse;'' and ``ER,'' according to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa acknowledged that the changes were prompted by the NAACP's
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say the vigilance and the attention that all of you
have placed on this subject have certainly moved things along,'' he
told the critics. ``It would be totally disingenuous to stand up
here and say we did this all on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   In January or thereabouts, CBS will introduce ``City of
Angels,'' a show set in an inner-city hospital with many black and
Hispanic doctors.
</P>
<P>
   At Fox, no changes have been announced.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORABLE MOMENTS FOR MINORITIES ON TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   _Desi Arnaz, a Cuban-born musician and actor, plays a successful
band leader on the hit comedy ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957.
</P>
<P>
   _Comedian Bill Cosby is the first black person to star in a
television drama. NBC's ``I Spy'' hits the airwaves in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1977, Rita Moreno, an actress from Puerto Rico, earns an
Emmy award for a guest appearance on ``The Muppet Show.'' She is
the first performer to win all four of the highest entertainment
awards: an Oscar for film acting, a Tony for a stage role, an Emmy
for TV work and a Grammy for recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   _``The Cosby Show,'' which aired from 1984 to 1992, portrays an
upper-class black family; Mom is a lawyer, Dad is a doctor. The
show is the first all-black Sitcom to reach No. 1 and is watched by
people of all ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   _Oprah Winfrey, whose talk show debuted nationwide in 1986,
rises as queen of the daytime talk show, knocking Chicago rival
Phil Donahue from the top. She creates Harpo Productions, making
her the third woman to own a major studio. (The other two were
actress Mary Pickford and comedian Lucille Ball.)
</P>
<P>
   _Beginning in 1996, two Asian actors, Irene Ng and Pat Morita,
star in Nickelodeon's ``The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo,'' about a
kid detective who stores and retrieves clues in her computer and
challenges the audience to solve the case before she does.

MOVIE REVIEW: ``TEACHING MRS. TINGLE'' 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By KARI BRASSELERO, Student Reporter 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``TEACHING MRS. TINGLE''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Katie Holmes, Helen Mirren, Marisa Coughlan, Jeffrey
Tambor, Barry Watson, Michael McKean, Lesley Ann Warren, Molly
Ringwald and Vivica A. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Mrs. Tingle is a history teacher who has terrorized the
students at Grandsboro High for 20 years. You know, the kind who
gets a thrill from flunking students.
</P>
<P>
   But when three best friends are falsely accused of cheating,
they try to prove their innocence. They soon find out that the only
way to beat Mrs. Tingle is to outsmart her using the rules she
created.
</P>
<P>
   This film is directed by Kevin Williamson, screenwriter of
``Scream,'' ``Scream 2'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
He also created TV's ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The whole plot was really unrealistic. It had the
potential to be a good film, but the best scenes were cut short. It
had some funny parts, and the teacher's lines were well-written and
well-executed.
</P>
<P>
   The film didn't get boring, but the fact that it was not
realistic took away from the movie because you're just thinking
``this could never happen.'' Fans of Williamson will probably like
this film, but otherwise skip it.
</P>
<P>
   Rating and reason for rating: PG-13 for theme, violence,
sexuality, offensive language and some teen drinking.

   BOOK: ``AMELIA TAKES COMMAND''
</P>
<P>
   Author: Marissa Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher: Pleasant Company Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Ages: 8 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $5.95.
</P>
<P>
   We all know what it's like not being in the same class as your
best friend, or to be put in the class with that teacher everybody
hates. Both of these things happen to Amelia when she starts the
fifth grade. When her best friend makes other friends, she tries to
do the same, but when she's teased about it she wonders if she'll
ever make new friends.
</P>
<P>
   This story is told through Amelia's entries in a notebook. When
you read this book, it will feel like you are reading the notebook
of your best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa Moss does a great job with this book, just like she has
with her five other books about Amelia. You can tell that she is
writing from real-life experiences. She makes Amelia so realistic
that you feel you are there, sharing the experiences with her.

   CD: ``RUNAWAY BRIDE'' SOUNDTRACK
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' _ the hit movie pairing Richard Gere as a
newspaper columnist with Julia Roberts as a woman with a fear of
committing to marriage _ has a terrific soundtrack, now out on CD.
This is a CD not to run away from!
</P>
<P>
   The CD features tunes with a foot-tapping beat, like the 1982
hit ``Maneater'' by Daryl Hall and John Oates and ``I Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For'' by U2.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack includes songs from the Dixie Chicks (``Ready to
Run'' and ``You Can't Hurry Love''), Martina McBride (``I Love
You'') and Shawn Colvin (``Never Saw Blue Like That'').
</P>
<P>
   This CD is recommended for people who love country music. You
might not know some of the musicians, but your mom and dad will. Be
sure to ask them about one star, Miles Davis, who performs ``It
Never Entered My Mind.''

   ``RAIN FOREST: HEROES OF THE HIGH FRONTIER''
</P>
<P>
   Plot: A team of scientists explores rain forests' mysterious top
layer _ called the ``canopy,'' located 100 feet above the forest
floor _ in search of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   They travel to tropical areas around the world, including the
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   They come across an opossum, an eagle and a sloth, as well as
countless insects. They climb trees and dangle from ropes and
discover that the canopy is the center of life in rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   Why see it: It gives very interesting facts on the rain forest
and the life within it, telling viewers that half of the rain
forest canopy has been destroyed by loggers or fires, or has been
cleared to create land to grow crops.
</P>
<P>
   Both kids and parents will find the animals cute and will walk
away having learned something.
</P>
<P>
   Available: Now, from National Geographic.

DID YOU KNOW ... ALL ABOUT BATTERIES? 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

   SCIENTISTS WORK ON SUPER BATTERIES
</P>
<P>
   Batteries that power CD players and other electronic essentials
are being developed to last a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of batteries that last 50 percent longer than
today's batteries is being studied. These batteries use a
``super-iron'' component that promises to be easy and affordable to
manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are still studying the idea, so don't look for them
in local stores soon. But researchers at the Israel Institute of
Technology say the super batteries could eventually come in the
rechargeable forms needed to power camcorders, laptop computers,
even electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Licht, a chemistry professor at the institute, led the
research team in trying out several materials, from sulfur to tin,
before it discovered that an unusual form of iron boosts battery
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, the super-iron batteries look identical to
conventional'' AA or AAA batteries, Licht said in an e-mail
interview from Haifa. ``The difference is within, and in the much
greater energy generated by the super-iron battery.''

<P>
   ON THE BADME PLAIN, Eritrea _ Like many other women who fight,
Senait Tekleab, a 19-year-old machine-gunner, gets a little bored
with outsiders who ask too many questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the enemy carries flashlights?'' she asked
impatiently, sitting yards away from the front-line trenches here,
not bothering to look up when gunfire went off. ``They are holding
guns so I have to kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tekleab then fired off two rounds from her AK-47, just to
show she knew exactly what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a nice shot, huh?'' one of the men commented.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea is one of the few nations in the world where female
soldiers fight side by side with men, and in the 15-month-old war
against Ethiopia, they have killed and been killed like any other
soldiers. There is no novelty to it. In fact, some of them have
powerful role models in making war: their own mothers, who fought
in the 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia, which was won in
1991. Eritrea became its own nation two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, `I am really proud of you','' said Yordanos
Tekeste, a 21-year-old artillery-woman whose mother and father were
both soldiers in the war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liberated the country,'' she said her mother told her.
``Now you are the ones who have to defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in the minds of many of this second generation of women
warriors, they are also the ones to take Eritrea further down the
road toward sexual equality. The first war helped propel women into
the National Assembly and other positions of political power,
partly because of their role in the fighting. Today, the new
ambassador to the European Union and the ministers of justice and
labor are women _ and military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But, even if it is less true here than in other African nations,
Eritrea remains a largely traditional society: Women are raised to
be shy and defer to men. Although the new government has outlawed
female genital cutting, it is still widely practiced. Despite
prominent exceptions, men still dominate politics and business
here, as they do around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Saba Habte, 19, who handles an AK-47 on the front here, said
that traditional male domination is unacceptable to her generation,
which has fought in some of Africa's bloodiest battles ever. (It is
estimated that at least 10,000 people died in each of two major
battles this year, at Badme and Tsorona.) The role of women, she
said, ``is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like my mother accepted it to be at home waiting for
their ``People like my mother accepted it to be at home waiting for
their husbands,'' she said. ``We can't do that. We know men very
well. We did what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   And if women in the West worry about whether they can be both
good mothers and have fulfilling careers, women here say they
expect few problems achieving both.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything I have done here,'' said Tsega Tesfay, 22,
``I am sure everything else will be easier.'' She wants to be a
nurse and have a family.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Fawzia Hashim said she had no doubts the
younger generation would carry on what she and other women warriors
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see they will retain their confidence,'' she said. ``They
will depend on themselves and they will have had exposure to the
negative and positive sides of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The war, she said, ``is affecting each and everyone in the
society. The war will be a continuation for them of what they
inherited from their sisters.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Eritrea, men and women alike are required to participate in
national service, which includes six months of military training.
Living side by side in military camps, men and women learn to
handle weapons, and study military tactics and survival techniques.
(The last part of the training is a month-long trek through
Eritrea's rugged countryside, an exercise called, with cheery
understatement, ``Get to know your country.'')
</P>
<P>
   In peacetime, they perform public works like building roads or
planting trees. But when the conflict with Ethiopia began in May
1998 _ with a border dispute that escalated into all-out war _ they
went to the front, men and women alike.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea has not released casualty figures, so it is impossible
to know how many women have died in the fighting. In the war for
independence, it is estimated that one third of the 65,000
Eritreans who died over 30 years were women.
</P>
<P>
   Both men and women on the front deny strenuously that there is
any difference between them _ though in three days of interviews on
two battle-lines, more women than men seemed to cook and make tea.
While many male soldiers in the United States resist the idea of
women in combat, Eritrean men seem overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 30 years' struggle for freedom, there were ladies,''
said Daniel Gitensae, 23, speaking bravely in English. ``So the
ladies must now be with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry rocket-propelled grenades,'' he said. ``They carry
bombs and machine guns.''
</P>
<P>
   He said sexual relations at the front are not unknown, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the interest of the girl,'' he said gallantly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the Tsorona front, one woman, Hiwet Yonanes, 21, said she has
noticed one major difference: Women rarely take prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are very bad,'' she said. ``They don't capture at all.
Most of the Ethiopians know that.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also said the Ethiopians, who do not have women in
combat, treat the female Eritrean soldiers differently than the
men. On the second day of a huge battle at Tsorona in March, she
said, five Ethiopian soldiers tried to take her prisoner _ but
without drawing their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it would be easy to capture me,'' she said. ``It
was very stupid of them. I didn't see them but my friends did and
shot them right before they got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the war is over, Ms. Tekeste said, she will think about
getting married and starting a career. But she said the fact that
she fought was still not enough to make her, or any woman, equal.
It is only a start, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect anything from anybody,'' she said. ``When I get
back _ if I get back alive _ I have to keep working hard. I have to
work hard to respect myself.''

 &HT;    Cash, gas and will: Autopsy shows Barton was prepared
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark O. Barton had a full tank of gas and enough cash
in his pocket to finance a getaway four hours after he committed
the worst mass murder in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   He also had an updated will in his minivan when police cornered
him and he killed himself July 29.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old murder suspect was wearing his seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   A Cobb County medical examiner's report released Wednesday said
police found $4,500 in an envelope in the day trader's hip pocket _
about 1 percent of the estimated $450,000 he lost in risky stock
speculations.
</P>
<P>
   The denominations were $50s and $100 bills. His last will and
testament, updated that day by his lawyer in Douglasville, was
found in a door pocket of the Ford Aerostar.
</P>
<P>
   Barton also had four handguns. Two were in a canvas overnight
bag that contained ``a large quantity of ammunition,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Acworth and Cobb County police surrounded the van, Barton
raised two other pistols _ a 9 mm and a .45-caliber _
simultaneously to both sides of his head. Only one gun discharged,
sending a bullet through his brain, the report said. Police
recovered the bullet from the van.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police aren't sure whether Barton was fleeing or driving
around aimlessly, but the department does have a one-inch thick
investigative report it plans to soon make public, said spokesman
John Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Mr. Barton, who was in debt, that was a lot money. But I'm
not sure it means anything,'' Quigley said. And yet, he said, ``I
question whether he would have killed himself until he became
confronted. He could have done it anytime in the four previous
hours. He could have done it at the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bishop, operations manager of the Cobb County Medical
Examiner's Office, said an extra-thorough report was done on
Barton's death because it was such an extraordinary case.
</P>
<P>
   Barton killed nine people at two day-trading firms, All-Tech
Investment Group Inc. and Momentum Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He already had killed his two children and wife at their
Stockbridge home.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said a toxicology report on Barton wasn't back from the
state laboratory, so authorities didn't know if his system
contained drugs or alcohol. Barton's liver, however, didn't show
signs of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a normal heart and a normal brain, medically
speaking, Bishop said.

<P>
   Shares of Bank One, the Chicago-based banking giant, plunged 23
percent Wednesday after the company stunned the financial community
with its warning late Tuesday that intense competition in the
credit-card business would cause profits to fall short of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts flocked to reduce their ratings on the
bank, the nation's fifth-largest, and shares of other major card
issuers were caught in the downdraft, although some later recovered
a good portion of their losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank One's announcement raises concerns about the overall
health of the card industry,'' Jeffrey Evanson, banking analyst at
US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, said.
</P>
<P>
   Metris Cos. lost $4.25 to close at $31; Providian Financial fell
$3.9375 to $87.50, and Capital One Financial gave up $3.3125 to
$43.375. American Express skidded more than $5.50 but climbed back
to finish at $147.25, down only 63.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One's situation was seen as especially troublesome. Its
First USA operation is likely to earn $500 million less than
anticipated, putting 1999 earnings in the range of $3.60 to $3.65 a
share, it said, in contrast to a consensus of $3.92 from analysts
surveyed by First Call. Still, analysts saw the episode as pointing
up the increasingly fierce struggle for credit-card profits. Among
other things, it is prompting some reappraisal of the industry and
a backlash by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the card business has been highly profitable,
with interest rates on revolving balances often running into the
high double-digits, more than offsetting monthly administrative
costs and the inevitable 1 or 2 percent of the debt that ultimately
proves uncollectible.
</P>
<P>
   But intense competition has forced rates down, both regular ones
and introductory teasers, so far that banks and others in the
business have increasingly tried to make up the revenue through
fees, such as for late payments and over-the-limit spending. In
many cases, even annual fees have been competed away to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One ``seems to have a severe case of the affliction
plaguing the entire industry,'' said James Daly, editor of Credit
Card Management, an industry monthly. He described profit margins
on this mature and now largely commoditized business as under
``extreme pressure.'' What's more, growth has slowed to about 5.5
percent a year from more than 20 percent as recently as the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Heller, research director of Veribanc Inc., a bank
research and rating service, made the case more pungently. ``The
whole card business is living in a wonder world,'' he said,
pointing to high delinquencies and chargeoffs at a time of
unsurpassed prosperity and to increasing reliance on
customer-unfriendly fees when it has become so easy for customers
to go elsewhere. ``What a crazy business model the card business of
the majors has become,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One, which boasts the nation's second-biggest card business
after Citigroup as a result of its 1997 acquisition of First USA,
found out in the spring just how peevish consumers have become.
They left in droves after the company dropped a one-day grace
period, quickly reinstated, for late payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers who are paying attention, who are savvy, are going
to find other options'' when displeased, said Gerri Detweiler,
education adviser to Debt Counselors of America. This is especially
true now that the better deals are so readily found on the Web _
at, for example, getsmart.com and cardweb.com.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation
of America, called what's going on a backlash to heavy-handed
industry practice. ``The fact that customers are leaving Bank One
in droves says they are getting wise to the tricks they play to
wring out unwarranted profits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives, not surprisingly, reject the pessimism.
``We believe the business is extremely healthy,'' said Sean Healy,
a spokesman for Visa USA. He cited vast opportunities on the
Internet and for debit cards, which allow banks to save money in
processing checks.
</P>
<P>
   Daly agreed that the Internet offered hope for the surviving
companies in a rapidly consolidating industry, but cautioned that
this ``won't be a slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the forces working to undermine the industry, various
analysts, including Katrina Blecher of Brown Brothers Harriman and
Joseph Duwan of Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods, called Bank One's shrunken
profits mostly its own fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``First USA took their eye off the ball,'' Duman said. ``They
got maybe a little too aggressive on pricing and fees,'' prompting
customers to consider other options.
</P>
<P>
   And there may be more grief to come, Heller of Veribanc
suggested. Bank One had a whopping $732 million, or 3 percent of
its card portfolio, seriously delinquent at the end of the first
quarter, well above the industry average. And this was after
charging off as uncollectible 1.2 percent, just as much as the rest
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   And if the economy should slip into recession, Heller added
ominously, things really ``could fall apart.''

 &HT;    Georgia girl commits suicide at school
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, Ga. _ Parents panicked Wednesday as word of a school
shooting spread through this rural county seat. Fear ebbed, though
grief did not, when it was learned that the shooter and the victim
were one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Tanquary, a 16-year-old sophomore at Jasper County High
School, apparently shot herself while sitting in a pickup truck
parked in the student parking lot, said school and law enforcement
officials. It was the town's first suicide of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found by a teacher shortly after 9 a.m., said
Julian Cope, superintendent of Jasper County schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time were any students or staff members in danger,''
Cope said. In fact, Cope said, no students are believed to have
witnessed the suicide. Counselors were made available to staff and
students Wednesday and will be available today, Cope said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the body triggered the school's emergency student
safety plan, which was drafted over the summer, Cope said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of first period, said student Michael Asaro, an
announcement came over the school intercom system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `All teachers keep your kids in the classroom. Code
yellow,''' said Asaro, an eighth-grader at the campus that houses
grades 6-12.
</P>
<P>
   Students were confined to their first-period classroom until
about 12:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want to compromise any security or the crime
scene,'' said Mike Newton, student services director.
</P>
<P>
   Parents flocking to the school were sent to Monticello Baptist
Church, which has the largest parking lot in town, where they could
check their children out of school. Students then were shuttled to
the church by school bus. About 150 of the 920 students at the
school left early. Polly Seabourn still wanted to hug her two
teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about what's going through their minds,'' she
said while waiting in the church parking lot. ``I want them to know
that no matter what the trouble is, they can come talk to me or
their daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the need to protect the family's privacy, school
officials released few details about Amanda. High school students
interviewed knew little about her, although she had been a student
in the county since first grade.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda was quiet, said 15-year-old classmate Brannon Cobb,
echoing the assessment of other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had friends,'' Cobb said, ``but not very many.''

ISRAEL DEFENDS 24-YEAR SENTENCE FOR MARYLAND TEEN-AGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (Eds. note: For 6th graf, `In Rockville, Md. ...,' the Times is
using brackets to denote dateline change) 
(DW) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli officials Wednesday vigorously defended a
plea agreement they reached with a Maryland teen-ager accused of
murder who fled to Israel to take advantage of its extradition
laws. They also sharply criticized Maryland state prosecutors for
publicizing the details of the agreement against what they said was
Israel's explicit wishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of accusations and finger pointing in the
two-year-old case, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein of Israel
hastily called a news conference to express displeasure that the
Maryland prosecutors had disclosed the contents of the plea
agreement for the teen-ager, Samuel Sheinbein, 19, who is charged
with murdering and dismembering a classmate nearly two years ago in
what prosecutors described as a ``thrill kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein is scheduled to get a 24-year prison sentence in
exchange for his guilty plea
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said his office had given the details of the
agreement to the Maryland prosecutors out of professional courtesy
with the specific request that they not be publicized until after
an Israeli court ruled on the agreement next week.
</P>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor in Montgomery County, Md., State's Attorney
Douglas F. Gansler, publicized the agreement on Tuesday and called
it ``an insult to justice'' because in Israel most prisoners serve
only two-thirds of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In Rockville, Md., one of Gansler's deputies, Jim Trusty, said
Wednesday that the Israeli authorities had not requested silence on
the plea, The Associated Press reported. Trusty said that two days
ago the Israeli authorities had faxed to his office a letter
announcing the plea, the news service reported, after which the
Maryland prosecutors spoke to the lead Israeli prosecutor and were
told that they were free to talk to the press.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheinbein had been tried and convicted of murder in Maryland,
as Gansler wanted, he could have faced life in prison without
parole. He would not have been eligible for the death penalty
because the crime was committed while he was a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said the sentence agreed upon was ``in the upper
limits for sentencing for murder by a minor'' in Israel. He said a
full trial in Israel would probably have produced a similar result
and added that courts in a number of American states would have
handed down sentences in the same range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect our colleagues in the United States to respect our
courts and prosecutors the same way we respect them,'' he said.
``From our point of view, this is more than a reasonable plea. We
were surprised that the Maryland prosecutors made this public. It
shouldn't have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheinbein case has been a tortuous one for prosecutors in
both countries and has badly strained relations between them. After
Sheinbein and a friend killed Alfredo Tello Jr., 19, and burned and
dismembered his body in September 1997, prosecutors said, Sheinbein
slipped out of the United States to Israel, where he claimed
citizenship because his father was born here in 1944 before the
state was formed.
</P>
<P>
   The friend who was accused of taking part in the crime, Aaron
Needle, hanged himself in jail in April 1998, just as his trial was
to start.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein was imprisoned in Israel while the Maryland
authorities sought his extradition on murder charges. Under Israeli
law at the time, Israel could not extradite its own citizens to any
other country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the furor over the Sheinbein case, that law,
instituted in 1978, has been repealed so that only citizens who can
prove residency in Israel are immune to extradition. But the new
law cannot be applied retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said that he had been working, in various positions,
to change the extradition law for years. His office had also
opposed its application to Sheinbein on the grounds that the intent
of the law was to protect Israelis, not those with tenuous links to
the country. But Israel's Supreme Court rejected that
interpretation and Sheinbein was declared a citizen who could not
be extradited and had to be tried here.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sheinbein's lawyer had said his client would admit to
the murder if tried here, he said last month that Sheinbein
admitted dismembering and burning Tello's body but not killing him.
With the suicide of Needle, Israeli prosecutors feared that proof
of Sheinbein's having committed the murder was not sufficiently
clear-cut and agreed to a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plea bargain is a very acceptable thing, and I believe that
statistics show it is even more acceptable in the United States
than in Israel,'' Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while most sentences were reduced to about
two-thirds, that was not always the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's plea is scheduled to be entered on Sept. 2 before a
three-judge panel in Tel Aviv.

UNDER PRESSURE, WHITE HOUSE TO PULL TROOPS FROM HAITI
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 10th graf, The Pentagon ..., to CORRECT, U.S. troops have
been in Sinai Peninsula since 1982; treaty was signed in 1979, not (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from the Pentagon and Republicans in
Congress to reduce military commitments overseas, the Clinton
administration plans to withdraw the last American troops stationed
in Haiti, even though peace there remains tenuous at best, Defense
Department and administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American troops _ 480 people, including engineers, doctors
and nurses and a security force from the Army's 82nd Airborne
Division _ are the remnants of the force of 20,000 that occupied
Haiti beginning in September 1994 to restore the elected government
of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House has not yet announced its decision, a
withdrawal of the remaining force, which cost more than $20 million
a year, is expected to be completed by the end of the year, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the Pentagon will send smaller contingents of
reservists and national guard members to Haiti on short, temporary
assignments, like those in other Caribbean and Central American
nations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller U.N. contingent of roughly 400 peacekeepers acting as
advisers to the Haitian police will not be affected. But the troop
withdrawal will end a continuous American military presence in
Haiti, something that officials in Haiti and advocates in
Washington consider important to help Haiti's troubled democratic
transition succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very large number of troops, but it's not the size
that is critical,'' said Donald E. Schulz, a former analyst at the
U.S. Army War College who has long studied Haiti. ``It's the
psychological presence. It can be argued that it is a deterrent to
those who would try to destabilize the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission in Haiti is only one of several international
military operations that the Pentagon has pressed the
administration to reduce. With the nation's armed services having
shrunk to 1.3 million men and women on active duty, a 36 percent
drop from a decade ago, senior commanders have begun warning that
the number of operations _ from Korea to Kosovo _ is stretching the
military thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concerted effort all over the world to look at our
commitments and ask ourselves, `Do we still need to be there?'''
Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, the Pentagon has drawn up plans to reduce the
American peacekeeping force to fewer than 4,000 troops, compared to
6,200 today. That reduction is part of a larger NATO plan, expected
to be completed next month, that would reduce the number of
international troops in Bosnia to 18,000 or 19,000, from more than
30,000 today and 60,000 when the NATO-led force first went there in
December 1995 to help stabilize the region after several years of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is also pressing the administration to scale back
the American role in the longstanding multinational observer force
in the Sinai Peninsula, where about 900 soldiers have been
stationed since 1982 to help monitor the peace treaty Egypt and
Israel. A decision on that mission is not expected soon and
probably would not come without a breakthrough in the Middle East
peace effort, one defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose the reductions say the administration is
sacrificing foreign policy objectives to satisfy pressure from
Pentagon commanders worried about the strain on the military and
the drain on its budget, and from Republicans lawmakers who
consider peacekeeping missions a distraction from traditional war
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Hooper, the executive director of the Balkans Action
Council, said that the reductions in Bosnia could undercut progress
in bringing about a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enough to keep the lid on Bosnia so the war doesn't begin
again,'' Hooper said of the Pentagon's plan for a smaller
contingent. ``It's not enough to accomplish their mission, which is
to create a unitary Bosnia state that allows all the refugees to
return home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Bang-Jensen, a lawyer with the Coalition for International
Justice in Washington, said a reduction would make it even less
likely that all the war-crime suspects still at large in Bosnia
would be arrested. ``I don't know anyone who thinks the job is
done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, too, the job is far from done. Although the American
intervention five years ago forced the military junta led by Lt.
Gen. Raoul Cedras to step aside and allow Aristide to return to
power, little has happened since then to reverse Haiti's standing
as the poorest country in the hemisphere and one of the least
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Aristide's successor as President, Rene
Preval, dissolved the country's parliament and began ruling by
decree.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the commander of American forces in Latin America,
Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm of the Marine Corps, recommended
withdrawing the last of the American military force because of the
increasing political turmoil. At the time, he warned of an
increased risk to the troops from shootings and other violence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the United States has steadily reduced its military
presence in Haiti. The 480 troops left there operate primarily in
Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, maintaining a small base at the
airport and running a hospital. Most of the troops are engineers,
who in the last year built or rebuilt seven schools, or medical
personnel, who last year treated 45,000 Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials said that the decision to
end the permanent presence in no way reflected a lessening of
American interest. The reserve and guard units will continue to go
to Haiti for periods of a week or two at a time to provide medical
care, build roads or offer other humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Quiqley, the Pentagon spokesman, said the United States would
have ``a frequent presence, thought not a continuous one.'' He
added that the reserve and guard missions could expand humanitarian
projects to more sites across the country, including rural areas
not reached now by the American force, which remains close to
Port-au-Prince because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of troops in Haiti is a mere fraction of the
1.3 million men and women now on active duty, the deployment has an
impact nonetheless on the military's readiness, Pentagon officials
said. For every soldier stationed overseas, there is another who
has just returned and another getting ready to go _ and still more
devoted to providing transportation, supplies or other
administrative needs. In many cases, sending troops overseas can
break up large units, as is the case with the soldiers from the
82nd Airborne.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of operations growing since the end of the Cold
War, highlighted most recently by the deployment of 7,000 soldiers
and marines in Kosovo, senior officials at the Pentagon, starting
with Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, have become more vocal
in pushing for an end to long-running missions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is also facing pressure from Congress. In the
case of Haiti, Republicans in the House approved an amendment to
the defense authorization bill in June that would have mandated a
withdrawal by December. While the Senate did not include the
provision, negotiators have agreed on language to force a
withdrawal by next May and expect both houses to approve it when
Congress returns next month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House's Select
Committee on Intelligence, said the decision to withdraw reflected
``a belated dawning'' on the administration that the mission in
Haiti was now simply draining resources that could be better spent
elsewhere.

 &HT;    Talking points at Duke
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ ``Airborne'' is the new team slogan for Duke
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Latin,'' explains Ben Bennett, first-year quarterback
coach, career-leading Duke passer and budding jokester. ``It's
derived from `Airus Bornus,' which means `born of the air.''' It
also means that, in addition to a much-needed sense of humor, the
Blue Devils have a different look. The new coach is Carl Franks, a
protege of Florida's Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier coached at Duke from 1987-89 and was ultra-successful
by Duke standards, posting a 20-13-1 record and going to a bowl.
Since Spurrier, the Blue Devils have hired _ and fired _ Barry
Wilson and Fred Goldsmith. They combined to go 30-69-1.
</P>
<P>
   So the Blue Devils went back to Spurrier and got Franks, a
nine-year assistant to Spurrier and his top staff member _ and, not
coincidentally, a former Duke player _ to replace Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   Look for quarterbacks Spencer Romine, Bobby Campbell and Kevin
Thompson of Thomasville, Ga., to be a little arm-weary before Duke
plays its opener against East Carolina on Sept. 11. The Blue Devils
will be airborne indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is going to be a replica of Florida's, very
similar,'' Franks said. ``That's the offense I know, and it
wouldn't make any sense to go do something else. We'll give our
quarterbacks a kind of suggestion to take to the line of scrimmage,
and then, if he comes up with something better, we expect him to
call it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is happier with the new offensive look than the
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't cover everybody in this offense,'' Campbell said.
``We're putting guys everywhere. I'm enjoying this offense so much,
the aggressiveness of getting the ball downfield. Coach Franks has
an aggressive attitude, but, coming from Florida, you'd have to
have that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Franks' first moves was to hire Bennett, who still is the
ACC's career leading passer with 9,614 yards accumulated at Duke
from 1980-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our playbook came straight from the Tampa Bay Bandits; they
just tore off the cover and put Duke on the front,'' Bennett said.
Before he took the Duke job, Spurrier coached the USFL team, with
Franks as an assistant and Bennett as quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the offense,'' said flanker Richmond Flowers, who has
caught 56 passes for 817 yards and six touchdowns in three seasons.
``I saw the `Airborne' slogan on a sign driving back to campus this
year. When Coach Spurrier was here, I heard the slogan was `Air
Ball.' When you're a receiver and the team slogan is that, it's got
to make you happy. Things are so much more comfortable when the
offensive coordinator is also the head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense is not as complicated as its seems or as some would
make it, Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Thompson has been such a pleasant surprise,'' he said.
``He missed spring practice but has picked up things so quickly.
That should tell you how complicated our offense isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And the offense is more than passing, Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most success I've experienced as an assistant was when
we've been able to run the ball,'' he said. ``(Former Florida
running back) Errict Rhett led the SEC in number of rushes one
year. (Florida's) Fred Taylor rushed for over 1,000 yards. This
offense gets notoriety because it enables us to throw the ball
downfield. But if the defense gets too worried about the pass,
we're going to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks did not inherit a bare cupboard. Nine starters return on
offense and 10 on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils could surprise this season. ``We're all kind of
fed up with losing,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   And Franks isn't used to anything but winning.

LABOR CHALLENGES MBEKI ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The still-young presidency of Thabo Mbeki faced
its first major domestic test this week as South Africa's public
sector labor unions squared off with the government in a battle
over wages.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a one-day strike on Tuesday that forced schools around
the country to close and left prisons understaffed, civil servants
have threatened to walk off their jobs indefinitely unless the
government accepts their demands for higher salaries. Twelve unions
plan to meet Friday to draft a hard-line strategy for a
yet-unscheduled new round of talks with government negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The Mbeki administration is unmoved and has begun to take the
unusual step of implementing a unilateral wage increase that falls
short of labor's demands.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the two sides are not far apart. Civil servants,
ranging from teachers to firefighters, want a pay increase 1
percentage point higher than the government has offered. But behind
the numbers lies a contentious struggle between traditional allies
for control of the nation's economic priorities. Mbeki wants a
leaner, more efficient government. Labor wants job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first big battle. It's about who calls the
shots,'' said Steven Friedman, director of the Center for Policy
Studies in Johannesburg. ``One percent becomes an issue when it is
code for other things. One percent is very important when you're
trying to show who's the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff has been building for years. In May 1996, when
Nelson Mandela's administration implemented a plan to trim the
public payroll, the government employed nearly 2 million people.
The plan sought to reduce that number by 300,000 through severance
packages and early retirement, but it had an adverse impact. Not
only did the program fail to meet its goal, but it caused an exodus
of highly skilled public servants. Two years later, with the
quality of service delivery dropping and the cost of running the
government still unacceptably high, Mandela engaged the unions in a
debate over retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki inherited the problem when he took office two months ago.
A Western-educated economist who steered economic policy under
Mandela, he has vowed a more aggressive approach to fighting
widespread poverty than his predecessor took.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer size of the public payroll, at 52 percent of the
annual national budget, limits his ability to pursue social
reforms. Trimming civil service, meanwhile, puts Mbeki at odds with
labor, which urgently seeks to protect workers from an economy that
has shed 500,000 jobs since 1994 and maintains an unemployment rate
of nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the public sector sought a pay raise, Mbeki drew a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that personnel costs account for over half of overall
expenditure . . . militate against any further dramatic increases
in personnel expenditure,'' Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, minister of
public service, told Parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
   When talks with the public sector unions broke down,
Fraser-Moleketi offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal: a 6.3 percent
pay increase for most civil servants, 7 percent for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have rejected the offer, arguing that it falls too
far below the rate of inflation. They seek a 7.3 percent increase,
8.3 percent for teachers. But the dispute over numbers masks their
real desire: more bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the power in our unity . . . and we want a speedy
return to the negotiation table,'' said Willie Madisha, the new
president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, during
Tuesday's strike.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, the strike brought together
predominantly black and predominantly white unions in the same
cause, leading some observers to see the action as the first drive
by labor that is class-oriented rather than political. In the end,
most observers expect the two sides will opt for some kind of
negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the battle will not mean the end of the war.
Mbeki has taken a firm stance against the unions in his pursuit of
leaner government, but at a potential cost to his ability to
govern. In the past five years the labor movement, an apartheid-era
ally of the ruling African National Congress, has been weakened as
many effective leaders have left for more comfortable jobs in
government or the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government knows what it wants the public sector to look
like, but it needs a cooperative relationship with a creative labor
leadership to drive the thing forward,'' said Friedman, of the
Center for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Sampie Terreblanche, an economist at the University of
Stellenbosch near Cape Town, applauds Mbeki's stance. ``The general
impression is that the productivity of the public sector is poor,
yet in spite of this, they want a large increase,'' he said. ``It
is madness to carry on with this strike when 35 percent of the
population can't get a job.''

TOP BOSNIAN SERB OFFICER ARRESTED FOR U.N. TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ The chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb
army was arrested Wednesday while visiting Vienna, unaware that he
had been charged in a secret indictment with crimes against
humanity during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Momir Talic, the highest-ranking official detained so far
on behalf of U.N. prosecutors, was seized in Vienna by Austrian
plainclothes police officers while attending a conference at the
National Defense Academy. Within hours he was flown to The Hague
and was taken Wednesday night to the detention unit of the
International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, court
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Talic, 57, was secretly charged by the tribunal last March with
persecuting civilians ``on political, racial or religious
grounds.'' If convicted, he faces life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As the commander of the 1st Krajina Corps of the Bosnian Serb
army in 1992, he is accused of planning and leading a brutal attack
on tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats to purge the
Krajina region in northwest Bosnia of non-Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest. Mirko Sarovic, vice
president of Bosnia's Republika Srpska _ the Bosnian Serbs' 49
percent of Bosnia, called it a trap and a humiliation. Other
Bosnian Serbs who attended the conference immediately left and flew
home.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrest is likely to further inhibit travel by
political or military officials who were directly or indirectly
involved in the violence that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the arrest, Louise Arbour, the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, said it was the first time a sealed indictment had led
to an arrest outside Bosnia. Most of the tribunal's detainees have
been arrested by peacekeeping troops within the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant because it shows we have other means to
achieve detentions,'' Mrs. Arbour said in an interview. ``People
who might have believed that they were outside the reach of
international justice are being brought into custody. There should
be a lot of very worried people now.''
</P>
<P>
   Talic's arrest is likely to be one of the last important
interventions by Mrs. Arbour, who steps down on Sept. 14 _ a year
before the end of her mandate _ to take a seat on Canada's Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arbour, who gained a reputation as a forceful prosecutor,
was the driving force behind the indictment of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and four of his top associates in May, charging
them with crimes against humanity in the Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She will be succeeded by Carla Del Ponte, the Swiss attorney
general, who is known as a tough crime fighter. Mrs. Del Ponte was
at the tribunal Tuesday and Wednesday for meetings with Mrs. Arbour
and her staff.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the circumstances of Talic's arrest, Mrs. Arbour said
that the move had been entirely the tribunal's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got information that he was likely to attend a conference
in Vienna,'' she said. Once his presence had been verified, she
said, her office sent a warrant and a copy of his indictment to
Vienna. ``We served the arrest warrant late yesterday, and the
arrest was made this morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arbour would not say which country tipped off the tribunal
that Talic would be in Austria. The conference, organized by the
Vienna National Defense Academy, was held also under the auspices
of the multinational Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, some of whose members also provided the tribunal with
information about violence in Kosovo before the arrival of NATO
troops there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a list of people on sealed indictments and we try
to keep an eye on their whereabouts,'' Mrs. Arbour said. ``Of
course we don't have the means to keep them under surveillance,
although I wish we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said that Talic was indicted secretly on March
12, together with Radislav Brdanin, the former Bosnian Serb deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Brdanin, who was arrested by peacekeeping troops in Bosnia on
July 6, is awaiting trial in The Hague. He pleaded not guilty to
charges that he played a role in planning and ordering the
expulsion, torture and murder of Bosnian Muslims and Croats from
the Prijedor region in northwestern Bosnia. The prosecutor said
that the two men will now probably be put on trial together.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-page indictment, which was released Wednesday, describes
Talic as a key strategist in the Bosnian war and traces in some
detail what it describes as his role in the violent attacks on
non-Serbian villages and areas in northern Bosnia.

 &HT;    Maddux plans return after one missed start
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a bad news, good news scenario for Greg Maddux
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He'll miss his start Friday in St. Louis because of the chipped
bone in his right wrist, but he's expected to return to the
rotation Tuesday in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old better-safe-than-sorry plan,'' Maddux said. ``If
I tried to start Friday, I might not make the next one, but if I
wait until 10 days are up, I could probably make the rest of (his
starts this season).''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux injured his wrist on Saturday, diving for a John Vander
Wal pop-up in front of the Padres' dugout. He was examined by team
orthopedist Dr. Joe Chandler on Wednesday and was told there is
some fluid built up in his wrist. Once that diminishes, he should
be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said if I threw it'd probably hurt more for my next start
than it did before,'' Maddux said. ``I thought I could pitch. But I
played a little catch (Tuesday), and by an hour later I was sore.
Luckily my day to pitch was an off day.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the off day today, Terry Mulholland will be able to
pitch Friday in St. Louis on his usual four days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan update
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan was scheduled to have two cortisone shots after
Wednesday's game _ one in his right hand, which has bothered him
since Mike Thurman hit him with a pitch on June 22, and one in his
left wrist, which is sore from overcompensating for the pain in his
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is expected to miss three to five games to allow the
cortisone to take effect. But he hopes to return Saturday when the
Braves play the second of three games against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather miss St. Louis than Cincinnati or Houston or the
Mets,'' said Jordan, whose problems with his right hand weren't
cleared up by two cortisone shots in late July. ``That's why we did
it now, plus the off day.'' O. Perez update
</P>
<P>
   Odalis Perez visited the clubhouse and reported the
rehabilitation of his surgically repaired elbow is going well.
Perez is nearly able to extend his arm fully, which he couldn't
before the surgery three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he's not targeting a specific time to return. He
won't begin throwing again until at least March or April.

 &HT;    Serie A wide open after buying spree
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The dizzying amount of Italian money chasing around
some of world soccer's top glamour boys this summer has been nearly
as riveting as what promises to be an especially intriguing Serie A
season.
</P>
<P>
   At least five, and as many as seven clubs are vying for a
legitimate chance to win the league, which kicks off Saturday. Most
of them have made major moves, rewriting the top of the
international-transfer list in the process. Five of the 10
costliest transactions of all time were conducted by Serie A clubs
in the offseason, and, by all indications, they're not done buying.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion AC Milan, which edged Lazio by a point last
season, has dropped two preseason matches, the Italian Super Cup to
Parma over the weekend and a friendly to Real Madrid on Tuesday.
Owner Silvio Berlusconi, the Steinbrenner-esque former Italian
prime minister and broadcasting mogul, is livid that coach Alberto
Zaccheroni is using an unconventional three-striker attack.
</P>
<P>
   Zaccheroni, who delivered a title in his first year on the job,
shot back: ``I'm the coach, and I'm going to do things as I see
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Playmaker Zvonimir Boban and defender Paolo Maldini will miss
the start of the season with injuries for AC Milan, which brought
in Andrii Shevchenko from Dynamo Kyiv for $25.2 million to join
Oliver Bierhoff and George Weah up front.
</P>
<P>
   Crosstown rivals Inter Milan made the biggest changes after a
dismal eighth-place finish. Inter was devastated by injuries and
went through four coaches, but Ronaldo is fully healthy for the
first time since the 1998 World Cup. The new coach is Marcello
Lippi, who led Juventus to three league titles and a European Cup
trophy in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Vieri made transfer history again when he came to
Inter from Lazio for a world-record $50 million. Lippi brought
goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi and midfielder Vladimir Jugovic with him
from Juve. Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf is rumored to be
on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, which paid $27 million for Vieri just a year ago, used
the hefty profit to acquire Juan Sebastian Veron from Parma for
$30.2 million and forwards Kennet Andersson from Bologna and Simone
Inzaghi from Piacenza.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentina might have won its first scudetto since 1969 had
Gabriel Batistuta not gone down with a knee injury in February.
He's out now with the same knee on the mend, but manager Giovanni
Trappatoni has given him some better aid, with Predrag Mijatovic
coming from Real Madrid and Enrico Chiesa cast off by Parma.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the UEFA Cup, Parma got Brazilian striker Marcio
Amoroso from Udinese for $33.4 million as it reconfigures its
lineup. Among the other newcomers is midfielder Ariel Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   Juve's sixth-place finish had a lot to do with injuries. The
healthy return of midfielder Zinedine Zidane and forward Alessandro
del Piero is imperative, as is that of midfielder Edgar Davids, who
has glaucoma. AS Roma held on to strikers Marco Delvecchio
Francesco Totti and will pair them with Vincenzo Montello, a $24.4
million purchase from relegated Sampdoria.
</P>
<P>
   _ The next tier: Bologna's semifinal run in the UEFA Cup last
year is about as well as it can do. Udinese remains respectable,
despite losing its top talent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hanging around: A small cluster of probable midlevel clubs
includes Venezia, Bari and Torino.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relegation zone: Italy's Cinderella is Reggina in its Serie A
debut, but it is given little hope of avoiding the drop. The other
three demotions should come from the group of Cagliari, Lecce,
Perugia, Piacenza and Verona.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV talk: Fox Sports has not renewed Italian rights, for
budgetary reasons. Italian-language RAI International has weekly
pay-per-view offerings on the DISH Network.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Madrid escapes disaster
</P>
<P>
   Injury-time goals by Raul and Fernando Morientes gave Real
Madrid a 2-1 win over Mallorca on Saturday, on the opening weekend
of the Primera Division season.... Defending champion Barcelona had
to rally in the second half to put Real Zaragoza away 2-0, with
Luis Figo and Dani scoring late.... Rayo Vallecano shocked Atletico
Madrid 2-0, as American goalkeeper Kasey Keller got a shutout in
his Spanish debut.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Leverkusen tops Bayern
</P>
<P>
   Goals from Ulf Kirsten and Oliver Neuville with 11 and five
minutes to play helped Bayer Leverkusen knock off Bayern Munich 2-0
on Sunday, as the Bundesliga continued to generate early upsets....
Hertha Berlin got a late goal from Sebastian Deisler to draw 1-1
with Arminia Bielefeld.
</P>
<P>
   England: A peachy Keane debut
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Keane, 19, had both goals in his Coventry City debut, and
the Sky Blues earned their first win of the year, 2-0 over Derby
County.... Roy Keane, no relation, had two for Manchester United,
including the winner with two minutes to play, as the champions won
2-1 at Arsenal on Sunday.

 &HT;    Enigma in the outfield has talent to determine own future

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Benny Neagle was in trouble early but working his way
out of it, when along came Jones. In this case, Andruw.
</P>
<P>
   It's never easy pitching against a team you've played for, guys
you've traveled with, eaten with, beered with and caught
``red-eyes'' with. And matched against an old locker neighbor, Tom
Glavine. The season hasn't been kind to Denny Neagle, down with a
strained muscle _ left quadriceps, if you must know _ twice on the
disabled list. Here it is late August, and this was only his 12th
start.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams opened with a two-base hit and moved to third on
Bret Boone's base-hit bunt. Men on third and first, nobody out.
Then he got the first Jones on a pop fly high enough to hit the
Goodyear blimp. Brian Jordan topped a pitch that might have
traveled 10 feet. Neagle's throw got him by an eyelash, with
Williams remaining at third.
</P>
<P>
   Now came Andruw. Two strikes, two balls when Neagle nipped the
outside corner for what looked like a third strike to many, not
including Jeff Nelson, whose opinion mattered most. He was working
behind the plate. Andruw next lifted a fly ball that soared and
soared and apparently was headed for Greg Vaughn's glove in left
field. It kept soaring and barely cleared that yellow border atop
the fence, while Vaughn stood there waiting for the ball that never
found his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Three runs scored, and they could have called the rest of the
game. Cincinnati would score only two, and the losing pitcher would
be Neagle. By the sixth inning, while the Braves scored two more
that would count against his earned-run average, he was gone, and
he was not a happy man. He plopped the ball in Don Gullett's hand
when the pitching coach came to excuse him for the rest of the day,
and he stalked off, talking fiercely to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones is a baseball enigma. Sometimes he can make you
hate him, then other times love him. He makes center field look
like the easiest job in baseball, drifting about casually, taking
in another fly ball in a way that makes it seem his body has
absorbed it. Then sometimes he drifts too casually and one gets
away, or it seems he lets a base hit play him instead of the
opposite, and boos fall on his tender ears. It hardly bears
repeating that Bobby Cox lifted him in the middle of an inning last
season for just that sort of sin.
</P>
<P>
   His future is written in stone. He can dictate it by just how
much he puts into it. There's something of DiMaggio in the way he
plays center field, but the two are/were exact opposites in
personality. DiMaggio was somewhat withdrawn, kind of reclusive,
who appeared not to enjoy being an idol _ nothing ever casual in
his style, but a carefully calculated manner of pursuit. Jones is a
child in a man's body, still wears a boyish smile, quite
approachable and open almost to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   It's rather odd that his defensive style should define him more
clearly than his offense. Yet, while delivering the winning bomb
against the Reds, it was totally overlooked that he also had eight
putouts. He's on a course toward 500 this season, and that has been
done only eight times in history, the last time 20 years ago. The
late Richie Ashburn did it four times. Jones should match or pass
that record.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went into this series hearing footsteps. In true '90s
style, they turned it up a notch, reached back for a little extra
and swept the Reds in three, seventh in a row. Now they have a
cushion, if not a fat and comfortable one. Their pitching has taken
shape. Glavine has found his old form. John Smoltz has performed
the miracle of completely remodeling his pitching style in the
course of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was beautiful, except where were the fans? A lovely
summer's afternoon, warm but not hot, no threat of serious weather,
and there were more vacant than occupied seats. But you have a long
time to catch Andruw's act. Just be thankful they now have padded
outfield walls, for another phenom, Pete Reiser, left his career on
the concrete walls of Ebbets Field.

U.N. MAY BE FORCED TO ABANDON IDEA OF MULTIETHNIC KOSOVO

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ As efforts to have Serbs and Albanians
live together in Kosovo seem to be failing, the U.N. administration
has been forced to consider the defacto segregation of Serbian
enclaves and even the temporary resettlement of Serbs to protect
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly three months since NATO stopped bombing Yugoslavia
and took over the administration of the devastated province of
Kosovo, pressure has been mounting from Belgrade and from Serbs
within Kosovo to formally partition the province into Serbian and
Albanian cantons. But the United States and its allies strongly
oppose a formal partition because it would mean abandoning the
stated goals of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at a heated meeting here with Albanian and Serb
representatives, Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. special representative,
rejected pleas by the Serbs to do just that. He said the United
Nations and the NATO-led peacekeeping force still intended to try
to protect the Serbs where they live, even if it means guarding
individual houses and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if security cannot be fully insured in some areas and
within a certain time span would we consider temporary or
provisional resettlement,'' Kouchner was quoted as saying by Nadia
Younes, a spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Kosovo who was
present at the meeting Wednesday of the Transitional Council, which
includes leaders from both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But some Serbs have already moved on their own to places within
Kosovo that they consider safer, and others have been movedby the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The refugee agency has moved
some 400 people to Serbia or to safer locations inside Kosovo since
NATO's arrival in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a life-threatening situation, we can move them within
or out of Kosovo,'' said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the refugee
agency here. He said Wednesday that Serbs are already congregating
in majority Serbian villages or in areas in eastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior administration official said that the
notion of resettling Serbs into what would essentially be ghettos
was a ``bad idea'' that the administration would attempt to
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't accept that,'' the official said. ``We're not signing
up to that. We're going to try to prevent it from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But the official acknowledged that the high tensions between the
Albanians and the Serbs made it ``tough in the short term'' to
guarantee safety for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The whole fabric of the administration's policy in Kosovo is
based on the notion that the Albanians and Serbs can live together
in a multiethnic society. If Kouchner found it necessary to move
Serbs into their own areas, the policy _ repeated many times by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ would be a failure, less
than three months after the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The administration's top envoy on Kosovo, Ambassador James
Dobbins, is due in Pristina on Thursday and plans to tell Kouchner
that the administration is opposed to the idea of resettlement, the
official said. ``We're not adopting this as a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The official acknowledged that the current atmosphere was not
conducive to full integration between Serbs and Albanians _ a
situation that has not existed in Kosovo in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But as a demonstration of opposition to Kouchner's move,
Washington would like some of the Serbs who have left Kosovo to
return, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some 180,000 Serbs from a pre-war population of 200,000 have
left Kosovo during and since the war, and barely 1,000 now remain
in the capital, Pristina. The returning Albanian population is
subjecting those who remain to threats and violence, which NATO
troops and U.N. police have struggled to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   But the peacekeepers have been unable to stem the violence and
protect the dwindling Serbian population and other minorities, like
the gypsies, placing the idea of partition back onto the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had pushed for the
partition of Kosovo during negotiations before the war, calling for
the northern part of the province to be made Serbian and the rest
to be abandoned to the Kosovo Albanians. Western negotiators,
Americans among them, rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By simply considering cantonization Kouchner caused
consternation this week among foreign diplomats and aid workers,
particularly Albanians. He rejected the idea, however, and promised
merely to beef up security at Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was stormy, not least because for the first time it
brought together rival Albanian leaders Hashim Thaci and Ibrahim
Rugova, along with the Serbian leaders Bishop Artemije and Momcilo
Trajkovic, the leader of the Serbian Resistance Movement and the
only prominent Serbian politician left in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr Kouchner is against cantonization,'' said Ms. Younes. ``The
use of the word even we are not keen on. It is quite loaded, and is
rejected by the Albanians.But we are very aware that it is
essential to protect people. We are trying to steer away from
cantons and step up security for the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Trajkovic had called for the creation of cantons last week and
presented a modified proposal at Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He wants five distinct areas in Kosovo to be allotted to Serbs
and to cover approximately a sixth of the province. Those areas
would observe Serbian law and have Serbian-run administrations,
essentially creating autonomous islands of Serb control within
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cause is not to divide but to end the tragedy of people
leaving Kosovo,'' Trajkovic said after the meeting. . ``We are not
separating the country but organizing local government.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina peacekeepers are now guarding individual Serbs,
living in the top floors of apartment blocks or camping out 24
hours a day in front of the gate of a Serbian house. They have been
dubbed the ``granny patrols'' since because so often the remaining
Serbs are often poor and elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Four British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, the Highlanders, are
on constant watch on their Saxon armored vehicle outside the house
of Dusanka Ristic, 54, since her 80 year-old mother, Ljubica Simic,
was shot in the face by intruders two weeks ago. Her mother is
still hospitalized. Ms. Ristic never leaves the house and is
grateful that the threats and insults from Albanians have stopped
since the soldiers began guarding her.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' commander says he can spare the men for the
constant watch because he has only four Serbs in his district to
guard, including an Orthodox priest. He admits that as Serbs leave,
the job becomes easier. Yet neither he nor Ms. Ristic see an end to
the constant guard.

GORE CULTIVATES THE IDEA OF CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tucked into Vice President Al Gore's stump speech
these days is the germ of an idea that his aides say will grow into
a full-blown campaign theme in the months ahead _ that Gore will be
the steward of change as the world hurtles into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he is trying to redefine the political use of the word
change. While he wants to convey that a Gore administration would
be a change from the Clinton administration, Gore also seeks to
reassure people that he stands for stability and will carry the
successes of the Clinton years into a world that is anxious about
how rapidly it is changing.
</P>
<P>
   These are somewhat conflicting messages. On the one hand is a
desire for a break from the status quo, while on the other is a
sense that the nation needs someone who can provide continuity and
reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   A top Gore strategist explained the campaign's thinking this
way: ``In 1992, there was a classic desire for change,'' he said.
``It was focused around economic issues and health care. In 1999
it's different. People understand they are living in a period of
profound change. Working families don't get up saying, `Am I going
to lose my job?' They are saying, `Is my kid going to be safe at
school?' There is a whole host of livability issues that the press
laughs at but I can assure you are pretty profound issues for
people. We are beginning to bring a coherent theme to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, all candidates promise change and want to represent
it, if only because voters eventually tire of the status quo and
want something fresh and different. This is what led Ronald Reagan
to declare, somewhat improbably, ``We are the change,'' when he
spoke on behalf of his vice president, George Bush, at the 1988
Republican convention. Reagan at the time was concluding eight
years in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Clinton-Gore ticket offered itself as the ``agent
of change,'' breaking with the Bush administration. But that was a
different kind of change from what Gore is talking about as he
competes for the Democratic presidential nomination against former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has many positions similar to
Gore's, and against a raft of Republicans, most of whom are
painting Gore as the status quo that needs to be upended.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one goal of the Gore campaign theme, said Stephen Hess,
a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, is to pre-empt
other candidates from using the slogan of change. ``Before the
Republicans stand for change, Gore wants to make it his very own,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore speaks of change in only the vaguest terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the world is going through a more rapid and
tumultuous period of change than ever in human history, as
Americans, we have to provide leadership,'' he told a small group
of Democratic donors in Washington the other night.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Change is always resisted. And we have been bringing
change. The question is whether or not that change will continue,
whether or not the prosperity will continue, whether or not we'll
use it to make sure that no one is left behind. That's what I stand
for.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore to his listeners that he is prepared to lead the
world into a new dimension beyond the Clinton years, Gore asserted:
``We've built a foundation. Now it's time to reach for the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a complicit partner in the message of change, just as
audaciously as Reagan was in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue in this election will not be whether we should vote
for change or not,'' Clinton told the same audience as he
introduced Gore. ``The issue is what kind of change we'll vote for.
We're living in an inherently dynamic time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster and adviser to the Gore
campaign, said Gore wanted to convey confidence to voters who feel
an underlying anxiety about school violence, keeping up with
technology and remaining prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   ``People recognize that the world is changing at a faster pace
than ever before, and they want a president who is going to help
make the future work for them,'' Mellman said. ``In focus groups,
people talk about education and not being able to do the things
that their kids can do on computers and fitting into the new
economy and all these issues in medicine _ genetic testing and
genetically modified food and the right to die. Their moorings have
been loosened a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that beyond the tactical goal, the Gore campaign was
trying to accomplish several tasks with the word change. One is to
assuage a natural fear about change. Another is to jazz up Gore's
image because change is a word that conveys ``excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Change in a political context is usually identified with
reform, so there is a subliminal message that they aren't just
stuck in the mud,'' Hess said. ``They're also trying to sort out
how Gore can take credit for what's been, take advantage of the
President's strengths and differentiate himself enough so that he
has his own persona.''
</P>
<P>
   As for pre-empting his rivals with the change slogan, so far it
does not seem to have worked too well. Gov. George W. Bush, the
Texas Republican whose candidacy represents an inherent change from
Clinton, has been leading Gore in the polls for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley likes to put forward the notion that he is the one who
offers a ``fresh start.'' Anita Dunn, a top adviser to Bradley,
said the desire for change would be ``one of the major factors in
this election, and a vice president is de facto the candidate of
the status quo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though Gore leads Bradley among Democrats, he still has had
obvious difficulty in separating himself from Clinton. Earlier this
year, he toyed with the idea of change as a natural break in the
calendar, an epochal divide that necessarily would leave Clinton
(and his scandals) in the past and allow Gore to proceed
unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only the beginning of a new century and a new
millennium,'' Gore said in March. ``It's the beginning of a whole
new era in human history.'' This, he said, posed a new set of
challenges and new solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But some aides thought this was too elliptical, and Gore dropped
that formulation. In June he called Clinton's extramarital behavior
inexcusable and said he would bring his own values to the Oval
Office _ a split that some Democrats, including those in the White
House, found too stark and that Gore's staff said news
organizations ``overinterpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore talks less now of separation from Clinton and more of a
sense of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the policies that work, and we know how they can be
applied to the brand new circumstances and the brand new problems
that will confront us at the beginning of the new century,'' Gore
said last week. He specifically mentioned balancing the budget,
overhauling the government's regulatory structure, opening new
markets and investing in education.
</P>
<P>
   Education is one of the top concerns of voters, and Gore is so
adamant about offering changes in public education that he
describes his approach as ``revolutionary.'' This usually leaves
his audiences a little puzzled, because he talks about reducing
class size by adding more teachers, and connecting all classrooms
to the Internet, _ efforts already under way.
</P>
<P>
   In his stump speech, Gore injects a note of uncertainty about
the future, which may reflect his vacillating relationship with
Clinton. He has taken to quoting the Spanish poet Antonio Machado,
saying: ``Traveler, there is no path. You make your path as you
travel.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Unfazed by the overwhelming odds against
attaining a modest desk job at Banco do Brasil SA, Latin America's
largest financial institution, Marta Oliveira submitted a job
application Wednesday at a bustling downtown branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need stability in my life,'' said Ms. Oliveira, a
23-year-old with bleached-blonde hair. Although her current salary
as a manager at a retail-credit outlet is higher than the 732
reais, or $381, a month she would receive as a clerk at Banco do
Brasil, she said, ``This is the only way I see of building a career
for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliveira is joining as many as 1 million people, or 1 out of
160 Brazilians, who are vying this month for about 10,000 new jobs
at Banco do Brasil, a sprawling, 191-year-old, government-run
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Even some long-time Banco do Brasil employees who lost their
jobs in earlier cutbacks are vying for the entry-level positions,
which the bank has advertised as part of an effort to fill
vacancies that will arise in the next few years. The bank has a
work force of 72,000 people, making it one of Brazil's biggest
employers.
</P>
<P>
   The entry-level positions are coveted because they come with
benefits not common in other jobs, such as comprehensive health
insurance, a pension plan and a salary paid on time and in full.
The job also pays more than five times Brazil's minimum wage of 140
reais a month, about $73.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of applications illustrates the job bleakness in
Brazil, even as it is slowly emerging from a recession.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive privatization of Brazilian industry and an easing
of protectionist laws that had shielded local businesses from
foreign competition are important reasons why the unemployment rate
has nearly doubled in the past few years to more than 8 percent.
That figure doesn't account for vast numbers of skilled Brazilians
working at low-skilled jobs with no career future.
</P>
<P>
   Before the government accelerated privatization auctions in the
mid-1990s, selling controlling interests in business ranging from
railroads to phone companies to electric utilities, Banco do Brasil
and other state companies were viewed as some of the best places to
work.
</P>
<P>
   It was Banco do Brasil, with branches in almost every
municipality, from the frontier towns of the Amazon to the
industrial centers of the country's South, that symbolized this
desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a job at Banco do Brasil was the best way to achieve
status and upward mobility,'' said Mailson da Nobrega, who after
starting a career at the bank in the 1960s in his native state of
Paraiba, eventually became Brazil's finance minister and later an
influential consultant.
</P>
<P>
   After the economy opened up in the 1990s, though, Brazil's
employment landscape changed. New job possibilities were introduced
to Brazilians with high school and college educations. While these
Brazilians found promising careers at multinational companies that
were establishing themselves in Brazil, other transformations were
creating new legions of jobless people.
</P>
<P>
   A cutback in the large government bureaucracy, for instance, put
many long-time civil servants out of work at Banco do Brasil and
other big state firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil never had as many people unemployed as it does today,''
said Marcio Pochmann, an economist at the University of Campinas.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest spike in unemployment to nearly 9 percent came
early this year after the economy slowed in 1998. (Wednesday, the
government said unemployment declined to 8.12 percent in July from
8.4 percent in June.)
</P>
<P>
   Among those caught by limited job possibilities were people like
Alcebiades Rego Rego, who is 52 and originally from Piaui, a poor
state in Brazil's Northeast, worked at Banco do Brasil for 24 years
before leaving the bank with a generous severance package a couple
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said two efforts to open a small business of his
own were thwarted by the high cost of borrowing money. Now he is
one of the applicants for the new openings at his old employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared to start at the bottom again to get my job
back,'' said Rego in an interview outside a Banco do Brasil branch
after he dropped off his application.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements for the clerk jobs are stringent enough to
allow only a small minority of Brazilians to apply. Applicants, who
must have a high school diploma, are tested on Portuguese grammar,
math, the banking system, current affairs and some English. They
must also pay 20 reais, or $10.40, for the application.
</P>
<P>
   Many people also purchase study guides that hawkers sell in
front of the bank's branches throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of Brazilians who aren't qualified to work at
Banco do Brasil, the employment dilemma is even more striking. A
recent government study showed that 36 million people, or half of
Brazil's workforce, completed only the local equivalent of junior
high school or below.
</P>
<P>
   One example of how this large part of society has been squeezed
came in June when the government of Sao Paulo created 50,000
openings in ``labor fronts,'' jobs like street sweeping, cleaning
train tracks and watering public gardens. The jobs pay a salary of
150 reais a month and include a monthly supply of basic foodstuffs
like beans, rice and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   About 450,000 people applied. Those selected were heads of
families, senior citizens and people who had been unemployed for
the longest amount of time.

58 ARRESTED IN SMUGGLING OF DRUGS ON AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The smugglers moved with ease through Miami
International Airport and even made their way onto American
Airlines planes parked at the gates, stashing heroin in coffee
containers in the planes' galleys and hiding cocaine and marijuana
in suitcases in the jets' baggage holds, a federal indictment filed
Wednesday charged. Once, they even agreed to stash on board three
hand grenades, as carry-on baggage.
</P>
<P>
   As they went about their illegal business, in plain sight of
passengers and airport security officers, federal investigators
said, the smugglers did not worry about being caught by the
airline. They were the airline.
</P>
<P>
   In the culmination of a sting operation that exposed
embarrassing security lapses by both the airline and the airport,
federal agents arrested more than 50 American Airlines baggage
handlers and food contract workers Wednesday morning, charging them
in multiple indictments of conspiracy, importation and distribution
of drugs, and weapons trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation, which first came to light two years ago
when an American Airlines pilot was accidentally served a mixture
of coffee and heroin from a smuggled parcel and complained that it
``tasted weird,'' was more than just a drug crime, said
investigators. It put passengers at risk, said Ed Halley, a
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs, the investigation showed, were hidden in overhead
compartments, the small metal food carts the flight attendants use,
wall panels, bathrooms, kitchen areas, cargo holds and _ more
ominously _ inside the wheel bays on American planes, said Halley.
``This compresses against cables and wiring,'' he said of the drug
shipments. ``If cocaine shifts, and breaks a wire, you're in big
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, what if the pilots had been posioned by the
heroin in the coffee. ``Who flies the plane?''
</P>
<P>
   In a predawn raid at the airport and at the homes of dozens of
American Airlines ramp workers, baggage handlers and contract
workers, federal agents arrested 58 people in all, including two
agents with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, a
Customs inspector and an off-duty employee at the Broward County
Sheriff's Department, who worked as a baggage handler.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, some 50 people had been indicted on narcotics and
weapons charges in a two-pronged operation that targeted employees
of LSG/Sky Chefs, a food service contractor owned by Lufthansa
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were convinced we could basically get anything on the
planes,'' said U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott, whose office led the
operation. The baggage handlers and food service workers apparently
had no difficulty in finding and removing the hidden drugs, under
the noses of other employees and airport security.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the airport, said Scott, was ``obviously
insufficient to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The accused smugglers went to work on their off days, in
uniform, to help find the hidden drugs and re-ship them, and were
rarely questioned why they just showed up on work crews,
investigators said. They operated with surprising arrogance, said
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people make $17,18,19 an hour with their regular jobs
and they still weren't satisfied,'' said Halley. ``They were
extremely confident individuals. It was no big deal at all for
them. We obviously were not their only clients. They said, `If
you've got the money, we'll get it through.'
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the American employees carried the drugs themselves, he
said, ``they used their American Airlines IDs, got past the ticket
counter and weren't asked any questions by ticket agents typically
asked to a normal passenger, like, if anyone had given them
something to take on board. Then, they passed security, loaded
their stuff on American Airline's baggage carriers and flew on free
flights.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline, in a prepared statement, said that ``while we are
disturbed that a small group of employees was part of this
smuggling ring, their activities have been under federal government
and company surveillance for quite some time. We will continue our
efforts with law enforcement officials to stem the flow of illegal
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said it was not a case of a few rogue
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they had was a very elaborate scheme for aiding in the
distribution of narcotics and weapons,'' said Halley. ``For a
price, they would bypass security and deliver anything that was
paid for to a person who was paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than regarding the arrests as a wake-up call to American
Airlines that it needs to be be more vigilant, a company spokesman,
Chris Chiames, said the airline viewed it as confirmation that it
was doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got numerous programs and surveillance programs in place
regarding people who have access to airport facilities,'' said
Chiames. ``We view these kind of incidents as proof that the
programs work.''
</P>
<P>
   No American managers or pilots were arrested in Miami. But eight
other people, including seven American employees, were arrested in
eastern New York state in a related case, and 10 Colombians were
arrested over the weekend in Cali, Colombia, on drug charges that
included allegations that they used American Airlines flights to
smuggle more than a half ton of heroin and cocaine to Miami over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   American, a respected foreign carrier, was used by smugglers in
Cali because ``its planes were not subjected to as rigorus
inspections as occurs with Colombian airlines,'' according to a
statement from the Colombian government. The drugs, according to
that statement, were hidden in the planes' tail sections, in
electrical compartments and behind the pilots' seats.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the arrests in Colombia were related to the
U.S. arrests, but federal officials here did say that Colombian law
enforcement officials had helped in their operation at the Miami
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Halley said undercover agents had also paid to have guns and
even military explosives _ fake _ smuggled on board by employees
who had no qualms about placing even grenades in the overhead bin.
</P>
<P>
   `` We approached them during one transaction and asked them to
carry three hand grenades and a loaded pistol and they had
absolutely no problem with it,'' said Halley. ``The only thing they
were concerned about was their own safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Halley said they charged $7,000 for delivery of guns and $1,500
per kilogram of cocaine, in 38 different transactions during the
sting operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal agents did not know how many drug and weapons shipments
were made before the sting operation, with its bogus drugs and
guns, were planned, but they said the smuggling operation was
already in full force by the time they began their operation.
</P>
<P>
   The use of commercial jets to smuggle drugs is an industry-wide
problem, said investigators. In July 1997, 12 Delta Airlines
employees were indicted on charges of trying to smuggle some $1
million in cocaine from Cali.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something unique to American Airlines,'' said
Halley. ``This kind of thing is most likely happening on other
airlines as well. This is only the beginning.''

RITE AID STOCK SOARS ON TALK OF A DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., West Coast)  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Rite Aid Corp., the nation's third-largest drugstore
chain, jumped $3.4375, or 17.6 percent, to $22.875, in after-hours
trading Wednesday after the company announced that it was
discussing a possible transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said late Wednesday that Rite Aid might sell all or
part of the 1,000 West Coast stores it acquired from Thrifty
Payless Holdings Inc. in December 1996. Rite Aid's West Coast
stores, which are larger than many of the company's other outlets,
have underperformed over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rite Aid's shares have plunged 54 percent this year,
analysts said they did not think the entire company would be
acquired. Rite Aid, which is based in Camp Hill, Pa., has 3,880
stores in 30 states and owns PCS, a pharmacy benefit manager.

 &HT;    Hurricane Dennis intensifying near Bahamas
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's looking a little more like Dennis
could become a menace to South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of following a tidy path northward Wednesday as
meteorologists thought it would, the tropical storm lollygagged
north of the Dominican Republic, intensified and is now threatening
parts of the Bahamas. By this morning, Dennis was expected to earn
hurricane status as it headed northwest toward the central and
northwestern Bahamian islands.
</P>
<P>
   If Dennis continues to dawdle, the low-pressure system that
seemed destined to push the storm out to sea may not meet up with
Dennis at all, said National Hurricane Center meteorologist Krissy
Williams. If that happens, there may be little to keep Dennis from
striking Florida, Georgia or the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, Dennis was starting to move toward the
north/northwest again, meteorologists said. But as long as the
storm remained nearly stalled, experts couldn't guess if _ or when
_ it might make landfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big question of the day,'' Williams said. ``If
Dennis decides just to sit there ... we may get a little worried.
We could have some problems in South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just Dennis. Two other tropical storms, Cindy and
Emily, were still dancing to the south and east of South Florida on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the three storms has state and local emergency
officials on alert. Though emergency status has not been declared,
and won't be until watches or warnings are posted for Florida,
officials are speaking by phone daily to make sure everyone remains
prepared, said Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the state Department of
Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy should still pose no threat to the U.S. coastline,
Williams said. Although it's a big storm that's likely to gain
hurricane strength again, Cindy is expected to continue northward.
A high pressure system northeast of Cindy should continue to pull
the storm toward cooler water, where Cindy will lose strength and
die a quiet death in the Atlantic, meteorologists predict.
</P>
<P>
   Emily, though, still deserves attention, Williams said. So far,
Cindy's impressive strength _ with tropical storm-force winds
extending out 175 miles _ has helped keep Emily in line. Only 600
miles separated the two storms Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're interacting with each other,'' Williams said. ``What
Cindy's doing to Emily is maybe breaking Emily up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Cindy is far enough to the north, however, Emily probably
will intensify, experts said. Emily could become a hurricane in two
to three days. Emily could strike the Lesser Antilles, about 1,500
miles southeast of Florida, by the weekend, said National Weather
Service meteorologist Bernard Esposito.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Emily could still be a danger to South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does have an effect, it won't be until next weekend,''
Esposito said. ``It's still a week away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, even if Dennis politely jogs to the north and
skips the U.S. coast entirely, its mere presence will influence
Florida's weather _ higher temperatures and less than usual rain.
</P>
<P>
   As Dennis rolls northward, the storm's weaker western side would
pull warm winds from the north toward South Florida, gathering more
warmth as they soared over the state, Esposito said. That would
mean higher temperatures _ in the low- to mid-90s _ and fewer
thunderstorms.

 &HT;    Cameras, black boxes to record crashes of young, old
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cameras and devices similar to ``black
boxes'' on airplanes soon may be mounted on 1,000 vehicles to study
habits of older and younger drivers, Florida Atlantic University
researchers said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed two-year study would bring FAU the largest single
grant project in its history _ more than $5 million in corporate
and government awards _ said Mary Russell of the university's
College of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ awaiting state approval _ will focus on local
high-risk drivers, identified as those older than 74 and younger
than 25, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those two groups of drivers accounted for 18,159 crashes,
resulting in 52 deaths and 8,042 injuries, according to 1998 Palm
Beach County traffic engineering statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said she hopes the study will help establish liability
in crashes, increase driver accountability, reduce insurance fraud
and better identify high-risk drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Recorder Study will seek 1,000
volunteers who are willing to have tiny cameras mounted in the
front of their vehicle and a transportation recorder, like an
aircraft's ``black box,'' mounted in the rear of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the study would work:
</P>
<P>
   The recorder measures speed, direction of travel, and a slew of
other data. When a crash occurs, the device will save and transmit
to the university _ via a cellular phone uplink _ data from 30
seconds before the crash to 15 seconds after it.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said researchers hope to start selecting volunteers by
Oct. 1 and have their vehicles equipped and ready for the road by
Jan. 1. She added that volunteers may be eligible for a discount
from their insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Reynolds, product manager of VDO North America _ which will
provide the crash recorders for the study _ said the company has
been selling and installing the recorders in Europe for 10 years
and has done a number of smaller trials in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first large effort in the U.S.,'' he said.
``You wouldn't dream of getting on a plane without a black box.
Someday we will look back and wonder why it took us so long to
bring this technology over to vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be the first time vehicles in the U.S. will have
black boxes installed in them.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, car manufacturers, including General Motors and
Ford, have equipped millions of their cars with devices that record
similar data similar to what FAU would collect. Car companies
intend to use it to help build safer cars.
</P>
<P>
   John Mackey, chairman of L.M.S. _ a New York corporation also
helping pay for the FAU program _ said their system is designed
specifically to give medical and safety researchers a firsthand
view of what happens during a crash and use that information to
reduce death and injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will finally be able to fully understand who and what is at
fault in an accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program is supported by a half dozen corporate partners,
including VDO, L.M.S. and Boca Raton-based Forensic Accident
Investigations, which will provide grant money, technical advise
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the project also has the support of the National
Transportation Safety Board, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration and the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   A group of program researchers is meeting with the Florida
Department of Transportation on Sept. 7 to discuss the project and
the possibility of obtaining some money from the state, said
Russell. She said she's confident the program will get under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to deal with a lot of legal and ethical
issues,'' she said. ``We still need to answer a lot of questions.''

PARENTS FRET OVER OPTIONS AFTER JUDGE BANS VOUCHER PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Maine)  (js) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Maria Silaghi did not sleep Tuesday night. She
scrubbed other people's floors until after midnight. And then she
lay in bed and agonized over whether her 10-year-old son, Anthony,
might have to leave his Roman Catholic grammar school.
</P>
<P>
   People like Ms. Silaghi have been fretfully weighing their
options since a federal judge here on Tuesday suspended a
4-year-old voucher program that allowed poor children to attend
private and parochial schools at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't take this away from us,'' said Ms. Silaghi, a
34-year-old house cleaner, as she sat near a statue of the Blessed
Virgin in the halls of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, seemingly a world
away from her West Side neighborhood, where children grow up
learning the street-gang swagger. ``My son needs this.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling to suspend the vouchers for some 4,000 children at
56 schools until he had time to consider a lawsuit challenging the
constitutionality of the program, Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. said the
plan had the ``primary effect of advancing religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling drew praise from opponents of vouchers, who say the
program violates the constitutional separation of church and state
and undermines the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   But many parents who use voucher programs say it is academic
strength, along with rigorous discipline, that makes the schools
they choose so desirable. Of the 70 students on vouchers at Our
Lady of Mount Carmel, about half are not Catholic. Many poor and
working-class people in the city say parochial schools offer their
children the best shot at keeping up with their counterparts in
good suburban schools, not to mention elite private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to move to the suburbs,'' said Ms. Silaghi, who
beamed proudly as her son, Anthony, came out of school and greeted
some adults with courtesy and poise. ``If you send your children to
the public schools in the city, you're taking a big risk. I won't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a breath and fought back tears, then added, ``I'll work
10 jobs before I send him to the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sister Rosario Vega, the principal at Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
said she had spent the last day fielding telephone calls from
frantic parents who were worried that their children would have to
leave school because they could not afford the $800-a-year tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling them, `Calm down, we'll work through this
together,' '' said Sister Rosario. Outside the 50-year-old
red-brick school, trimmed with marigolds and petunias, some worried
parents embraced and tried to shore up one another.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   School officials in the archdiocese have been telling parents
not to pull their children out of their schools until the case
works its way through the courts. Some smaller religious schools,
however, have expressed doubt about their survival without
vouchers.

   Started by the Ohio Legislature in 1995, the voucher program
gave poor families up to $2,250 per child to apply toward tuition
at private and parochial schools. It was the nation's first program
to allow vouchers to be used for religious schools. While Milwaukee
had an earlier voucher program, started in 1990, it did not allow
religious schools to participate until after Cleveland did. The
Milwaukee program was upheld by the Wisconsin Supreme Court last
year, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear appeals of that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's attorney general, Betty D. Montgomery, filed an emergency
appeal with the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.
Proponents of the voucher plan say they will take their fight to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph L. Conn, of Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, an opponent of the vouchers, said the Cleveland decision
``brings the voucher train to a screeching halt.'' But advocates of
vouchers promise to fight on, not just in Cleveland but also in
states like Florida, where a statewide voucher program that began
this year faces a court challenge, and in Maine, where a court
ruling prohibiting the use of vouchers is on appeal.

   ``We are confident that the way we set up our program will
withstand a legal challenge,'' said Karen Chandler, the spokeswoman
for the Florida department of education. ``The Legislature was very
careful in writing the law, very mindful of the church and state
issues. We believe we've kept them apart adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Robert Bagley, of Raymond, struck a similar note of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Though earlier this year a court denied his request to use
public money to send his two teen-age boys to a Catholic school, he
predicted he would win the financing on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to take this all the way to the United States
Supreme Court,'' he said. ``This isn't about the state getting
involved in religion. It's about my wife and I needing money to
help send our kids to a school that charges tuition. That school
happens to be run by a church. So what? Others needing help might
pick a nonchurch school.''

   A Harvard University study of the Cleveland program in 1997
found that it had raised test scores of students. The study found
that ``these private schools seem to be able to create an
educational environment that parents see as safer, more focused on
academics and giving more individual attention to the child.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little debate that some religious schools in
urban neighborhoods, especially Catholic schools, have demonstrated
great success with poor children. A nationwide study of 1,500
schools by the University of Chicago in 1989 found that religious
schools had a lower dropout rate than both public schools and
nonreligious private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, the late professor James Coleman, said
many poor urban children thrived in religious schools, with their
emphasis on structure and discipline and an ethos of caring for one
another. Catholic schools in America, some scholars have noted,
were organized for a largely working-class, immigrant student body,
not terribly different from the students in big cities today.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the judge's ruling, on the day before school
started, came in for much criticism here. The Cleveland Plain
Dealer, in an editorial titled ``Voucher vulture,'' complained that
the last-minute ruling threw families and schools into needless
fear and confusion. The newspaper called it ``an act of arrogance,
carelessness and utter disregard for the needs of children across
the city.''

   The Cleveland public schools, like many districts in big cities,
have struggled for decades with low test scores and teacher
dissension. Their new leader, Barbara Byrd-Bennett, a former New
York City educator, has begun a series of ambitious measures,
including a summer school for about one-fifth of the students
enrolled in the district. But many parents in Cleveland say the
public schools have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Spurgeon, who has three children who receive aid to
attend Our Lady of Mount Carmel, said she could not fathom turning
to the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard about the judge's ruling, she said, she grew
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't be true, it just can't be,'' she recalled saying,
over and over. ``I thought, `We've got to make some decisions and
we've got to make them this minute.' It was like somebody stabbed
me in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Spurgeon was just about to start attending a vocational
college for automotive technology. She has canceled her enrollment,
however, because she does not kno whether the family might need to
use the tuition money for her children's school.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, Daniel, a delivery truck driver, walked in the
door, she told him they might have to take the children out of
their school.
</P>
<P>
   He told her, ``I'll work two jobs.''

HARVARD, TO IMPROVE TOWN-GOWN RELATIONS, AGREES TO PAY MORE TAXES
TO BOSTON

<P>
   BOSTON _ When a mayor accuses a university of ``the highest
level of arrogance seen in our city in many years,'' it is a pretty
good bet that town-gown relations have hit a notable nadir. Around
here, it is also a pretty good bet that the university in question
is Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the situation two years ago, when Harvard disclosed
that it had been quietly buying up 52 acres to expand in the
Allston section of Boston, across the Charles River from its
Cambridge campus. Outrage ensued in City Hall, and Boston's mayor,
Thomas M. Menino, a neighborhood kind of guy, sharply criticized
the university for what he said was its failure to be ``up front
with the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But a deal announced on Tuesday seems to presage a possible
period of peace and harmony between the nation's most prestigious
university and its premier college town.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Harvard will increase the voluntary
payments that it makes to Boston in lieu of the taxes it would pay
if it were a commercial rather than a nonprofit entity. (It was the
potential loss of $1.5 million a year in taxes that so upset City
Hall about the Harvard purchases.) Over all, the university will
hand over $40 million in such payments in the next 20 years _ $12
million more than under a previous agreement _ and will build 288
apartments for graduate students elsewhere in Allston.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures may not sound earth-shattering, but the big change
came in the tone emanating from the city and the university. Menino
talks about ``a new day'' of Harvard-Boston cooperation. Harvard's
president, Neil Rudenstine, praised the mayor ``for his leadership
and the quality of his team.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's ``relationship with Boston has been up and down,''
said Paul Grogan, the new university vice president in charge of
community relations. ``There was consternation several years ago
about the acquisition of property in the Allston neighborhood, and
so part of what this is all about is getting the relationship
firmly on the right track. And you do that by building respect and
trust and having a positive and open discussion that leads to a
good result.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although it was the 52 acres in Allston, an ethnically diverse
neighborhood of triple-decker homes, restaurants and auto shops,
that soured relations, that land is not directly connected to the
new payment agreement. The payments, rather, are meant to
compensate for a major expansion of Harvard Business School on
other property in Allston: more than a half-million square feet
that will include a student center, housing and space for programs
geared to mid-career executives, Grogan said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal seems to bode well for Allston's residents, said Paul
Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association and a member
of a community task force that includes university and city
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has done is sort of unjammed the process for
development for Harvard for the projects they've had in the
pipeline,'' Berkeley said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the city would say, exactly, that it has been blocking
Harvard since the land-buying ruckus began, he added, but it wants
to complete the deal on the payments, and it is ``first things
first from the city's perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Berkeley said, plans can proceed on projects that residents
hope will bring new life to an area dominated by gritty industrial
lots.
</P>
<P>
   By any reckoning, Harvard desperately needs Allston if it is
going to use any of its $13 billion-plus endowment _ the largest of
any university in the world _ to expand. Cambridge, the seat of
Harvard's core campus, is densely developed, and Cambridge
residents are said to have an attitude that goes beyond Nimby _ an
acronym for ``not in my back yard'' _ to what some call Banana:
``build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Allston, already home to the Harvard Business School and several
other properties, including an athletic complex, is the obvious
spot to build. University officials say they are considering many
options for the 52 acres, working out plans for the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard now owns about the same amount of land _ more than 220
acres _ in Boston as in Cambridge, Grogan said, excluding the
Arnold Arboretum, which functions as a city park.
</P>
<P>
   The graduate student housing that Harvard has promised to build
in Allston addresses a frequent complaint from Boston residents
that the tens of thousands of students at the city's colleges drive
up rental prices and crowd its neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The new housing ``will free up some of the space so desperately
needed in the city,'' Menino said.

<P>
   Just as Harvard seems to be bursting at the seams physically
these days, its pockets seem to be bursting at the seams, too. On
Thursday it is scheduled to lower into place the final sections of
a decorative spire atop Memorial Hall, the replacement for a spire
that was destroyed by fire in 1956. The cost of the alumni-financed
project: $4 million.

 &HT;    Martin camp hoping for hung jury as trial continues
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The career of bankrupt Miami Dolphins receiver Tony
Martin, and his ability to collect most of a $14.2 million
contract, hangs on jury deliberations that were to enter their
third day today.
</P>
<P>
   Martin remained outwardly cool while waiting in a federal
courtroom hall Wednesday for the verdict in his money-laundering
case with about 20 family members, friends and clergy.
</P>
<P>
   He napped, chatted and quietly signed an autograph for Wilson
Lous, 15, of Miami. ``To me, I think he looks innocent,'' Lous
said. ``I think he's just waiting his time.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk in the Martin camp was subdued but hopeful. The hope is
that the jury is hung up on charges against co-defendant and
convicted drug dealer Rickey Brownlee, a view that was bolstered by
the jury's request Tuesday for court transcripts relating to
Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors sent U.S. District Judge Michael Moore a note Wednesday
simply saying that they wanted to go home. They were scheduled to
return at 8:30 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is composed of eight women and four men, predominantly
black and Hispanic but now includes two white members who replaced
others excused for work commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee faces 11 counts related to cocaine and heroin
trafficking, and he and Martin share five counts associated with
money-laundering. Martin has acknowledged that he agreed to write
checks for more than $200,000 in exchange for cash to secure cars
and attorneys for Brownlee from 1994 to 1997. But Martin's lawyers
argue he was merely helping out a family friend and did not
knowingly launder drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Martin, 33, had to know he was dealing in dirty
money, though audio and video surveillance tapes presented in
evidence contain no direct admissions to that effect from Martin.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Martin could receive three to five years. Brownlee
is facing up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have not ruled out playing Martin this season even
if he is convicted, assuming a judge allowed him to remain free
awaiting sentencing and appeals, and the league agrees.

 &HT;    EDS: Corrects name of Denny Neagle in first graf.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Enigma in the outfield has talent to determine own future
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Denny Neagle was in trouble early but working his way
out of it, when along came Jones. In this case, Andruw.
</P>
<P>
   It's never easy pitching against a team you've played for, guys
you've traveled with, eaten with, beered with and caught
``red-eyes'' with. And matched against an old locker neighbor, Tom
Glavine. The season hasn't been kind to Denny Neagle, down with a
strained muscle _ left quadriceps, if you must know _ twice on the
disabled list. Here it is late August, and this was only his 12th
start.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams opened with a two-base hit and moved to third on
Bret Boone's base-hit bunt. Men on third and first, nobody out.
Then he got the first Jones on a pop fly high enough to hit the
Goodyear blimp. Brian Jordan topped a pitch that might have
traveled 10 feet. Neagle's throw got him by an eyelash, with
Williams remaining at third.
</P>
<P>
   Now came Andruw. Two strikes, two balls when Neagle nipped the
outside corner for what looked like a third strike to many, not
including Jeff Nelson, whose opinion mattered most. He was working
behind the plate. Andruw next lifted a fly ball that soared and
soared and apparently was headed for Greg Vaughn's glove in left
field. It kept soaring and barely cleared that yellow border atop
the fence, while Vaughn stood there waiting for the ball that never
found his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Three runs scored, and they could have called the rest of the
game. Cincinnati would score only two, and the losing pitcher would
be Neagle. By the sixth inning, while the Braves scored two more
that would count against his earned-run average, he was gone, and
he was not a happy man. He plopped the ball in Don Gullett's hand
when the pitching coach came to excuse him for the rest of the day,
and he stalked off, talking fiercely to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones is a baseball enigma. Sometimes he can make you
hate him, then other times love him. He makes center field look
like the easiest job in baseball, drifting about casually, taking
in another fly ball in a way that makes it seem his body has
absorbed it. Then sometimes he drifts too casually and one gets
away, or it seems he lets a base hit play him instead of the
opposite, and boos fall on his tender ears. It hardly bears
repeating that Bobby Cox lifted him in the middle of an inning last
season for just that sort of sin.
</P>
<P>
   His future is written in stone. He can dictate it by just how
much he puts into it. There's something of DiMaggio in the way he
plays center field, but the two are/were exact opposites in
personality. DiMaggio was somewhat withdrawn, kind of reclusive,
who appeared not to enjoy being an idol _ nothing ever casual in
his style, but a carefully calculated manner of pursuit. Jones is a
child in a man's body, still wears a boyish smile, quite
approachable and open almost to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   It's rather odd that his defensive style should define him more
clearly than his offense. Yet, while delivering the winning bomb
against the Reds, it was totally overlooked that he also had eight
putouts. He's on a course toward 500 this season, and that has been
done only eight times in history, the last time 20 years ago. The
late Richie Ashburn did it four times. Jones should match or pass
that record.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went into this series hearing footsteps. In true '90s
style, they turned it up a notch, reached back for a little extra
and swept the Reds in three, seventh in a row. Now they have a
cushion, if not a fat and comfortable one. Their pitching has taken
shape. Glavine has found his old form. John Smoltz has performed
the miracle of completely remodeling his pitching style in the
course of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was beautiful, except where were the fans? A lovely
summer's afternoon, warm but not hot, no threat of serious weather,
and there were more vacant than occupied seats. But you have a long
time to catch Andruw's act. Just be thankful they now have padded
outfield walls, for another phenom, Pete Reiser, left his career on
the concrete walls of Ebbets Field.

 &HT;    New coaches bring new focus at Oklahoma, Colorado and Baylor
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Aware that the Baylor Bears were one of the most
penalized football teams in the Big 12 Conference last year, new
coach Kevin Steele watched curiously this spring as an officiating
crew worked the Bears' first scrimmage of his tenure in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six penalties later, the scrimmage ended. Mercifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much hair,'' Steele said. ``But what little I had
almost disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting a struggling program can be a hairy experience for
a new coaching staff, more at some schools than others. Three
coaches are undertaking the task this year in the Big 12. Two _ Bob
Stoops at Oklahoma and Gary Barnett at Colorado _ are trying to
recapture past glory. Then there's Steele, trying for starters to
simply reacquaint the Bears with some degree of consistent success
after the disastrous two-year reign of Dave Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an attitudinal problem, although it's not a bad one,''
Steele said. ``But when you have a group of players experiencing
losses and failures, they start to doubt everything around them.
And when adversity strikes, they expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears have never escaped from the Big 12 cellar and have won
just three conference games and eight overall in the league's
three-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude adjustments required of Stoops and Barnett aren't
as severe.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, who orchestrated the turnaround of Northwestern's
sad-sack football image, inherits from Rick Neuheisel a Colorado
team that some think has the potential to challenge Nebraska and
Kansas State for the North Division crown.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops, like Steele a first-year head coach, oversees a Sooners
program light-years away from its nationally elite status of the
1970s and mid '80s. But OU is blessed with an abundance of talented
athletes, and many believe it lacks only a firm sense of direction,
something that was glaringly absent in three years under John
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M Coach R.C. Slocum thinks Oklahoma could be the Big
12's surprise team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the players they have, and I think they're not that
far away,'' Slocum said. ``With the excitement of a new coach, and
if they find a quarterback, I can see them being pretty good ...
really good, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the league's three new coaches and the programs they
inherited:
</P>
<P>
   Baylor: Someone to believe in
</P>
<P>
   Before being hired as Baylor's 23rd head football coach in
mid-December, Steele probably was best-known for what Bears
linebacker Rodney Smith delicately referred to as ``the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele made ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' highlights last season when,
as a third-year assistant for the NFL's Carolina Panthers, he was
jostled and grabbed by linebacker Kevin Greene in a sideline
flareup during a game. The intensity that led to that confrontation
was noticed by the Bears in the spring, although in much less
dramatic ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears seem to respect Steele's discipline, which included
dismissing standout running back prospect Ben Gay in May for
reasons Steele declined to divulge, other than to say they weren't
legal in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big thing about winning is not only trusting the person
beside you doing his job, but trusting that the coach is going to
put you in the right position to make the right play. He's shown us
he's going to do that,'' said Smith, who has moved from strong
safety. ``He gets on us to make his point, but I like the way he
does it. He doesn't put people down. He does it in a positive
manner and doesn't make a player feel like he's nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele's coaching resume includes stops at Tennessee (his alma
mater, class of 1981) under Johnny Majors and at Nebraska under Tom
Osborne. He recruited former Cornhuskers quarterback Tommie
Frazier, now an assistant with him at Baylor. Steele said his
philosophies have been formed by his experiences with all his
former coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a product of our environment, and I'm no different
than anyone else,'' he said. ``We've made it a point at Baylor that
everything we've done has been very positive. We're going to be
honest and not sell the players something on false pretenses. But
our guys are very hungry for success and have bought into what
we're trying to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears, who last year lost back-to-back two-point decisions
at Colorado and Texas Tech en route to their second straight 2-9
season, believe a positive attitude can cure many woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think the team's that bad,'' sophomore center
Joe Jackson said. ``We were close in a lot of games last year,
where a play or two could have turned it around, but we didn't have
a whole lot of confidence in the coach. We never gave up. We just
didn't have a whole lot of faith in the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added that the Bears ``have a good chance of being an
above-.500 ballclub,'' but Steele said the record isn't his sole
barometer, especially in his first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we measuring success? In actual wins and losses, or in
attitude?'' he asked. ``Coach (Joe) Gibbs told me that the first
year is more important in attitude than in numbers. The biggest
thing I can do for these guys is when they see how I react in
adverse situations. I've conditioned them that when something goes
wrong, it's not the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these are players who wanted someone to show them what
to do and to have a plan they could believe in,'' Steele added.
``In our first team meeting, I told them not to believe anything I
said, that words are simply things to be used as a pattern of what
to look for in terms of actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to watch us. If our actions mirrored what we told
them, then they have something they could, and should, believe
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma: finding a direction
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the Sooners' 1999 media guide doesn't show Stoops.
Instead, there's a picture of a clenched fist holding up a crimson
OU helmet, with Oklahoma's national championship seasons listed off
to the side _ 1950, 1955, 1956, 1974, 1975 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the first significant reference to OU's 21st head coach
doesn't appear in the 352-page book until his biography begins on
page 34.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be successful and bring this program back to
compete for a championship,'' said the boyish-looking Stoops, who
turns 39 on Sept. 9. ``But it won't be me bringing it back. It'll
be a lot of people, from the (OU) president on down and the
commitment of our fans. They're hungry, and rightfully so. This is
a program with a lot of tradition. You don't give it to them for
all those years, then take it away and expect them to be happy
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been much for Sooners fans to be happy about
lately. OU hasn't been to a bowl game in five years and hasn't won
one since the 1993 John Hancock Bowl. Gary Gibbs was dismissed
after a 6-6 season in 1994. The Sooners were 5-5-1 in one ill-fated
year under Howard Schnellenberger, and they went 3-8, 4-8 and 5-6
in three seasons under John Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's 31 losses in the past five seasons are two more than
Barry Switzer compiled in his 16-year reign ending in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops has no previous head-coaching experience. He spent the
previous three years as assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator for Steve Spurrier at Florida. For seven seasons before
that, he was instrumental in helping Bill Snyder turn around Kansas
State's woeful program.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the OU job in December, Stoops raided Snyder's
staff for three important assistants, including Stoops' younger
brother Mike, Mark Mangino and Brent Venables, all of whom had
coordinating duties at K-State. And perhaps because of his
association with pass-happy Spurrier, whose son Stoops hired as
wide receivers coach at OU, Stoops' offensive coordinator is Mike
Leach, who worked with quarterback Tim Couch while holding the same
post the past two years at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want coaches who want to be at Oklahoma,'' said Stoops, a
1983 Iowa graduate. ``I work with them. They don't work for me. I
don't have ownership over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops' unassuming attitude doesn't mask his perfectionism. The
Sooners were penalized even more than Baylor last year, ranking
second in the league in infractions (114) and penalty yards (990).
Stoops made it clear immediately that that was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one and our first meeting, he let us know we were
going to be disciplined and do what's right, on and off the
field,'' safety Rodney Rideau said. ``He let us know it was this
way or the highway, and if we didn't want to do it right, we could
jump off the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The general assumption in college football is that it was only a
matter of time before OU regained its footing. Under Stoops, the
time might be sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, they just had instability here and didn't have
direction that's been uniform and established,'' he said. ``The
message to our fans is we're all going in the same direction. If we
continue to do that we have a chance to be pretty powerful. I tell
our fans that they should expect us to win and have a successful
team. I don't think they've been used to hearing that lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado: Return to smash-mouth
</P>
<P>
   For the first couple of years of Neuheisel's four-year reign,
the Buffaloes made a nice human-interest story _ their
guitar-playing coach leading them on rafting and skiing trips into
the Rockies. Along the way, though, the Buffs lost their identity
from when Barnett was an assistant there from 1984 to 1991 under
Bill McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   And when they started losing games and Neuheisel bolted to
Washington, the 53-year-old Barnett was brought back from
Northwestern to restore the mindset _ and success _ that led to
CU's 1990 national championship. That, primarily, is the
smash-mouth philosophy that helped produce running back Rashaan
Salaam's Heisman Trophy season in 1994, as opposed to the
air-it-out finesse of Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991 we were a real physical football team, offensively and
defensively, and we took our identity from that,'' Barnett said of
his last season as a CU assistant. ``Now we're more of a finesse
team on both sides of the ball, but it's my belief that to have a
chance in this conference we've got to get back to the style of
play we had in the early '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Buffs spent the spring toughening up. It was an
eye-opening, and not unwelcome, experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a change for the better,'' said offensive guard
Ryan Johanningmeier, a 6-foot-7-inch, 310-pound senior All-America
candidate. ``In this conference, you can't expect to go out on
Saturday and just be physical if you haven't been physical all week
in practice. You have to be prepared for it, and we're going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Added safety Rashidi Barnes: ``As a defensive player,
smash-mouth football is what you live for. Coach Barnett is
bringing that to Colorado, and that's what a lot of people have
been waiting for. As players, we like what he's brought to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, almost hired at Texas as John Mackovic's successor
before the Longhorns fell in love with Mack Brown, has returned to
a potential bonanza. The Buffaloes welcome back nine offensive and
seven defensive starters that many believe should have done better
than their 8-4 record, considering they lost four of their last six
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett stressed that Colorado won't abandon the passing game in
its quest to be more physical. He said the Buffs have installed
more of a West Coast offense to take advantage of quarterback Mike
Moschetti's running ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a 50-50 team,'' Barnett said. ``We're not going
to run the ball any more, really. We just want to run it better.
We're not going to force it, but at the same time we're going to
believe in it, and we're going to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado ranked 11th in the Big 12 last year in rushing offense,
ahead of only Baylor. The Buffs averaged only 3.0 yards per carry
and 123.2 yards per game.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ By his own account, Steve May knew from the time he
was in his early teens that he wanted to be a politician,
specifically a conservative Republican politician. He carefully
built his life, he says, to shape an attractive resume, from his
decision to enter ROTC in college and then serve as an Army officer
to his efforts at building a track record as a small-business man,
helping run his family's herbal-tea and natural-foods company here.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. May served with distinction as a lieutenant on active
duty in the Army and then entered the Reserve, and last November he
was elected to the state Legislature, to represent the affluent,
conservative district where he had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed to be going just right until this winter, when
the usually affable and measured 27-year-old bitterly spoke his
mind in the Arizona House, this time not as a Republican
legislator, a Mormon or a soldier, but as a gay man.
</P>
<P>
   May denounced an ultimately failed bill that would have barred
the use of public funds to pay for health benefits of same-sex
partners, and also attacked the legislation's conservative sponsor,
Rep. Karen S. Johnson, a fellow Republican who had vigorously
attacked homosexuals as immoral.
</P>
<P>
   May's remarks were widely quoted here and followed by a cover
article in Phoenix New Times, an alternative magazine, that
discussed everything from his youthful realization that he was gay
to how he had met and dated his current live-in companion. The
upshot was that he not only angered many conservatives in his party
by suggesting that Ms. Johnson was bigoted but also brought on
himself one of the more unusual investigations under the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy toward
homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Under that policy, recruiters are barred from asking applicants
about their sexual orientation, and commanders are forbidden to
undertake investigations of suspected homosexuality unless there is
significant evidence of homosexual conduct. On the other hand,
homosexuals are forbidden to disclose their orientation in a public
setting; indeed, their doing so is considered evidence of at least
an intent to engage in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   Col. John R. Hawkins III, the spokesman for the Army Reserve,
acknowledges that an investigation of May is under way, to
determine whether his remarks are grounds for discharge. Hawkins
says the inquiry should come as no surprise, given the public
nature of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the individual has been, shall we say,
keeping this under wraps, as to his sexual orientation,'' the
colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, May, who was first ``outed'' as gay when he ran
unsuccessfully for the state Senate three years ago, faces the
possibility that the increased publicity about his homosexuality,
as well as his scuffling with party leaders, will hurt his chances
of winning re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   May said he had never hidden his sexual orientation; in fact, he
joined the board of the Log Cabin Republicans, a nationwide
organization of gay party members, after his state Senate run. But
he always chose to identify himself with other issues, like
education, rather than gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after long doing everything ``right,'' he says, he faced a
perhaps inevitable choice when he heard gay men denounced during
the health-benefits debate in February as disease-ridden dangers to
the family who were doomed to ghastly early deaths.
</P>
<P>
   During his outburst in the House, he acknowledged that it might
have been politically wiser to keep quiet. ``But when you attack my
family,'' said May, whose father was once a bishop in the
conservative Mormon Church, ``and you steal my freedom, I will not
sit quietly in my office. This Legislature takes my gay tax
dollars, and my gay tax dollars spend the same as your straight tax
dollars. If you're not going to treat me fairly, don't take my
money.''
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a string of newspaper articles, and later a
confrontation with the Army in which he was informed of the
investigation against him.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of May's public remarks on the matter makes
this a highly unusual case, said Stacey Sobel, a senior attorney at
the Service Members Legal Defense Network, a Washington-based
organization that advises troops faced with inquiries about their
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sobel said that in some instances, the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy had been pursued so aggressively by commanders that
comments made by a soldier in entirely private conversations had,
when disclosed, been used as a basis for discharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because what he's said has been published in newspapers,'' Ms.
Sobel said of May, whom she has been advising, ``it can be
considered credible information, and that passes their test for
what can be used against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that make the case unusual, she said, are that it
involves an elected official _ the only one she knows of who is a
target of such an investigation _ and that it is aimed at a
reservist rather than an active-duty soldier.
</P>
<P>
   May says the absurdity of the policy and his situation became
evident earlier this month when he was officially told he was under
investigation and confronted by a military legal officer right
after a three-day exercise in Flagstaff. That meeting, he said,
came shortly after he had been told that he might be given command
of the transportation company in which he serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about gay rights,'' May maintained. ``It's about
the security of the nation. The issue for me as a policy maker is I
want to make sure the nation is aware of the dangers this policy
creates for our military preparedness.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Even as the military faces continuing shortages in personnel,
the policy on homosexuals, which was supposed to protect them from
harassment, has resulted in growing numbers being discharged,
according to Pentagon figures: last year 1,145 members of the armed
services were discharged for homosexuality, up from 997 in 1997 and
617 in 1994, when the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Pentagon, faced with mounting criticism
from gay rights groups over those numbers, announced that it was
revising the guidelines for carrying out the policy. The guidelines
will require that many of the inquiries like the one undertaken
against May be conducted by senior officers. Among the other
provisions are that troops receive anti-harassment training
throughout their careers, beginning with boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups, and May himself, say the changes do not go
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we're going to indoctrinate our soldiers to believe that
homosexuals are inferior and a threat because of this policy, and
then we're going to indoctrinate them into believing gays shouldn't
be harassed,'' May said. ``It doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   May said other lawmakers had told him that some of his new
political enemies, from the right wing of his own party, had
spurred the Army investigation by alerting the service to his
public remarks. One Republican, Jeff Groscost, the speaker of the
House, denied that accusation and said May had only his own candor
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question was, How could you expect that not to have made it
to the Army?'' said Groscost, who fought several tough legislative
battles against May this spring and has become one of his critics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The case threatens the political career of one of the few openly
gay officials in the country elected to state or national
positions. There are three openly gay or lesbian members of the
U.S. Congress, and 34 gay, lesbian or bisexual officials elected at
the state level, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a
group that supports gay candidates. The fund added that one of the
three U.S. representatives is Republican and only one of the 34
state level officials is Republican, May.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the fundamental problem for some members of May's party
seems to be his sudden outspokenness more than his sexual
orientation. Although May said he has been open about his sexuality
with his family and friends since he was 18, he had not discussed
it in public until he was ``outed'' by a member of his own party
when he ran for the state senate in 1996. A letter was sent out to
some voters saying that he was gay. It is not clear why the Army
did not pick up on the issue then.
</P>
<P>
   May said the episode worried him, but he chose to address his
homosexuality only when others raised it. Last year, May said, he
followed the same policy, never denying his homosexuality, but not
raising the issue himself. That seemed to satisfy some party
leaders at least for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve May is a pretty good guy, to tell you the truth,'' said
Mike Minnaugh, the Republican Party state chairman and a resident
of May's district, in the wealthy eastern section of Phoenix. ``As
an individual, I do not endorse homosexual relationships _ it goes
against my beliefs _ but I do respect his rights. As long as he
doesn't go and talk a lot about his homosexuality, he can continue
to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnaugh added, though, that if a straight candidate with
equally conservative credentials were to run against May ``that
would be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost said that, ``if there's a politically attractive
challenger, Steve could have some trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm not sure that he ran before as an openly gay
legislator. There's a small chink in that armor.''
</P>
<P>
   May said he is concerned now that the party may not support his
re-election bid next year; he is already working to raise a
campaign war chest of $100,000, a huge sum for a state race here.
The experience, he said, has shaken his belief in the party
machine, not the party's traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been Republican,'' said May. ``I believe in the
core Republican principles. I also happen to be gay. But the party
has been hijacked by theocratic fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Cheuvront, a Democrat and the only other openly gay member
of the state legislature, said he was surprised at May's
outspokenness concerning his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young,'' said Cheuvront. ``And all of a sudden he heard
this stuff being said about gays. He dealt with it differently than
I do.''
</P>
<P>
   May says he had no choice. ``The voters want you to be honest,''
he said. ``I'd rather just say, `It's none of your business.' But
you can't get away with that anymore.''

ISRAELI SAYS PALESTINIAN THINKER HAS FALSIFIED HIS EARLY LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward W. Said, the literary critic and intellectual who has
long been one of the most eloquent proponents of the Palestinian
cause, has been accused by an Israeli scholar of misrepresenting
his early childhood in order to lend poignancy and power to his
political stance.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the September issue of Commentary, which Said
disputes, Justus Reid Weiner accuses him of cultivating a moving
personal story of an idyllic childhood spent in Palestine that was
abruptly shattered by exile to Cairo shortly before Israeli
independence in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Weiner says, Said's childhood home was Cairo. Although
Said was born and baptized in Jerusalem, Weiner says he found no
evidence that Said's parents owned the house there that he has
reminisced about living in and no record that he attended fulltime
the school he seemed to suggest he had.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview late Tuesday, Said denied ever having
misrepresented his past. He insisted he had always made it clear
that he had grown up not only in Jerusalem but also in Egypt and
Lebanon. He said his family had frequently traveled between Cairo
and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He said his father, Wadie Said, ran the Cairo branch of a family
business; his cousin, Boulos Said, ran the Jerusalem branch. He
said his father was a ``partner'' in the house in Jerusalem where
Boulos Said lived with his wife, who was Wadie Said's sister, and
where Wadie Said's family often stayed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the school, St. George's preparatory school _ where a
profile of Said in Current Biography Yearbook said his
extracurricular activities included riding, boxing, gymnastics and
piano _ he said Tuesday that he was enrolled there ``for a few
months in 1947.'' Otherwise, he was in school in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never said I am a refugee,'' said Said, a professor of
English and comparative literature at Columbia University and the
author of more than a dozen books. ``Never in my life. On the
contrary, I go out of my way to say I had a very privileged life,
we had a house in Cairo.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he added, ``The fact is that of the rest of
my family _ not my immediate family but all of my cousins and aunts
and uncles _ not a single member of my family remained in Palestine
after 1948. They were all, without exception, evicted. That's the
central point.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in an article published in 1998 in The London Review of
Books quoted by Weiner, Said wrote, ``I was born in Jerusalem and
had spent most of my formative years there and, after 1948, when my
entire family became refugees, in Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Said, who is 63, is widely admired as one of the most
influential literary critics alive. He is also despised by many
conservatives. He writes frequently about the Palestinian cause,
was a member of the Palestinian National Council until 1991 and is
a relentless critic of Israeli policy on the Palestinians and of
the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner is a lawyer and scholar in residence at the Jerusalem
Center for Public Affairs, which describes itself as an independent
think tank. He emigrated from the United States to Israel in 1981
and spent 12 years working in the human rights department of the
Israeli ministry of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Weiner said he spent three years investigating
Said's life, looking through everything from baptismal and tax
records and business directories to student registration books in
Jerusalem and Cairo. He even toured the Jerusalem house to see
whether two large families could fit.
</P>
<P>
   He did not interview Said. He said he left one message with
Said's assistant at Columbia two-and-a-half years ago, explaining
what he had found and asking Said to call. When Said did not call,
he said, he never tried again. Said says he never received any such
call.
</P>
<P>
   Said's memoir, ``Out of Place,'' in which he describes his
childhood in Cairo in great detail, is scheduled to be published by
Alfred A. Knopf next month. Weiner suggests Said, who learned in
1991 that he had leukemia, wrote the memoir to ``camouflage and
backfill,'' having caught wind of Weiner's research _ a suggestion
Said dismissed as ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   In the article in Commentary, a neoconservative magazine that
has an interest in Jewish affairs and that once published an
article on Said entitled ``Professor of Terror,'' Weiner cites
numerous instances in which Said seems to have left the impression
that he had spent his early years in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Weiner describes a 1998 documentary entitled ``In
Search of Palestine'' that Said helped make for the BBC, which
included recent footage of him and his son outside the house in
Jerusalem and footage of Said touring St. George's preparatory
school.
</P>
<P>
   But Weiner says the title deed of the house listed only the
family of Boulos Said. He says he found no listing for Wadie Said
in Jerusalem's telephone and commercial directories. Having gone in
and measured the house, he says it was too small to house two
large, prosperous families together.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his time in Jerusalem might have been overstated,
Said said, ``I had a very itinerant life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think it's that important, in any case. It doesn't
make that much difference to the case I'm representing. I never
have represented my case as the issue to be treated. I've
represented the case of my people, which is something quite
different.''

SMALL INVESTORS GET CHANCE TO TRADE AFTER HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a small corner of Wall Street, people have been
talking about this for years: Why not offer individual investors a
way to buy and sell stocks after the 4 p.m. closing bell at the New
York Stock Exchange?
</P>
<P>
   Institutional traders have long been able to trade overnight for
their biggest and wealthiest clients, often reacting to late news
like a company's earnings release.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, many small investors got their first shot at
the after-hours market through two online brokerage firms _
Discover Brokerage and Dreyfus Brokerage Services _ which opened
their electronic doors to eager investors between 6 and 8 p.m. ET.
With final numbers from the session still being tallied,
preliminary results suggested a lackluster but promising beginning,
though the companies involved said they did not expect an explosive
start.
</P>
<P>
   Just about 700,000 shares _ or 1,200 orders _ were traded
Wednesday night in the first 45 minutes, a pittance compared with
the nearly 1.8 billion shares that were traded during the day on
the major exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the first time small investors had the chance to buy
200 of the most active Big Board and NASDAQ stocks so late in the
day through a new electronic trading format. The firms say they
just wanted an orderly beginning to what they hope will become a
pioneering effort to bring round-the-clock trading to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to tell you the launch was successful,'' Michael
Sanderson, the chief executive at MarketXT Inc., the electronic
trading system that created the after-hurs forum, said during a
conference call at 7:20 p.m. ``The system is working as planned.''
</P>
<P>
   The new format, which meant re-opening the markets after a
two-hour close _ the delay is included to give investors time to
digest late-breaking news and events _ could also serve as a
preview of what is to come when the nation's largest stock
exchanges begin offering after-hours trading on a huge scale next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that investors face greater risks in after-hours
trading, largely because the systems are untested and not as
active.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Discover Brokerage, a unit of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co., and at Dreyfus Brokerage Services, a unit of
Mellon Bank, say they are working aggressively to educate and
protect smaller investors. Only the most active stocks are traded,
for example, and investors must use limit orders, which means a
trade at the investor's specified price.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Discover Brokerage, which ranks ninth among online
brokers in average daily trades, say they chose not to aggressively
publicize the first day of after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Other online brokers are entering the market. Last week, ETrade
Group teamed with Instinet, the electronic trading unit owned by
Reuters Group PLC, to provide after-hours trading beginning in
October. Just days later, the Chicago Stock Exchange said it would
enter the after-hours market in September.
</P>
<P>
   Datek Online Holdings Corp. _ which owns Island, an electronic
trading system _ was the first to offer after-hours trading to its
customers in NASDAQ stocks between 4 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. The
service, which began earlier this month, is now commission-free,
and tens of thousands of Datek customers have signed up, said
Robert Bethge, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Datek says that on an average day about 600 trades are executed
in its after-hours market.
</P>
<P>
   Customer demand for after-hours trading clearly exists. One clue
is that at Discover Brokerage, up to 40 percent of the firm's
online orders are placed at a time when the markets are closed.
Wall Street analysts say other online brokerage firms are recording
similar numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not large numbers of individual investors are
demanding the right to trade in the late hours, a growing number of
online brokers and Wall Street trading houses are scrambling to
forge new alliances and develop the electronic means to offer such
a system.
</P>
<P>
   They are racing ahead of Wall Street's biggest brokerage houses,
and even the major stock exchanges, vowing to give the people what
they want.
</P>
<P>
   The small guys on Wall Street say they are providing what the
small guys on Main Street want: equality with their larger
brethren, who can trade any time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Philosophically it's unfair and suspicious,'' said Jim Laird,
an electronic commerce analyst at Yankee Group in Boston.
``Financial firms have risked talking out of both sides of their
mouth, so there's been an inherent contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, part of the after-hours movement can be attributed to
heightened competition among online brokers trying to stand out and
offer new services at a time when investors are riding a
record-breaking bull market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., ETrade and Fidelity
Brokerage have been making aggressive moves to attract more
``active investors,'' a growing and highly profitable segment of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want the guys who trade 100 times a year,'' said
James Punishill, an analyst at Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, online brokerage firms are installing faster
software, arranging better access to the markets and coordinating
initial public offerings. Technology is also being developed for
wireless trading from mobile hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   The firms can now begin to assess the true demand for these
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question becomes how many people are going to show up,''
said Larry Connors, a co-founder of Tradehard.com, an online
service for professional traders and fledgling day traders. ``I
think it'll take some time before we know. We think there's a
market for this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Connell, the president and chief operating officer at
Discover Brokerage in San Francisco, said he was pleased with the
start. Though he said he could not give out exact numbers, about a
third of the orders entered into the system were executed in the
first hour of trading Wednesday night, and the volume was about 1
percent of what the firm does on a typical day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie's out of the bottle,'' he said. ``It's like having
one of the first Netscape browsers. You know it's going to be
big.''

CINEMA ALFRESCO: FOREIGN FILM AND FRENCH FOOD MIX AT NEW
OUTDOOR  THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news file)  
 By SAM WHITING  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nightly at 9 o'clock an old bathroom window
slides open and the flicker from a film projector pokes out,
shining ``La Dolce Vita'' across a courtyard and onto a white
concrete wall. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  This is Foreign Cinema, a new year-round outdoor movie theater
and French bistro in the Mission District. On an enclosed, heated
patio, up to 100 people a night can watch foreign classics _ a
different one will play every week or so _ and eat at five long
tables. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Anybody can come watch the movies without charge, says
co-owner Michael Hecht. ``There is no minimum at Foreign Cinema; we
are simply trying to create a festive courtyard environment,'' says
Hecht. ``The assumption is that in that environment people are
going to be more than willing to grab a beer or a bottle of wine.
It's a `Cinema Paradiso' piazza.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecht wants to revive the neighborhood's movie theater heritage
while still drawing the thrift-shop hipsters who will pay $19 for
lobster and monkfish bouillabaisse with coral aioli. The full-menu
restaurant opened Monday, and people can eat inside or outside with
the movies.
</P>

<P>
   The ``antiplex'' had its grand opening on a recent Sunday,
heralded by one of the most elaborate publicity stunts in theme
restaurant history.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene of the Fellini classic ``La Dolce Vita'' is of a
helicopter flying low over Rome, dangling a large statue of Jesus.
Foreign Cinema owner Jon Varnedoe tried to re-create this tableau,
commissioning a 16-foot steel and plaster statue of Jesus and
hiring a helicopter and a film crew to make a trailer about the
theater's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Guests had to sign releases, and after some libations on the
patio, they were herded inside behind glass doors to clear the way
for the helicopter to pick up then drop its Jesus on an X marked in
the patio. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The scene got Felliniesque. The helicopter appeared and
hovered for a moment, dropping a rope to lift the Jesus, which was
hidden in an alleyway behind the back wall. But Jesus was too heavy
to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfectly scripted performance piece,'' says
Varnedoe, ``but it became a modern parable that Jesus refused to
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally ``La Dolce Vita'' rolled and Foreign Cinema was open. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Varnedoe, 36, envisions it as a ``total cinematic
experience,'' but it won't be total until next year, when an
adjacent indoor theater opens. The 129-seat theater will charge
admission and show a different lineup of films, some locally made. &LR;
</P>
<P>

</P>

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may be the first new movie theater on Mission Street since
Varnedoe's mother was growing up along the strip, which is still
marked by the abandoned marquees for the Grand, El Capitan Tower,
Rialto and New Mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was historically a theater district,'' Varnedoe says.
``There were 10,000 theater seats between 24th and 19th streets.''
Some of the seats remain at the old New Mission, which is now a
furniture store. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  City College of San Francisco wants to tear down the New
Mission but preserve the historic marquee, designed by Timothy
Pflueger, which looms near Varnedoe's patio. When he saw it up
there like a monument to motion pictures, an idea for a
neighborhood tie-in percolated. ``We just looked at this and
thought, `Dammit, this looks like a screen,''' Varnedoe says.
``From then on we built the restaurant around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Varnedoe's partner Hecht spent his final year at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business studying the entertainment market in
San Francisco. Varnedoe did his studying in ``The History of
Narrative Film,'' taught by Dominic Angerame at the University of
California at Berkeley Extension. The films were all foreign, and
students would stick around afterward to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were so passionate about this class, it really looked
like it needed a liquor license,'' says Varnedoe, who went out and
got one and then started building his own outdoor classroom. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The projection room at Foreign Cinema is above the patio, and
the movie shines high up the wall so the sight lines are clean even
when people are standing. Over time, Varnedoe expects the regulars
will buy a beer or an appetizer to support the cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Diners in the restaurant near the windows can see but not hear
the film. There is some light bleed from the restaurant onto the
screen, and when the courtyard is packed, hearing the soundtrack
can be a struggle, like listening for the ocean in a seashell.
People can stand and mingle right below the screen. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``The story is supposed to come off the wall and into your
life,'' Varnedoe says. ``For a lot of people, the spectacle is
watching `La Dolce Vita' 18 feet high, then looking up and watching
a jetliner in the clear Mission sky.''

   FBI-WACO (Washington) _ The FBI backs away from six years of
unqualified denials to Congress and the public and concedes that it
used ``pyrotechnic'' tear-gas canisters on the final day of the
1993 standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas. The
bureau says the devices were ``pyrotechnic'' only in a limited
sense and bounced harmlessly off a concrete structure six hours
before the compound's main building erupted in flames. By David

   GAY-LAWMAKER (Phoenix) _ By his own account, Stephen May knew
from the time he was a young teen-ager that he wanted to be a
politician, more specifically, a conservative Republican
politician. And everything seemed to be going just right after he
was elected last November, at the tender age of 26, to the Arizona
state legislature. Then earlier this year, May angrily spoke his
mind, this time not as a Republican, a Mormon, or a soldier _ but
as an openly gay man. His denunciation of an anti-gay bill and its
right-wing sponsor triggered one of the more unusual investigations
under President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy toward
gays in the military, and it now appears likely that May will be
discharged from the Army Reserve. By James Sterngold. (The story

no novelty to it. Some of them have powerful role models in making

   ``SELECTED NON-FICTIONS'' &QL; 
By Jorge Luis Borges (Viking, $40) &QL; 
``The angels are two days and two nights older than we: The Lord
created them on the fourth day, and from their high balcony between
the recently invented sun and the first moon, they scanned the
infant earth, barely more than a few wheat fields and some orchards
beside the waters.'' With his essay ``A History of'' ``Angels,''
written in 1926, Borges rescues us from the tripe written on the
subject in recent years and leaves us to wonder whether Wim Wenders
read this before he made his haunting film about angels, ``Wings f
Desire.'' ``I always imagine them at nightfall,'' Borges writes,
``in the dusk of a slum or a vacant lot, in that long, quiet moment
when things are gradually left alone, with their backs to the
sunset, and when colors are like memories or premonitions of other
colors. We must not be too prodigal with our angels; they are the
last divinities we harbor, and they might fly away.'' This is the
third volume in Viking's centenary edition of Borges' work in
English, coming after ``Collected Fictions'' and ``Selected
Poems.'' Borges wrote thousands of pages of non-fiction _ essays,
book and film reviews, lectures, encyclopedia entries, historical
surveys and notes on politics and culture, and from them, editor
Eliot Weinberger chose 161 pieces. Most appear in English for the
first time. The rest were newly translated for this edition. Among
the films reviewed (albeit briefly _ as Weinberger notes, Borges
never wrote anything long) are ``King Kong'' and ``The Petrified
Forest.'' Among the books: William Faulkner's ``Absalom! Absalom!''
and Ellery Queen's ``The Door Between.'' It's a marvelous
collection, published to celebrate what would have been Borges'
100th birthday in late August. &QL;

HEARTWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By James Lee Burke &QL; 
(Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this novel is a bit busy _ to say that it's complex is to
give it too much credit _ but Burke is so much better than other
crime writers that he pulls it off anyway. From the first pages,
we're aware of his virtuosity, although that seems like an odd word
to apply to a man whose characters are world-weary moralists and
vicious schemers and whose setting in this new series (in wake of
his books about Louisiana cop Dave Robicheaux) is a Texas hill town
called Deaf Smith. The hero is Billy Bob Holland, the former police
officer/Texas Ranger-turned-defense attorney, last seen in
``Cimarron Rose.'' In the early pages, Billy Bob suffers the return
to town of a rich man named Earl Deitrich, who long ago wooed and
married Peggy Jean Murphy, the local beauty who was Billy Bob's
high-school lover. Billy Bob is still hung up on Peggy Jean, and
she is still hung up on a boy who died in Vietnam _ both obsessions
that are difficult to believe as the book progresses. Their
attraction is further complicated because the cowboy Billy Bob
takes on as a client is accused of stealing $300,000 in bonds from
Peggy Jean's husband. More plot description would merely make you
dizzy _ suffice it to say that Burke makes all of his characters,
even the odd ones, as real as a Texas moon, and his setting becomes
a character in itself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING ON THE WIND: &QL; 
ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE &QL; 
WITH MIGRATORY BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Weidensaul &QL; 
(North Point, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thre are some shorebirds that fly non-stop from the southern tip
of South America to the coast of New Jersey _ a trip that takes 10
days, an astonishing 240 hours of uninterrupted flight. And there
are Arctic terns that each autumn fly across the Atlantic to
Europe, then south along Africa to recross the Atlantic toward
South America, finally wintering off of Antarctica. In spring,
writes the author, ``they reverse course, moving up southern Africa
and lancing back to Canada _ a figure eight inscribed on half the
globe, a track that returns them, often as not, to precisely the
same sheltered nook where they nested the summer before.'' Is there
anything more miraculous, more ethereal, more mysterious than the
epic migrations of birds? Weidensaul explores the process with
eloquence, meticulous research and considerable reverence _ and it
does not hurt that his subject is rife with fantastic facts. Did
you know that there are hummingbirds that cross the Gulf of Mexico
twice each year and tiny warblers that fly non-stop from New
England to South America? Did you know that albatrosses leaving the
nest might pass the next four years without touching land?
Weidensaul spent more than six years researching his book,
traveling 70,000 miles by plane, car, boat, horse and foot _ and
yet, he says, he covered fewer miles than a sandpiper would in its
short lifetime, propelled only by muscle and the instinct to trace
those invisible pathways in the sky. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DAYS OF INFAMY &QL; 
By Michael Coffey  &QL; 
(Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A companion volume to the History Channel's documentary
``Military Blunders,'' this is a survey of mistakes that had
terrible consequences. If the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's chauffeur
had asked directions in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, he would not
have taken the wrong turn that led to the archduke's assassination.
If the captain of the Lusitania had steered in a zig-zag pattern as
advised, he might have avoided the torpedo that sank the ship and
drew America into World War I. If naval commanders had not
underestimated the threat of air power, the British would not have
suffered the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse, two of their
finest ships. If German fliers attempting to destroy oil tanks on
the English coast had not lost their way and bombed the outskirts
of London instead, orders (on both sides) to avoid populated areas
might have stood, saving civilian lives during World War II. You
like war stories? Coffey has war stories, and they prove just how
slender the thread of fate can be. &QL;

CINEMA ALFRESCO: FOREIGN FILM AND FRENCH FOOD MIX AT NEW
OUTDOOR  THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``e'' entertainment news

 By SAM WHITING  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nightly at 9 o'clock an old bathroom window
slides open and the flicker from a film projector pokes out,
shining ``La Dolce Vita'' across a courtyard and onto a white
concrete wall. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  This is Foreign Cinema, a new year-round outdoor movie theater
and French bistro in the Mission District. On an enclosed, heated
patio, up to 100 people a night can watch foreign classics _ a
different one will play every week or so _ and eat at five long
tables. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Anybody can come watch the movies without charge, says
co-owner Michael Hecht. ``There is no minimum at Foreign Cinema; we
are simply trying to create a festive courtyard environment,'' says
Hecht. ``The assumption is that in that environment people are
going to be more than willing to grab a beer or a bottle of wine.
It's a `Cinema Paradiso' piazza.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecht wants to revive the neighborhood's movie theater heritage
while still drawing the thrift-shop hipsters who will pay $19 for
lobster and monkfish bouillabaisse with coral aioli. The full-menu
restaurant opened Monday, and people can eat inside or outside with
the movies.
</P>
<P>
   People come in groups, take a table and pull a metal drive-in
speaker off one of the posts along the wall. There is a bar at the

HONG KONG MERCHANTS SEND SOS TO CHINA OVER BAN OF U.S. NAVY  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Malaysia and the Philippines)   By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Tony Wong dismisses many of the old chestnuts about
U.S. sailors on leave in exotic foreign ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't go to girlie bars anymore, they buy computer
equipment,'' said Wong, a tailor whose family has made clothing for
sailors from visiting U.S. Navy ships since 1898, first in Shanghai
and now in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime of fitting admirals for dinner jackets and
ensigns for sport coats, Wong is steeped in the lore of U.S.
sailors on R &AMP; R. Despite a stern gaze that suggests he could
command a destroyer as easily as outfitting its crew in worsted, he
said, ``I have a special affection for the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Wong took it hard in May when the Chinese
government banned Navy ships from visiting Hong Kong. The ban _
apparently in retaliation for NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade _ is a footnote in the larger struggle between a
superpower and a rising power.
</P>
<P>
   But for Wong and a circle of Hong Kong merchants, restaurant
owners and barkeepers who depend on visiting U.S. sailors for their
livelihood, it is a potentially mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the sailors don't come back, we'll have to think of new
ways to survive,'' Wong said as he surveyed his empty store.
``What's the buzzword in America? We'll re-engineer our business.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be difficult. Wong's shop is in the Fleet Arcade, a
pocket-size shopping mall next to the pier in Victoria Harbor that
exists primarily to serve ships. The Navy pays for the mall's
upkeep under an agreement with a nonprofit organization, the
Servicemen's Guides Association, to give sailors a place to eat,
get a haircut, call home or even buy Chinese porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   Wong thinks he can muddle through on the small number of local
landlubbers who use the mall. But a nearby shop that sells
porcelain closed its doors this week. ``There's no business, so we
had no choice,'' said the manager as he packed up mournfully.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consulate here says that about 60 ships a year normally
anchor in Hong Kong, pumping $50 million into the local economy.
The bulk of that is spent on provisions like food and fuel. But
with 45,000 crew members swarming into the streets, the sailors
also spend a lot on food and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Wong's assertions notwithstanding, they still run up bar tabs in
the enduringly seedy clubs of Wanchai. do ``We view these stopovers
as serving the interests of all parties,'' said Rob Laing, a
spokesman for the consulate. ``We're prepared to resume them as
soon as the Chinese government approves our requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement that governed Hong Kong's
return to China from Britain in 1997, Beijing controls Hong Kong's
national security. So legal experts say it is entirely within its
rights in curtailing the visits. It has allowed visits by naval
ships from other countries to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Laing said Beijing had not given a reason for denying the
requests from U.S. ships to dock, the first of which came in
mid-May, soon after the embassy bombing. All told, it has turned
down visits by 10 ships and 3 military planes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs Beijing is softening its stance. It recently
approved a request for a military plane to pick up a congressional
delegation. It is allowing a visit by a Navy supply ship next
month. The shopkeepers grouse that the vessel has a crew of only
90, most of whom are civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ronald R. Saucci, a Maryknoll Catholic priest who runs
the Servicemen's Guides Association, recently cornered a
high-ranking mainland Chinese official at a diplomatic reception to
ask him whether Beijing would lift the ban on the Navy visits. The
official's response? ``God will provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Saucci said he hoped China would relax its ban, if only to
preserve Hong Kong's role as one of the Navy's favorite rest and
recreation destinations. U.S. ships have been dropping anchor here
for decades, particularly since 1949, when the Communist victory in
China's civil war closed off Shanghai and other mainland ports.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants say they can trace the changing nature of the U.S.
Navy to the things that sailors do and buy while ashore. Wong shows
off a yellowed slip of paper that permitted his granduncle to board
the U.S.S. New York in Shanghai in 1902 to measure the crew for
tuxedos.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s and '60s, Hong Kong became known as something
of a den of sin, with its sloe-eyed bargirls and sharp-eyed pimps.
But the British colony immortalized in the 1960 film ``The World of
Suzy Wong'' has long since given way to a more wholesome and
commercial place, where sailors shop for computers, stereo
equipment and Oriental rugs.
</P>
<P>
   People here worry that unless China allows visits to resume
soon, Hong Kong could lose out to competitors like Singapore and
Manila, which recently reopened its port to visiting U.S. warships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope it doesn't become a thing where China carefully
assesses the world scene every time the U.S. requests a visit,
because that could cut the heart out of our organization,'' Saucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the shopkeepers and barmen can only watch as China and
the United States engage in a diplomatic pas de deux. Most are
hopeful that as tensions between the countries cool, China will
relent.
</P>
<P>
   ``China and the U.S. are like a couple: they fight with each
other and then they make up,'' said Roger Sibnoni, who runs a hole
in the wall that sells playing cards and a cologne scientifically
designed to attract women.
</P>
<P>
   At Club Hot Lips, a bar in Wanchai that was as quiet as a
convent on a recent evening, the manager said plaintively, ``Tell
the Chinese government to settle this so the Americans can come
back and start drinking again.''

BERKELEY ART MUSEUM PICKS NEW DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH BAKER  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Kevin E. Consey has been appointed director
of the
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive at the University
of California at Berkeley. He replaces Jacquelynn Baas, who
resigned in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always susceptible to offers too good to refuse, and this
is one of them,'' said Consey, who was director of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago from 1991 to 1998. He has since been
earning an MBA at Northwestern University and teaching arts
administration at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great staff and faculty and the challenge of thinking about
how to position and build the museum in the next century, plus the
opportunity to teach in art history or the business school _ it was
all very attractive to me,'' he said of the Berkeley position.
</P>
<P>
   What, where and how much to build or rebuild are live issues for
the Berkeley Art Museum because it has been in seismic jeopardy
since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's building committee, trustees and staff have been
studying options. These include a retrofit and expansion of the
existing structure, demolition and reconstruction on the present
site, and rebuilding on a different campus site. Cost estimates for
the three possibilities come to about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum board is in the process of digesting all this and
will decide this fall what recommendation to make,'' said Consey,
who starts his new job January 1. ``My guess is that a clear course
of action may not be articulated until January or February.''
</P>
<P>
   Concurrently, a study of prospective funding sources is under
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual physical shape of a new building will evolve from
museum and film archive programming concerns,'' Consey said. ``We
will remain committed to edgy contemporary art, strengthen and
expand the film archive, increase our interest in Asian art and
strengthen partnerships with different areas of the academic
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Consey is also thinking about how to maintain the museum and
film archive's public presence during their two- to three-year
reconstruction period. ``During that time we're going to be pretty
visible outside Berkeley,'' he said, hinting that off-site programs
are under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Consey has extensive experience in museum fund-raising and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, he oversaw
fund-raising, design and construction of the MCA's new $72.5
million building.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Consey directed the Newport Harbor Art
Museum, now called the Orange County Museum of Art, in Newport
Beach
</P>
<P>
   and the San Antonio Museum of Art.

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``My kid told me he was proud of me,'' a beaming
Theresa Sanders said, describing the best part of having her job.
</P>
<P>
   And what an unusual job it is _ making harps. But then again,
Ms. Sanders, 42, was an unlikely candidate for a job that requires
woodworking skills. A high-school dropout and mother of two
adolescents, she collected welfare for about a dozen years. Unable
to read and perpetually out of work, she confronted the 1996
welfare law, which imposes a strict limit on collecting welfare
checks, with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Sanders turned to a neighborhood group based on the West
Side of Chicago, the Greater West Town Development Project, as her
``last chance.'' Greater West Town put her through an intensive
14-week training course in woodworking, with on-site equipment like
that used by a number of cabinet, furniture, and guitar makers in
the neighborhood. The program also taught her basic English and
mathematics. A case manager helped her juggle training and family
duties.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the help, Ms. Sanders' training did not come easy.
After putting in a full day, she went home to take care of her
children, then took jobs as a nighttime babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   Now she works full time at a company, Lyon &AMP; Healy Harps, the
country's largest manufacturer of harps. A case manager from
Greater West Town continues to monitor Ms. Sanders' progress. Ms.
Sanders started as a sander, earning about $6.00 an hour plus
benefits, including health insurance. Two years later she has been
promoted to work as an assembler and earns about $10 an hour. The
steady work allows her for the first time ``to take care of my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And within that simple statement lies a message both optimistic
and sobering about the next stage of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The message is optimistic because Greater West Town provides a
workable model for putting some of the most entrenched welfare
recipients on an upward economic escalator. The message is sobering
because the Greater West Town's highly interventionist model cannot
be easily replicated.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Sanders is not the only former welfare recipient
working at Lyon and Healy from the Greater West Town training
program. The company has hired dozens, about a third of the more
than 100 workers at its West Side plant. Lyon &AMP; Healy builds about
1,200 harps a year _ perhaps 60 percent of the world's production _
with fewer than 10 master harp makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turn out the best harps in the world _ with former welfare
mothers,'' says Tom Berry, the plant manager. ``They've worked out
terrifically.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater West Town is key to that success. It takes poorly
educated welfare recipients and other jobless people from the
neighborhood and within a few months places almost all of them in
steady jobs with possibilities for promotion. The program's
distinguishing feature is its focus on the specific training needs
of nearby woodworking firms and distribution centers. It also
provides mentoring for trainees whose poor work habits and spotty
employment records make them unattractive to many employers.
</P>
<P>
   But Greater West Town's emphasis on intensive training runs
counter to the thrust of welfare-to-work programs run by most
states. The current mantra is ``work first,'' the policy of putting
people to work without detours through training and education. So
far, the state strategies appear to be paying off _ recipients are
fleeing welfare rolls for work in record numbers. Recent surveys
suggest, however, that the good news might be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Former recipients are not earning very much and their prospects
for promotion appear dim. To make work truly pay for former welfare
recipients _ to put substantially more food on their breakfast
tables than did welfare _ may take more training than states now
think they need to provide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lots of former welfare mothers have found jobs. The White House
reported this month that welfare rolls have been cut approximately
in half since 1993, from about 14 million to 7 million. Pamela J.
Loprest of the Urban Institute found that, based on the Institute's
national survey of families between 1995 and 1997, two-thirds of
the former recipients were working at the time they were
interviewed in 1997. Even given the booming economy and low
unemployment rates almost everywhere in the nation, these results
are remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence is accumulating that the recipients who left
welfare rolls have not fared all that well. Ms. Loprest's survey
found that their wages were still quite low - averaging about $6.60
an hour. No big surprise there. But about 75 percent of them also
lacked medical benefits and about a fourth worked night shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrisome, a third of the welfare recipients who left
the rolls from 1995 to 1997 had returned by the end of the period.
The poorest 20 percent of American families, government data
indicate, lost more in welfare benefits _ almost $1,400 per family
_ than they gained in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another chilling fact. According to Ms. Loprest's survey,
low-income parents who had not been recently collecting welfare
earned no more on average than did former welfare recipients who
only recently went to work. That fact suggests that, on average,
former recipients who stay at work may not see their wages rise
very much.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the Loprest survey and government data raise
powerful questions: Will former recipients who go to work be
trapped in low-paying jobs offering meager prospect of advancement?
And will recently employed recipients be thrown out of work the
next time the economy hits the skids?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to both questions might be yes _ unless there is
training. And not just ordinary training. Real progress requires
hard, focused training and close contacts between trainers and
employers of the type forged by Greater West Town.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the welfare-to-work programs across the country have
chosen the work-first direction. That ``may be a smart way to
reduce caseloads and welfare expenditures,'' says Clifford Johnson
of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But studies of state
programs that put welfare recipients to work without much training
show that earnings typically rise by very little. So if former
welfare mothers like Ms. Sanders are to find steady work with good
prospects for promotion, they may need the type of rigorous
training she received rather than the benign neglect offered by
most state-run programs.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary is that while Greater West Town appears to provide
an effective answer to the plight of unskilled job searchers, there
is no guarantee it can be replicated on a scale vast enough to
absorb millions of mothers that the 1996 welfare law will force off
the rolls by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The major federal program for training disadvantaged workers
until now, the Job Training Partnership Act, which started in the
early 1980s, ``overall had moderate impact on earnings for welfare
recipients,'' says Judith Gueron, president of the Manpower
Demonstration Research Corp., a nonprofit research group in New
York. But, she adds, a small number of training programs run by
local community groups produced strong earnings gains when they,
like Greater West Town, forged close links with employers.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater West Town Project started 10 years ago with funding
from government sources to help the unemployed and disadvantaged
residents on Chicago's West Side. It has set up two training
programs, one in woodworking and another in shipping and receiving,
which teaches trainees how use fork lifts, process bills and run
computer programs that are widely used in distribution centers. The
project trains about 100 enrollees each year. About 85 percent
graduate. Of those, about 90 percent are placed in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Swanice Staples, 27, grew up in the nearby Henry Horner Homes,
the impoverished, crime-ridden public housing complex made famous
by Alex Kotlowitz's 1991 book, ``There Are No Children Here.'' Like
Ms. Sanders, she did not complete high school, though she could
read and write. She has three young children. She too entered the
woodworking program at Greater West Town. The staff helped Ms.
Staples overcome fear of the table saws and other equipment. She
trained more than full-time. After the regular training session
ended at 3:30, she stayed for tutoring. She needed to learn basic
skills, such as how to use a ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Today Ms. Staples works at Lyon &AMP; Healy as a finisher, earning
enough, she says, ``to get things I want.'' She explained: ``I've
bought a car. I just bought a house near Henry Horner.'' She says
she makes enough to ``get my kids everything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Staples and her fellow graduates succeed, says William J.
Leavy, executive director of Greater West Town, ``because we train
them to do tasks that local firms need to have done. We also help
enrollees overcome educational, racial, cultural and other barriers
to employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The close connections with the neighborhood are clear. Tom Berry
at Lyon &AMP; Healy helped design Greater West Town's woodworking
program, and serves on its board. The idea is to offer local firms
the opportunity to hire local residents with skills that the
companies have a hard time finding elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Thomas, a case manager, teaches ``soft skills'' - how to
get along with customers, fellow workers and managers. She also
helps current and former trainees solve day-care, housing and
transportation problems that come between them and their employers.
Just appearing every morning on time is a challenge for some of the
program's graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The important question facing advocates of the 1996 welfare law,
which cuts enrollees off after a five-year maximum, is whether Ms.
Sanders, Ms. Staples and others could have found attractive work
without intensive training. Leavy says no, barely hiding his
contempt for welfare-to-work advocates who think that all that
welfare recipients need is a firm push and job search assistance.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of anecdotal evidence on his side. The Welfare
to Work Partnership, a nonprofit group of business formed in 1997
by executives committed to hiring welfare recipients, met this
month in Chicago. Led by Eli J. Segal, the founder of Americorps
during President Clinton's first term, the conference proudly
pointed to the fact that 12,000 members of the partnership have
hired more than 410,000 recipients since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But conference participants, including community groups, former
recipients, government officials and CEO's, also pointed to severe
problems that are certain to plague welfare-to-work programs in the
future: illiteracy, low skills, day-care, poor transportation, the
general absence of support from families and others.
</P>
<P>
   Those barriers are precisely what Leavy's program is designed to
overcome. He can rightly claim success on his small scale.
Expanding his training model to accommodate the millions of mothers
who will be kicked off the welfare rolls over the next few years
becomes the major challenge of social policy for the next
administration.

MORE THAN 25 LAWSUITS FILED IN KC AREA INVOLVING FEN-PHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ More than 25 lawsuits involving the
combination of diet pills known as fen-phen and a closely related
drug have been filed in the Kansas City area, and more are
expected.
</P>
<P>
   In these actions and thousands of other lawsuits around the
country, consumers say they have experienced significant health
problems from using the diet drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of prescriptions were written for the drugs from 1995
until September 1997, when they were pulled off the market
voluntarily at the request of the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area and around the country, most of the
lawsuits have involved allegations related to heart valve damage
and a condition known as primary pulmonary hypertension, a deadly
lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the most recent lawsuits were filed in federal court in
Kansas City this week.
</P>
<P>
   In one lawsuit, Maria Ubaldo of Independence said she suffered
heart valve damage from taking a combination of Pondimin and
phentermine.
</P>
<P>
   In another lawsuit, Edna Ewing said she suffered heart valve
damage from taking the drug known as Redux.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed against American Home Products Corp. and
its subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, and A.H. Robins Co.,
which was acquired by American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuits, Ewing and Ubaldo allege negligence and
fraudulent misrepresentation, among other charges. Both seek jury
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Petkus, a Wyeth-Ayerst spokesman in Pennsylvania, said that
he could not confirm that the lawsuits had been served and that he
could not comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Jeans, one of the Kansas City lawyers representing
Ubaldo and Ewing, said the two lawsuits were among 26 such actions
that he and two colleagues have filed since June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans said he and lawyers J. Scott Bertram and William Dirk
Vandever would probably have 40 such lawsuits on file by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   Also pending are related class-action lawsuits around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits here and elsewhere ``have the potential to last for
many years,'' Bertram said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram said most or all of the lawsuits might someday be
resolved in a global settlement, ``but nobody on the planet knows
if or when that will happen.''

BACK SPASMS LEAVE JONES SHORT OF HER DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones left the starting blocks the way
she has left them in every 200-meter race she has run in the last
three seasons: with an aura of invincibility. But when Jones came
out of the turn and started to sprint toward the finish line of
this world championship semifinal, she was soon out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   With approximately 50 meters remaining, Jones grimaced and
shouted, grabbed at her back with her left hand and then slowly
twisted to the surface of the Mondo track where she had won the 100
in such impressive fashion on Sunday. She then lay on her back with
back spasms, her chest heaving and her mouth wide open in pain as
her seven competitors finished.
</P>
<P>
   She was then placed on a stretcher by medical personnel and
wheeled off the track to a medical station at the Estadio Olimpico
with her husband, C.J. Hunter, by her side. After approximately two
hours of treatment, she walked gingerly to a waiting van shortly
before 10 p.m. and returned to her hotel for further examinations.
Jones did not make any comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's OK,'' her agent, Charlie Wells, said Wednesday night by
telephone while the examinations were taking place. ``She had what
a lot of athletes have had sometimes and what I had myself when I
was as an athlete: cramps and spasms.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had won 21 consecutive 200-meter finals, came to
Seville with the ambition to win an unprecedented four gold medals
at a world championships. But unless she makes a quick recovery
before Sunday's relays, she will leave Seville with just one, along
with the bronze she won in the long jump on Monday night. She had
complained of fatigue in the heats of the 200 on Tuesday, saying
she had gotten only five hours of sleep and that she was looking
forward to Wednesday when she had just one race to run. But even
before she grabbed her back, Jones did not look her best. She was
only in third place in her heat coming out of the turn.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any chance Jones might race again in this
championship, Wells said, ``We'll have to evaluate that after the
examinations and after we see how she recovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wagner, an Austrian agent and promoter who manages dozens
of athletes, said he had been told that Jones had suffered from
back problems at other times this season. But Jones has not
complained of back pain this year, and when Wells was asked if her
cramps in Wednesday night's race were linked to an earlier or
existing injury, he said, ``I have no information on that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that when Jones recovers, she will have to wait
until next season and the Summer Olympics if she is to realize her
goal of winning three individual events in a major, international
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, she's the wonder woman of track and field,'' said
Nova Peris-Kneebone, an Australian 200-meter runner. ``She's
brought so much respect to the sport. A lot of sprinters find it
difficult to do the 100 and 200, but to medal in long jump, as
well, is incredible. For her to end the championships like that is
really sad. I would love to have seen her win the 200.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' mishap was the latest in a series for the U.S. team here.
Although Americans have won five events, medal favorite John Godina
struggled badly in the shot put and discus; Jeff Hartwig failed to
qualify for Thursday's pole vault final after being told by an
official that he already had cleared the necessary height, and the
world's top two 110-meter hurdlers Allen Johnson and Mark Crear did
not reach the final in their event. Crear was disqualified for two
false starts in the quarterfinals; Johnson, the reigning Olympic
champion, withdrew with a calf injury.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Jackson of Great Britain capitalized on their absence by
out-lunging Anier Garcia of Cuba (silver) and Duane Ross (bronze)
at the finish line. Jackson's time of 13.04 seconds gave him his
second world title but did not threaten his world record of 12.91.
</P>
<P>
   Another world-record holder, Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic,
won the decathlon Wednesday with a total of 8,744 points. Dean
Macey of Great Britain was a surprise silver medalist with 8,556
points: a mere 9 points ahead of the bronze medalist Chris Huffins
of the United States. Charles Michael Friedek of Germany won the
triple jump with a season-best effort of 57-feet 8{ inches. His
countrywoman Astrid Kumbernuss won the women's shot put.
</P>
<P>
   The most unexpected gold medalist of the evening was Cuba's
Daimi Pernia, who has been hurdling for just three years but
recorded the sixth fastest time in the history of the women's 400
hurdles, 52.89 seconds. Pernia was in the lead when she arrived at
the final hurdle but struck it with her left foot and lost speed.
The favorite in the race, Nezha Bidouane of Morocco took advantage
and surged ahead but Pernia caught her at the line to win by
one-hundredth of a second. Deon Hemmings of Jamaica took the
bronze. &QL;

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Barely a week after a furor over the drug
question, Texas Gov. George W. Bush brought his juggernaut campaign
to South Carolina, where few in this Republican stronghold seemed
to care if he ever inhaled or snorted.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 people who attended a $20-a-head Rotary Club luncheon
were instead singing Bush's familiar ``compassionate conservative''
refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one sure way to elect a Republican president is to
nominate Bush,'' said Mike Hartrich, a local county campaign
co-chairman who said the drug question shouldn't stop what he hopes
will be a Shermanesque march through the South for the 53-year-old
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his wife, Laura, the leading contender for the
Republican presidential nomination is spending the week campaigning
and raising money in the Southeast. The Charleston visit was
scheduled to conclude with a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has so far raised at least $36 million this year,
wraps up his trip Friday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers billed Wednesday's luncheon as nonpartisan, one in a
series of gatherings intended to educate Rotary Club members.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Bush backers had plenty of criticism over last
week's drug issue, it wasn't aimed at him. The controversy broke
out when Bush said he could have passed background checks for
illegal drug use when his father was president, from 1989-93. A
campaign spokeswoman later said that Bush meant he hadn't used
illegal drugs since 1974. A flurry of news stories and Sunday
morning political talk show punditry followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he'd take a stronger hand with the press,'' said Finbar
O'Reilly, an insurance salesman. ``A lot of people would really
rally behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Charleston rotarians rallied behind Wednesday was more
of Bush's familiar call for a kinder, gentler, ``compassionate
conservatism.'' The leading contender for the Republican
presidential nomination repeated his support for tax cuts,
including an end to the so-called, ``marriage penalty'' and to the
inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   He promised that Americans would open their hearts to illegimate
children, urged men to be responsible fathers, and pledged that if
he were elected to the White House, he would, ``rebuild the
military power of the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   He touted the benefits of free trade in a state where for years
textile and manufacturing plants have been closing shop and moving
to Mexico, where wages are lower and environmental regulations more
lax than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the next president of the United States must work to
tear down barriers and tariffs everywhere entirely so that that the
entire world trades in freedom,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned against ``regulations that tend to strangle
enterprise,'' and said prosperity would come if the nation is
``strong enough to stand up to the trial bar'' and fight for
meaningful, real, long-lasting tort reform in America, a fight he
carried on successfully in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around politics all my life and no candidate has
ever walked into Charleston and taken the place by storm like
Governor Bush has today,'' said State Rep. H.B. Chip Limehouse, a
Republican from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even Sen. John McCain, has had such an effect, said
Limehouse and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican decided to skip the recent Iowa
Republican straw poll _ where he had little chance of overtaking
Bush's commanding lead _ and has instead turned his attention to
winning the important South Carolina primary.

FBI NOWS SAYS IT POSSIBLY USED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AGAINST BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal officials have flip-flopped on six years of denials and
now admit that the FBI ``may have'' used pyrotechnic tear gas
grenades during the 1993 Branch Davidian standoff that ended with
the compound burning to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But officials maintained in a prepared statement released
Wednesday that the ``very limited number'' of cannisters did not
cause the fire. They were launched into an area outside the main
compound, hours before the rickety wooden buildings burst into
flames, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI conducted a further search of our files and has come
across information that suggests pyrotechnic devices may have been
used in the early morning of April 19, 1993,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has ordered a full review of the
episode, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that law enforcement did not start the
fire,'' FBI spokesman John Collingwood told The Associated Press.
``But we regret (that) previous answers to Congress and to the
public ultimately may prove to be inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission came days after Danny Coulson, a former assistant
deputy FBI director, told ``The Dallas Morning News'' that the tear
gas grenades were used. Coulson said he still does not believe the
cannisters sparked the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The inferno ended a 51-day standoff with religious leader David
Koresh. When investigators sifted through the rubble, they found
Koresh and at least 80 of his followers dead inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, federal officials were accused of causing the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have always denied any responsibility for the fire,
and have adamantly denied using any incendiary tear gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they have pointed to evidence that cult members
spread some sort of fuel throughout the inside of the compound. In
1994 congressional hearings, experts testified that some of the
survivors had residue from charcoal lighter, gasoline or kerosene
on their clothing. Experts have previously said that three separate
fires started simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they still believe Koresh followers were
responsible for the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the tear gas devices wasn't discovered until now
because officials at the scene might not have thought it was
relevant to the investigation, said one federal official on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking that nobody ever thought to link the two,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the FBI will post a picture on its web site
(www.fbi.gov) that will illustrate where the cannisters were
launched and where they were aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's latest admission was welcome news for Houston
attorney Mike Caddell, who has filed a multimillion-dollar federal
wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of nearly 200 Branch Davidians and
their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' Caddell said. ``It completely undermines the
government's credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission also gives Caddell concrete evidence that the FBI
used devices that could have started the fire, evidence Caddell
said he lacked until now.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he is skeptical of the FBI's explanation. It's more
likely, he said, that the FBI knew they would be caught in a lie
now that U.S. District Judge Walter Smith has ordered that
attorneys be allowed to review the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Caddell said, ``it's sort of, `Oh, you mean those
pyrotechnics.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, proving that the cannisters sparked the fire will be no
easy task, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably won't ever be definite evidence of how the fire
started,'' he said.

ALCALA TOO IMPORTANT TO BE ACHILLES' HEEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He doesn't play a glamorous position and he's not
on the cover of the media guide. But Julio Alcala, a senior, is Cal
State Northridge's best offensive lineman, an anchor for one of the
team's most-improved areas.
</P>
<P>
   Alcala has a sore Achilles' tendon, which is not serious, but
the CSUN coaches aren't taking any chances. Interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said he wanted to talk with head trainer Rhonda Lowry about
Alcala's injury. The lineman was held out of practice Wednesday and
won't return until he is completely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hear any apprehension in her voice, I won't use him at
all,'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Alcala had a close call when a defender landed on his
leg in a team drill. Kearin was visibly upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose Julio, that's almost the equivalent of losing
Marcus (Brady),'' Kearin said that night. ``He's got to play.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Kid power: Only two receivers who caught passes last year _
Aaron Arnold, who had 65 receptions and Gil Rodriguez, who had one
_ participated in Wednesday morning's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ramos, who plans to transfer to Washington State, is
gone, and Ethan Beck, who only had one catch last year, is
sidelined with a sore groin.
</P>
<P>
   The position is wide open and two freshmen are taking advantage.
Joe Gilliam, from Fresno's Edison High, and Greg Orlando, from
Santa Margarita High, have been pleasant surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Both are backups, but in CSUN's run-and-shoot offense they will
get plenty of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them have done really well,'' said Armando Gonzalez,
CSUN's wide-receivers and tight-ends coach. ``Joe runs good routes
and he gets good releases. Greg has done a good job on the inside
slot, taking Anthony's place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam (6-foot-2, 180 pounds) bears a resemblance to Arnold,
who needs seven catches to break David Romines' school record for a
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Mel Miller, a Pac-10 cornerback, Joe is hanging with
him,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando (5-9, 170) played quarterback last year at Santa
Margarita, replacing Carson Palmer, who now starts for USC.
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Hackett, a freshman from San Dimas who is considered one of
CSUN's top recruits, might be redshirted. He's third on the depth
chart.
</P>
<P>
   __ Multitalented: CSUN only has one tight end listed on the
depth chart _ redshirt freshman Nate Davenport. The Matadors are
planning on using several players from other positions as
Davenport's emergency backup, including linebacker-defensive end
Brennen Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swannie went in there the other day and he looked like he had
played there all his life,'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson looked so good at tight end that CSUN is reserving an
unassigned jersey in the 90s for him to pull over his No. 52 if he
is needed in a game.

AD   COLUMN: CAMPBELL'S CHANGES ITS SOUP LABEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)   By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Campbell Soup Co. has found a way to virtually guarantee a run
on its slow-selling classic soups _ at least temporarily. The
company is retiring the classic red-and-white Campbell's Soup can
label that the pop artist Andy Warhol raised to icon status with
his famous silkscreen renderings.
</P>
<P>
   Although subtle, the label tweaking is sure to create a frenzy
at stores, as consumers rush to hoard the classic soup cans.
</P>
<P>
   The new label, which is also red and white but includes modern
graphic elements, marks the most significant change in the history
to the classic soup can, which has lined grocery shelves for more
than a century. But modernizing a beloved icon, even slightly,
comes with some risk, and the change is unlikely to create
significant long-term sales growth, analysts and brand image
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's, whose business has been in slow motion as it has
struggled to get people to eat more of its chicken noodle, tomato
and nearly 70 other soup varieties, said the changes would enhance
the brand and were designed with time-pressed shoppers in mind.
Consumers strolling supermarket soup aisles may not immediately
notice the changes, but the new cans, which will be unveiled
Thursday, contain several added elements to increase shopping
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   To help people choose a soup more easily, for instance, five
colored banners have been added to the new labels, marking the
soups as ``classic, fun favorites, special selections, great for
cooking and 98 percent fat free.'' In addition, each new label
contains a photo of the soup in a bowl. Also, the size of the
label's signature gold medallion has been reduced and moved from
the middle of the can to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's busy consumers will now be able to find the soups they
want more quickly and easily,'' said Lisa Zakrajsek, vice president
for Campbell's domestic soup division.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said such superficial changes represented only minor
tinkering to a brand in need of a second wind.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the company acknowledged trouble in its core business
when it said it would not meet analysts' expectations for the
current quarter because of slowing soup sales in grocery stores. At
the time, the company said it would reorganize the business, take
charges against earnings of up to $45 million in the current year
and replace the president of its all-important domestic business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will definitely take more than changing a label to change
eating habits,'' said Naomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
But, she added, ``the company is clearly signaling the fact that
unit volume is way short of expectations, and they are trying to
shore it up in as many ways as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The company acknowledged that the new label alone would not be a
chicken-soup, cure for its ills, but as part of a total freshening
of its marketing program ``the package redesign without a doubt for
the Campbell company is a very big deal,'' Ms. Zakrajsek said. ``It
has been in the making for well over 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a century ago, the company, which is based in Camden,
N.J., set to work designing a label befitting what were then its
increasingly popular soup lines. Initial designs failed to capture
the excitement of the new soup brand. The first label in 1895, a
black-and-white version used for Campbell's ready-to-serve
beefsteak tomato soup, seemed subdued. The next version, an
orange-and-black design developed when the condensed line was
introduced in 1897, was deemed too somber. The current label was
created later that year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the by-then-familiar label took a prominent role
in the art world when Andy Warhol painted it. In explaining his
inspiration, Warhol said, ``I just paint things I always thought
were beautiful _ things you use everyday and never think about.''
</P>
<P>
   To mark the label's evolution, the company will donate the last
remaining can of Campbell's Condensed Tomato Soup with the classic
label to the Andy Warhol archives in Pittsburgh, where many of the
artist's celebrated Campbell's Soup images hang.
</P>
<P>
   Fine for posterity, but will consumers turn up their noses at
the new cans?
</P>
<P>
   Though purists may sniff at the new packaging, Campbell has
minimized the risk of consumer backlash by retaining key elements
of the old label, consumer brand image experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visual qualities of that package, and most important the
promotion of the red and white and Campbell's unique script
typography, those components are well etched into consumers' minds
by strenuous advertising efforts and all the components of the
marketing mix,'' said John DiGianni, president and creative
director of Gianninoto Associates in New York City, a consulting
firm that specializes in brand identity.
</P>
<P>
   For just that reason, the company gave the soup cans the
cosmetic equivalent of highlights instead of a full dye job.

<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us down. Same
for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian currency
collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game. Nonetheless, the
collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S. consumers and to many U.S.
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to devalued Asian currencies, we've been getting TVs,
microwave ovens, and computer chips at bargain prices, so our
consumer price index has stayed amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and widen profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing propels furniture, refrigerator,
and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

consumer price index has stayed amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and widen profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing propels furniture, refrigerator,
and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us down. Same
for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian currency
collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game. Nonetheless, the
collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S. consumers and to many U.S.
corporations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Between Jan. 15 and April 15, Mexico's IPC index, or Bolsa,
jumped about 65 percent, the best performance by a major stock
index this year.
</P>
<P>
   Had you been brave enough to buy Mexican stocks in mid-September
last year, while Brazil, Russia, and Long-Term Capital Management
were turning wealth into waste, you would have nearly doubled your
money.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us were so brave, however: The pundits were warning us
that Brazil _ as the next domino after Thailand, Malaysia, and
Indonesia _ would soon topple the rest of Latin America, including
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But economists underestimated the confidence and resilience of
U.S. consumers, who bought more than 85 percent of Mexico's
exports. As long as American families kept shopping, Mexican
factories ought to keep humming to meet our demand for cars,
clothes, and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mexico exports hardly anything to Brazil, a
key point overlooked during the frenzied sell-off last year in
Mexico's market.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Mexicans speak Spanish does not mean their economy
is linked more closely to Latin America than to North America.
Indeed, our 6 percent gain in gross domestic product in the fourth
quarter of 1998, despite tumbles in the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq, was an excellent signal that Mexico would not collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As American consumers swiped their credit cards, Mexican
businessmen wiped their brows with relief. The several thousand
factories just south of the U.S. border _ in an area known as
Maquiladora _ have continued to thrive in 1999, with overall
exports increasing at a 7.7 percent pace in February.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of watching their economy shrink in 1999, as
Brazilians, Argentines, and Venezuelans will, Mexicans will see
their GDP rise by 2 to 3 percent. (In further tribute to the
country's resilience, the jobless rate fell to just 2.7 percent in
March.)
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind the Bolsa's bounce is the rise in the
price of oil. Crude jumped from about $11 per barrel in December to
$18 by mid-April, thanks to an OPEC deal to cut production,
stronger economic prospects in Asia, and the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico exports oil, higher prices improve Mexico's
expected trade balance and its budget revenue projections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the Bolsa hitting 5430 in the second half of April,
investors in Mexico might want to book some profits now, because
there are a couple of dangers looming.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mexicans will head to the voting booths to elect a new
president in July 2000. Months before the 1994 election, wealthy
Mexicans began sneaking their funds out of the country to the
safety of U.S. banks in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They may get antsy again, recalling that the last presidential
election was marred by the assassination of the leading candidate,
rising inflation, and ultimately a collapse of the peso, which
triggered a deep recession in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the reigning PRI party, which has dominated Mexican
politics for 70 years, has been bloodied in recent years and even
been forced to share power with its rivals on the right (PAN) and
the left (PRD).
</P>
<P>
   President Zedillo's interior minister, Francisco Labastida, is a
candidate, but other cabinet ministers may challenge him for the
PRI's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A second possible trouble spot is the peso. It looked awfully
strong earlier this year, actually rising by more than 5 percent
against the U.S. dollar through mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexican exporters start bellyaching about how a stronger peso
hurts their ability to compete with other countries, investors
should head for the exits with their profits in tow. &QL;

<P>
   It was going to have roughly the effect of a neutron bomb attack
on Main Streets and shopping malls. The buildings would be left
standing but the people would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the superior efficiency of selling things via the
Internet that brick-and-mortar stores would be unable to compete on
price, choice or even service.
</P>
<P>
   Book and music sellers had already been ``Amazoned.'' Soon
Web-based ``category-killers,'' in everything from toys to pet
supplies, would overwhelm their physical-world competitors.
Shoppers would never be more than a mouse-click from the best
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers, terrified of cannibalizing sales and
destroying the value of their expensive properties, were already
too late to meet the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some categories,'' said Mary Meeker, a seer of the Internet
at Morgan Stanley, ``it's already game over.''
</P>
<P>
   These are convenient beliefs for anyone justifying some
e-commerce share prices, but they are already mostly wrong. The
reasons should surprise no one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not a dominant technology but rather a network
of people. It is a rich and highly flexible means of communicating
that is rapidly achieving pervasiveness because more and more
people find it easy and convenient to use. But it is those people's
preferences that will count; and for most people, shopping is more
than just a means to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Internet provided a perfectly efficient way to shop
it would not provide a satisfactory alternative to the physical
enjoyment of sniffing a ripe melon, say, or trying on a cashmere
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some products, such as music and banking, can be
distributed electronically with success and cost savings. But most
purchases cannot be reduced to digital code. And distributing
physical goods is cumbersome and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Behind even the most exciting user-interface there are
old-fashioned warehouses and trucks; customers who decline to sit
at home waiting for purchases to arrive; and goods that must be
rewrapped and expensively returned.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the cost of getting goods to customers' homes so
often soaks up the notional price advantages of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   What Internet shoppers have quickly realized is that the Web is
an addition to, and not a substitute for, their shopping habits. It
is wonderful for gathering up-to-date information about products
and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue, a research firm, estimates that in 1998 23
million Americans sought information online, but then made their
purchases offline, compared with only 17.7 million who did the
whole thing online.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more bullish forecasters doubt whether online retailing
in America _ the country at the furthest e-frontier _ will amount
to much over 6 percent of the total by 2003. What happens after
that will depend mainly, not on the new specialists of the online
world but on the traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most big retailers had seemed reluctant to
experiment much with e-commerce. Apart from the risk of
cannibalization, they were put off by the sheer complexity of
integrating their in-house information technology with the demands
of selling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But now firms such as Macy's, Wal-Mart and CVS drugstores are
linking their offline operations into a new and forceful presence
on the web. By blending the best of both offline and online worlds,
they can reflect the desire of consumers to shop pragmatically.
</P>
<P>

   It was going to have roughly the effect of a neutron bomb attack
on Main Streets and shopping malls. The buildings would be left
standing but the people would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the superior efficiency of selling things via the
Internet that brick-and-mortar stores would be unable to compete on
price, choice or even service.
</P>
<P>
   Book and music sellers had already been ``Amazoned.'' Soon
Web-based ``category-killers,'' in everything from toys to pet
supplies, would overwhelm their physical-world competitors.
Shoppers would never be more than a mouse-click from the best
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers, terrified of cannibalizing sales and
destroying the value of their expensive properties, were already
too late to meet the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some categories,'' said Mary Meeker, a seer of the Internet
at Morgan Stanley, ``it's already game over.''
</P>
<P>
   These are convenient beliefs for anyone justifying some
e-commerce share prices, but they are already mostly wrong. The
reasons should surprise no one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not a dominant technology but rather a network
of people. It is a rich and highly flexible means of communicating
that is rapidly achieving pervasiveness because more and more
people find it easy and convenient to use. But it is those people's
preferences that will count; and for most people, shopping is more
than just a means to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Internet provided a perfectly efficient way to shop
it would not provide a satisfactory alternative to the physical
enjoyment of sniffing a ripe melon, say, or trying on a cashmere
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some products, such as music and banking, can be
distributed electronically with success and cost savings. But most
purchases cannot be reduced to digital code. And distributing
physical goods is cumbersome and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Behind even the most exciting user-interface there are
old-fashioned warehouses and trucks; customers who decline to sit
at home waiting for purchases to arrive; and goods that must be
rewrapped and expensively returned.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the cost of getting goods to customers' homes so
often soaks up the notional price advantages of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   What Internet shoppers have quickly realized is that the Web is
an addition to, and not a substitute for, their shopping habits. It
is wonderful for gathering up-to-date information about products
and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue, a research firm, estimates that in 1998 23
million Americans sought information online, but then made their
purchases offline, compared with only 17.7 million who did the
whole thing online.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more bullish forecasters doubt whether online retailing
in America _ the country at the furthest e-frontier _ will amount
to much over 6 percent of the total by 2003. What happens after
that will depend mainly, not on the new specialists of the online
world but on the traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most big retailers had seemed reluctant to
experiment much with e-commerce. Apart from the risk of
cannibalization, they were put off by the sheer complexity of
integrating their in-house information technology with the demands
of selling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But now firms such as Macy's, Wal-Mart and CVS drugstores are
linking their offline operations into a new and forceful presence
on the web. By blending the best of both offline and online worlds,
they can reflect the desire of consumers to shop pragmatically.
</P>
<P>
   They can use their physical stores both to advertise their
websites and to support old-fashioned shopping: why not order
online at work and then pick up your purchases on the way home? Or,
if an online purchase is not what you wanted, just swap it at the

<P>
   As a good story, it is hard to beat. Give the Almighty five
days, and He completes the heavens and the earth and assorted
beasts and creeping things. One more day, a scoop of dust and a
puff of divine breath and hey presto! there is Adam.
</P>
<P>
   The poetic language of the first few chapters of the Book of
Genesis has kept painters busy for centuries. As an account of the
beginnings of life, it is certainly easier reading than Charles
Darwin's ``Origin of Species,'' the book that laid the foundations
of evolutionary biology in 1859.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is no wonder that, in the United States, some
people are so moved by the Genesis account that they refuse to
believe any other explanation of the origin of life.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they say, no eyewitness observed humanity emerge from
primeval slime or evolve from apes, while at least God was there to
record His own acts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, creationists have managed to undermine the teaching of
evolution in schools in Alabama, New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana
and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest triumph has been to persuade the State Board of
Education in Kansas to make teaching evolution an optional extra to
the standard science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In future, Kansas schoolchildren will neither have to learn, nor
be tested on, the origin of species through natural selection, or
the idea that the universe began with a cosmological big bang.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your religious beliefs, there are several oddities
here. One is that, whereas in 1859 Darwin's book stirred up outrage
among churches and churchgoers, nowadays his views are no longer
seen as inextricably alien to the Bible and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   They can be a basis for atheism, for sure, and often are; but
they can also be seen, by the many believers who take the Bible's
words as impressionistic rather than the literal truth, as merely a
depiction of the way divine creation has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Another, though, is a more American oddity. There is no more
Darwinian society than the United States, no society that operates
so clearly according to selection by experimentation and the
constant elimination of mistakes. And yet many Americans still
believe that Darwin was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In America companies rise and fall with the certainty of
species. Predators weed out the weak; new mutations launch
successful IPOs; organisms grow more nimble as they evolve to fit
their particular niche.
</P>
<P>
   For the individual, little in the way of a social safety net
stands between success and social extinction. Indeed, America's
economic success over the entirety of the 140 years since 1859 is
surely explained by the fact that, while the United States embraces
a Darwinian approach to economic life, competitors in Europe are
keener on Darwin as a work of scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   That is the real, natural America, for which children need to be
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Darwinism is even the basis for the agriculture on which Kansas
depends: the biological revolution that began with Darwin's work
has provided the basis for much of modern farming (America is the
world's biggest agricultural producer); and now for new industries
based on biotechnology and genetics (in which America also leads).
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another Kansas tradition, that of ``The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' As they were wandering down the yellow
brick road, Dorothy asked the scarecrow to tell her a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been so short,'' he replied, ``that I really know
nothing whatever. I was only made the day before yesterday. What
happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought that he had no brain and no knowledge. But then he,
Dorothy and their pals triumphed over the wicked witch.
</P>
<P>
   Survival of the fittest, again. Or pure luck. Darwin's theories
could accommodate both. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there is one person who stands above America's
fledgling presidential campaign, it is Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Most presidential hopefuls heap respectful praise on the head of
America's central bank and, from Al Gore to Elizabeth Dole, have
recommended that he should be reappointed when his term as Federal
Reserve chairman formally ends next May.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Washington, Greenspan is credited with an
unsurpassed understanding of America's economy, as he has steered
monetary policy to achieve rapid growth, low employment and low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, his acumen will be more necessary than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, there are reasons aplenty to fear inflationary
pressure. A batch of recent economic statistics hinted that tight
labor markets are at last pushing up wage costs.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets tumbled in early August after the employment
cost index, a quarterly measure of overall labor costs, leapt 1.1
percent between April and June, compared with 0.4 percent in the
first quarter. In the year to July, hourly earnings rose by 3.8
percent, up from a low of 3.5 percent in the year to May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were convinced that these numbers provided enough
evidence of an overheating economy to guarantee another
quarter-point rise in interest rates, or maybe more, when the
Federal Reserve next meets on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, inflation itself has not yet picked up.
Statistics released in the past week show that the major inflation
gauges _ the producer and consumer price indices _ are still
extremely well behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Producer prices for finished goods rose a mere 0.2 percent in
July (compared with 1.5 percent a year ago), and consumer prices
only 0.3 percent (2.1 percent a year ago).
</P>
<P>
   This news calmed the financial markets. Although the consensus
on Wall Street is still that the Fed is likely to raise rates next
week, some economists suggest that this is no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is a mistake to take either the labor-market figures
or the inflation statistics too literally. Wage pressures are
building up slightly, but this is after months of very modest wage
gains.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the April-June rise in the employment cost
index was a payback for an extraordinarily small rise in the first
three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that the labor market is tighter than ever,
and on an unsustainable track.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 new jobs were created in July, much more than
most analysts had expected and three times more than the growth of
the labor force could normally sustain. The number of unemployment
claims is at its lowest in this economic cycle, and virtually every
Federal Reserve district has noted widespread labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the benign inflation numbers should not be taken
at face value. First, the central bank has to worry about future
inflation threats when it decides whether or not to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Since it takes several months for the full effects of changing
interest rates to be felt in the economy, it can be dangerous to
wait until there is actual evidence of accelerating prices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even today's figures show a worrying price pressure
behind the benign headlines. Oil prices have risen sharply, and
commodity prices in general are firmer.
</P>
<P>
   As the economies of Europe and Asia show signs of more vigor,
the dollar has been sliding, especially against the yen. On Aug. 18
it passed Yen112, its lowest since January.
</P>
<P>
   Higher commodity prices and a weaker dollar have removed an
important source of imported disinflation for America, and firms'
input costs are now rising.
</P>
<P>
   The producer-price index for core intermediate goods _ those
goods such as paperboard and plywood that firms use as part of the
production process _ has risen at a 4 percent annual rate over the
past three months, the biggest rise in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no certainty that firms will pass on higher
input prices as higher goods prices (if firms raise their
productivity they can absorb the extra cost). But, as Bruce Kasman
of J.P. Morgan points out, every stage of Federal Reserve
tightening over the past two decades has been accompanied by an
acceleration of core intermediate producer prices.
</P>
<P>
   How much the Federal Reserve must raise interest rates depends
on how far the economy can be trusted to slow by itself. At first
sight, it seems to be doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Recent retail-sales figures suggest that consumer spending may
be slowing. According to economists at Goldman Sachs, consumer
spending, after adjusting for inflation, is likely to rise by 3.6
percent at an annual rate between July and September, certainly
much less than the 6.7 percent real rise in the first three months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But history suggests caution. America's economy in recent years
has continually surprised analysts with its strength. And the next
few months could be no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending is still strong by historical standards. The
housing market, an important engine of demand (because people have
realized capital gains as they sold their houses, received cash as
they refinanced their mortgages and boosted construction demand by
building new houses), is still extraordinarily vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sharply higher mortgage rates, housing starts rose by
5.7 percent in June, though the rate of mortgage refinancing has
slowed sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The replenishing of firms' inventories could provide another
short-term boost to growth. Currently, inventories are low. Between
April and June firms added only $19.4 billion to their inventories
compared with $38.7 billion in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect a sharp rebound during the next few months,
and as companies prepare for the uncertainties of the millennium
bug they may well add to their stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this a strengthened demand for exports as economies in
Europe and Asia accelerate, and it is hard to see much chance of
the economy slowing down. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000. TOTAL UNCUT IS 1,175 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Two important _ and related _ uncertainties could cloud this
picture. One is the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street shrugs off higher interest rates entirely, as it
did in June, an orderly slowdown will be harder to achieve.
Conversely, a big correction in the stock market could precipitate
an uncomfortably sharp slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The other unknown is how foreigners will behave. America's trade
deficit rose to a record $24.6 billion in June, and the country is
heading for a current-account deficit of 4 percent of GDP this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As the economies of Europe and Asia perk up, foreign investors
who are financing this sizeable deficit may demand substantially
higher interest rates to do so. The recent slide in the dollar and
the strengthening in bond yields could be but the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   If foreign sentiment turns sharply, America's much-needed
economic slowdown could occur more suddenly than anyone expected.
And Alan Greenspan would then no longer seem a demigod. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   How much the Federal Reserve must raise interest rates depends
on how far the economy can be trusted to slow by itself. At first
sight, it seems to be doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Recent retail-sales figures suggest that consumer spending may
be slowing. According to economists at Goldman Sachs, consumer
spending, after adjusting for inflation, is likely to rise by 3.6
percent at an annual rate between July and September, certainly
much less than the 6.7 percent real rise in the first three months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But history suggests caution. America's economy in recent years
has continually surprised analysts with its strength. And the next
few months could be no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending is still strong by historical standards. The
housing market, an important engine of demand (because people have
realized capital gains as they sold their houses, received cash as
they refinanced their mortgages and boosted construction demand by
building new houses), is still extraordinarily vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sharply higher mortgage rates, housing starts rose by
5.7 percent in June, though the rate of mortgage refinancing has
slowed sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The replenishing of firms' inventories could provide another
short-term boost to growth. Currently, inventories are low. Between
April and June firms added only $19.4 billion to their inventories
compared with $38.7 billion in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect a sharp rebound during the next few months,
and as companies prepare for the uncertainties of the millennium
bug they may well add to their stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this a strengthened demand for exports as economies in
Europe and Asia accelerate, and it is hard to see much chance of
the economy slowing down. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000. TOTAL UNCUT IS 1,175 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Two important _ and related _ uncertainties could cloud this
picture. One is the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street shrugs off higher interest rates entirely, as it
did in June, an orderly slowdown will be harder to achieve.
Conversely, a big correction in the stock market could precipitate
an uncomfortably sharp slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The other unknown is how foreigners will behave. America's trade
deficit rose to a record $24.6 billion in June, and the country is
heading for a current-account deficit of 4 percent of GDP this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As the economies of Europe and Asia perk up, foreign investors
who are financing this sizeable deficit may demand substantially
higher interest rates to do so. The recent slide in the dollar and
the strengthening in bond yields could be but the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   If foreign sentiment turns sharply, America's much-needed
economic slowdown could occur more suddenly than anyone expected.
And Alan Greenspan would then no longer seem a demigod. &QL;

   Give her your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to
do post-docs and patent drugs galore; the wretched refuse of your
teeming labs shall find funding on this golden shore.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, a lot of the immigrants coming to the United
States have arrived with PhDs burning holes in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   As a study published in this week's Science magazine shows,
America has incorporated this influx of talent so well that the top
ranks of its scientific establishment are now replete with
foreign-born workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Levin of the University of Missouri and Paula Stephan of
Georgia State University took a look at more than 4,500 top-rate
scientists and engineers who practice their craft in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   After checking how many of these had been born or educated
abroad, they reckon that the most accomplished scientists in
America are disproportionately foreign.
</P>
<P>
   The two economists began by consulting the membership rolls of
the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of
Engineering _ America's top scientific and technological clubs _
for the past 20 years. They also included the authors of the papers
and patents cited most frequently in scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, they culled lists of scientists from the boards of
selected American biotechnology firms. This dream team of
researchers is one that befits a nation of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all of the above categories, across almost all
disciplines, the proportion of foreigners is greater than it should
be considering their proportion of the scientific community as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1980 only about a fifth of the scientists in
America (those with doctorates, at any rate) had been born abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Over the subsequent decade, 60 percent of the American-based
authors of the most-cited papers in the physical sciences were
foreign-born, as were nearly 30 percent of the authors of the
most-cited life-science papers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a quarter of the founders or chairmen of the
biotechnology companies that went public in the early 1990s also
came originally from outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The main victims of all this, according to Ms. Levin and Ms.
Stephan, are Germany and Britain. Superficially, the reason is not
hard to find. It is money.
</P>
<P>
   British spending on research and development, as a fraction of
GDP, slumped this year to a record low of 1.8 percent. Germany's
was 2.4 percent. In America, it was 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to check the outward flow, a lobby group, Save British
Science, has been pushing the British government to double its
spending on science over the next nine years. Germany has pledged
to double its spending by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But that may miss the point. The proportion of research financed
by the taxpayer is falling in almost all industrial countries. It
is private spending that is rising. But Europe is behind America
here, too: and that is not so obviously open to a quick government
fix.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is not alone in its worries. China and India are also
watching the American statistics, since the 2000 census is expected
to show a fairly sharp increase in the supply of immigrant
scientists from there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Skilled Asian immigrants are snapping up visas as fast as
America can dole them out. In California's high-tech industries,
Asians already hold over 50,000 jobs and produce $17 billion-worth
of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   So, as other countries watch their talent wooed away, America is
left to cope with an embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   But every silver lining has its cloud. If foreign scientists are
so successful in America, it follows that at least some native
researchers are losing out in the competition for senior positions.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to immigration has classically come from the bottom
rungs of American society. Is a nativist backlash possible in the
quiet groves of academia as well? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ Carefree laughs drowned out the occasional
ping of an aluminum bat striking a ball Wednesday afternoon at the
dusty field where the young stars from Toms River, N.J., were
practicing for the biggest baseball game of their young lives.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Toms River meets Phenix City, Ala., in the
semifinals of the Little League World Series, the U.S. championship
game. Should the undefeated Toms River team (3-0) defeat Phenix
City (2-1) for the second time this week, it will be only the third
team to return to the finals one year after winning the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question Wednesday was not whether they could do it;
it was who would be on the mound when Thursday's game began. The
Toms River manager, Mike Gaynor, would not tip his hand. Some
players believed that Gaynor would turn to his son and the staff
ace, Casey. Others speculated that he might look beyond Thursday's
game, calling on Zack Del Vento or Eric Campesi and saving Casey
for a potential World Series final on Saturday against the winner
of Thursday's international showdown between Yabucoa, P.R., and
Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not sure,'' Mike Gaynor said with an all-knowing
smile.
</P>
<P>
   If the manager does start his son on Thursday, it will be the
seventh game Casey has pitched in and the sixth he has started
since Aug. 10, dating back to the regional tournament. During that
span, Casey, who relies to a considerable degree on his curveball,
has pitched 29 innings, giving up five hits and no runs. It is more
than he would be allowed to pitch in the same period during the
regular season under the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The number of innings _ and the types of pitches _ that any
12-year-old pitcher should be allowed has been an issue that has
been bubbling around the surface for years. The argument against
allowing 12-year-olds to throw curveballs is that the pitch creates
too much stress on an undeveloped arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen any of that to be a problem,'' said Mike
Gaynor, who has his pitchers apply ice to their throwing arm
immediately after games. ``There's stress on the muscles, but we
haven't had any problems with any of our pitchers. My kids have
been throwing curves for 10 years, and now some of them are playing
varsity in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The curve is an important pitch to throw, so I think
it's important for them to master it early. A lot of kids wait
until high school to learn it, but by then it's already too late.
At this level, it's an important pitch to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor was not concerned when asked about any risk to his
young arm, saying only that ``it doesn't bother me'' and ``curves
don't make my arm feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, pitchers may throw only six innings
in a calendar week; if they pitch up to three innings, they cannot
pitch the next day, and if they pitch four or more innings, they
cannot pitch the next three days. But those rules do not apply once
the teams reach the post-season. In tournament play, pitchers can
throw up to nine innings in a single game, and they are forbidden
to pitch in consecutive games or on consecutive days unless the
previous appearance was for one inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to see a pitcher throw 30 innings in the
post-season,'' said Lance Van Auken, a Little League spokesman.
``Theoretically, it's possible for a pitcher to throw 36 innings in
a seven-day period. That is, if every game goes to extra innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Rasmus, the Alabama manager and father of the South's star
pitcher, Colby, was not receptive to the idea of his son throwing a
curveball. Not at first, that is. But seeing the competition in the
district tournament changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a strong opponent of throwing curveballs at his
age,'' Rasmus said. ``I wouldn't let mine throw one. But after
districts, we realized that a good fastball and changeup wasn't
enough. Colby begged me to let him throw a curve, so I guess,
against my better judgment I let him.''
</P>
<P>
   Colby's curveball is very effective when it's working, and it is
probably a big factor in the South's advancing to the U.S.
championship game. But Colby struggled with his curve last Sunday,
which allowed Toms River to get some key hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may regret it four years from now,'' the elder Rasmus said
of his decision to let his son throw a curve. ``But I don't regret
it now.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Each Friday, Saturday and Sunday _ take the Sabbath of your
religious inheritance or choice _ America's places of worship are
filled with the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Americans out of every ten polled say that religion is
either ``fairly'' or ``very'' important to them; seven out of ten
claim affiliation to a religious group; four of every ten regularly
attend a church, synagogue or mosque.
</P>
<P>
   For all that the Constitution's very First Amendment seeks to
separate church from state, there is no denying that America, by
its history and its evolution, is a more religious nation than most
(in infidel, or at least insouciant, Britain, barely a tenth of the
population is religiously observant).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even America's supposedly feckless young proclaim their
faith: witness their proud hymn-singing after last April's
high-school slaughter in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   So no wonder America's politicians are also avowedly religious.
Congress begins each day's session in solemn prayer; ``God bless
America'' is a plea that comes automatically to any modern
president's lips (along, in Bill Clinton's case, with biblical
quotations and words of contrition); and among the nation's 100
senators only Colorado's Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Washington's
Patty Murray admit to having no religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite that First Amendment, America's
politicians will invoke God's name and espouse the virtue of faith
as readily as, say, politicians in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   So one should not expect George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee-apparent, to be any different. Bush has recently been
outlining ``a different role for government, a fresh start, a bold
new approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of ``the failed compassion of towering, distant
bureaucracies,'' America's poor, its drug addicts and its socially
inadequate will have access to ``a quiet river of goodness and
kindness that cuts through stone,'' he told an audience in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every instance where my administration sees a
responsibility to help people,'' he went on, ``we will look first
to faith-based organizations, charities and community groups that
have shown their ability to save and change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith-based?'' Al Gore, on the Democratic side, has discovered
the concept too, and finds it rings nicely on the hustings.
</P>
<P>
   But is this not code for steering the taxpayers' dollars to
religious groups, in defiance of that supposed traditional wisdom?
</P>
<P>
   It seems a long way from President Ulysses S. Grant, who once
declared: ``Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the
church and the private school, supported entirely by private
contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it depends on how you define separation. ``In God We
Trust'' was first engraved on American coins in 1864, when
President Grant was just General Grant, and became mandatory for
all coins and bills in 1955, just a year after the phrase ``under
God'' was added to the pledge of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks the House of Representatives has voted to
allow public schools to post the Ten Commandments on their walls,
Kansas has joined the states where the teaching of evolution is
merely optional, and the House only just fell short of the
two-thirds majority needed to pass a resolution calling on
Americans to ``observe a day of solemn prayer, fasting and
humiliation before God.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, all this is more ``gesture politics'' than substance.
But what of the 1996 federal welfare-reform law?
</P>
<P>
   Now widely praised across the political spectrum, this law
specifically provides for ``charitable choice,'' permitting
faith-based groups to receive federal cash for job-training
programs and other welfare-linked services so long as there are
secular alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Add the increasingly popular notion that children may receive
federal vouchers to attend private religious schools, and it is
hardly surprising that First-Amendment zealots react with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulation, they believe, will unavoidably follow the
use of government dollars. Religious and irreligious alike have
been warned.
</P>
<P>
   The risk will presumably be worse if a future President George
Bush expands ``charitable choice.'' After all, it is hard to see
the Scientologists or the Moonies being as politically palatable as
Episcopalians and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Is the George W. brand of compassion therefore something that
will insidiously, albeit unintentionally, undermine a social order
based on the notion that America has no established religion and
that its citizens have absolute freedom of belief?
</P>
<P>
   Surely not for a long time _ and meanwhile there is plenty of
evidence that faith-based groups, be they the Salvation Army or the
Nation of Islam, do a much better job than any government agency of
weaning the young away from drugs and street crime.
</P>
<P>
   The better criticism of George W.'s compassion is that it is so
partial. Of course America's prisoners, and their 1.3 million
children, will benefit if faith-based organizations and charities
have a bit more money with which to help them. (Bush talks of
giving $8 billion to them, and many other deserving causes, through
various tax incentives in the first year of his presidency.)
</P>
<P>
   But in a country as rich and generous as the United States, why
should this be necessary? Already almost half of the nation's
adults do some form of voluntary work, and last year gifts to
charity rose by 9 percent to $175 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One answer may well be that government programs are the
inefficient products of ``towering, distant bureaucracies.'' But
another is that God-fearing politicians such as Bush have too often
helped to create the problems they seek to cure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush bemoans the fact that so many children have parents in
prison. ``These are the forgotten children _ almost six times more
likely to go to prison themselves _ and they should not be punished
for the sins of their fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   So would it not be sensible to put fewer parents in prison in
the first place? (America's prison population has tripled in the
past 15 years.) Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   These are, to be sure, complicated issues. But in George Bush's
Texas the prison population at the last count (for 1996) was over
132,000, more than in any other state except California.
</P>
<P>
   The governor takes pride in a tough approach which, for example,
makes sure that drug offenders get jail rather than treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservatism'' may be a catchy campaign slogan,
but the element of compassion clearly has its limits. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Each Friday, Saturday and Sunday _ take the Sabbath of your
religious inheritance or choice _ America's places of worship are
filled with the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Americans out of every ten polled say that religion is
either ``fairly'' or ``very'' important to them; seven out of ten
claim affiliation to a religious group; four of every ten regularly
attend a church, synagogue or mosque.
</P>
<P>
   For all that the Constitution's very First Amendment seeks to
separate church from state, there is no denying that America, by
its history and its evolution, is a more religious nation than most
(in infidel, or at least insouciant, Britain, barely a tenth of the
population is religiously observant).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even America's supposedly feckless young proclaim their
faith: witness their proud hymn-singing after last April's
high-school slaughter in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   So no wonder America's politicians are also avowedly religious.
Congress begins each day's session in solemn prayer; ``God bless
America'' is a plea that comes automatically to any modern
president's lips (along, in Bill Clinton's case, with biblical
quotations and words of contrition); and among the nation's 100
senators only Colorado's Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Washington's
Patty Murray admit to having no religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite that First Amendment, America's
politicians will invoke God's name and espouse the virtue of faith
as readily as, say, politicians in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   So one should not expect George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee-apparent, to be any different. Bush has recently been
outlining ``a different role for government, a fresh start, a bold
new approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of ``the failed compassion of towering, distant
bureaucracies,'' America's poor, its drug addicts and its socially
inadequate will have access to ``a quiet river of goodness and
kindness that cuts through stone,'' he told an audience in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every instance where my administration sees a
responsibility to help people,'' he went on, ``we will look first
to faith-based organizations, charities and community groups that
have shown their ability to save and change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith-based?'' Al Gore, on the Democratic side, has discovered
the concept too, and finds it rings nicely on the hustings.
</P>
<P>
   But is this not code for steering the taxpayers' dollars to
religious groups, in defiance of that supposed traditional wisdom?
</P>
<P>
   It seems a long way from President Ulysses S. Grant, who once
declared: ``Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the
church and the private school, supported entirely by private
contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it depends on how you define separation. ``In God We
Trust'' was first engraved on American coins in 1864, when
President Grant was just General Grant, and became mandatory for
all coins and bills in 1955, just a year after the phrase ``under
God'' was added to the pledge of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks the House of Representatives has voted to
allow public schools to post the Ten Commandments on their walls,
Kansas has joined the states where the teaching of evolution is
merely optional, and the House only just fell short of the
two-thirds majority needed to pass a resolution calling on
Americans to ``observe a day of solemn prayer, fasting and
humiliation before God.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, all this is more ``gesture politics'' than substance.
But what of the 1996 federal welfare-reform law?
</P>
<P>
   Now widely praised across the political spectrum, this law
specifically provides for ``charitable choice,'' permitting

<P>
   PRAGUE _ Ten years ago, dissident intellectuals helped topple
Czechoslovakia's Communist regime. Arty sorts _ playwrights,
painters, philosophers _ held office in the transitional government
that followed, perhaps expecting an artistic flourishing of Czech
life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the currency of Czech intellectuals has been
devalued by a decade of cynicism, pop culture, and the advent of
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a group of the Czech Republic's leading
intellectuals, including Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, the country's top
churchman, academics, actors and writers, united for the first time
in ages to sign ``Impuls 99,'' a manifesto urging politicians to
stop bickering, to behave with less arrogance and to govern
properly.
</P>
<P>
   A comeback of sorts for the Czech intellectual? Or just a doomed
attempt to return to the days when people actually cared what a
poet thought?
</P>
<P>
   The signatories of Impuls 99 say they simply want to give their
politicians a kick in the pants. A recent poll suggested that 76
percent of Czechs are ``disgusted'' by their politicians. But these
days they are not turning to intellectuals for answers. And
politicians are more likely to regard intellectuals as a liability
than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was the collapse of communism that began to
undermine the position of Czech intellectuals. Until 1989, they _
or at least the heroic few with a dissident orientation _ had a
system to hate. Post-Cold-War, this target collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Motives were suddenly suspect. Were you a socialist, a
neoconservative, a Catholic revivalist, or did you simply want to
make money?
</P>
<P>
   Though the brain drain abroad after 1989 was somewhat offset by
the return of emigres, the internal loss of Czech intellectuals to
commercialism has proved more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Among the greatest contributors to this trend is Vladimir
Zelezny, once a Czech dissident and co-founder of TV Nova, the
country's most popular television station. Nova now feeds Czechs a
brain-numbing diet of soap operas, American cop shows, and, yes,
stark-naked weathergirls.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectuals complain that Nova is exploiting the ``moral
vacuum'' left by communism. If it improved the quality of its
shows, they argue, Czechs would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Zelezny is unapologetic: ``We just show what the market wants.''
If opera were as popular as guns and naked women, he says, Nova
would show opera.
</P>
<P>
   With a playwright for a president (Vaclav Havel), and a fine
literary tradition of their own (Milan Kundera, Ivan Klima, Bohumil
Hrabal) Czechs have not abandoned high culture altogether.
</P>
<P>
   They remain avid theatre-goers, even in the provinces, and _
despite the obliging efforts of TV Nova to supply lowbrow fare _
enthusiasts for opera and classical music, for which tickets are
still partly state-subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   Czech cinema, more thoughtful than its Hollywood counterpart,
just about holds its own. Publishing houses continue to put out
provocative books, albeit with smaller print runs. But the gradual
withdrawal of state subsidy and the opening up of the market has
inevitably promoted popular culture at the expense of the highbrow
version.
</P>
<P>
   Zelezny says his former dissident friends now shun him for
revealing a hard truth: most Czechs never particularly liked
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this myth among dissidents in communist times that
ordinary Czechs were secretly reading Proust,'' says Zelezny. ``Our
market research showed Czechs were not refined intellectuals at
all. They weren't interested in Proust at all. No! We discovered
what they were: beer-drinking, working-class Catholics, rather like
Belgians but less cultured.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the kind of talk to infuriate intellectuals. ``If he had
his way we'd all be watching his soft porn,'' sneers one. &QL;

   SEOUL _ The story of the creation of Daewoo was also the story
of the rise of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Over just three decades, Kim Woo Choong, a former shipyard
worker of modest means, built, through energy, guts and
determination, a global industrial giant that reached from
automobiles and electronics to financial services and construction.
</P>
<P>
   The conglomerate's allegorical power has therefore given its
decline an uncomfortable significance for South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, Daewoo's long-suffering creditor banks announced a
government-orchestrated plan to dismantle the sprawling group,
signalling what they hope will be the final chapter in a protracted
crisis that has cast a cloud over South Korea's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   When that cloud clears, Daewoo (``Great Universe''), the name
Kim chose in 1967 when the firm was just a tiny speck in what was
then one of the poorest countries in Asia, will remain only on its
cars and trading operation, according to the plan. The rest of its
dozens of Korean businesses are to be sold off by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has already announced that an investment group of
American banks has agreed to buy most of its electronics business
for $3.2 billion. In exchange for all this, the government will
prevent the creditor banks from forcing the firm into bankruptcy
and liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Daewoo's long-standing financial troubles, led by its
$50 billion in debt, the near-collapse of the group in July still
shocked many Koreans. They had believed that Hyundai, Daewoo,
Samsung and LG, the four biggest chaebol or family-controlled
business groups, were too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they were right. For all the government's tough talk
and Kim Dae Jung's televised speech on Aug. 15 in which he claimed
he would be the first South Korean president to dare to reform the
chaebol, neither government nor banks plan to liquidate a single
Daewoo company, for fear of rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo companies and their subcontractors employ some 2.5
million people in Korea alone, which _ as a government official
admits _ is the main reason for rescuing the group.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any mention of Daewoo's scores of overseas
subsidiaries, which are often tangled in complicated business and
financial relationships that go far beyond South Korea's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Even achieving the restructuring announced this week will be
tough. There are more than 60 Korean creditor banks in the
negotiations, and not all of them are controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign banks, which together extended $9.9 billion of loans to
Daewoo, are even harder to keep in order. Cash and loans flowed
freely between Daewoo subsidiaries regardless of shareholder
interests and so, if any one of the creditors calls in loans and
bankrupts a Daewoo company, it could pull the whole lot down.
</P>
<P>
   Finding buyers for Daewoo's businesses will be hard too. The
group announced last April that it wanted to sell its shipbuilding
operation but has yet to find a taker.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors hope General Motors (GM) will take over a controlling
stake of Daewoo Motor, but the American car giant is refusing to be
rushed into a deal. After a joint venture fell apart in 1992 over
Daewoo's plans to enter the American car market, relations between
the two companies have been prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors want to merge Ssangyong Motors, which Daewoo acquired
last year, with Daewoo Motor as part of the deal. But when Daewoo
and GM signed a memorandum of understanding early this month to
collaborate on new car production in South Korea, Ssangyong was not
included (the fact that it lost $417 million last year may have had
something to do with that).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, any buyer of Daewoo Motor will have to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars in plants that Daewoo left
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's financial trouble came to a head only last month, but
its failure was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the economic crisis forced most of the chaebol
to cut back, Daewoo brazenly added 14 new firms to its existing 275
subsidiaries _ and this in a year where the group lost a combined
550 billion won ($458 million) on sales of 62 trillion won ($51
billion).
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, South Korea's four biggest chaebol averaged
debt of nearly five times their equity. But while Samsung and LG
cut back during the subsequent year of economic crisis, Daewoo
acted as if nothing had changed: it added 40 percent more debt.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not alone in this: Hyundai's already large debt grew
larger, and it, too, went on an acquisition spree, buying Kia
Motors, LG Semicon and an oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai and Daewoo are the only top chaebol that are still run
by the mercurial tycoons who founded them. Kim is used to making
investment decisions on the spot, based on hunches.
</P>
<P>
   Although officially retired, Hyundai's Chung Ju Yung still
exerts strong influence on the group's affairs and few of his
managers will challenge his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's managers defer to him absolutely. Why is Kim, and not
Chung, now facing the humiliating public dismantling of his
business empire?
</P>
<P>
   The answer boils down to politics and paper. The government
believes that the recovering economy can now handle one big
corporate crisis, but worries it might tumble again with two _
especially one involving South Korea's largest firm. Besides,
Daewoo's finances really are worse than Hyundai's.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from having a higher debt-to-equity ratio than Hyundai, it
was particularly dependent on short-term debts.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the government put a ceiling on the total value of
bonds and commercial paper which the top five chaebol could issue,
thus cutting off Daewoo's access to capital and eventually
precipitating its near-bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing Daewoo to the brink, President Kim has shown he can
indeed challenge the chaebol. But he has yet to prove he can save
them. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an almost comical mismatch, the 300-plus residents of
Tehuacana, Texas, refused to give ground, even when a giant,
rock-blasting quarry company hired one of Texas' most powerful law
firms and sued the Central Texas town for $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Residents quickly united to battle Vulcan Materials, the
nation's largest supplier of gravel with annual sales of $1.6
billion, by organizing a $5-a-head, cornbread-and-soup fund-raiser
and reviving their lapsed bluebonnet festival. They collected
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Tehuacana got word that a federal judge in Waco
dismissed the lawsuit against it Tuesday. Vulcan sued in December
after Tehuacana banned quarry blasting within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   And though it may only be the first round, they're celebrating,
in moderation, at Tehuacana's General Store, the only business in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's parading up and down Main Street, but we're
delighted,'' said Betty Shelton, a City Council member and
proprietor of the General Store, known locally as the ``center of
knowledge'' for the alacrity with which news is spread there.
</P>
<P>
   The town saw it as a fight to defend its right to pass
ordinances that protect the community and preserve its peaceful
environment. Vulcan argued that the town violated its
constitutional rights by denying it due process when the new
ordinance kept it from operating on its own property.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton credits the townspeople, who she said put aside petty
differences to pull together under the leadership of a feisty
80-year-old resident named Jeffalene Stuver, sister of the town's
83-year-old mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't prefer trouble,'' said Stuver, a formidable
woman who didn't blink when Vulcan began lawyering the town. ``But
when it comes, I think I could meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they courted, tried to be so nice to us,'' she said
of Vulcan. ``Then they sued, and that really flipped us.
Twenty-five million! That could mean they'd take the whole town.
But we didn't stay down long. You just don't drop dead; you've got
to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's legal fees were largely covered by its insurance
policy, but Stuver quickly mobilized the Community Action League of
Tehuacana to raise funds to pay the $2,500 deductible. Going all
out meant a cornbread dinner with local singers providing the
entertainment. Now she hopes her group will move on to other
projects and keep the spirit of unity alive.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vulcan, it referred requests for comment to its attorney,
Bob Newman of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' Newman said of the ruling by federal
District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. But Vulcan hasn't decided yet
whether to appeal the decision, ask Smith to reconsider the ruling,
refile the suit in state district court, ``or all three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a contender as a site for Texas' capital, Tehuacana is a
sleepy community just northeast of Mexia in Limestone County that
is slowly gaining residents attracted by its friendly, quiet
ambience, after years of dropping population following Trinity
University's move to San Antonio in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Vulcan's southwest region president, Tom Ransdell,
said his firm, not Tehuacana, was the underdog in the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a government entity here telling us we can't work,
can't use our property,'' said Ransdell, 56. ``They're the
government making the laws and using powers to put us out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company points out that for years it has operated close to
residential areas in many cities, including San Antonio, where
Ransdell is based.
</P>
<P>
   But Tehuacana, as Vulcan is learning, is not like other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're close enough,'' Shelton said of the quarry, located
about a mile out of town. ``We like to go into our yards to listen
to the birds singing, rather than hearing blasting and seeing
clouds of dust.''

 Staking Your Domain
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Dan Fost  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; When I read about what happened to Willie Brown, I figured it
was time to stake my claim in cyberspace before somebody beat me to
it.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I'm a technology reporter. I know people in Silicon
Valley. I have e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw that the mayor of San Francisco, a city
positioning itself as a high-tech capital, had let a cybersquatter
snag the domain name www.williebrown.com, I figured I couldn't let
the same thing happen to me.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to www.danfost.com. There's nothing there yet, but it's
mine.
</P>
<P>
   While many people who want to plant their own flag in cyberspace
may not have as easy a time as I did _ my name is not only
mercifully short, it was available _ buying your own domain name is
getting easier.
</P>
<P>
   A domain name identifies an Internet site. It is a unique name
with two or more parts, separated by dots.
</P>
<P>
   For example, sfgate.com is the domain name belonging to The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Once a domain name is registered, subaddresses can be assigned
to it. For example, my e-mail at The Chronicle is fostd &LR; sfgate.com
and my e-mail at home is danfost  &LR; pacbell.net.
</P>
<P>
   People who have personal Web sites usually want it to bear their
own domain name. Having your own domain name also lets you have an
e-mail address that doesn't advertise the name of your employer or
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   For example, now I can get the e-mail address dan &LR; danfost.com,
even though my Internet service provider continues to be Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Having your own domain brands you as a hip digerati. It also
lets you change Internet service providers without changing your
e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, only one company, Network Solutions of Virginia,
doled out domain names. Network Solutions charges $70 for two
years, but it requires customers to provide a lot of technical
information such as the host name and net address of your primary
and secondary servers. If you don't have that information, Network
Solutions will reserve the name for you for $119.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are plenty of services that will register your
domain name and handle the technical mumbo jumbo. I chose
NameSecure.com of Moraga, which charges $95 to set up a domain
name. For another $24.95 a year, it will make sure any visitors to
my Web address are routed to my Web site and that all e-mail is
correctly routed.
</P>
<P>
   My Internet service provider, Pacific Bell, provides those same
services for $24.95 per month but with more features than I need.
</P>
<P>
   If your preferred domain name already is taken, you have several
options. One is to choose another name.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can get something approximating your first choice through
a company called Web.com. They would have let me use fost.web.com.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might be able to buy your first choice from whoever
controls it. To find out who has it, go to www.register.com and
type in your name. If it says your name is not available, click on
your name and then information about the domain-name owner should
appear.
</P>
<P>
   A company in Vancouver, British Columbia, called MailBank has
hoarded thousands of names _ from professions (biologist.com) to
animals (hippopotamus.com) to common surnames (roberts.net). It
will sublease these names for $19.95, plus $9.95 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to register your name with Tonic at www.
mailname.to.
</P>
<P>
   Tonic, headquartered in Tonga, registers domain names ending in
.to instead of .com or .net. It charges $98 per year to register a
domain name and forward e-mail to it.
</P>
<P>
   A San Anselmo woman named Hazel Wood wanted to establish her
consulting firm, Up and Running, on the Internet. Someone else
owned www.upandrunning.com, and when she tried through her ISP to
get upandrunning &LR; mindspring. com, someone had that, too. ``What I
really wanted to have was an e-mail address that said, hazel
 &LR; upandrunning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to Tonic and now has hazel &LR; upandrunning.to.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows, plenty of people are in the same boat as Hazel
Wood. For example, www.willie brown.com is registered to somebody
working for a competitor of the San Francisco mayor. There's Stead
Motors, which is suing a cybersquatter to try to seize possession
of www.steadmotors.com. There's Agilent, the new Hewlett-Packard
spin-off; even though the company has an invented name, someone
else already had registered www.agilent.com.
</P>
<P>
   In any of these situations, a Tonic name would be an adequate
solution. The only real drawback is that .com is far more familiar
than .to.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Rony of Tiburon, co-author of ``The Domain Name Handbook''
and Web master of www.domain handbook.com, said having your own
domain name is valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy, communications, services, goods _ it's all
happening on the Internet,'' Rony said. ``You're going to want to
participate in that, and you want to participate as yourself, not
with your affiliation with your ISP.''
</P>
<P>
   I almost picked a .to name, but Rony said .com will always be
more desirable, and because my name was available in .com, she
urged me to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   To set up my own Web page, I went to Xoom.com, which provides
free home pages. Other companies, including Lycos and GeoCities,
provide the same service. However, Xoom wouldn't host my page under
the domain name danfost.com.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I needed NameSecure to host it. The host keeps dan
fost.com on its computer so that when people type that name into
their Web browser, the get routed to my Xoom home page.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, my home page is in its infancy, and my e-mail
needs are basic. If you're trying to run a business under your own
domain name, there are plenty of companies that offer far more
elaborate services, for more money.
</P>
<P>
   And now, to paraphrase Steve Martin in ``The Jerk,'' when he saw
his name in the phone book for the first time: I have a Web site!
I'm somebody!

 480 More Jobs Cut At Komag  
 By Henry Norr 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Struggling computer-disk-maker Komag yesterday announced plans to
eliminate another 480 jobs, shift virtually all manufacturing to
Malaysia and shutter two San Jose plants.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of staff reductions is the company's third this
year. Together, they will reduce its U.S. head count from 1,950
last January to 570 by the end of the year _ 350 at its San Jose
headquarters and 220 in Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 employees lost their jobs immediately as a result of
the latest cuts. The remaining layoffs will be carried out over the
next two quarters. Komag's 2,750 workers in Malaysia were not
affected by the cutback.
</P>
<P>
   Komag makes thin-film disks, which store data inside hard disk
drives. It supplies the disks to drive manufacturers such as
Western Digital, Maxtor, Seagate and IBM, all of which have
recently announced cutbacks of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone in our industry is losing money,'' said Komag
spokesman Bill Potts. ``Everyone is struggling to size their
business properly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' he said, ``that we've had to take such
drastic action.''
</P>
<P>
   In its second quarter, which ended July 4, Komag recorded a net
loss of $38.2 million on sales of $93.2 million. In the previous
quarter, it lost $21.5 million on sales of $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, the 16-year-old company announced the
retirement of its two co-founders, Stephen C. Johnson, who served
as CEO and president, and Tu Chen, who was chairman of the board.
T.H. Tan, a 10-year Komag veteran who was appointed to succeed
Johnson, announced yesterday's restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems stem from the intersection of
technological progress and shifting market trends.
</P>
<P>
   Technologically, the capacity of the disks Komag makes has grown
so dramatically that disk-drive-makers need fewer of them.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as December, Potts said, each disk the company made
could store 3.2 gigabytes of data. The disks coming off the
manufacturing line today hold more than twice as much _ 6.8
gigabytes each. And soon, Potts said, the company will switch over
to 9.1-gigabyte disks.
</P>
<P>
   Such increases enable hard-drive manufacturers to build drives
of ever larger capacities even while reducing the number of disks
stacked inside each drive and thus cutting costs. And with most
growth in the computer industry taking place at the low end of the
market, those cost-reduced drives are exactly the ones PC
manufacturers are ordering.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, disk sales are growing relatively slowly. Komag's
unit volume increased 10 percent in the second quarter, compared to
the first quarter. But that figure included the output of a San
Jose facility the company acquired earlier this year from Western
Digital Corp. Komag had hoped the combination would boost unit
volumes by at least 20 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Excess capacity has also driven down prices even when the
company can find a customer. The average selling price of its disks
dropped 6 percent in the second quarter, compared to the previous
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Komag layoffs are part of wave of job cuts that has
swept through Silicon Valley this month. On Tuesday, Raychem, an
electronic-components manufacturer based in Menlo Park, said it
would eliminate 646 jobs in the Bay Area. Last week, Quantum said
it would trim 600 positions in Milpitas. And earlier this month,
Silicon Graphics announced a restructuring that will eliminate up
to 1,500 jobs.

 Left Field Drops Ads for Amazon.com
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
San Francisco ad agency Left Field has resigned from the
online-advertising account of Amazon.com, its oldest and best-known
client, due to disagreements over money and competitive conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced yesterday, illustrates the dramatic impact
on Web ad agencies of the ``portalization'' trend among Web
publishers. As Seattle's Amazon has expanded from a simple online
bookstore into a virtual mall, Left Field was precluded from
pursuing a growing array of e-commerce accounts, from auctioneers
to music sellers, said Michael MacMahon, the agency's managing
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker, though, was that Amazon refused to meet Left Field's
compensation demands. ``We have other clients paying us 50 to 60
percent more than Amazon,'' said MacMahon. ``We haven't made money
from the Amazon account for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Capelli, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment on the
financial dispute. ``While we have been very pleased with (Left
Field's) work, we felt that we had reached a point where it was
mutually beneficial for us to part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts between existing and potential clients is a perennial
irritant for ad agencies. A firm that works for Coke cannot also
create ads for Pepsi, for example. But the situation is compounded
on the Web, where the ease of consolidating many businesses into
one space has spurred a wave of portal building.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, for example, now sells CDs, videos, toys, games and
consumer electronics as well as books. In addition, it has made
large investments in Drugstore.com, Gear.com, Homegrocer.com and
Pets.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the bigger Web companies diversify, they're requiring their
primary agencies to remain noncompetitive, but that comes with a
high price to the agency,'' said Eric Roos, a partner in Swirl, a
San Francisco advertising firm. ``The client has to be willing to
ante up to keep that agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Web agencies like Swirl and Left Field ``are getting
from one to 10 calls a day'' from startups that could be the next
hot dot-com, Roos added. ``The task now is not trying to unearth
great clients _ it's sifting through those who call.''
</P>
<P>
   Left Field has turned away inquiries from e-commerce companies
including an auction site and a music e-tailer, MacMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Left Field's decision was a difficult one, said MacMahon,
who founded the agency three years ago with Amazon as its sole
client. ``Amazon is probably the marquee client'' on the Web, he
said. ``Everyone knew us as Amazon's agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Left Field counts Infoseek, Sun Microsystems, ImproveNet
and Macys.com as clients. Amazon represents less than 10 percent of
its $12 million in annual revenues, MacMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon spends an estimated $2.5 million annually on Web
advertising, but about $130 million on television, radio, print and
outdoor.
</P>
<P>
   Foote Cone &AMP; Belding of San Francisco has handled Amazon's
advertising in conventional media for about two years. FCB's
relationship with Amazon has also been rocky, according to industry
sources, but an FCB spokesman described it as ``solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is seeking a new Web advertising agency and does not
intend to consolidate the account at FCB, said Capelli.

   &UR; Cleaning Out Your PC Before You Sell It &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: I'm thinking of selling a notebook computer on eBay. Before
doing so, I would like to remove all personal information from the
hard drive. By this I mean my Outlook files, e-mail messages,
bookmarks, user names and passwords. Got any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best thing to do is reformat the hard disk and reload
Windows. You should be able to do that with the ``recovery'' CD
that came with the computer. That way, you'll get rid of every
single piece of data that you put on it, so you won't have to worry
about missing anything. And the person who buys it from you will
get it the way it was shipped from the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Purists will argue that even after you reformat your hard drive,
an expert could retrieve deleted files _ and that you need an
industrial-strength disk shredder to completely erase the drive.
Although that's true, the odds are that whoever buys your PC will
have neither the ability nor the inclination to hack into it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Test Driver
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know where I can obtain or download an updated driver
for a Lucent 56K modem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lucent makes the chipsets for modems that come in many new
PCs. Seeing as there are minor differences between these modems,
Lucent doesn't offer specific drivers for them. But it does offer a
generic driver that should work in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   You can download it for free at www.lucent.com/micro/K56flex
/driver2.html. You also should check the Web site of the company
that made your PC. Many PC-makers have a page where you can
download the right driver.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
My Favorite Things
</P>
<P>
   Q: I create a lot of documents in Word 2000, but some are more
important than others. Instead of saving those documents in My
Documents _ the default folder for Word files _ I've taken to
saving them in the Favorites folder.
</P>
<P>
   You can do this by clicking the Favorites icon on the left side
of the Save As dialog box. The problem is that whenever I want to
access a favorite Word file, I have to search through the list of
favorite Web sites. Is there a better way to save files so I can
get to them quickly?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Jeez, how long does it take to scroll through the My
Documents folder? But if that's not fast enough for you, I'd
suggest creating a separate folder inside the My Documents folder.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, go to Windows Explorer. (It's in the Windows
Programs menu.) Select the My Documents folder, then choose New
from the File menu, click Folder, and give the new folder a name.
Henceforth, the new folder will appear along with the list of your

PHONE LINE UPDATE:  &QL; 
Last week, I discussed ways to get around the problem of missing
incoming phone calls while you're connected to the Internet. A
reader suggested another option, a service called the Pagoo Call
Catcher from Pagoo Communications of San Francisco (www.pagoo.com).
</P>
<P>
   The service, which costs $3.95 a month, acts like a virtual
answering machine, storing messages on the company's Internet
server. Using free downloadable software called the Pagoo Player,
you can get instant notification of messages and play them back
without disconnecting from the Net. That's pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  A widely circulated e-mail currently making the rounds
anonymously warns that Windows 95 and 98 could crash on January 1
unless you change a default format for years in Regional Settings
from two digits to four. The e-mail claims that the setting affects
all Windows applications and that the two-digit format won't roll
over to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is calling this e-mail a Y2K hoax. The company says
the date format in question is just a display setting and has no
effect on any software. Microsoft even has posted a warning about
the e-mail on its Web site.

   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; San Francisco's small-business owners apparently are taking a
``so what'' approach to Y2K computer preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion of a study released yesterday that says 62
percent of the city's small businesses surveyed have no plans to be
Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
   Another 20 percent said they will wait until November or later
to get going.
</P>
<P>
   Problems could materialize for small businesses that rely on
errant computer programs and chips that mistake the year 2000 as
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by Mayor Willie Brown, the study is based on a
sample of 201 of the city's 83,000 small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Brown committed $25,000 in city funds to find out what steps
small businesses have taken to get ready for Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are being used in an information campaign to fight Y2K
apathy among small businesses. Microsoft and Cnet also have
contributed $25,000 each to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the city, through an outside consultant, is
setting up a Web site (www.sfy2k.com) to prepare small-business
owners for potential Y2K problems. The city also is planning
community outreach meetings and outdoor advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The apathy of small businesses toward Y2K problems is
widespread. The Small Business Administration, for example, has
made little headway across the country in getting small businesses
to apply for special Y2K loans.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, few have applied for the loans. The San Francisco
SBA office has made just one loan since the program started in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Marshall, economic development specialist at the SBA's San
Francisco office, said many small-business owners simply have gone
out and bought new computers this year to avoid costly new software
or consultants to help fix Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some small-business men who are Y2K compliant say there are
still other fears to consider on January 1.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Douglas Stewart, the owner of Howler Products, an
organic ice cream-maker in Hunters Point, who has a Macintosh
computer system that he says is Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fear is the power grid system. We have already
lost power three times this year because of PG&AMP;E breakdowns. For
the New Year, we are considering a backup generator.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Len Anderson said those fears are unfounded.
``Jan. 1, 2000 will be a day like any other, with full service
reliability. We are in very good shape as we approach the
rollover.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Providian Says Study Finds No Late-Fee Fraud
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Providian Financial, the credit card giant accused of milking
customers by charging improper late fees, said yesterday that an
outside review has cleared it of deliberate fee fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the accounting and consulting firm Ernst &AMP; Young
``found no evidence that Providian or any of its vendors were
intentionally withholding payments from processing,'' the
consultant concluded in a letter released by Providian. In
addition, Providian has ``established procedures to ensure timely
payment processing,'' Ernst &AMP; Young noted. The firm has been
Providian's auditor since it became a public company two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young's report addresses one of the most important
accusations leveled against San Francisco's Providian in a scandal
that erupted three months ago after KRON and The Chronicle
disclosed that hundreds of consumer complaints had been filed
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Providian, the nation's ninth-largest credit card issuer,
currently is under investigation by the city district attorney's
office for a range of alleged abuses, including thousands of cases
in which it levied $29 late fees even though payments arrived on
time.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bank regulators also are conducting a review, and the
matter is a key allegation in lawsuits seeking class-action status
filed against the company. Providian has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Providian Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Shailesh Mehta
issued a statement yesterday characterizing Ernst &AMP; Young's study
as ``confirmation'' that the company's payment-processing
procedures ``are fundamentally sound.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Ernst &AMP; Young stated in its letter to Providian
that it was expressing ``no opinion or any other form of
assurance'' concerning the allegations against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young tested payment-processing performance at six
sites, including four operated by outside vendors. The review
examined only current operations and did not consider past
practices, Providian spokesman Konrad Alt said.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney representing plaintiffs in one of the consumer
lawsuits against Providian said the study wouldn't affect the case,
which addresses the company's actions before Ernst &AMP; Young was
hired. ``These things, even if true, don't have any bearing on the
merits of our case,'' said Eric Gibbs, an attorney with the San
Francisco firm Girard &AMP; Green.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said his firm has asked for a court order directing Ernst
&AMP; Young to make its report and all supporting materials available
to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Providian previously has admitted that it had a serious
payment-crediting problem. Last month, Providian said a software
coding error had caused it to charge improper late fees in 700,000
cases since 1997. The company apologized and promised to give
customers refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The company said yesterday that it will set up a pay-by-phone
service by September that will make it easier for customers to
avoid missing payment due dates.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Providian adopted a series of measures to
address consumer complaints, such as offering a two-day grace
period before imposing late fees and promising to cancel sales of
credit protection and other add-on products if consumers feel they
were misled.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's release of the results of Ernst &AMP; Young's study came
on the same day Chicago's Bank One disclosed that problems at its
credit card subsidiary, First USA, forced it to slash its profit
projections for the year. First USA is the nation's No.2 credit
card issuer.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement prompted investors to dump shares of virtually
all major credit card companies. Providian's shares fell $3.94, or
4.3 percent, to $87.50.

ANGLING DEBATE OVER HOT SPOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In this push-button world, few old-school
traditions seem safe _ not even secret fishing holes held near and
dear to skippers of saltwater sport-fishing boats for years.
</P>
<P>
   Out with triangulation and visual landmarks to locate a
clandestine rock or pinnacle that has produced a bounty of game
fish. In with the Global Positioning System. Better known as GPS,
the precise computerized navigational luxury eliminates the hard
work.
</P>
<P>
   But a debate is brewing over how to acquire the coordinates that
lead anglers to the promised land: Should party-boat passengers
carrying hand-held GPS units on fishing trips copy the data for
their own purposes?
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is tantamount to stealing, an act of piracy that
compromises the livelihoods of skippers, deckhands and other crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else knew the spots, because they were so hard to get
on, to find,'' said Bill Cavanaugh of San Diego, a skipper on the
long-range boat Excel who cut his teeth as a deckhand in Ventura
during the mid-1980s. ``That stuff was sacred; that's how I
considered it. But there were backstabbers who stole spots and that
opened it up to everybody. (Other skippers) would have little spies
who would come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's a free sea and such information should be
available to anyone who pays the price of the boat ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps offer compelling arguments, but ultimately it's an
issue of ethics and etiquette that will be bandied about until _
and likely long after _ the next navigational technology is ushered
in.
</P>
<P>
   Those who feel they have the most to lose are the captains _ the
parties responsible for putting customers on fish, often by
visiting angling hot spots that few others may know about. Having
an angler punch in the spot on a personal GPS unit to be used for
future trips on private boats _ or, worse, pilfering the
coordinates for competing party boats _ is nothing less than a
violation of trust, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the reasons Cavanaugh pulled up stakes in Ventura in
favor of the San Diego multiday fishing fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys on private boats want to go out and fish these
coordinates on their boats,'' Cavanaugh said. ``On the other side
of the coin, you got a guy trying to make a living _ and it's
becoming more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He was taken aback by the brazen behavior of anglers he claims
were out to nab his skipper's fishing havens.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the guys in the wheelhouse, our buddies, the guys
feeding us meatball sandwiches,'' Cavanaugh said. ``They would look
at the Loran (a navigational tool developed prior to GPS), memorize
the coordinates and there you go. It was a slow progression, but
nothing is sacred anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   GPS is of lesser importance in the open tuna grounds to the
south, where pelagic fish migrate throughout a water column far too
deep for anchoring. Up north, careful monitoring of coordinates is
critical to structure-oriented fishing, where schools of many
species can hold on a single rock, a wellhead, a shipwreck or slabs
of riprap; finding a prolific angling site _ no matter how
unscrupulously _ can make or break a day's outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm down here fishing on a long-range boat. I got
disgusted with what was going on locally,'' Cavanaugh said. ``These
are spots where you can't fish two boats at once _ way too small.
There was too much competition with other sport-fishing boats in
that region, overpressuring the area and private boats fishing
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Many sport-fishing enthusiasts are on board with the logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unequivocally, a small boater should not be really sponging
off party-boat or charter-boat operations,'' said Ronnie Kovach of
Huntington Beach, who hosts ``Fishing Expeditions'' on sports-talk
radio KXTA-AM (1150) and a national cable-television show of the
same title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the recreational angler should try to find (productive
spots) on his own. I think it becomes almost unethical to steal
spots that party-boat and charter-boat skippers have worked so hard
to find and to cherish in order for them to basically come up with
successful catches for their paying customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the jury is out, as others close to the issue offer
different viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on boats where we'll be on a wide-open bite and
there is a guy with a hand-held (GPS unit) and he puts in the
coordinates, so he's not even stealing them from up there (in the
wheelhouse),'' said Joe Contaldi of La Canada Flintridge, manager
of the Oxnard Sport Chalet who has organized many sport-fishing
charter trips. ``He's just getting them from being there (on the
water).''
</P>
<P>
   But he's on the skipper's boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has paid to be on there,'' Contaldi said.
</P>
<P>
   How secret are these locations anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not, they're not,'' he said. ``With today's
technology, all the electronics we have, everything that's out
there, there are no secret spots. Most of the coordinates are in
books already.''
</P>
<P>
   So why are skippers so incensed about losing their special
fishing holes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are probably the old-time guys, who, back in the
old days, didn't have GPS to help them out,'' Contaldi said.
``Maybe they're bitter because skippers nowadays have easy access
to information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Prieto in Granada Hills has seen both sides of the
situation as a salesman at Bob Sands Fishing Tackle in Van Nuys and
a deckhand aboard the Chubasco out of Long Beach Sportfishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a problem. It's a big ocean, but there
are few secrets,'' Prieto said. ``To be opposed to (copying
coordinates) is a waste of energy, because people are going to do
it. It's a free ocean.''

VALLEY ANGLERS CAN STAY CLOSER TO HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not often that anglers get to brag about a
new fishery. It's even rarer when a fishing hole opens in the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what will happen at 10 a.m. Saturday in Lake View
Terrace, when lines and bait can be dangled in Hansen Dam Lake for
the first time in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for the residents of the Northeast Valley to
have quick access to one of the few stocked lakes in the urban
basin. They can finally have an opportunity to fish without
traveling a great distance,'' said Congressman Howard Berman, who
made the reopening of the facility a priority when elected in 1982.
Lake Balboa is the only other fishing lake in the Valley, according
to recreation and parks officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some 375 pounds of catfish were released Aug. 9 into the
city-operated Army Corps of Engineers flood-control facility; it
hadn't been stocked with the whiskered denizens for 16 years.
Largemouth bass, bluegill and carp _ introduced the week before the
inauguration of monthly catfish plants _ also may be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, D-Mission Hills, will be on hand Saturday armed with rod
and reel for the event, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The
9{-acre lake near the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and
Osborne Street is free for use by anyone with a state fishing
license; anglers ages 15 and younger are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   It eventually will be open from an hour after sunrise to an hour
before sunset. Cold-water-loving rainbow trout are expected to be
planted regularly in winter months. Anglers and other visitors may
employ nonmotorized boats, including canoes, kayaks, sailboards and
float tubes; paddle boats will be available for rent.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's festivities include a fishing clinic with several
``learning stations'' _ biology and ecology, knot-tying, casting,
and safety and ethics _ as provided by the Department of Fish and
Game's ``Fishing in the City'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great opportunity if you don't know about fishing
and want to learn a little bit more,'' said Elaine Fischer, a DFG
fish and wildlife interpreter helping to coordinate the Hansen Dam
Lake fishing project.
</P>
<P>
   An adjoining 1{-acre pool is designed for swimming. The twin
lakes replace Holiday Lake, a 130-acre inland center of
water-skiing, boating, swimming, fishing and picnicking forced to
close in the early 1980s after becoming clogged with flooded silt
and sediment and resulting vegetation.

METS' ROGERS IS A PITCHER OF MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something unnerving about Kenny Rogers, a disturbing
unknown that has a Blair Witch air to it. Something is out there,
way out there. And it's Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the sly Mona Lisa smile on his face that suggests he's
hiding a secret. It's in his aloof personality that puts limits on
what his teammates and coaches know about him.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he has become a man of mystery in New York. Here, he
is susceptible to weird twinges and spasms that appear inflicted by
voodoo pins. Here, he is incapable of telling a story that doesn't
twist and bend like a side street in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, not long after Rogers had signed a $20 million
deal with the Yankees, Manager Joe Torre felt he had been lied to
when Rogers indicated that his shoulder was fine in spring training
when it wasn't. That was just the beginning of the bizarre behavior
that marked Rogers' underachieving stint in a city that seemed to
draw out his quirky personality.
</P>
<P>
   `'Not everyone is a New York person,'' George Steinbrenner said
when the Yankees traded Rogers to Oakland in November of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland seemed to fit him at first. Less pressure, lower
expectations. In that atmosphere, Rogers won 16 games for Oakland
last season and was 21-11 over all with the As when they curiously
traded him to the Mets a month ago. Curious because they were _ and
still are _ in the race for a wild-card spot. There were
explanations, such as the A's desire to reduce their payroll. But
Rogers did not endear himself to the organization, either. He was
disgruntled, and wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Mets wanted a steady, veteran lefty to be
their co-star to Al Leiter, to anchor the team's flighty rotation.
But steady is not the word readily associated with Rogers. He's
back in New York. And he's just as enigmatic this time around. He
arrived in late July with a hamstring injury and two different
versions of how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Rogers was about to jog to the mound, and all
Manager Bobby Valentine could do was assume that his starting
pitcher was being up front about his latest ailment, back spasms.
Rogers pitched three innings against St. Louis in his last start
and left the game in pain after allowing seven hits and four runs.
Four days later, Rogers maintained that he was ready for his sixth
start as a Met Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Kenny,'' Valentine said before the Mets played the
Astros. ``He always says he's fine. You know Kenny.''
</P>
<P>
   But deception is a dangerous trait in a pennant race. Rogers was
facing the Astros in his most crucial start for the Mets, who are
desperate to keep within bloop range of the Braves and stay ahead
of the Reds in the wild-card race. Rogers was also facing an Astros
team the Mets could meet in the post-season, and was trying to send
his team off on a high note as they begin a six-game road trip that
will pass through Arizona and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you trust Rogers? How do you know when he's healthy
and when he's not? When he's ready and when he's not? The Mets have
no choice right now but to go with whatever Rogers tells them. They
need Rogers to establish his place as No. 2 in the rotation because
miracle comebacks are fickle and the Mets' safety net of a bullpen
is not immune to fraying at times.
</P>
<P>
   They need Rogers because they have little else to lean on. Once
you get past Leiter, the Mets' potential playoff rotation is a grab
bag of the peculiar Rogers, unspectacular Orel Hershiser, mercurial
Octavio Dotel and surging Yoshii Masato. If healthy, Rick Reed
would be in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the decisions we have to make,'' Mets General
Manager Steve Phillips said. ``For us to predict today what things
will look like two weeks from now is impossible. It's really too
hard to predict even what decisions we'll have to make. I believe
it's really the player who leads you to the decisions you have to
make. It's not about feelings down the stretch, it's about
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all it's about for the Mets. And they'll take a victory
any way they can dig one up. But ninth-inning rallies aren't
reliable. They need a starter they can count on, one they can put
their faith in.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was that pitcher at first. He shrugged on his Mets'
jersey in late July, sauntered out to the mound and threw a
one-hitter through six innings until his hamstring injury surfaced.
Until then, he seemed like a new man, as if he could handle the
pressure of playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But after an injury-tainted month and a few so-so starts, Rogers
has turned into an enigma once again. He seemed to trot to the
mound Wednesday night, as if to say, ``Trust me.'' But can you?  &QL;

JOHNSON CHASING FINAL PROOF OF PREEIMENCE IN 400-METER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Since 1990, Michael Johnson has been collecting
evidence. He's won seven world championships, become the only man
in history to win both the 200 and 400 meters in the same Olympic
Games, run the fastest 200 meters ever with a mind-numbing 19.32
seconds in Atlanta, and has even been on the cover of a national
news magazine, track shoes of gold draped around his muscled neck.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson is still chasing Exhibit A, perhaps the final bit of
proof the 32-year-old needs before history will judge him a legend:
the 400-meter world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's glaring, because it's the one thing missing,'' said
Johnson earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not for long. The way Johnson has been running at the
World Championships of Track and Field, many believe the
11-year-old record of 43.29, held by American Butch Reynolds, could
fall in Thursday night's 400-meter final. Among the believers is
Johnson himself, who has run seven of the fastest 10 times ever,
including a 43.39 four years ago that ranks as the second best in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm in shape right now to run faster than 43.29,'' he
said after turning in a ludicrously-easy 43.95 as he coasted the
last 70 yards of the semifinal. ``I know that I'm in shape to do
that, and I'm going to go out there and give it my best shot. I
really shouldn't have any mistakes and no excuses for not being on
the right pace (Thursday night).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's confidence was ratified by US teammate Jerome Davis.
``Michael is in better shape than he was in '96, in my opinion,''
said Davis after being eliminated in a 400 semi. ``He's running
like a madman out there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his 43.92 in Lausanne is the fastest time in the world
this year and Johnson comes to Seville as the reigning world
champion, the track has had its bumps since Atlanta. Pulling up
injured midway through the much-hyped 1997 match race against
Donovan Bailey was one of them; withdrawing at the last minute from
a ballyhooed 200-meter showdown against Maurice Greene at June's US
nationals was another. Just a few weeks ago, he stopped in the
midst of a 400-meter race in Stockholm and then skipped a major
meet in Zurich, citing a slight strain of his lower right
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Some have wondered, many aloud, if Johnson is trying to avoid
any threat to the dominance for which Nike signed him to a $12
million contract after the Olympics. (``I haven't heard anyone in
particular come up to me and say, `Hey, I thought you were
ducking,' '' Johnson said Tuesday after his semifinal. ``Until
somebody comes up to me and says something about it . . . then that
will be between me and that person.'') But the reason may actually
be much more mundane: a hip-alignment problem that has been nagging
him since the Olympics, requiring daily physical therapy to keep
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Smith, his therapist, told reporters last week that
injuries such as pulls or strains could recur any time Johnson puts
his legs under pressure. ``If Michael becomes a little rotated or
out of alignment up in his low back or pelvis, he creates stress
across his legs in a way they are really not designed to take
stress,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   It was that situation, said Smith, that knocked Johnson out of
the showdown against Greene at nationals and the race in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said he has been feeling great here, and in any case
he would likely throw caution to the wind during a championship
final.
</P>
<P>
   Not naturally outgoing, Johnson has also been criticized as
aloof, holding himself distant from his fans, unwilling to sign
autographs even for children. At a news conference last week, he
made it clear he finds the label unfair and unwarranted. ``I do
autograph sessions. I do camps for children. I do all kinds of
things for children,'' he said. ``I hope that answers your
question. I can't be perfect. I can't do everything for everyone.
But I try and do the best that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as he progressed through the rounds of the 400 this
week, Johnson was talkative, even playful, signing autographs and
kissing a couple of stadium volunteers as he came off the track
Tuesday night and stopping to chat at length with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because he feels that his physical problems, if not
vanquished, are finally under control, putting the grail back
within reach. When asked after his semifinal if he thinks there's a
world record in the immediate future of those reborn legs, he
answered with a smile: ``I think there is.''

REPORT TO DETAIL PBS DONOR-LIST SWAPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 100 of the nation's 1,058 public television
and radio stations have bought donor lists from or swapped them
with political parties, according to an inspector general's report
that will be sent to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans last month criticized the list-swapping as a
partisan practice between some stations and Democrats. But
Inspector General Kenneth Konz said Wednesday that most stations
apparently had swapped lists as a result of pressure to raise
funds. He also said name-swapping with political parties appeared
to be ``just a very small percentage'' of the stations' direct-mail
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had looked at the numbers, and a large portion of the
numbers in a campaign or in a series of campaigns over the years
had been targeted, I would be more disturbed,'' said Konz, who
oversees the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. ``I would be more
disturbed if it were all Democrats or all Republicans. But the fact
of the matter is, depending on the groups you look at, it's a small
portion of their direct marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Konz said he intends to write in his report to Congress:
``In my personal observation, I don't think it was appropriate for
them to be dealing with political organizations at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Several House members, Democrats and Republicans, have expressed
that sentiment over the last two months, after the disclosure that
Boston's prominent public television station, WGBH, had traded its
donor lists with the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning about the WGBH incident, members of the House
Telecommunications Subcommittee, which authorizes funding for
public broadcasting, launched an inquiry to discover if the
practice was occurring nationwide and suspended the budget process
that was supposed to include a sizable increase for the stations.
</P>
<P>
   The funding is still in jeopardy, with the subcommittee refusing
to consider the public broadcasting budget until the inspector
general's report has been reviewed and a final hearing on the issue
has been held, according to Ken Johnson, a spokesman for
Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who
heads the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Konz emphasized that the report is still incomplete and probably
will be sent to Congress in early September. But based on his
investigation so far _ involving visits to 13 television and radio
stations, including WGBH and public TV stations in New Hampshire
and Vermont _ Konz said it did not appear any stations had violated
the regulations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which
grants funding to stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Since the controversy over list-swapping erupted, the public
broadcasting group instituted stringent rules prohibiting the
practice. But no such prohibitions were in place when the incidents
took place, Konz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it wrong under CPB statute, or under any regulations CPB
had? The answer is, no, it wasn't. Under the old rules, it
wasn't,'' he said. ``I am now in the process of analyzing the (new)
rules and evaluating them to determine whether anything more needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 99 percent of the public TV stations and 94 percent of
public radio stations have provided complete information about
their direct marketing practices to investigators, Konz said. Konz
said he has also ``made use of outside resources,'' including
documents from brokers often hired by stations to organize mailing
lists for them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the information already gathered, 26 television
stations made their donor lists available to political parties and
in many cases received lists of political donor names in return.
Another 50 or so TV stations purchased _ or in the parlance of
direct mail, ``rented'' _ lists from political parties. Some 23
public radio stations exchanged lists, Konz said.
</P>
<P>
   But Konz said names acquired from or exchanged with political
parties ranged from ``0.3 percent to no more than 6 percent'' of
any station's overall direct mailing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my conclusion is that they could continue and they
could have good direct-mail soliticitations and programs without
the names they got from political organizations,'' he said. ``And
that would probably make everybody happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's spokesman agreed. ``If it's a very small amount then
they won't miss it when we make it illegal,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH appeared to have swapped lists twice. Konz said he visited
the Boston station to go over its records and found potentially
exonerating evidence. On more than one occasion the station had
refused to swap lists with political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found there were times when those same political entities
had requested additional names and were turned down,'' Konz said.
</P>
<P>
   Konz, who was appointed inspector general by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting but reports directly to Congress as well as to
public broadcasters, said his report will include a complete
listing of the stations engaged in various list-swapping practices.
</P>
<P>
   But Tauzin is planning to introduce legislation this fall that
would outlaw such list-swapping. ``Let me be as blunt as I can be.
The inspector general's report is not going to put this controversy
to bed,'' Johnson said. ``We are going to continue until we are
satisfied we have all the answers to all the questions.''

BRUINS STILL UP IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two weeks ago, UCLA's prospective punters sent a
slew of spectators, including athletic director Peter Dalis,
running for shelter at Spaulding Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they (punt) them into the net, sometimes into the
tennis courts,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``They almost killed
my athletic director.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp ended Wednesday with a Rose Bowl scrimmage, but
the punting problem remains unresolved. It might be easier to
replace quarterback Cade McNown than Chris Sailer, who punted for
four years and kicked for two.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins recruited several junior college punters in the
spring but couldn't get them in school. The remaining candidates
are strong-legged freshman Nate Fikse, who did not punt in high
school, and walk-on Kurt Jasso.
</P>
<P>
   Fikse consulted Sailer about the conversion from punting to
kicking and received a few tips. But as a longtime soccer player,
Fikse's natural motion is sideways. That might be ideal for
kicking, but it's disastrous for punting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been hard to switch up,'' Fikse said. ``Punting is
so different from what I'm used to, but Chris told me to change my
(punt) drop so there's no rotation. That gives me more solid
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Fikse and walk-on Chris Griffith are competing for the kickoff
and placekicking jobs, and Toledo might let the winner do both.
However, the days of one player performing all three functions _
the Sailer triple _ probably are over. Fikse has the leg to do it
but not the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be adequate in the kicking game,'' Toledo said.
``Punting concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ State of the return: With Freddie Mitchell, DeShaun Foster,
Jermaine Lewis, Ryan Roques and Ricky Manning Jr., the Bruins have
their deepest and most talented group of returners in years.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mitchell is the primary punt returner and will join
Lewis on kickoff returns. When Roques returns from his two-game
suspension (disabled-parking placards), he might replace Mitchell
on punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   !bold!Parking-scandal update: Fullback Durell Price, guard Jim
Ghezzi and three former players scheduled for arraignment Wednesday
in Municipal Court received continuances until Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Price said Tuesday that he expects the same punishment nine
players received July 28: two years probation, a $1,485 fine and
200 hours community service. Price and Ghezzi are represented by
Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I think it'll be the same (punishment),'' Toledo
said. ``(The continuance) is just procrastinating in my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the UCLA police, the cases involving tailback Keith
Brown and safety Eric Whitfield have not been forwarded to the city
attorney. Brown and Whitfield have been suspended for two games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: The Bruins survived training camp with just
two injuries to top players. Receiver Danny Farmer (sprained ankle)
is doubtful for the Boise State game, and safety Jason Stephens
(sprained knee) is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally: UCLA expects the Sept. 25 game at Stanford to
start at 2 p.m., but the kickoff time won't be official for several
weeks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bennett turns 21 today.

FBI ADMITS IT USED HEAT-GENERATING DEVICES AT 1993 WACO DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI backed away from six years of unqualified
denials to Congress and the public Wednesday and conceded that it
used ``pyrotechnic'' tear-gas canisters on the final day of the
1993 standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said the devices were ``pyrotechnic'' only in a
limited sense and bounced harmlessly off a concrete structure six
hours before the compound's main building, built of wood, erupted
in flames.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people, including 24 children, were found dead after
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation, after repeated staunch denials, that federal
agents used pyrotechnic devices of any definition was deemed so
serious that Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh on Wednesday night ordered an exhaustive inquiry into the
events of April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 FBI agents have been assigned to the review, and
everyone who was at Waco that day will be re-interviewed, said John
Collingwood, a bureau spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that law enforcement did not start the
fire,'' Collingwood said. But there were clear signs Wednesday
evening that the backtracking had spawned a serious credibility
crisis for the FBI and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new information requires a thorough investigation of
whether the Justice Department has misled the American people, and
the Congress, about what happened at Waco,'' Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., who heads the Committee on Government Reform, said
Wednesday night in a statement. ``I intend for the Government
Reform Committee to get to the bottom of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another FBI spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the devices in
question were ``pyrotechnic'' only in a limited sense _ that is,
that they generated heat even as they dispensed tear gas. He said
they were fired at the concrete ``bunker'' about 100 yards from the
main wood structure after less potent tear gas canisters failed to
pierce the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agents wanted to get tear gas into the bunker
because they feared the Davidians would try to escape through a
tunnel between it and the wooden building, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The two pyrotechnic devices, military-type gas canisters known
as M-651 grenades and fired by an FBI agent from a range of about
40 yards, also bounded off the bunker roof and into a nearby
puddle, where they lay harmlessly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After flames consumed the wood building, the remains of the cult
leader, David Koresh, and about 80 of his followers were found.
Autopsies showed that some had died of self-inflicted gunshot
wounds, others from the flames or smoke. A few escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI spokesmen, while insisting that there is no new
information to challenge the finding that the Davidians themselves
started the fire, acknowledged tonight that the necessity to
``recant and modify'' earlier statements was acutely embarrassing
to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Reno came under heavy criticism immediately after the raid, but
then regained respect as she accepted responsibility and answered
questions with seeming candor. Her credibility and that of the FBI
are at stake with the disclosures about the use of the
military-type gas grenades. Freeh was not the FBI director at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about the two pyrotechnic canisters were first carried
by The Dallas Morning News this week based on an interview with a
former senior FBI official.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of force used by federal agents on April 19, 1993,
could be critical in a wrongful-death suit filed by some Branch
Davidian survivors and relatives of the dead and scheduled to open
on Oct. 18. Some plaintiffs are represented by former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark. And the question of whether the FBI used
pyrotechnic devices has been the subject of a separate inquiry by
the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and Justice Department are far more worried that the
recantation will fuel the suspicions of people who have long
doubted the federal government's motives and actions in the
incident. ``We're fighting the conspiracy theorists,'' one bureau
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A former soldier, Timothy McVeigh, was so enraged by the
incident at Waco that he bombed the Federal Building in Oklahoma
City on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people, according to evidence
at his trial. Prosecutors said he chose the second anniversary of
the Waco incident for symbolic vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI explained Wednesday night that on April 19, 1993, a
bureau agent was driven to within 40 yards of the Davidians'
concrete bunker in an Army Bradley fighting vehicle, then fired the
two military canisters. He was 100 yards away at the time and was
firing away from the wood structure, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The unsuccessful use of those two canisters was noted in
documents at the time, the bureau said Wednesday night. The issue
began to resurface this week, when Danny Coulson, a former senior
FBI official in Texas, told The Dallas Morning News that
pyrotechnic grenades had indeed been used.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law enforcement officials backed up his recollections.

   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 100 of the nation's 1,058 public television

CLASSIC FIELD GETS CROWDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day after Mazel Trick was injured in a workout,
knocking the heavy favorite out of Sunday's Pacific Classic, the
field for Del Mar's $1 million race grew to as many as 11 horses.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer of Such Charisma, who has never raced on dirt, said
the colt will be entered this morning, when post positions are
scheduled to be drawn. And the trainers of turf specialists Ladies
Din and Army of One as well as New York-based Catienus indicated
their horses might be entered in the 1\-mile race, weakened by this
month's injuries to Victory Gallop, Real Quiet and Mazel Trick.
</P>
<P>
   Previously confirmed were Malek, General Challenge, Barter Town,
River Keen, Lazy Lode, Smile Again and Jack Grandi. It was
announced Wednesday that Smile Again has been purchased by Sidney
Craig from Saudi Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. and moved
to Ron McAnally's barn from Alex Hassinger's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wide-open race, don't you?'' said Humberto
Ascanio, assistant to Bobby Frankel, the Mazel Trick trainer whose
hope for a fifth Pacific Classic victory now depends on Barter
Town.
</P>
<P>
   Mazel Trick fractured both sesamoid bones in his right foreleg
and was pulled to a stop by jockey Chris McCarron during what would
have been a 5-furlong workout Tuesday morning at Del Mar. He was
reported comfortable in his stall Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Hollywood Park 7-furlong record setter will survive
and go to stud at former Kentucky Gov. Brereton Jones' Airdrie
Stud, under an agreement negotiated last month, will depend on his
recovery from surgery scheduled for Friday in Rancho Santa Fe,
veterinarian Helmuth Von Bluecher said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery by Kentucky-based vet Larry Bramlage will be
designed to fuse the fetlock joint with screws, wire and a metal
plate, allowing the leg to bear weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not out of the woods,'' Ascanio said of Mazel Trick.
``We'll know after they do the surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   While Frankel was at Saratoga on Wednesday, preparing the filly
Keeper Hill for Friday's Personal Ensign Handicap, Ascanio
supervised a 3-furlong workout in 37 2/5 seconds by Barter Town and
jockey Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Juddmonte Farms' Barter Town, who hasn't won at the stakes
level, comes out of neck losses to Worldly Ways in Golden Gate
Fields' All-American Handicap and to River Keen in Hollywood Park's
Bel Air Handicap. Desormeaux will take over from Victor Espinoza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barter Town is no slouch,'' Frankel had said when it appeared
he'd have both that 4-year-old and Mazel Trick in the Pacific
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel trained the winners of four consecutive Pacific Classics
_ Missionary Ridge, Bertrando and Tinners Way twice _ starting with
the second running of the race for 3-year-olds and up in 1992.

CELLUCCI LEANING TOWARD MARSHALL FOR CHIEF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a move that would make her the first woman to lead
the state's highest court, Governor Paul Cellucci is strongly
leaning toward elevating Supreme Judicial Court Associate Justice
Margaret H. Marshall to be chief justice of the seven-member panel,
administration sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci may announce a replacement as soon as Thursday for
Chief Justice Herbert P. Wilkins, 70, who faces mandatory
retirement this month.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is also considering associate justices Roderick L.
Ireland, the court's first African-American, and John M. Greaney,
an appointee of former governor Michael S. Dukakis, for the chief
justice's job.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said Marshall has emerged as the favorite because
Cellucci feels she has the intellectual heft needed for the top
post. A 54-year-old native of South Africa, Marshall is considered
a liberal-to-centrist thinker on the court, with strong
civil-libertarian views.
</P>
<P>
   ``She interviewed the best of all the candidates,'' said one
source.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is also searching for candidates to fill two associate
justice vacancies on the court left by Wilkins's impending
departure and justice Charles Fried's departure earlier this
summer. Cellucci will probably miss his goal of announcing those
nominees by Labor Day. His legal aides have been waylaid by a probe
into alleged misconduct by Economic Development Director Carolyn
Boviard, and her top aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't know if we can do it now,'' said Cellucci's
legal counsel, Leonard J. Lewin, referring to the Labor Day
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is only considering sitting SJC members for the chief
justice's job. Cellucci and Lieutenant Governor Jane M. Swift
called Marshall, Ireland, and Greaney to his State House office on
Tuesday for interviews. The choice must be approved by the
Governor's Council.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to criticism that he is more interested in hiring
political supporters than making top-notch appointments, Cellucci,
a lawyer, has told aides he wants to make sure his picks for the
court are of the highest quality and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who has worked at major Boston law firms, has Ivy
League credentials, having graduated from Harvard University and
Yale Law School. She also has strong connections in Cambridge
academic circles, and served as Harvard's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Marshall and Ireland were finalists for a seat on the
SJC, when Governor William F. Weld appointed her to the court.
Weld's decision touched off a backlash in the black legal and
political communities, where leaders had been lobbying heavily for
Ireland. Less than a year later, Weld chose Ireland to fill another
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   While a student in South Africa, Marshall was a national leader
in the protest movement against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Marshall would be the first female chief justice
has helped her candidacy, sources said. Her consideration comes as
the governor deals with embarrassing fallout from a scandal at the
Massachusetts Port Authority involving a state-funded ``booze
cruise'' featuring heavy drinking and swimsuit-clad young women. On
Tuesday, Cellucci appointed his chief of staff Virginia Buckingham
to be the first woman Massport director.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Cellucci does tap Marshall, he is turning to a jurist
who not only has contributed money to Democratic candidates, but
whose liberal-leaning philosophy often conflicts with his
positions.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci takes tough law-and-order stands on criminal
justice issues, Marshall is considered more liberal on those
issues. She opposes the death penalty, while Cellucci has led the
fight to reinstate capital punishment. She also sided with the
court's majority in declaring that the sex offender registry law
did not provide sufficient constitutional safeguards for those
convicted of sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with Marshall and her legal career say she also
has strong civil libertarian leanings, although on economic issues,
she is generally a centrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wild-eyed liberal she is not,'' said one friend of hers who
has worked with her on legal matters and followed her career.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was appointed to the court by Weld in the middle of his
1996 US Senate campaign against US Senator John F. Kerry, in what
many felt was part of an attempt to attract women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is married to New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis.
She has contributed to Democratic political figures, including US
Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   As a South African native, she would be the first chief justice
who is a naturalized citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC, the forum where some of the state's thorniest issues
are resolved, is the final stop in Massachusetts for all court
cases, both civil and criminal. In a series of decisions this
summer, the court has redefined the traditional notion of family,
and next month will tackle the issue of whether spanking veers into
child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will fill an unprecedented four slots on the court,
because three judges will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70
during his term, and Fried left in July to return to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin is now conducting interviews with over a dozen candidates
forwarded to him by a screening panel set up by Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin will present the governor a number of choices.

RYDER CUP PLAYERS GIVE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS SPECIAL FLAVOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ The field is exclusive, the purse is huge and the
winner will receive $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the things that make the World Golf
Championships NEC Invitational, which begins Thursday, different
from a typical tour event. Only 41 players qualified for the second
event in the WGC series: the members of this year's Ryder Cup teams
from the United States and Europe, plus the members of last year's
U.S. and international President's Cup teams. The tournament was
formerly the NEC World Series of Golf, won by David Duval last
year, but it became a WGC event this year, with a total purse of $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four of the top 30 players in the world ranking will be
competing at Firestone Country Club, including Tiger Woods, Duval,
Colin Montgomerie and Sergio Garcia. The year's four majors are
over, and the Ryder Cup is still almost a month away. But with the
hefty purse and a world-class field, the NEC Invitational has more
than enough to hold everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the strongest 40 players you'll find in the world
today,'' said Ernie Els, a two-time U.S. Open champion. ``You're
going to see some great golf.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first time that both Ryder Cup teams have been
together since they were completed earlier this month. Not
surprisingly, most of the pre-tournament talk has centered on next
month's Ryder Cup at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   With seven Ryder Cup rookies on its 12-man team, Europe is the
decided underdog. It will be a European team in transition, lacking
many veterans who have been the backbone of their team for the past
decade, like Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ian Woosnam, Costantino
Rocca and Seve Ballesteros. But Europe was also the underdog when
it won in 1995 and 1997, and a neutral observer like Els believes
anything could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, the Americans would blow Europe clean out of the
water,'' said Els, who as a native of South Africa does not compete
in the Ryder Cup. ``They should steamroll them. If they played the
Ryder Cup as a stroke-play format, I would think the Americans
would beat them quite comfortably. But with 18-hole match play,
anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The five Ryder Cup veterans who will anchor Europe's team are in
this week's field: Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, Jose Maria Olazabal,
Jesper Parnevik and Darren Clarke. But they will be joined next
month by seven players who have never tasted Ryder Cup pressure _
the 19-year-old Garcia, the British Open champion Paul Lawrie,
Jarmo Sandelin, Miguel Angel Jimenez, Jean Van de Velde, Padraig
Harrington and Andrew Coltart.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the American team is potentially one of the strongest
ever, featuring Woods, Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III, Mark
O'Meara, Justin Leonard, Phil Mickelson, Hal Sutton, Jim Furyk,
Jeff Maggert, Tom Lehman and Steve Pate. Ten of those players, with
the exception of Woods and O'Meara, will visit The Country Club on
Monday for a practice session, along with the U.S. captain, Ben
Crenshaw. Woods and O'Meara had previous engagements, but they will
visit The Country Club before Ryder Cup week.
</P>
<P>
   While the American players are confident, the United States has
lost the last three international team events _ two Ryder Cups and
last year's President's Cup. While the American players have played
down the impact of the recent debate regarding Ryder Cup revenue,
others are curious to see how well the team comes together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American team is very strong, but maybe a little
fragmented right now with what's been going on the last couple of
weeks,'' said Nick Price, who is in this week's field. ``I think
they are going to have to work hard on pulling themselves together
and remembering that they have got to try and win back the cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is still riding high after his second-place finish to
Woods at the Professional Golfers' Association Championship, and
Garcia will be paired with Duval on Thursday, a twosome that should
attract one of the day's largest galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a lot of fun and I'm playing well,'' Garcia said.
``I'm going to see if I can play a good tournament here, then
hopefully, we can win the Ryder Cup.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Tim Finchem &UR; ,  &LR; commissioner of the PGA Tour, remained confident
that the PGA of America and players would reach an agreement on how
to allocate Ryder Cup money to charities of the players' choice.
``This matter, conceptually, is resolved,'' Finchem said. ``It is
only a matter of detail to be worked out in the coming weeks and
months.'' . . . Tiger Woods &UR; ,  &LR; who turned professional on Aug. 27,
1996, has won more then $9.89 million worldwide. If he finishes
13th or higher this week, he will surpass the $10 million mark in
just over three years. &QL;

REPORT TO DETAIL PBS DONOR-LIST SWAPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 100 of the nation's 1,058 public television
and radio stations have bought donor lists from or swapped them
with political parties, according to an inspector general's report
that will be sent to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans last month criticized the list-swapping as a
partisan practice between some stations and Democrats. But
Inspector General Kenneth Konz said Wednesday that most stations
apparently had swapped lists as a result of pressure to raise
funds. He also said name-swapping with political parties appeared
to be ``just a very small percentage'' of the stations' direct-mail
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had looked at the numbers, and a large portion of the
numbers in a campaign or in a series of campaigns over the years
had been targeted, I would be more disturbed,'' said Konz, who
oversees the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. ``I would be more
disturbed if it were all Democrats or all Republicans. But the fact
of the matter is, depending on the groups you look at, it's a small
portion of their direct marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Konz said he intends to write in his report to Congress:
``In my personal observation, I don't think it was appropriate for
them to be dealing with political organizations at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Several House members, Democrats and Republicans, have expressed
that sentiment over the last two months, after the disclosure that
Boston's prominent public television station, WGBH, had traded its
donor lists with the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning about the WGBH incident, members of the House
Telecommunications Subcommittee, which authorizes funding for
public broadcasting, launched an inquiry to discover if the
practice was occurring nationwide and suspended the budget process
that was supposed to include a sizable increase for the stations.
</P>
<P>
   The funding is still in jeopardy, with the subcommittee refusing
to consider the public broadcasting budget until the inspector
general's report has been reviewed and a final hearing on the issue
has been held, according to Ken Johnson, a spokesman for
Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who
heads the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Konz emphasized that the report is still incomplete and probably
will be sent to Congress in early September. But based on his
investigation so far _ involving visits to 13 television and radio
stations, including WGBH and public TV stations in New Hampshire
and Vermont _ Konz said it did not appear any stations had violated
the regulations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which
grants funding to stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Since the controversy over list-swapping erupted, the public
broadcasting group instituted stringent rules prohibiting the
practice. But no such prohibitions were in place when the incidents
took place, Konz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it wrong under CPB statute, or under any regulations CPB
had? The answer is, no, it wasn't. Under the old rules, it
wasn't,'' he said. ``I am now in the process of analyzing the (new)
rules and evaluating them to determine whether anything more needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 99 percent of the public TV stations and 94 percent of
public radio stations have provided complete information about
their direct marketing practices to investigators, Konz said. Konz
said he has also ``made use of outside resources,'' including
documents from brokers often hired by stations to organize mailing
lists for them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the information already gathered, 26 television
stations made their donor lists available to political parties and
in many cases received lists of political donor names in return.
Another 50 or so TV stations purchased _ or in the parlance of
direct mail, ``rented'' _ lists from political parties. Some 23
public radio stations exchanged lists, Konz said.
</P>
<P>
   But Konz said names acquired from or exchanged with political
parties ranged from ``0.3 percent to no more than 6 percent'' of
any station's overall direct mailing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my conclusion is that they could continue and they
could have good direct-mail soliticitations and programs without
the names they got from political organizations,'' he said. ``And
that would probably make everybody happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's spokesman agreed. ``If it's a very small amount then
they won't miss it when we make it illegal,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH appeared to have swapped lists twice. Konz said he visited
the Boston station to go over its records and found potentially
exonerating evidence. On more than one occasion the station had
refused to swap lists with political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found there were times when those same political entities
had requested additional names and were turned down,'' Konz said.
</P>
<P>
   Konz, who was appointed inspector general by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting but reports directly to Congress as well as to
public broadcasters, said his report will include a complete
listing of the stations engaged in various list-swapping practices.
</P>
<P>
   But Tauzin is planning to introduce legislation this fall that
would outlaw such list-swapping. ``Let me be as blunt as I can be.
The inspector general's report is not going to put this controversy
to bed,'' Johnson said. ``We are going to continue until we are
satisfied we have all the answers to all the questions.''

LIBERTY GETS MESSAGE: WIN ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Liberty arrived for practice at Madison
Square Garden two days ago to find the Knicks' orange-and-blue
banners draped over the scorers' tables. When the Liberty returned
Wednesday, the banners were still courtside and flapping.
</P>
<P>
   What was up?
</P>
<P>
   Were Garden officials trying to send a subliminal message to the
Liberty as the team enters the semifinals of the Women's National
Basketball Association playoffs against a spirited Charlotte Sting
team. Something like: ``Don't forget the Knicks, who surprised
everybody and made it to the finals of the NBA playoffs. Maybe you
can surprise everybody and and win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Liberty's challenge is somewhat different than
what the Knicks faced. The Liberty (18-14) is the top-seeded team
in the Eastern Conference and will have home-court advantage in the
semifinals. The Knicks were an eighth-seeded team and did not have
home-court advantage in the four rounds they played.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks won their opening games on the road during the
first three rounds, and that is just what the Liberty wants to do
Friday night: start its two-of-three-game series against the Sting
with a victory in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can win the first one,'' Richie Adubato, the Liberty
coach, said. ``If not, we're coming home to our home court, where
we're 12-4 this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty will play Game 2 against the Sting on Sunday at the
Garden and Game 3, if necessary, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Western Conference finals will begin Thursday
night, with the Los Angeles Sparks (20-12) playing host to the
two-time defending champions Houston Comets (25-6) in their
two-of-three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup brings together the WNBA's two best teams from its
more dominant conference, where the 15-17 record of the last-place
Utah Starzz equaled that of the second-place Sting and the Detroit
Shock in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between the Comets and the Sparks could be intense
enough to make the championship round feel a little anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, of course, do not see it that way. New York and
Charlotte have been dueling from the start of the season to see
which team would finish first. Less than two weeks ago, the two
teams were tied for the top spot in the East, but then the Liberty
finally prevailed. They split their regular-season matchups, 2-2,
with each winning one game on the opponent's court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last two games were very competitive and close,'' Adubato
said after putting his team through two and a half hours of
practice Wednesday. ``The one here went into overtime and they beat
us. The one in Charlotte, we lost by 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both games we didn't benefit from the foul line. They shot
24 to our 8 in one game and 20 to our 8 in the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Adubato has focused on stopping the inside game of the Charlotte
forward Vicky Bullett, who is 6 feet &QC; 3 inches, and the 6-2 center
Rhonda Mapp. The Sting's backcourt is also of concern to Adubato,
because Andrea Stinson and Dawn Staley are among the league's
strongest perimeter shooters. Mapp and Stinson each had 16 points
in the Sting's first-round victory on Tuesday night over the Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Liberty has not played since Saturday, there was no
evidence of any lack of intensity during practice. Vicki Johnson
found herself being elbowed by Venus Lacy when Johnson attempted to
wrest a ball from Lacy's clutch. Johnson walked away smiling. Lacy
did not crack a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus is a big girl; I know my limitation,'' the 5-9,
150-pound Johnson said of the 6-3, 234-pound Lacy.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a brief scare when Teresa Weatherspoon, the team's
vocal floor leader, was spotted stumbling off the court, clutching
her left thumb. Weatherspoon had sprained the thumb against the
Washington Mystics on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Not to fret, Liberty fans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would be ready for Friday night's game,
Weatherspoon looked at the swollen thumb, shrugged and said: ``I'll
be ready in about five minutes. It's not the time to be hurting or
tired. This is the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for the mystery of those Knicks banners, the answer was
quite simple. The Knicks have been holding tryouts for the City
Dancers.  &QL;

   Overriding opposition from labor unions within his own Social
Democratic Party, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder sent Parliament a
plan to slash government spending by nearly $20 billion and to trim
pension increases. The budget marks a sharp shift by Schroeder
toward the interests of business and industry, but, in a move to
divide the ruling coalition, the opposition Christian Democratic
Union might block the measure in Parliament's upper house.

cease-fire agreement in 1997. Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan told
the BBC: ``I have no doubt that the IRA were involved in the murder

will rule this week on whether the IRA or its political wing, Sinn
Fein, broke the accord.

   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of Mexico City says he will
step down next month to work full time on his third campaign for
the presidency. Cardenas said he would quit after delivering a
state-of-the-city speech on Sept. 17. Cardenas is virtually certain
to win his leftist party's Oct. 10 presidential primary. His

<P>
   At least 56 people have died in attacks by right-wing
paramilitary squads on four villages, part of an offensive into the
same area where a Roman Catholic bishop critical of their
activities was kidnapped on Aug. 15. More than 4,000 peasants in
the northeast, a traditional stronghold of Marxist rebels, have
fled to Venezuela, fearing that their names may be on the
paramilitary forces' list of suspected rebel sympathizers who are
to be executed.

RUMORED ANGELS SALE NOT GOOD FOR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Bucking public perception, Los Angeles Dodgers
president and CEO Bob Graziano said it would be a negative for the
Dodgers and baseball if Disney was to sell the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Reports surfaced a few weeks ago that Disney had backroom talks
about selling the club. ``If Disney is, in fact, looking to get out
of the game, it's bad for us, bad for the industry,'' Graziano said
Wednesday. ``Disney is good for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziano was in town to talk with commissioner Bud Selig about
the state of baseball, particularly from an economic standpoint,
and also about the Dodgers' role in it. They have the third highest
payroll in the league at $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a global conglomerate, the Dodgers' parent company, the Fox
Group, is part of a new breed of owners. Disney fits the same mold.
Baseball is moving away from family ownership to corporate
ownership. Both the Angels and Dodgers were sold recently to huge
corporations that, in theory, had the financial resources to run a
profitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they did get out of the game, I don't think that's a good
sign for baseball, or a good sign for us,'' Graziano said. ``I
think that's a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes against public thinking that Disney and Fox have such
a strong rivalry that one's loss is the other's gain. Disney and
Fox compete for more than just the Southern California baseball
fan. Both are entertainment giants, of which sports is one facet
but not the major revenue producer.

   ASARCO AND CYPRUS AMAX WEIGH PHELPS DODGE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Two copper companies in the midst of a merger, Asarco and Cyprus
Amax Minerals, said they were willing to discuss being taken over
by Phelps Dodge, one of the world's largest mining companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the two companies flatly rejected Phelps Dodge's initial
offer of $2.66 billion, saying they wanted at least 25 percent more
than that. Phelps Dodge called the new proposal ``totally
unreasonable'' but said it would review it.
</P>
<P>
   TREASURIES RALLY ON FED MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rallied on the prospect that the increase in
short-term interest rates announced by the Federal Reserve on
Tuesday could be the last of the year. Yields were down to a
one-month low even after the government reported that durable goods
orders rose 3.3 percent in July, far exceeding expectations. The
30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32, to 103 29/32. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.85 percent from 5.93
percent on Tuesday and was the lowest since 5.77 percent on July
21.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks moved higher, carrying the Dow Jones industrial average
to a closing high as investors grew more confident that the
interest rate increase would enable the economy to grow without
runaway inflation. The Dow advanced 42.74 points, to 11,326.04. The
NASDAQ composite index gained 53.23 points, to 2,805.60, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index was up 18.29 points, to 1,381.79.

   BRAZILIAN JOB AD OPENS FLOODGATES
</P>
<P>
   As many as a million people _ or one of every 160 Brazilians _
are competing for about 10,000 entry-level jobs advertised by Banco
do Brasil. The flood of applications highlights the bleakness of
Brazil's job situation, even as the country slowly emerges from
recession.

   ALASKAN OUTRAGE AT CRUISE LINE
</P>
<P>
   Despite a visit and apology by Jack Williams, the president of
the Royal Caribbean International cruise line, which has pleaded
guilty to dumping pollutants in Alaskan waters, the city of Juneau,
Alaska, is likely to impose a $5 ``head tax'' on each passenger as
cruise ships dock there.

<P>
   METROPOLITAN LIFE SEEN IN DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. is reported to be in talks to
buy General American Life Insurance Co. of St. Louis for $1.2
billion. That could mean that customers would be repaid the $6.8
billion they have demanded from General American.
</P>
<P>
   RITE AID SHARES JUMP ON SPECULATION
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Rite Aid, the nation's third-largest drugstore chain,
jumped $3.4375, or 17.6 percent, to $22.875, in after-hours trading
after the company said it was discussing a possible deal. Analysts
said that Rite Aid might sell all or some of the 1,000
underperforming West Coast stores it acquired from Thrifty Payless
Holdings in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   FACTORY ORDERS CLIMB 3.3 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Orders to U.S. factories jumped 3.3 percent in July, but
analysts said the sharp increase did not suggest inflationary
pressures of the kind that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve
have moved to head off. The rise in production of durable goods
like cars, airplanes and computers, reported by the Department of
Commerce, was offset by a drop of 3.9 percent in the sale of
houses.
</P>
<P>
   WORRY OVER ASIAN BANKING SCANDALS
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and securities analysts predict that the banking
scandals that have rippled across Indonesia and Thailand this month
are likely to worsen, to the consternation of lenders at the World
Bank and IMF.

<P>
   SOCIETE GENERALE TO RETURN SHARES
</P>
<P>
   Societe Generale, the big French bank, will return to
shareholders the minority stake in the investment bank Paribas that
it won in its failed takeover attempt. Because of the merger
defeat, Paribas' chairman, Andre Levy-Lang, left the bank. He was
succeeded by Michel Pebereau, the chairman of Banque Nationale de
Paris, which gained a 65.4 percent stake in Paribas.

 &HT;    48 American Airlines workers charged with smuggling
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In what federal authorities are calling the largest drug
smuggling investigation ever involving a U.S. airport, 48 airline
workers were charged Wednesday with smuggling drugs and weapons
concealed in garbage bags, food carts and luggage aboard passenger
planes.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year investigation into employees and contract workers
for American Airlines revealed an organization that smuggled about
550 pounds of bogus cocaine and heroin into and around the country,
said Thomas Scott, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
Florida. The fake drugs were provided to the alleged smugglers by
undercover agents in the reverse-sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation highlighted an alarming security problem at
U.S. airports, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 51 people were indicted in Miami on various drug
charges as a result of the two-pronged investigation, including 30
American Airlines ramp workers at Miami International Airport, 13
workers for LSG/Sky Chefs, a food service contractor owned by
Lufthansa Airlines, and three law enforcement personnel. Most face
a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, 48 people were arrested, most at their homes
and a few at the airport. So many were arrested that at one point
the agency had to borrow a bus from the marshal's service to hold
prisoners as they waited to be booked and fingerprinted. About
$69,000, a still unopened safe and five stolen laptop computers
were also seized in the predawn raids.
</P>
<P>
   In what Scott called a related investigation, eight people in
New York and Dallas _ seven current or former American employees _
also were charged Wednesday with conspiracy to smuggle marijuana
from Miami to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And in Cali, Colombia, officials identified American as the
airline associated with the arrests last weekend of 10 Colombians
charged with smuggling more than a half ton of heroin to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people sunk to the lowest depths in pursuit of greed,''
said Vince Mazzilli, special agent in charge for U.S. Customs
Service, at Wednesday's news conference in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the joint investigations, dubbed ``Operation Ramp
Rats'' and ``Operation Sky Chef,'' were brought to a close three
weeks ago after one of the smugglers transported a handgun,
ammunition and three grenades in a carry-on bag aboard a passenger
plane. He said the weapons, provided by undercover agents, were all
dummies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get anything we wanted to on these planes,'' he said.
``We thought it was time to let the public know.''
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sky Chef focused on employees of LSG/Sky Chefs. Scott
said it began in April 1998, shortly after an American Airlines
pilot complained that his coffee tasted funny and was weak. An
investigation revealed 15 pounds of heroin inside coffee packets
loaded aboard an American Airlines flight from Colombia, Scott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover officers contracted with Sky Chefs employees to
smuggle cocaine and heroin into the Miami International Airport
from Costa Rica, Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia at $1,000 a
kilogram, according to an indictment. The drugs were hidden inside
garbage bags, hollowed out cutting boards and jury-rigged food
carts.
</P>
<P>
   Once the packages containing drugs were in the country, Sky
Chefs employees unloaded them into trucks and drove them out of the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The operation included the smuggling of nearly 20 pounds of fake
cocaine and more than 4 pounds of fake heroin and resulted in the
indictment of 13 Sky Chefs employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Slay, a spokesman for LSG/Sky Chefs in Arlington, Texas,
said the caterer cooperated with federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees have access to airplanes. Unfortunately, this
handful of people have taken advantage of the situation and used it
to their own enrichment,'' Slay said.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Ramp Rats started in April 1997 after investigators
received tips that American Airlines' ramp workers were smuggling
drugs into the country and redistributing some drugs to the
Northeast on airline flights, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   He said ramp workers used their employee uniforms and badges to
bypass X-rays, metal detectors and customs inspections in order to
load and unload drugs from international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Ramp workers also used their identification to deliver drugs to
buyers waiting to board domestic flights. They also flew free on
American Airlines' flights to northeastern cities, including New
York, Baltimore and Washington, to deliver drugs to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Ramp Rats was brought to a close shortly after Aug. 3
when a smuggler agreed to transport a Glock 19, 9 mm semi-automatic
pistol with two loaded magazines and three M-67 fragmentation hand
grenades aboard a passenger plane. All of the weapons were disabled
and undercover agents switched the bag holding the weapons with an
empty bag shortly before the smuggler boarded the plane, Scott
said. He was the second smuggler to agree to carry the weapons on a
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The operation resulted in 38 indictments, including the
indictment of an Immigration and Naturalization Service agent, an
inspector with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a Broward
County sheriff's deputy who worked part-time as a baggage handler.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects in the two operations face a variety of charges,
primarily conspiracy to possess narcotics, attempted importation of
narcotics and attempted possession.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, the largest carrier serving Latin America,
said it has cooperated with investigators and blamed the problem on
a ``small group of employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company with zero tolerance for illegal drugs,''
said Larry Wansley, American's managing director of corporate
security.
</P>
<P>
   Scott disagreed, characterizing the drug ring as a large
conspiracy that put the public at great risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case of one or two rogue employees involved in a
month-long drug case,'' he said. ``They had come to the airport
literally to perform criminal conduct, utilizing their security
passes, utilizing their uniforms in order to bypass security,
bypass the laws of the United States and take contraband onto these
airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement is just the latest indictment of
American employees suspected of smuggling drugs into the U.S.
aboard passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
   In February, agents in Puerto Rico arrested an American Airlines
ramp supervisor on charges of trying to smuggle 205 pounds of
cocaine into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, federal agents in Miami arrested six American
mechanics suspected of smuggling a half ton of cocaine and heroin
aboard jetliners by stashing the drugs behind cabin walls and
ceiling panels and in the cockpit electronics.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, mechanics conducting an overnight maintenance
check on an American jet in Dallas found 64 pounds of cocaine
stuffed into the wall panels of the Boeing cockpit.

ALL ROADS LEAD TO THE SUGAR BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the NCAA violations at Washington and the
UCLA parking mess to the scandal at Notre Dame, it was a busy
offseason in college football.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season should be plenty entertaining, as well. The
Bowl Championship Series is back from its spring checkup, ready to
match Nos. 1 and 2 on Bourbon Street on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   There are two returning deans (Lou Holtz at South Carolina and
John Robinson at Nevada-Las Vegas) and a relentless Dayne (Ron),
who makes a run at the Division I-A rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   The power base returns to the Sunshine State, where Florida,
Miami and Florida State have top-10 talent. If quarterback Chris
Weinke stays healthy, the Seminoles should finish ranked in the top
four for a remarkable 13th consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's new coach, Bob Stoops, hopes to rekindle old success,
while Penn State patriarch Joe Paterno chases Bear Bryant. (Paterno
needs 16 victories to catch Bryant for the career record. He'll
have to wait 'til next year.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 welcomes two old friends (Dennis Erickson and Rick
Neuheisel) a few months after saying goodbye to two other old ones
(Cade McNown and Chris Claiborne).
</P>
<P>
   Without further delay, here's a look at several stories to watch
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Bad Boys are back:
</P>
<P>
   College football lost its edge in 1995, when NCAA sanctions
crushed Miami's program. Without the taunting, flaunting and
talented 'Canes, there was no antagonist, no one to hate. (Other
than Notre Dame, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Miami's back _ back in the headlines, back in the
top 15 and back to create chaos with a schedule that includes Sugar
Bowl contenders Ohio State, Florida State and Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami wasn't going to be down for long with the high school
talent down there and the kind of program they have,'' said Ohio
State coach John Cooper, who meets Miami on Sunday in the Kickoff
Classic. ``It was just a matter of time until they got back to the
top of college football.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes coach Butch Davis has 17 starters returning from a
team that went 9-3 and ruined UCLA's title hopes. Although tailback
Edgerrin James and quarterback Scott Covington are gone, the
defense should be good enough to carry the 'Canes until the offense
finds its form.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season will give us the best indication of where we
are,'' Davis said. ``We lost 31 scholarships (to NCAA sanctions)
and it takes time to rebuild. Next year will be the first time
we're back to (the maximum) 85 scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success here made everybody feel like we could just show
up and play. But their eyes opened in 1997 with that losing season,
and that's when people started to appreciate what probation is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Jumpin' for Joe Pa?Penn State was the defending national
champion when it opened the 1983 season in the Kickoff Classic
against Nebraska. The Cornhuskers won 44-6 and Penn State never
recovered, finishing No. 17 in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't ready to handle a team on a mission like that
Nebraska team,'' Paterno said. ``But are we as good (this year) as
people think we are? I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Lions ready to deliver the 72-year-old Paterno his third
national title? He'll know a lot more after Saturday's showdown
against Arizona in the Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   With both quarterbacks and their top tailback returning, the
Wildcats also have a national title in the crosshairs. Both teams
have favorable schedules: Penn State gets Michigan and Ohio State
at home, and Arizona plays Middle Tennessee State and Texas-El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions might have the nation's best defense, but they
definitely have questions at quarterback _ always a disadvantage
but especially in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed feelings (about playing Arizona), but I talked to
the squad and they were enthusiastic,'' Paterno said. ``Arizona is
just outstanding. If I had it to do over again, I'd play Akron.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Please Pass the Hard Drive
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 5, three unbeaten teams threatened to
discombobulate the inaugural Bowl Championship Series rankings.
Then UCLA and Kansas State tumbled, Tennessee and Florida State
were matched in the Fiesta Bowl, and the BCS creators exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, they went back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the season, we dissected each ranking system, and the
one component we thought we could improve on was the computer
polls,'' said Charles Bloom, assistant commissioner of the
Southeastern Conference and BCS co-creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to add polls to come up with a representative
computer average. Our point of emphasis was to try to keep the
importance of scoring margin to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of averaging three computer polls (Seattle Times,
Sagarin and USA Today), the BCS formula will consider eight: the
original three, the Dunkel Index, the M Ratings, the Scripps-Howard
ratings, the Rothman rankings and the Billingsley poll.
</P>
<P>
   The other BCS poll components _ average of the top-25 polls,
losses and strength-of-schedule quotient _ are unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at 40 or 50 computer polls and came up with those
five,'' Bloom said. ``Then we ran the new formula based on the 1998
information, and it came up with the same No. 1 and 2 teams. The
only thing that's different this year is that each computer poll
means a little less.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's good or bad won't be clear until December.
</P>
<P>
   __ Touchdown Dunbar: The most intriguing off-field story this
season emanates from South Bend, Ind., where Notre Dame awaits the
NCAA's ruling on potential rules violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish expect the NCAA to determine that school officials
should have done more to learn about gifts players received from
convicted embezzler Kim Dunbar, according to the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, who pleaded guilty to two felony theft charges and was
sentenced to four years in prison, is considered a representative
of the university because of her $25 membership in the Quarterback
Club.
</P>
<P>
   She embezzled more than $1.2 million from a South Bend business
and used some of those funds to entertain players and conduct
relationships (including sexual relationships), according to the
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the lack of institutional control would constitute the
first major rules violation in Notre Dame history.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly when the NCAA will speak _ and what it will say _ is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it to come sometime during the season,'' Irish coach
Bob Davie said. ``And we'll deal with it when it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Go ahead, take your shot:
</P>
<P>
   Long before Rick Neuheisel checked real estate prices on Lake
Washington, officials from Washington and Colorado agreed to next
month's game in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's move to Seattle _ and the lingering resentment in
Boulder _ makes the Sept. 25 showdown the most intriguing game of
the season, but his gauntlet doesn't end there. It's full of
potential torment and vengeance, as if Shakespeare himself had
scheduled the games.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 18, the Huskies play Air Force, which beat them 45-25
in the Oahu Bowl last year in Jim Lambright's final game as UW
coach.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, the Huskies play archrival Oregon, which lost to
Neuheisel and Colorado in the Aloha Bowl last year in what became
Neuheisel's farewell game. (Neuheisel and Ducks coach Mike Bellotti
haven't liked each other since the 1996 Cotton Bowl, when Bellotti
accused Neuheisel of running up the score.)
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9, Washington faces Oregon State and Dennis Erickson,
the former coach of the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   And on Nov. 13 in the Rose Bowl, Neuheisel meets his alma mater
and former employer, UCLA, for the first time. Although Neuheisel
and Bruins coach Bob Toledo never coached on the same staff, their
paths are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel was an assistant coach in 1994 when he was passed over
for UCLA's vacant offensive coordinator post. Frustrated, he left
Westwood for Boulder and began his climb. The departure vexed
Bruins fans, who considered the bright, dashing Neuheisel the
logical successor to Terry Donahue. The man Donahue hired instead
of Neuheisel: Toledo. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TEN THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne needs 1,717 yards to break
the Division I-A rushing record, set last season by Ricky
Williams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Florida State coach Bobby Bowden needs eight victories to
reach the 300-win plateau. He's scheduled to get the Big One on
Oct. 23, at Clemson. His son, Tommy, will be the opposing coach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. On Dec. 4 in Philadelphia, Army and Navy will play for the
100th time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. The nation's three best players are Florida State receiver
Peter Warrick, Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington and Louisville
quarterback Chris Redman. Give the Heisman Trophy to Warrick. &QL;

CISCO SET TO BUY CERENT, MONTEREY NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)   (Exclusive)  
(mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Cisco Systems Inc., the leading maker of hardware for computer
networks, is expected to announce Thursday that it is acquiring two
privately held companies for about $7.4 billion, people close to
the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions would make Cisco the most visible player in the
fast-growing market for next-generation computer networking
equipment, which makes it easier for customers to send large
volumes of voice and data quickly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cerent Corp., which is based in Petaluma, Calif., and makes
equipment that quickly routes telephone calls and computer data
between old-world copper telephone lines and faster fiber-optic
cables, is being acquired for about $6.9 billion, or 100 million
shares of Cisco common stock, the people close to the deal said.
Monterey Networks, based in Richardson, Texas, is an innovator in
optical cross-connect technology, which makes it easy to move vast
amounts of data over the Internet. It is expected to bring shares
worth $500 million. The boards of each company have met and
approved the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cerent acquisition will be the largest in Cisco's history
and a departure from its strategy of making smaller acquisitions
valued from $50 million to $350 million. Cisco's management has
typically shied away from buying large companies _ in 1996 it
acquired the networking company Stratacom Inc. for $4 billion in
stock _ because of the complexities involved in combining two large
and distinct staffs. Cisco expects to take an after-tax charge of 7
to 11 cents a share for in-process research and development
expenses in the first quarter of the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Cerent was founded in January 1997 in Petaluma, two hours north
of San Francisco, and is backed by several high-profile investors,
including the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers and Cisco Systems. It was initially called
Fiberlane Communications and was the result of an idea of Vinod
Khosla, a partner at Kleiner Perkins and Cerent's chairman. The
company has 287 employees.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the company filed for an initial public offering,
hoping to raise $100 million. But a person close to the companies
said Cerent's management thought the company could grow faster
being a part of Cisco than remaining independent. So on Aug. 11,
Cerent's chief executive, Carl Russo, met with John Chambers, his
counterpart at Cisco, to discuss a combination. Within two weeks,
they struck a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is interested in Cerent's technology because the company's
compact equipment makes it easy to move vast quantities of data, in
effect widening the ``pipes'' that information flows through. One
Cerent box, which is about the size of a microwave, can handle 240
gigabits of information _ or about 4 million telephone calls _
every second. Monterey's wavelength router product, which was
recently introduced in June, complements Cerent's boxes, acting as
a traffic officer for all that data. It is expected that the market
for these new technologies could reach $10 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey was founded in 1997 and employs 130 people. Cisco
invested $15 million in the company earlier this year, getting a
seat on its board. Cisco was also an investor in Cerent, having
paid $13 million for a small stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the companies said both would become part of
Cisco's transport business unit and that Russo and Joe Bass,
Monterey's chief executive, would report to Kevin Kennedy, senior
vice president for the service provider line of business. While
Monterey has no customer base yet for its products, Cerent has
relationships with several companies, including Qwest
Communications International. Most recently, in June, Cerent
announced a $25 million deal to sell high-speed data transport
technology to Williams Communications Group, the long-distance
telephone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cisco rose $2.25 Wednesday, to $68.625.

COURT PROGRAM HELPS CHILDREN AVOID PITFALLS OF POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Donnie Wilson of Kansas City grinned as he
loaded a book bag with free school supplies for 6-year-old Melvin
Rolls on Wednesday at the Don Bosco Center.
</P>
<P>
   Then he promised to help find a business willing to provide free
or discounted eyeglasses to replace the pair Melvin had broken. And
maybe even scrounge up some gym shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical stuff for a social worker. But this social worker is
from the Jackson County prosecutor's office. For about 18 months,
Wilson has worked as an advocate for more than 70 children in an
experimental drug court for fathers who are delinquent on their
child support.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, prosecutors say, represents the beginning of a new
approach in modern prosecution, and Wilson is among the first to
hold this new kind of job. In many ways, he acts as a traffic cop
for families in need, directing single mothers to social service
programs and agencies that can help them with the task of raising a
family on their own.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 men in the yearlong Fathering Project can avoid jail by
such things as job training, substance-abuse treatment and paying
whatever child support they can afford. But prosecutors also see
this as a chance to help poor children at risk for failure _
children more statistically at risk of becoming involved with
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird liked Wilson's work so much
that he used $30,000 in federal grant money to put another child
advocate in the large regular drug court. It handles about 500 drug
offenders, who have about 1,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reach out to these kids and stabilize their
lives,'' Beaird said. ``We've got the opportunity...we see the
warning signs, we're doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach is another new one from Jackson County, which was
among the first to use a drug court in 1993, said Marc Pearce,
senior vice president of the National Association of Drug Court
Professionals in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 600 drug courts are operating or planned, Pearce
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say drug courts _ or those based on the same model that
address child-support delinquencies, domestic violence or other
things _ prevent crime by forcing offenders to complete a year of
treatment and other programs to avoid jail.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes sense from a public policy standpoint, Pearce
said, to try to help children of offenders. He cites studies that
have shown that money spent during their formative years reduces
incarceration rates and health-care costs when those children are
grown.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson knows all that, says it's fine, but says that's not why
he became the prosecutor's first child advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love this job,'' Wilson said. ``I'm having a great
time.''
</P>
<P>
   His job with the court began with a $25,000 private grant, which
would help pay for his 20 hours of work a week. Instead, he often
worked 30 or more, said Jim Nunnelly, administrator for COMBAT, the
county's Community Based Anti-Drug Tax.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who has another full-time job in a group home for
children, said he had grown up in a single-parent family and
understood his clients' problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing he does is meet with the mothers of the children
to find out children's needs for such things as health care, dental
care, day care and recreation. Then he plugs them in to a wide
range of services.
</P>
<P>
   That alone can be difficult, Wilson said. Some mothers are hard
to find and some fear the system and hide. So far, he has reached
only 45 of the more than 70 children.
</P>
<P>
   The 45 children are now covered by health insurance, Nunnelly
said. More than 60 percent benefit from child-support payments that
their legal guardians were not previously receiving, and 75 percent
get visits from their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he takes mothers and fathers who often dislike each
other to quiet, private meetings over fast food and explains that
they must tolerate each other to help their children. He persuades
and cajoles.
</P>
<P>
   He introduces children to fathers they have never seen. One
father who recently met his 3-year-old, Wilson said, started paying
child support and visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's mother, Shelia Herring of Kansas City, said so far she
has not received child support and her son's father has not visited
him, but she praised Wilson's work.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson arranged a Christmas party in which merchants donated
food and space for children to make presents for their parents. He
gets the children into charity programs that give them Christmas
presents.
</P>
<P>
   He sees to it that parents know about things such as churches
that sell used school clothes or the Don Bosco giveaway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who played on the floor with his new school supplies _
wearing the prescription gym goggles that will have to suffice
until he gets his new glasses _ had only one word to say about it
all: ``Wow.''

BARKLEY EVERGREEN SUES COMPETITOR OVER DEPARTURE OF THREE
EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Advertising agency Barkley Evergreen &AMP;
Partners is suing competitor Sullivan Higdon &AMP; Sink over the
departure of three Barkley Evergreen employees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit centers on John January, who joined Sullivan Higdon
in June, followed shortly by Paul Diamond and Tug McTighe. The
three held high-level creative jobs at Barkley Evergreen, as they
do now at Sullivan Higdon.
</P>
<P>
   In their new positions, January is associate creative director,
Diamond is senior art director and McTighe is senior copywriter.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Barkley Evergreen accuses Sullivan Higdon
officials of soliciting and inducing Diamond and McTighe to leave
their jobs with Barkley Evergreen to join January at Sullivan
Higdon. The lawsuit recently was moved to U.S. District Court in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   It also alleges that January was ``intentionally induced'' by
Sullivan Higdon to disclose confidential financial and proprietary
information pertaining to Barkley Evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   Both allegations would be in violation of a confidentiality
agreement January signed when he was hired by Barkley Evergreen in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also alleges that before inducing January to divulge
confidential information and before inducing Diamond and McTighe to
join January, Sullivan Higdon officials knew of the contracts and
agreements the three had signed with their former employer.
</P>
<P>
   Those agreements are standard noncompete forms that employees of
advertising agencies are required to sign upon employment. They
generally prohibit employees from disclosing any confidential
information about the agency or its clients and from soliciting
other employees to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley Evergreen is based in Kansas City. Sullivan Higdon is
based in Wichita, but has an office in the Crossroads Arts District
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan Higdon attorney Daniel Dibble said Wednesday that the
lawsuit was without merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients didn't do any of the bad things that Mr. Rose and
his petition said they did,'' said Dibble, referring to Leonard
Rose, an attorney for Barkley Evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   Dibble said he came to his conclusion after talking with his
clients and looking at documents. However, citing attorney-client
privilege, Dibble declined to say what documents he had examined.
</P>
<P>
   Dibble said it was purely coincidence that January, Diamond and
McTighe all left Barkley Evergreen and joined Sullivan Higdon
within a short period.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The hiring) was all done on an up-and-up, legitimate basis,''
Dibble said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fromm, head of Barkley Evergreen, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we feel the agreements were violated, and we're
going to defend our position,'' Fromm said. ``The suit speaks for
itself.''

 Station Casino's payment of fine wraps up boat-in-moat cases  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri's final casino boat-in-a-moat case
was closed Wednesday when Station Casino Kansas City agreed to pay
a $75,000 fine for replenishing its off-river mooring basin with
city tap water.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Kansas City, the Missouri Gaming Commission also
learned that St. Jo Frontier Casino owner William M. Grace had
purchased 50 percent of a proposed casino near Hannibal, Mo., that
could open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also was told that after one week of open
boarding, admissions at four eastern Missouri casinos jumped 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things are at work here,'' said commission financial
analyst Jim Oberkirsch. ``The patron count is up 34 percent, and
the number of admissions each patron is registering is also up
considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the change, Missouri casinos could allow boarding only
during the first 45 minutes of each two-hour cruise session.
</P>
<P>
   Now patrons can board any time. They can also be present for as
little as two hours and two minutes but actually be counted _ and
the boats taxed _ for three two-hour sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Executive Director Mel Fisher said he expected Kansas
City area boats to offer open boarding in six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Bradley, an assistant attorney general for Missouri,
told commissioners the state was never advised by Station Casinos
Inc. that its riverboat basin was able to tap city water supplies
to maintain proper water levels.
</P>
<P>
   That charge was first leveled during last year's constitutional
battle that challenged whether riverboats moored off-river were
operating legally.
</P>
<P>
   Voters settled that issue in November by retroactively
legalizing off-river casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also erased a requirement that riverboats' off-river
moats be filled by 100 percent river water.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said Wednesday that Station Casino still had to
answer the allegation its water system had violated the old law.
</P>
<P>
   The law now permits riverboat casinos to offer their games of
chance in ``artificial spaces that contain water and that are
within 1,000 feet'' of the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, principal owner of the St. Joseph casino, is now an equal
partner with Ward Sauvage and his Las Vegas-based Sauvage Gas Co.
in a small riverboat casino planned for LaGrange, Mo., near
Hannibal.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvage said Nevada developer Dean Phillips Inc. dropped out of
the deal that has been stalled since the commission granted
preliminary approval in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million project would draw customers mainly from
Hannibal; Quincy, Ill.; and Keokuk, Iowa, Grace said. The off-river
facility would include a restaurant, a lounge, shops and a casino
floor with 450 slot machines and 14 table games.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said a market study indicated that the casino would gross
about $25 million a year, including $16 million from Illinois and
Iowa customers. He compared it to his St. Jo Frontier, which
grosses about $20 million a year from a similar market area.
</P>
<P>
   Grace also is nearing completion of his Lakeside Casino &AMP; Resort
south of Des Moines, Iowa. That $50 million project off Interstate
35 will include a 60-room hotel, conference center, restaurants and
a floating casino that will cruise West Lake near Osceola, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy Riverside Casino agreed to pay a $25,000 fine, concluding
a disciplinary case brought against it in 1995 for unlawfully doing
business with a felon.
</P>
<P>
   When Argosy decided four years ago to fight the charge, it faced
a $5,000 fine for contracting with a vending company owned by
Jackie Dale Norris, who had several illegal-gambling convictions on
his record. In 1993 he was identified by federal authorities in
Kansas City as the head of a local bookmaking ring that took bets
mainly on college and pro football and basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   Norris' J&AMP;J Amusement Co. of Kansas City maintained
coin-operated pool tables in the casino's sports bar.

SHRUGGING OFF PRESSURE, BUSH REGAINS HIS FORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOOSE CREEK, S.C. _ On his first campaign swing since he found
himself besieged by questions about whether he had used cocaine as
a younger man, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seemed unbowed and
unworried Wednesday, making only the subtlest allusions to the
tense events of last week and reconnecting with the loose, relaxed
demeanor that is his hallmark on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the campaigns of personal destruction,'' Bush, a
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, told several
hundred people Wednesday at a rally here, one of several stops he
made around Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   That remark seemed to represent a jab at opponents and reporters
who had hounded him for detailed answers about the extent of his
drug use, if any, in the past, but it was as close as Bush came to
an explicit return to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief conversation with reporters at a hotel in North
Charleston just an hour earlier, Bush was asked about gambling, the
North American Free Trade Agreement and the educational advancement
of minorities, but not once about drugs. His wife, Laura, who had
not been with him last week and does not always campaign with him,
was snug at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his speeches Wednesday by reminding his audience that
he was first and foremost a family man, that Laura Bush understood
that she could never hold a job as important as being a good,
loving mother, and that running a presidential campaign was no more
difficult than rearing his twin 17-year-old daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In a story that Bush has told repeatedly, he said one of the
girls had recently informed him: ``I've been reading about you in
the newspapers. And I've been looking at those polls. You are not
nearly as cool as people think you are.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed possible that the storm of attention to drugs had
blown out to sea, at least for the moment. Bush, 53, has been asked
time and again if he used illegal drugs in the past, and he has
usually answered that he behaved irresponsibly, without giving
details.
</P>
<P>
   When he was pressed anew last week, however, he suggested that
he had not used illegal drugs in the past 25 years. Subsequent
polls showed that neither his responses nor their vagueness were
costing him much support among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Bush began a two-day swing through South Carolina,
which has an early, pivotal primary in February, he did not alter
his usual speech significantly to reflect, or deflect, the trials
of last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs will destroy you,'' he told his audience here, invoking
a frequently used line but giving it no more emphatic a reading
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   He decried the ethic of ``if it feels good, do it,'' and he
called for an era of responsibility in which people accept the
consequences of their bad decisions. He also presented himself as a
principled man who would bring honor to the White House. The
apparent implication was that President Clinton had not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, whatever travails Bush had endured last week were being
transformed by his supporters into jokes with a Democratic punch
line. Introducing Bush at a luncheon Wednesday, Mike Jones,
president of the Rotary Club of Charleston, said the White House
had just released a statement that Clinton never used cocaine _
with Gennifer Flowers.

 Bill would give religious groups more freedom from zoning
restrictions  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As new churches sprout up across the
metropolitan area, Congress is considering a bill that some local
leaders fear would curtail their ability to regulate zoning for
religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House voted 306-118 to pass the Religious
Liberty Protection Act, a law intended to protect religious
activities from being impeded by government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is similar to one passed by Congress in 1993 but thrown
out four years later by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because
it interfered with the right of states to regulate for the health
and welfare of residents.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill was tailored to answer the Supreme Court's
objections. However, the legislation is drawing fire from some
cities and counties, where leaders say it would exempt religious
practices from local laws pertaining to things such as child abuse,
drug enforcement and employee safety.
</P>
<P>
   More important to residents is the prospect that the proposed
law would exempt religious organizations from zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law doesn't specifically exempt churches from such
laws. But it says that governments may not apply land use
restrictions in a way that imposes a substantial burden on a
religious practice unless there is a compelling governmental
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that churches could use the law to challenge zoning
ordinances that might require more land for parking or buffers to
protect neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big stick to be able to go directly into federal
court with a federal cause of action, circumventing all the state
and local appeals processes,'' said Susan Parnas, senior
legislative counsel for the National League of Cities.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law is particularly relevant to the Kansas City
area, which in the last year has witnessed a church construction
boom totaling about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some new churches or church expansions have sent nearby
residents to City Hall to voice concerns about the effect on their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many churches where we have had to use our
authority to restrict their growth and suggest changes to
development plans to better accommodate neighborhoods,'' Overland
Park, Kan., City Councilman Neil Sader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we keep local authority over those
applications. A one-size-fits-all law out of Washington doesn't fit
well into Overland Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill say the intent is to drive discrimination
out of the land-use process.
</P>
<P>
   Discriminatory application of zoning laws is ``the single most
pervasive government intrusion on religious freedom in this country
today,'' said Steven McFarland, general counsel for the Christian
Legal Society. ``It gives government virtually unfettered authority
based on very subjective considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress, McFarland cited several examples,
including one in which an Orthodox rabbi in Miami was threatened
with prosecution for leading morning and evening prayers in a
converted garage in a residential area.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the bill contend that a 1990 U.S. Supreme
Court decision undermined religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1990, courts had traditionally held that government had
to show a compelling state interest _ health or public safety, for
example _ for any regulation that created a significant burden on a
religious belief or practice.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990, the court refused to apply that standard when it
ruled that Oregon did not have to rewrite its drug laws to allow
American Indians to use peyote during religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Congress responded with the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act, which tried to write the ``compelling interest''
standard into law.
</P>
<P>
   But that law was struck down, prompting Congress to respond with
the bill now pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill include the Clinton administration, the
civil liberties group People for the American Way, the Christian
Coalition and various church-advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Democratic Rep. Dennis Moore of Lenexa said the bill
would strike a balance between the religious rights of individuals
and the rights of local governments.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't think Congress intended to strip local zoning
boards of their ability to control land use. He said ]he thought
the proposed law would merely restore the rules that the courts
applied to religious freedom before 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see that it's any great, major change,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Democratic Rep. Karen McCarthy of Kansas City said the
bill would not exempt churches from zoning laws. She said the bill
was intended to stop local government from using laws to
discriminate against churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people don't want a nontraditional church to
establish in their community,'' McCarthy said. ``So they use the
zoning laws to try to restrict that.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill, which include the National League of
Cities and the National Association of Counties, say it would lead
to litigation against local governments
</P>
<P>
   Few cities or counties in the Kansas City area have taken a
position on the bill.

 THE CAPITALIST PIG HAS STUCK FORBES ON A SPIT
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAN FOST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
The Capitalist Pig has beaten the Capitalist Tool.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Hoenig, a 23-year-old entrepreneur from Chicago,
dispenses financial advice to Gen-Xers under the name Capitalist
Pig. He has a book, a Web site, a column in POV magazine, a
newsletter and a radio show, and he plans to start a hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine, which calls itself the Capitalist Tool, has
been around since 1917 but this year started beefing up its Web
site at www.forbes.com.
</P>
<P>
   To call attention, Forbes launched a national billboard campaign
of irreverent ads, including one showing a young man, baseball cap
on backward, with the phrase, ``21-year-old, pizza-eating,
parent-mocking, software-company-owning capitalist pig.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads appeared in the San Francisco Bay Area and other cities.
Although Forbes is based in New York, it has a significant presence
here, with publisher Rich Karlgaard based in Burlingame, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, some people thought the capitalist pig in the
ads was Hoenig. So Hoenig sued.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were ``directly being targeted toward a younger audience
and the youth market,'' Hoenig said. ``That's the constituency I
serve. It felt a little too close for comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoenig isn't swinish enough to suggest he invented the term
``capitalist pig,'' which probably has been around since before
Karl Marx. But he did get a trademark for the name, and then Forbes
came in and ``stepped into my mix and were not even giving me my
props. I said, `All right. I will see you in court.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk one up for the Pig. After Hoenig filed suit in federal
court in Chicago, Forbes pulled the ads. ``Forbes is working with
Mr. Hoenig on a swift and amicable settlement,'' said Monie Begley,
a Forbes spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   SHE'S BACK: Gina Smith, who left the Bay Area in 1996, is doing
the unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   She has left ABC News, where she served as a technology
correspondent on highly rated shows such as ``Nightline'' and
``Good Morning America,'' and moved to San Francisco to be a host
of a new show that Cnet is producing.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Cnet's News.com,'' will air from 1 to 2 p.m. Sundays
on CNBC starting in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it made sense covering tech from New York,''
said Smith, 33. ``They think it's the center of the world. But you
can't just run out to dinner with Larry Ellison.''
</P>
<P>
   The show will have an investment focus, which is a departure for
the geeky Cnet. ``We'll be making recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   She made the move because her contract with ABC was up. ``It
seems like the networks are dinosaurs,'' she said. ``Here I am,
covering this industry and watching it grow, and I want to be a
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She's hoping she can return to network television through CNBC's
parent, NBC. And she'll keep writing her column in the Sunday San
Francisco Examiner and doing her show on the ABC radio network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Martha Stewart of computers,'' she said, ``but nicer.
Cooler. Younger.''
</P>
<P>
   HERRING HORS D'OEUVRES: Talk about convergence. Red Herring has
a magazine, a Web site, a conference business and a television
strategy. And now, it also has a natural place to party: Red
Herring restaurant, on Steuart Street in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, members of the digerati have to eat, too.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, which used to be called Roti, is not connected
to the company, but you wouldn't know it from the way execs and
advertisers schmoozed over fish cakes and little cones of lobster
salad at a party last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rip-off artists stole our name, so we're having a party
here and making everybody think we own the place,'' said Tony
Perkins, founder of Red Herring, the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The mag has something to celebrate: a roster of new columnists.
It inked Dominick Donald from the London Times and signed a few
other businesspeople to new roles as pundits. Idealab Chairman Bill
Gross and Be Chairman Jean-Louis Gassee will face off each month in
a tech-biz point-counterpoint. Venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson,
former Vignette Chairman Ross Garber, pioneering designer Roger
Black and Global Business Network Chairman Peter Schwartz will pen
monthly columns.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Jason Pontin said the additions reflect a broadening
scope for the magazine, which once targeted only venture
capitalists and technology executives, and now is gunning for
people who work in all fields but want to stay up on technology.
</P>
<P>
   It's a niche that the Industry Standard, Business 2.0 and Fast
Company first identified, but Pontin thinks those pubs are either
too trade-oriented or too mass-market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our category to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pontin will need to keep an eye on his columnists because
they're coming from the world of business instead of journalism.
``By and large, I will not permit them to write about companies
they're investing in, and if they do, I will disclose it in a way
that will make Brill blush,'' he said, referring to media watchdog
Steven Brill.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I'm not entirely uncomfortable that they will
write about trends that they believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Herring does not allow its employees &UR;  &LR; to write about
companies in which they hold stock. Pontin invests only in mutual
funds but said, ``I couldn't retain my staff if, in the largest
boom market in history, I told them they couldn't own stock at all.
That's unreasonable.''

NORTH KOREA   AGREES TO TALKS   WITH U.S. AIDE   ON MISSILE TEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, South Korea , Japan, Alaska, Hawaii)   By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a promising sign that a resolution might be
closer in the standoff between North Korea and the United States
over North Korea's suspected preparations to test a new long-range
ballistic missile, the two sides have agreed to meet early next
month in Europe, the Clinton administration said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. special envoy, Charles Kartman, will lead a delegation
of U.S. diplomats and the North Koreans will send their deputy
foreign minister, Kim Gye Gwan, for four days of talks in Berlin
starting on Sept. 7, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are to be held about the time when the administration
expected that the North Koreans might stage the test of the new
Taepodong 2 rocket. North Korea will mark the 50th anniversary of
Communist rule next month and some analysts have suggested that the
test of the missile, which theoretically has the capacity to reach
Alaska or Hawaii, would be staged as part of the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   As the possible test loomed, the United States, South Korea and
Japan have shown an unusually high degree of diplomatic
coordination in condemning North Korea and pledging to slow down
food and oil assistance if the test is carried out. This month,
Japan and the United States also agreed to conduct joint research
on a missile-defense system that in theory could destroy incoming
ballistic missiles from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were cautious Wednesday in forecasting
what, if anything, might come out of the talks in Berlin. But they
noted recent, relatively conciliatory statements from Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs that North Korea wants to improve relations,''
a senior official involved in the policy said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was also encouraged that North Korea had
invited a correspondent from Cable News Network to report from the
country this month, the first such opening to Western television.
</P>
<P>
   There was also some suggestion Wednesday that the North Koreans
were showing interest in proposals laid out in June by a U.S.
envoy, former Defense Secretary William J. Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Perry essentially offered the lifting of some trade sanctions
and the beginning of a formal recognition of North Korea in return
for a halt to its testing of missiles and an end to its export of
missile technology to the Middle East and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have been briefed on Perry's proposals,
but they have not been made public. Washington officials have been
monitoring the activities at the North Korean launching site by
satellite.

58 ARRESTED IN SMUGGLING OF DRUGS ON AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add 7 grafs to end of original material, bgng  ` American,
because ...' ; changes `he' to `Halley' in first sentence after
optional trim.)  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The smugglers moved with ease through Miami
International Airport and even made their way onto American
Airlines planes parked at the gates, stashing heroin in coffee
containers in the planes' galleys and hiding cocaine and marijuana
in suitcases in the jets' baggage holds, a federal indictment filed
Wednesday charged. Once, they even agreed to stash on board three
hand grenades, as carry-on baggage.
</P>
<P>
   As they went about their illegal business, in plain sight of
passengers and airport security officers, federal investigators
said, the smugglers did not worry about being caught by the
airline. They were the airline.
</P>
<P>
   In the culmination of a sting operation that exposed
embarrassing security lapses by both the airline and the airport,
federal agents arrested more than 50 American Airlines baggage
handlers and food contract workers Wednesday morning, charging them
in multiple indictments of conspiracy, importation and distribution
of drugs, and weapons trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation, which first came to light two years ago
when an American Airlines pilot was accidentally served a mixture
of coffee and heroin from a smuggled parcel and complained that it
``tasted weird,'' was more than just a drug crime, said
investigators. It put passengers at risk, said Ed Halley, a
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs, the investigation showed, were hidden in overhead
compartments, the small metal food carts the flight attendants use,
wall panels, bathrooms, kitchen areas, cargo holds and _ more
ominously _ inside the wheel bays on American planes, said Halley.
``This compresses against cables and wiring,'' he said of the drug
shipments. ``If cocaine shifts, and breaks a wire, you're in big
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, what if the pilots had been poisoned by the
heroin in the coffee. ``Who flies the plane?''
</P>
<P>
   In a predawn raid at the airport and at the homes of dozens of
American Airlines ramp workers, baggage handlers and contract
workers, federal agents arrested 58 people in all, including two
agents with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, a
Customs inspector and an off-duty employee at the Broward County
Sheriff's Department, who worked as a baggage handler.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, some 50 people had been indicted on narcotics and
weapons charges in a two-pronged operation that targeted employees
of LSG/Sky Chefs, a food service contractor owned by Lufthansa
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were convinced we could basically get anything on the
planes,'' said U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott, whose office led the
operation. The baggage handlers and food service workers apparently
had no difficulty in finding and removing the hidden drugs, under
the noses of other employees and airport security.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the airport, said Scott, was ``obviously
insufficient to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The accused smugglers went to work on their off days, in
uniform, to help find the hidden drugs and re-ship them, and were
rarely questioned why they just showed up on work crews,
investigators said. They operated with surprising arrogance, said
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people make $17,18,19 an hour with their regular jobs
and they still weren't satisfied,'' said Halley. ``They were
extremely confident individuals. It was no big deal at all for
them. We obviously were not their only clients. They said, `If
you've got the money, we'll get it through.'
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the American employees carried the drugs themselves, Halley
said, ``they used their American Airlines IDs, got past the ticket
counter and weren't asked any questions by ticket agents typically
asked to a normal passenger, like, if anyone had given them
something to take on board. Then, they passed security, loaded
their stuff on American Airline's baggage carriers and flew on free
flights.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline, in a prepared statement, said that ``while we are
disturbed that a small group of employees was part of this
smuggling ring, their activities have been under federal government
and company surveillance for quite some time. We will continue our
efforts with law enforcement officials to stem the flow of illegal
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said it was not a case of a few rogue
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they had was a very elaborate scheme for aiding in the
distribution of narcotics and weapons,'' said Halley. ``For a
price, they would bypass security and deliver anything that was
paid for to a person who was paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than regarding the arrests as a wake-up call to American
Airlines that it needs to be be more vigilant, a company spokesman,
Chris Chiames, said the airline viewed it as confirmation that it
was doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got numerous programs and surveillance programs in place
regarding people who have access to airport facilities,'' said
Chiames. ``We view these kind of incidents as proof that the
programs work.''
</P>
<P>
   No American managers or pilots were arrested in Miami. But eight
other people, including seven American employees, were arrested in
eastern New York state in a related case, and 10 Colombians were
arrested over the weekend in Cali, Colombia, on drug charges that
included allegations that they used American Airlines flights to
smuggle more than a half ton of heroin and cocaine to Miami over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   American, a respected foreign carrier, was used by smugglers in
Cali because ``its planes were not subjected to as rigorous
inspections as occurs with Colombian airlines,'' according to a
statement from the Colombian government. The drugs, according to
that statement, were hidden in the planes' tail sections, in
electrical compartments and behind the pilots' seats.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the arrests in Colombia were related to the
U.S. arrests, but federal officials here did say that Colombian law
enforcement officials had helped in their operation at the Miami
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Halley said undercover agents had also paid to have guns and
even military explosives _ fake _ smuggled on board by employees
who had no qualms about placing even grenades in the overhead bin.
</P>
<P>
   `` We approached them during one transaction and asked them to
carry three hand grenades and a loaded pistol and they had
absolutely no problem with it,'' said Halley. ``The only thing they
were concerned about was their own safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Halley said they charged $7,000 for delivery of guns and $1,500
per kilogram of cocaine, in 38 different transactions during the
sting operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents did not know how many drug and weapons shipments
were made before the sting operation, with its bogus drugs and
guns, were planned, but they said the smuggling operation was
already in full force by the time they began their operation.
</P>
<P>
   The use of commercial jets to smuggle drugs is an industry-wide
problem, said investigators. In July 1997, 12 Delta Airlines
employees were indicted on charges of trying to smuggle some $1
million in cocaine from Cali.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something unique to American Airlines,'' said
Halley. ``This kind of thing is most likely happening on other
airlines as well. This is only the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   American, because it serves Latin America far more than any
other U.S. airline, is more vulnerable, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, drug agents in Puerto Rico arrested an
American Airlines ramp agent, saying he tried to smuggle 200 pounds
of cocaine into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, federal agents in Miami arrested six American Airlines
mechanics on drug charges after the mechanics allegedly smuggled a
half-ton of cocaine and heroin into the United States by hiding the
drugs behind wall panels.
</P>
<P>
   And in March 1996, mechanics found 64 pounds of drugs stuffed
behind panels of an American Airlines plane at Dallas-Fort Worth
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, American Airlines signed what is called the ``super
carrier agreement'' with the Customs Service in which it said it
would toughen security procedures in countries like Colombia and
Peru, where much of the drugs originate. In return, the Customs
Service agreed not to impound the airline's planes. ``We committed
extra resources and manpower to go above and beyond what Customs
had done previously,'' said Chiames, the airline's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Boynton, the former head of security at American Airlines
who retired in 1993, said keeping drugs off planes ``is an almost
impossible task,'' and added, ``What you try to do is put enough
procedures in place to reduce the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Those procedures broke down at Miami International. Scott, the
U.S. attorney, said the employees accused of the smuggling just
showed up at work, unexplained, and, flashing their identification
badges, had free run of one of the nation's busiest airports.

GUENTHER CHOOSES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC received an oral commitment Wednesday night
from tight end Gregg Guenther of Taft High (in the Woodland Hills
section of L.A.).
</P>
<P>
   Guenther, who is 6-foot-8 and 260 pounds, selected USC over
Arizona State, Washington and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an athlete. He has fine motor skills for his size,'' Taft
coach Troy Starr said. ``He's really a skilled player who's that
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said Guenther has a lot of growth potential and will end
up playing tackle in college. Guenther has even played some wide
receiver for Taft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good decision,'' Starr said of Guenther's choice.
``It's close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenther is USC's sixth commitment this year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Grain wins back spot: In the first shakeup of the offensive
line, senior Jason Grain has reclaimed the starting right guard
position from redshirt freshman Zach Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Grain, who lost 30 pounds in the summer, had been passed by
Wilson in spring practice but has impressed the coaching staff in
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the change after (Tuesday's) scrimmage,'' offensive
line coach Steve Greatwood said. ``Right now, I feel Jason has the
edge in experience over Zach. Jason has been very, very motivated
this summer. It's been close and it still continues to be close.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Wide receiver Marcell Allmond underwent X-rays
after injuring his foot in practice, but it was diagnosed as turf
toe and is not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Troy Polamalu suffered a hip flexor and has been out
several days. Defensive end Lonnie Ford, who has been out with a
sprained ankle, is expected back by Sunday. Also expected back
Sunday from ankle injuries are Bernard Riley, Aaron Williams and
Omar Nazel.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Miguel Fletcher of Alemany suffered an ankle sprain
in practice Wednesday and probably will be out several days.
</P>
<P>
   Another minor injury occurred when linebacker Henry Wallace
suffered a slight stomach pull.
</P>
<P>
   __ Two-deep due: Coach Paul Hackett said he will release his
depth chart today. Other than Grain, few major changes are expected
in the starting lineup, although Markus Steele might have moved
into the No. 1 spot at weakside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   __ Etc.: Freshman offensive lineman Norman Katnik has moved to
tight end for this season. He will be redshirted but is considered
an emergency backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 240 pounds, (he's) more tight-end oriented than guard,''
Hackett said. ``He will grow into a guard.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   USC believes after a preliminary consultation with the
Pacific-10 Conference that tailback Petros Papadakis has a good
chance for a redshirt year. The NCAA will make the final decision.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Former walk-on linebacker Rocky Seto has been hired as a
graduate assistant coach.

EDITORIAL: WHAT THE APOLLO MEANS FOR HARLEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, August 26:
</P>
<P>
   Harlem was once the center of life for the African-American
middle class and a storied gathering place for artists, writers and
musicians. Middle-class flight, business closings and the urban
disorders of the 1960s robbed the district of its grandeur and have
presented a formidable challenge to private entrepreneurs and
government agencies that have been striving to restore Harlem as a
desirable place to live and work in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   No institution personifies Harlem's problems _ or its promise _
more clearly than the Apollo Theater, a music venue whose name is
recognized around the world but whose management has consistently
failed to maximize the theater's value or keep it in good working
order. In addition, the board that now runs the theater has been
sued by the state attorney general, who has accused it of
questionable fiscal practices over a period of several years.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is owned by the state but operated by the nonprofit
Apollo Theater Foundation. The suit accused the foundation's board
of failing to collect millions of dollars owed it by Percy Sutton,
a businessman and former Manhattan borough president, whose company
produces a weekly variety program for television at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, has offered the Apollo a
chance at commercial success _ and a way out of legal trouble _
saying he will drop the lawsuit if the foundation's board yields
control to the entertainment giant Time Warner. The agreement
requires Sutton and associates to pay the foundation about $700,000
and stipulates that the foundation expand its board, giving Time
Warner power to appoint the majority of the members. Charles
Rangel, Harlem's Democratic congressman, would also be required to
step down as the board's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the relevant parties seemed to have agreed on a
settlement that would bring the theater a fresh infusion of both
cash and talent and get Spitzer to put aside the suit. But the
settlement was derailed by some of the board's more powerful
members. As the current chairman, Rangel has a special
responsibility to put aside political gamesmanship and sign this
agreement promptly. Time Warner has threatened to abandon the deal
if there are more shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   If the settlement goes through smoothly, Harlem's commercial
area could get a boost that might entice other companies to follow
Time Warner's lead. But if the board drags its feet or the deal
falls through, the negative fallout could harm both the Apollo and
the prospects for an economic recovery along Harlem's business
strip, 125th Street. Put another way, the deal sets the tone for
the entire revitalization effort.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: THOUGHTS OF AN ATHLETE PEAKING YOUNG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ One year ago, in the final game of Little
League Baseball's World Series, the reserve outfielder Chris
Cardone _ who had hit only one home run in his entire Little League
career _ came off the bench to hit two. His tie-breaking home run
in the last inning lifted the U.S. champion Toms River to a 12-9
victory over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days the Toms River players, and especially
Chris, achieved the height of superstardom available to
12-year-olds. They signed autographs until their hands ached. They
went on Rosie O'Donnell's show and took the field at Yankee Stadium
with the players. Chris himself appeared on David Letterman and in
People magazine, and received letters from around the world and a
marriage proposal from a Toms River girl, although she was only 7.
</P>
<P>
   This week Toms River is the favorite to repeat as world
champion, a staggering feat considering that only 2 of its 12
players were on last year's squad, and that the team is made up of
all-stars from only one of three leagues in the town, an East Toms
River league for players with last names beginning with the letters
A to J. Toms River has beaten all three other American teams, and
will replay Phenix City, Ala., in the American final Thursday
night. The winner of that game will play in the world final on
Saturday against the best foreign team.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, who at 13 has graduated to Junior League play, has been
watching the Little League championship games on television in his
basement with a friend. He is as baffled as the rest of the town by
Toms River's uncanny success. ``We practice more than they do in
other places'' is his best guess.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in February the town opened a new indoor batting cage
and pitching lanes to allow its Little Leaguers to practice during
the winter. But some players were already outside. Chris Keiper, an
11-year-old watching Tuesday's game with his family in a Toms River
sports bar called Mugsy's, said that his coach held outdoor
practices in March.
</P>
<P>
   Others credit the coach, Mike Gaynor, who should have some major
league managers looking over their shoulders, and what people here
call an unusual level of town and parental involvement. The
pressure this puts on 12-year-olds intensifies accordingly. When an
opposing pitcher was seen to cry during Tuesday's game, several
people in Mugsy's commented, with pride, that no Toms River player
would do that.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cardone thought that was the wrong attitude. ``If you've
got to cry, you cry,'' he said simply.
</P>
<P>
   He seems mature enough to realize that he is still immature. He
knows that the world embraced him in large part because he was not
a star but a bench player who fulfilled every ordinary child's
fantasy. Fame was fun, but it got wearing. ``Everyone wanted a
piece of him,'' said his father, Bill, and Chris said he found
autograph-signing so onerous that he doesn't like to ask other
players for them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about the experience was the camaraderie,'' he
says. ``I have all these memories of being with my friends that
week before the final.''
</P>
<P>
   As he watches a new Toms River team, Chris does wish he could
replay last summer, but only so he could concentrate more on
enjoying the game and less on missing Bill and his mother, Lucy,
during his three weeks of travel. He had never even spent a night
away from home before, and while they were present at games and
practices, parents were barred from the players' dorms. They gave
him a journal and told him to write down his thoughts, a process
his father says helped Chris deal with the death of his grandmother
just after the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the homesickness Chris had suffered was apparent when a
post-championship interviewer asked if he wanted Mark McGwire or
Sammy Sosa to win the 1998 home run race. ``Sosa,'' Lucy remembers
Chris saying, ``because he is so far away from his home.''

 &HT;    Braves sweep Reds into rear view
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This Red hot series turned out to be most everything
but. The Braves' 5-2 victory Wednesday was just the final straw.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, the team with the best road record in baseball,
ducked out of Turner Field the loser of three games in a row and
0-6 there this season. After winning nine consecutive series and
battling the Astros for the National League Central lead, they head
to Montreal looking a lot more like wild-card contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, meanwhile, sucked up two more injuries and tacked on
three more victories, giving them a season-high seven wins in a row
and a two-game lead in the NL East over the Mets, who played
Houston Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're worried about the wild card,'' said Tom
Glavine, who held the Reds to two runs in seven innings to earn the
win. ``Our intention is to win our division.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have played like it, winning nine of their past 11
games. They've won nine in a row at Turner Field dating to an Aug.
8 loss to the Giants, including a perfect six-game homestand with
sweeps over the Padres and Reds, their first such feat since July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Does that year ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are situations that bring out the best of everybody,''
Glavine said. ``This team has always been good with its back
against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   With Greg Maddux lost for a start and Rudy Seanez gone for at
least 15 days, the Braves went back to work Wednesday against
former teammate Denny Neagle, who was traded in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle gave up three hits and three runs in the first inning on
a two-out, two-strike home run to Andruw Jones, which bounced on
and over the top of the left-field wall, beyond outfielder Greg
Vaughn's feeble attempt at reaching it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones got two more hits to pace the Braves on offense, but his
24th home run of the year and the 3-1 lead it provided turned out
to be all Glavine (11-9) needed to move two games over .500 for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't blown anybody out,'' Chipper Jones said. ``We've
been playing good team ball. That starts with pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nowhere to go but up,'' said Glavine, who's 8-2 over his
past 15 starts.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When they say U.S. Open, this must be what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   Front-row seats are there for the taking, close enough to lean
over the court fence, reach out and put a hand on the shoulder of
the guy barking ``Fault!'' (Probably not the best idea.) Stretch
out, put your feet up on the bleachers, lie back and catch a ray;
there's plenty of room.
</P>
<P>
   You can sidle up next to coaches and parents of the players,
offer some unsolicited tips. Competitors themselves are wandering
around between matches, available for handshakes _ if you recognize
them. (Hint: They're the folks with multiple racquets.) There are
no lines at the few concessions stands that are ready for business.
Parking is free.
</P>
<P>
   The real Open starts on Monday, but this week there are
qualifying rounds _ known to insiders as ``the qualies'' _ in which
256 men and women compete for 32 slots in the most important tennis
tournament in America. Before the big names start playing, before
the ladies in the wide-brimmed hats fill the corporate boxes,
die-hard tennis fans by the thousands flock to Flushing
Meadows-Corona Park, streaming through the open gates to watch
top-notch tennis for the cost of a subway ride.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of New York's best-kept secrets, a late-summer
tradition for those in the know.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 15,000 fans watched the qualifying rounds.
On opening day Tuesday, the count was 2,249. Crowds typically build
through the week until the final rounds on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever tennis is played, that's where I like to be,'' said
Ronald Fieulleteau, dressed head to toe in tennis white and perched
under a beige umbrella to block the sun. ``I haven't missed a year
since I can't remember when. When they started the qualies.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieulleteau began watching tennis when he was 15, peering
through the chain-links at a court near his home in the Bronx. Now
87, glaucoma having stolen the sight from his right eye, he still
swings a racquet a few times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of difficulty in finding the ball, but I
go out and I try,'' he said, a yellow plastic sun shield protecting
both his bad and good eyes. ``If I had two eyes, I would be playing
the 85s,'' he added, referring to age-specific tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The stands at the qualies are dotted _ with people like
Fieulleteau. Tennis people.
</P>
<P>
   There are wannabes, like the kids in matching T-shirts from
Alliance Junior Tennis camp in Roosevelt, N.Y. There are
once-weres, like Martin Wostenholme, who was on the other side of
the fence for a half-dozen Open qualifiers, and even made it to the
main draw once, only to be knocked out by John McEnroe in the
second round. Then there are the dreamers, the folks who fill the
country clubs and the public parks and are here, watching, in hopes
of picking up a few pointers for their own pathetic little games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could play for one game _ for four points _ what these
players do all day long,'' mused Paul Teicher of Queens, as he
watched Mike Bryan, a comer from California, beat Ofer Sela of
Israel. Looking around at the nearly empty stands, he added, ``A
lot of people are missing out on a lot of fun. Free fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Good tennis, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan and Sela went to tie breakers in both sets Tuesday (in
qualifying rounds, both men and women play best of three), with the
American coming from behind to eke out a 7-6 victory in the second
tie breaker after the Israeli double-faulted.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse crowd cheered good points by either player equally.
Fieulleteau favored Sela, because he saw him play last week in a
tournament in the Bronx. Anne Smythe and Katherine Hand, a few rows
away, were rooting for the hometown boy, because they remembered
him and his twin brother, Bobby, from last year's qualies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smythe, a sixth-grade teacher, and Ms. Hand, a 72-year-old
retired government worker, play tennis once a week in Rockville
Centre. Once a year, they pack lunches in a cooler and head for the
Open. The finals, they watch on television. The qualies are their
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, we were the only two people in the stands,'' Ms. Smythe
recalled. ``The player rightfully complained, those two women are
talking. We were deep in the middle of a gossipy conversation. We
get that in, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is casual, with people free to talk quietly and
move about the stands _ or even from court to court _ which is next
to impossible during the crowded Open. Buzz filters up when stars
are practicing on courts with a view.
</P>
<P>
   But most are just as happy to watch Paradorn Srichaphan of
Thailand play Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina, as long as that
little yellow ball keeps going back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recognize any of these names,'' admitted May Massa,
65. ``I can't pronounce them, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who can get tickets to the main draw say the qualies
have a certain magic. For the big matches during the tournament
proper, fans sit in a vast stadium, most high up on the second or
third tier. This week, they're practically in the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a pleasure to be down here, to hear the grunts and
groans and the squeak of the sneakers,'' said Mrs. Massa, who lives
_ and plays _ in Merrick, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to sit this close, where they're serving right into
your face,'' agreed Doug Monaghan, 48, a high school assistant
principal who was seated a few benches from Mrs. Massa and her
husband, Ray. ``You see what 125 miles an hour is. That's the only
way we'll get to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the players, the qualifying rounds are a shot at not only
celebrity, but also cash. A loss in the first round of qualifying
pays $3,000, and a berth in the main draw guarantees a player a
minimum of $10,000. (Winners of the Open get a $750,000 purse.)
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of kids making their debuts, like Marty Fish,
17, of Vero Beach, Fla., who is deciding whether to go pro or maybe
compete in college. Then there are old-timers like Ronald Agenor,
34, a Haitian who was ranked 28th in the world in 1988 and seems
uninterested in quitting, even though he is just one year away from
qualifying for the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Other players getting attention this year include Max Mirnyi of
Belarus, who took home the mixed-doubles trophy with Serena
Williams at Wimbledon and the Open last year, and Xavier Malisse, a
Belgian called the Dennis Rodman of tennis because he dyed his hair
different colors for each round of a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   These players do not arrive in limousines. They carry their own
bags. Three of them were happy to sign a dozen tennis balls for the
7- to 11-year-olds from the Creek Club in Locust Valley, N.Y., even
though an hour later, the fans had to consult the list of players
to recall whose autographs they had received.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Arvelia Myers, who runs the Pyramid Tennis Association in
Harlem, says the frantic first two days of the qualifying rounds,
with 64 matches each, are her favorite part of the tournament,
because no one has yet disappeared. ``I don't know what the finals
is for _ it's not for me,'' she said. ``By the time you get to the
finals, you've seen some of the finest tennis. It's a wrap-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Myers was seated high on a bleacher in
the shade under a straw hat, watching Erica Adams of the United
States fall to Tina Krizan of Slovakia, 6-2, 6-4. Next to her was
her racquet. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go anywhere without it,'' she explained. ``I really
don't like watching tennis. I prefer to play.''

EDITORIAL: JAPAN DISCOVERS DEFENSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, August 26:
</P>
<P>
   Japan is slowly overcoming decades of reticence about building
and using military forces. This change in attitude carries
important implications for Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite defense spending of more than $40 billion a year,
Japan's military strength remains limited. Tokyo relies mainly on
U.S. power and U.S. forces based in Japan, South Korea and the
Western Pacific to keep its territory and the surrounding region
safe from hostile attack. Japan has no nuclear weapons of its own
and no ability to transport its forces by air or sea beyond its
immediate area. Its troops have not engaged in combat since World
War II, and its Constitution bars waging war or threatening to use
military force. Only in the past decade have Japanese forces taken
part in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and then only in noncombat
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Tokyo has shown a new willingness to stand
up to North Korean bullying, deflect criticism from China and
involve itself in regional defense arrangements. Japan's military
alliance with Washington remains the centerpiece of its security
planning. Wisely, Tokyo and Washington are moving to update the
alliance to give Japan a more explicit military role in responding
to regional crises, like tensions on the Korean Peninsula. As it
expands its military vision, Tokyo must be careful to avoid being
drawn into a destructive arms race with China.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's new assertiveness on defense is a healthy development
that should not alarm other Asian countries. More than 50 years
after the end of World War II, it is appropriate for Tokyo to cast
off some of the inhibitions stemming from its earlier record of
aggression and conquest. Japan is now committed to democracy and is
unlikely to repeat that violent history, especially if it maintains
a close partnership with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several Japanese moves in recent weeks illustrate the new mood.
These include a joint naval training exercise with South Korea, a
new agreement to collaborate with Washington on developing advanced
missile defenses, and plans for building a Japanese spy satellite.
Japanese political leaders have also begun to talk with greater
directness about their country's defense needs. Meanwhile, serious
discussion has begun about easing Japan's strict constitutional
restrictions on using military force. Japan's Parliament recently
voted to restore official status to the country's old Rising Sun
flag and former national anthem. Both long predate World War II,
and for all but a handful of right-wingers, their revival
represents a return to tradition, not to imperial ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is the immediate source of Japan's defense
anxieties. Last year Pyongyang fired a medium-range missile over
Japanese airspace without advance warning, exposing Japan's
vulnerability to missile attack. Japanese leaders are also uneasy
about China. For decades, Tokyo has sought friendly relations and
economic cooperation with Beijing. But China has recently seemed
less receptive to Japanese overtures and has stirred new worries
with its own missile testing and warlike talk about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the world's second-largest economic power, and nobody
should expect it to remain aloof to matters involving its own
defense. As Tokyo starts finding its way to a new military role, it
must continue coordinating its defense policies closely with
Washington.

HORRY IS MAN IN NEW POWER PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Charles Oakley isn't coming. Lorenzen Wright
probably never was. Dennis Rodman? He'll have to post bail before
the Los Angeles Lakers can even consider him.
</P>
<P>
   So meet their new power forward, same as the old power forward.
</P>
<P>
   He should look familiar _ 6-foot-10, 235 pounds, athletic,
smart, averaged a respectable 7.5 rebounds and 7.4 points per game
in his last full season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry's name might only be etched in pencil, but as of
today he leads the Lakers' power-forward-by-committee now that
Oakley is on the verge of re-signing with the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won 61 games a year ago (1997-98) with Robert Horry as our
starting power forward. I think everyone has forgotten that,'' West
said Wednesday. ``Robert Horry is a very good player. When we
become more active (in the offense) again, the little things he
does, this new system should help him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, Horry will flourish in new coach Phil Jackson's
offense. Possibly, Travis Knight will mature and provide some depth
behind him. Maybe that's enough. But Horry is undersized for the
position. And no one on the Lakers' roster has the experience,
toughness and defensive prowess of Oakley, the Lakers' prime target
this offseason. (Though it is worth noting that Oakley's statistics
last season were almost identical to Horry's of '97-98.)
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the Lakers have little choice but to convince
themselves of Horry's viability. The free-agent market for power
forwards is sadly lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley spurned their $2 million offer to take a three-year, $18
million deal in Toronto. Wright, the former Clipper, was signed and
traded to Atlanta after using the Lakers as leverage. J.R. Reid,
who finished last season as the Lakers' starter, signed with
Milwaukee. Rodman is a last resort who has nevertheless moved up a
few slots. Vin Baker has returned to Seattle and Charles Barkley
will do the same in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? Dickey Simpkins. Marty Conlon. Pete Chilcutt.
</P>
<P>
   West's next move might be to bring back former Laker Corie
Blount _ perhaps the best of what's left _ to add some depth. But
there are no proven starters available.
</P>
<P>
   A trade is unlikely. Sources said the Raptors rejected an offer
of Horry and Sean Rooks for Oakley in a sign-and-trade deal, and
the Lakers turned down the Raptors' request for Glen Rice. The
Lakers have been similarly frustrated in other trade scenarios. So
the duties fall to Horry, barring a major surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hopeful to do something,'' West said. ``We need
role players who can do the dirty work-type things. We're not
looking for another star-type player. . . . We want some bigger
bodies that have been around a bit that can play a role for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley fits that description. But the idea of him taking the
Lakers' $2 million exception was always a stretch and West said he
never got his hopes up. But he also didn't hide his disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been a positive influence on our team, but there
was no way that was going to happen without a sign-and-trade,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing our due diligence'' by pursuing Oakley, West
said. ``It was something we wanted to explore and the only way it
could have happened was a sign-and-trade deal. And there was
little, if any interest, on Toronto's part in doing that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, you almost feel like you're one of the conduits for
other players getting contracts and I don't find that palatable
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to both Oakley and Wright, whose agent used the
threat of a Lakers signing to spur the Clippers to sign and trade
Wright to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have one roster spot open and both their $1 million
and $2 million exceptions available.
</P>
<P>
   Blount's agent said he will make a decision by the end of the
week. San Antonio, Indiana and Washington are also pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also have their eyes on the waiver wire. Portland and
Orlando, for example, both are overloaded with guaranteed contracts
and will have to cut loose some talent in the next month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get something,'' West said. ``Trust me, we will get
something.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Six months after Chief Justice William Rehnquist
adjourned the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton,
Senate leaders have sent souvenirs to the White House lawyers and
the House managers who argued the case: the leather chairs in which
they sat throughout the five-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unassuming brown chairs resides in the office of
David Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer and a partner at the
Washington law firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly. A gold plaque on the
back reads: ``White House Counsel's Chair, Impeachment Trial of
President William J. Clinton, January 7, 1999, to February 12,
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he was considering the proper display of the chair,
which he called ``a working chair, poised for action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a thoughtful and generous gesture,'' Kendall added.
``However, it makes me think that the Senate leaders would like to
think of me sitting in the chair in silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has collected a few other artifacts from the long, tense
days of last winter. He has in a glass case the nameplate that
rested on the table before him each day, photos of the Senate floor
on Feb. 12, the day Clinton was acquitted, and framed passes from
the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the Congress, Diane Skvarla, the Senate curator,
has documented and stored many objects from the deliberations. With
assistance from the Senate sergeant-at-arms, Ms. Skvarla has
gathered items large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Her office has examples of the Senate pens misprinted to read
``Untied States Senator,'' and the pencils used for the vote
tallies, stored in plastic bags and cataloged, and a few of the
three types of tickets, public, diplomatic and press, issued for
each day of the impeachment hearing. The podium and easel used in
presentations on the Senate floor, the nameplates identifying the
participants, and Rehnquist's chair have all been marked and saved
as memorabilia of the only impeachment trial of a president since
1868, when Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   The furniture used throughout the proceedings has been marked;
as a piece moves from office to office in the Capitol, a label
identifies its inanimate participation in the historic occasion.
The tables at which the House managers and the White House lawyers
presided were built specifically for the trial. They are too large
to remain in the Capitol, and have been stored in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Original material from the presidential impeachments, including
the 130-year-old documents from the Johnson impeachment, and other
historic records from the Senate are maintained by the Senate
Library. It provides an internal archive of all proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   All Senate and House records are presented to the National
Archives every two congressional terms.
</P>
<P>
   Senate records at the archives are closed to the public for 20
years; House records for 30 years. But investigative records, which
would include much of the impeachment material, are closed for 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   And what has become of the blue dress that contained evidence of
Monica Lewinsky's relationship with the president, or the copy of
Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass'' that Ms. Lewinsky described as
``the most sentimental gift'' Clinton gave her?
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Independent
Counsel, said all evidence in the impeachment proceedings was being
kept in storage, the temporary property of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel. Starr's staff is still ``researching'' whether
to turn over to the National Archives the dress, the gifts from the
president and the collection of documents, Ms. Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr plans to conclude his investigation with a report to be
released in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that whatever the independent counsel has at the end
will go to the archives, as a record of the office,'' said Steven
Tilley, chief of the special access branch of the National
Archives, which is responsible for the Freedom of Information Act.
Tilley has worked with materials from other independent counsels as
well as with the archives' holdings from the Watergate scandal and
the John F. Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, through her lawyer, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some of the historical material from the impeachment
may find its way to Arkansas. Skip Rutherford, the local planning
coordinator for the Clinton presidential Library in Little Rock,
Ark., said that library planners would review how other
presidential libraries have handled scandals. The president is
seeking advice from historians, Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply are not at the stage when we could give any definite
plan for any exhibit,'' he said. ``But certainly the impeachment
issue was part of the presidency _ a very public part of the
presidency. It will have to be included in some way.''

CRUISE LINE CHIEF VISITS ALASKA TO APOLOGIZE FOR DUMPING
POLLUTANTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of the Royal Caribbean International cruise line,
which recently pleaded guilty to dumping pollutants in Alaskan
waters, paid visits to three southeastern Alaskan cities this week
and apologized for the company's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, lingering resentment toward Royal Caribbean is likely
to result in the adoption by one of the cities, Juneau, of a $5
``head tax'' on each passenger as cruise ships dock there. The tax
would affect all cruise lines, not just Royal Caribbean. But Dennis
W. Egan, the mayor of Juneau, said people were still so outraged by
Royal Caribbean's violations that the measure would easily pass
when balloting is held on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Jack L. Williams, president of the cruise line, which is based
in Miami, and two other company officials spoke at public forums
this week in Juneau, Skagway and Haines. ``He apologized in a most
sincere manner and said his company was guilty and had taken every
step to correct the problem,'' said Buckwheat Donahue, executive
director of Skagway's office of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty last month in six U.S. District
Courts to 21 felony violations of federal law, beginning in 1994,
and agreed to pay $18 million in fines for the dumping, which also
occurred in waters off Puerto Rico and Florida. The violations in
Alaska included four counts of dumping oily bilge water into the
Lynn Canal between Skagway and Haines and discharging dry-cleaning
chemicals and other toxic waste into Gastineau Channel, within the
Juneau city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Alaska sued Royal Caribbean in Superior Court in
Juneau, charging it with violating seven laws governing the
disposal of oil and hazardous waste. Meanwhile, Juneau is exploring
whether it can sue Royal Caribbean, although Egan said that state
law limited the steps municipalities could take.
</P>
<P>
   But there appears to be no prohibition against a head tax of the
type commonly levied by popular ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one on the ballot about three years ago,'' Egan said,
``but it failed in a close vote.'' The vote was also expected to be
close this time around, he said. ``But after Royal Caribbean
pleaded guilty,'' he added, ``the tax is going to pass, and even
people here whose livelihood depends directly on tourism say
they're going to vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Juneau, the state capital and home to about 40,000 permanent
residents, is heavily dependent on tourism _ as are many other
Alaskan communities _ because of shrinking oil reserves, said John
Mazor, president of the Juneau Convention and Visitors Bureau. The
bureau says about 600,000 cruise ship passengers visit Juneau
between mid-May and mid-September and account for most of the
estimated $75 million annually that Juneau earns from tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Donald F. Berry, the mayor of Haines, population 2,800, said
that the 165,000 cruise ship visitors a year spent about $65 each
while in town.
</P>
<P>
   John Mielke, the mayor of Skagway, said: ``Of course we want an
end to dumping, but I'm willing to let the state and the attorney
general deal with it. We survive on tourism, and 600,000 to 700,000
cruise passengers come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The visits by Williams, who joined Royal Caribbean in 1997, may
have been inspired by invitations from the mayors, especially a
letter from Egan that said that ``a full-page ad in the local
newspaper from your PR department is NOT an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the anger at the cruise line reflects a sense of
betrayal many Alaskans say they felt when they learned of Royal
Caribbean's activities. ``It meant that all the while they were
dumping in our waters,'' Egan said, ``their people were wearing
buttons bragging about their campaign to save the whales.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Alaskans think Royal Caribbean got off lightly. As a letter
writer to The Juneau Empire wrote this month: ``An apology and
fines don't begin to pay for what these people have done to
southeast Alaska or the hearts of its citizens. At least the
wrecking of the Exxon Valdez could be attributed in part to
negligence stemming from alcohol use. The dumping of oily bilge
water and chemical waste calls up images of Saddam Hussein setting
oilfields afire during the Persian Gulf War.''

A DELICATE GRIND OF A GAME LEVELS OFF THE CHESS SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT BYRNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took 84 moves over almost seven hours for Vladimir Akopian to
wear down Alexander Khalifman Tuesday evening by delicate
positional play and a grinding endgame in the third encounter of
their International Chess Federation World Championship Match. That
result, at the half-way point of the six-game series at Caesar's
Palace in Las Vegas, evens the score at 1 1/2-1 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian, an Armenian whose style resembles that of his great
predecessor Tigran Petrosian, got everything he likes this time.
Maneuvering against Khalifman's doubled and isolated pawns, he
prevented any tricky counterblows and arrived at an endgame in
which he could wander all over the board with king and rook, while
Khalifman could only suffer and cower.
</P>
<P>
   When he had driven his helpless opponent to the wall, Akopian
finished with a nice reduction of material that made everything
very plain.
</P>
<P>
   The Rossolimo Variation in the Sicilian Defense, 3 Bb5,
postpones an early d4 for the sake of quiet development. The
advance with 7...c4 deterred Akopian's aim _ d4 with a big center _
but he then satisfied himself with 8 d4 cd, and, not bothering to
recapture, sped his development with 9 Bg5 Ne5 10 Nbd2.
</P>
<P>
   Khalifman put his trust in a simplifying exchange with 10...Ba4
11 Qa4, but maybe he should have avoided loosening his queenside
with 11...b5 in favor of 11...Qd7.
</P>
<P>
   Khalifman's objective in playing 12...h6 was to make his e5
knight secure after 13 Bf6 gf, but the resulting doubled f pawns
and the isolated h6 pawn were to become headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Because the black mobilization lagged and the communication
between his flanks was awkward, Akopian seized the chance to weaken
the b5 pawn by 14 a4!
</P>
<P>
   Akopian changed doubled f pawns into doubled e pawns with 15
Ne5! de and continued his queenside attack with 16 Qa7. Perhaps
Khalifman could have played 16...Qb6, but 17 Qb6 Rb6 18 ab ab 19
Ra8 Kd7 20 Nb3 e6 21 Rd1 would recover the d3 pawn with the
superior position.
</P>
<P>
   Khalifman created a target with 20...h5; he might have tried
20...e6 and 21 ...Be7.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian had a pawn and, after 32...Qb5 33 Rb5, he had an
endgame.
</P>
<P>
   After 37...f5, it would not have been wise for Akopian to play
38 ef ef 39 gf because Khalifman would get the pawn back with
39...Rh8 40 Kg3 Be7.
</P>
<P>
   After 51 Kf3, Khalifman saw 52 Ng4 and 53 h6 coming, and thus
took his chances in a rook-and-pawn ending with 51...Bh2 52 Rh2
Kc3.
</P>
<P>
   But after 57 Kg2, it is not clear why he did not try 57...Ke2,
with the plan that 58 Rh3 Kd2 59 Kf3 Kd3 60 Kg4 Ke4 61 Kg5 Kd4 62
Kf6 e4 would get him a draw.
</P>
<P>
   He let things slide until, after 81...Kf7, Akopian put an end to
all resistance with 82 Rf1 Kg7 83 Ke7 Ra8 84 h8/Q! Khalifman saw
that 84...Kh8 (or 84...Rh8 85 Rg1 Kh6 86 Rh1 Kg7 87 Rh8) 85 Rf8 Rf8
86 Kf8 Kh7 86 Kf7 Kh6 86 Ke6 Kg7 87 Ke5 Kf7 88 Kd6 wins routinely,
and he gave up.
