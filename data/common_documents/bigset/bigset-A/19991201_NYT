YANKS AND NETS MERGER IS APPROVED BY BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The business merger between baseball's New York Yankees and
basketball's New Jersey Nets overcame its final obstacle Tuesday
when Major League Baseball owners approved the deal in Irving,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees-Nets merger was announced last February after
Cablevision's proposed acquisition of 70 percent of the Yankees
fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's ratification of the deal came 10 weeks after the
National Basketball Association approved it.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, had no
comment after Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resulting company, YankeeNets, intends to become a
significant sports and entertainment entity,'' said Howard
Rubenstein, a spokesman for Steinbrenner and a board member of the
holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Steinbrenner believed the merger did not constitute a
change in control of the Yankees and did not require a vote. But
baseball's position prevailed and it approved the transfer of
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Courtney, a spokesman for baseball, said the paperwork
for the deal was not ready in time for the last ownership meeting
in September. No meeting was scheduled during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really weren't any hang-ups,'' Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   To create the merged company, the Yankees were valued at $600
million and the Nets at $150 million. To equalize the ownership,
the Nets paid the Yankees $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   The combined holding company is trying to sell $360 million in
bonds to finance the merger, $115 million of which would finance
the Nets' payment to the Yankees, according to The Sports Business
Journal, an industry weekly. Another $115 million will be used to
pay the Nets' existing debt, the publication reported.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has said he needed baseball's approval before
making his long-awaited decision to stay in the Bronx or move to
Manhattan after his Yankee Stadium lease expires after the 2002
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Rubenstein would not say if the merger's approval would
expedite the decision. ``We are considering all our options,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Nets are looking into creating a new cable
channel to carry their games, but could instead re-sell their
rights to MSG, which carries the Yankees, and Fox Sports New York,
which carries the Nets. Cablevision owns both networks.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of starting a rival network could push Cablevision to
pay the teams far more than they now receive. The Yankees' 12-year,
$486 million MSG deal expires after next season; the Nets' contract
at FSNY ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Now that baseball has approved the merger, the YankeeNets are
expected to announce that Harvey Schiller, the former president of
Turner Sports, will be the president of the holding company.
</P>
<P>
   In other business at the owners' meeting, control of the
Montreal Expos was transferred to Jeffrey Loria, a New York art
dealer. He has pledged $50 million to buy 35 percent of the team.
The current ownership group _ minus the former controlling partner
Claude Brochu _ will own the remainder of the team. &QL;

 &UR; ONLINE _  &LR; Tom Johnson, an avid collector of Franciscan pottery and
an eBay buyer and seller, started his own online business in San
Francisco last year to sell antiques, fine art and collectibles.
Rather than buy and sell their own wares, Johnson and his partner
in Michigan elected to display stuff owned by others and take a 2
percent to 10 percent commission of the sales price. Getting online

 Clinton Proposes Giving Parents Paid Leave to Take Care
of  Newborns 
 &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
President Clinton announced a proposal Tuesday that would let
states pay unemployment benefits to parents taking time off from
work to care for a new baby.
<P>
   If the proposal, which does not require congressional approval,
takes effect as expected by next spring, it would be up to each
state to pass legislation tapping into unemployment funds for paid
parental leaves.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how the proposal would affect California. The state
is already one of a handful that permit paid childbirth leaves
under its disability insurance program. Most women qualify for six
weeks of payments after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Gov. Gray Davis approved raising the weekly
disability benefit limit from $336, to $490. He also authorized a
study into expanding paid leave beyond the standard six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is unlikely that the state would shift gears and
switch from its present disability-based program to an
unemployment-based system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Donna Lenhoff, general
counsel for the National Partnership for Women and Families in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   She said use of unemployment funds for parental time off likely
will be explored by states that do not have programs to subsidize
absences from work because of new babies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the governor's office said the new proposal is
being studied but that it is too soon to say whether California may
alter its benefits program for childbirth leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Other States
</P>
<P>
   Aside from California, only Hawaii, New York, New Jersey and
Rhode Island have authorized use of disability insurance for
childbirth leaves.
</P>
<P>
   But with many states now flush with cash thanks to the booming
economy, the federal government thinks many state legislatures will
embrace the use of unemployment insurance surpluses to fund new
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal rules do not allow use of unemployment funds for
childbirth leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it will strengthen parents' bonds with both their
children and their jobs,'' Clinton said in a White House news
conference before departing for a three-day Democratic fund-raising
trip to the West Coast, as well as a stop at the World Trade
Organization summit in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the eve of this new century, we ought to set a goal that
all parents can take the time they need for their families without
losing the income they need to support them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was passed in
1993, parents are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to
look after a new baby.
</P>
<P>
   Many Parents Forgo System
</P>
<P>
   However, a 1996 study found that many parents forgo unpaid leave
because they cannot afford the loss of income. One in 10 of those
taking unpaid leave ended up on welfare while off the job,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new rule would give options to states that wouldn't
otherwise have them,'' said Lisa Ecks, legislative representative
with the California Labor Federation in Sacramento. ``It gives
states a way to open the door for wage replacement for people who
are between a rock and a hard place.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the business community is opposed to use of
unemployment insurance for parental leaves. Employers are
responsible for funding the program through payroll taxes, and they
fear an increase in payments.
</P>
<P>
   Disability insurance, on the other hand, is paid by workers
through taxes on their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Businesses Criticize Measure
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployment rate may be relatively low right now, but
what happens when the party's over?'' asked Dan Danner, senior vice
president of the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, unemployment is going to rise again, and there's a
good chance the only way the government could pay for both this new
benefit and unemployment insurance is to increase payroll taxes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has written to the
Labor Department to warn that using unemployment funds for parental
time off would open a Pandora's box.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Paxton, the U.S. Labor Department's deputy solicitor, said
in a conference call with reporters that each state would be free
to decide the terms of its leave program.
</P>
<P>
   She said the ``model legislation'' put together by the federal
government features 12-week leaves for both mothers and fathers,
with benefits running about $200 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal is good for families and employers,'' Paxton
said. ``This proposal is about investing in the workforce of
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule will be published Friday for a 45-day comment
period. A final rule is expected to be issued by January 17 and
would take effect within several months thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   California provides approximately $1.8billion in total
disability payments each year, according to the state Employment
Development Department. A breakdown for childbirth payments was not
available.

SIXERS TOP KNICKS, 74-70 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It seems milk lasts longer than the expiration
date on the New York Knicks' feel-good moments. Twenty four hours
ago, they were popping out points like candy from a Pez dispenser
and tapping their toes to the beat of a blowout victory against
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But instead continuing their blissful pattern, the Knicks
curdled at the sight of the Sixers' harassing defense and were left
futilely scraping for points at the First Union Center on Tuesday
night as their two-game winning streak ended, 74-70.
</P>
<P>
   They struggled to put back-to-back possessions together against
a Philadelphia Sixers team that played without Allen Iverson. The
Knicks finished the night shooting 30 percent and turned the ball
over 19 times, getting 18 points out of Latrell Sprewell (6 for 18
with 6 turnovers) and 20 points from Allan Houston (5 for 15).
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers were led by Larry Hughes's 25 points to boost a team
that shot 38.7 percent and made just 14 of 28 free throws. In many
ways, the Knicks' frustrating night of groping for their groove
mirrored their season. They left the court with a 8-8 record, as
did the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' Sprewell said. ``We can't get on a roll this
season. We get two wins in a row and then we can't get that third.
We haven't been able to put that run together.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one offensive run on Tuesday night that mattered.
And the Sixers' claimed it. They did not have Iverson but they had
his stunt double, the springing Hughes. He's almost as explosive,
just as braided, nearly as many tattoos and capable of taking over
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes tortured Houston to open the fourth quarter with a wild
streak. He put together a string that included a dunk off a follow,
a jumper, a 3-point shot and a 3-point play made with a contorted
baseline move that drew a foul on the bewildered Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hughes hurt us,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``We
thought we had them stopped, but then he gave them life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hughes' effort, the Sixers had a 61-50 lead with 8 minutes
16 seconds left in the game. But with a little effort from John
Wallace and Kurt Thomas, the Knicks were within, 67-64, with 2
minutes remaining. Twice in the closing 21 seconds, the Knicks had
a chance to tie the game. But Houston missed an open 3-pointer and
Sprewell put on his pattened step-back-behind-the-arch 3-pointer
but was errant with 11 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rushed and you're thinking of everything, the clock,
everything,'' Sprewell said. `'But it just didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing fell right for the Knicks. Without a post presence, the
Sixers could blanket Houston and Sprewell and focus all their
attention on them. ``It's hard for us to win when those two guys
don't shoot reasonably well,'' Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Houston had no help. Unlike their wins against
Orlando and Dallas, the support system disappeared overnight.
Thomas finished 1 for 10 and Charlie Ward was 0 for 2.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the league's new rule to promote more fluid and
graceful game was not applying to Tuesday night's first half. The
same Ward who scored a career-high 25 points against Dallas, had
three fouls and no points in the first quarter _ and Iverson wasn't
on the floor. The same Thomas who opened up against Dallas with 10
points in the opening minutes ended the first half with 1 point and
was 0 for 4 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   There was no support for the sagging combo of Houston and
Sprewell. Together, they ended the first half 6 for 19 with six
turnovers. It was a relief for them to be playing an equally
malfunctioning Sixers' team. The Knicks finished the first half
shooting 25.7 percent while the Sixers hit 38.2 percent, turned the
ball over 12 times and converted just 4 of 13 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   What was the encore? There seemed to be little room for these
two teams to look worse. But they managed to open the third quarter
with a combined four turnovers in 59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers did unearth some semblance of an offense when Tyrone
Hill opened up with two baseline jumpers to put his team up, 37-33,
early in the third. The Sixers went ahead 41-35 after Sprewell's
fourth turnover of the game resulted in a fast-break layup by Aaron
McKie with 7 minutes remaining. After a flurry of misses and
mistakes by the Sixers, Sprewell, who had missed six shots in a
row, came up with a drive on a hop inside the paint and then a
jumper to pull the Knicks within 47-45 with 46.7 seconds left in
the third. The Knicks did not escape without one more turnover that
led to a layup by Larry Hughes, but not to be outdone, the Sixers
allowed Houston to sprint through the paint and draw a foul with
one-tenth of a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Houston hit both free throws, to leave the Knicks behind, 49-47,
entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the Knicks were still in this game despite the
eyesore they were co-producing.

DRUG EVILS SHROUD BORDER IN COLD FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY AND DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (JUAREZ, MEXICO) - As U.S. and Mexican officials began to
unearth corpses here Tuesday, Nov. 30, they also were exhuming a
cold fear buried along the drug-bloodied border.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, people have simply disappeared in this
city of 1.5 million people, suspected casualties of narco violence
and the powerful Carrillo Fuentes cartel. Others have been gunned
down in the streets amid ruthless drug-trafficking wars.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alonso Aguilar, 33, was one who vanished.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of May 1, 1998, two men dressed in black
fatigues showed up to talk to Aguilar, an auto-body repairman.
Alonso's brother, Roman, says nobody knew whether they were police
or thugs. The gunmen hauled Alonso away in a gray car. His wife and
six children never heard from him again.
</P>
<P>
   `We began to worry because he never came home,'' Roman Alonso
said &UR; Tuesday, Nov. 30, standing outside the massive gates of the
ranch where authorities were digging for bodies. He was circulating
a flier with his brother's picture. ``We don't know why they took
him.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Mayor Gustavo Elizondo complained that his
city's dark reputation is undeserved and that Juarez is a victim of
drug trafficking by outsiders. ``The Juarez Cartel is made up of
South Americans, some Mexicans, and some bad Americans,'' groused
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But local residents say there is no concealing the reality that
blood runs often in the streets of Juarez. Just last week, a man
was gunned down while dining at a popular downtown restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   `They don't know if he was killed over a woman, money or
drugs,'' said ice-cream vendor Salvador Martinez, 43, shrugging his
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this mayhem is blamed on the Juarez Cartel, among
Mexico's four largest. Amado Carrillo-Fuentes took over the
syndicate in 1992 when kingpin Rafael Aguilar Guajardo, once a
Mexican drug agent, was shot down in Cancun. As the Colombian
cartels faltered under U.S. pressure, Carrillo expanded his power
and political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Among those suspected of taking bribes: former Mexican drug czar
Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, who was arrested by the Mexican government
in 1997 and sentenced to 32 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo died in July 1997 of complications from plastic
surgery. Today, the cartel persists under several leaders,
including Amado's brother, Vicente Carrillo, who faces criminal
charges in Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans, untrusting of authorities and the media, believe
Amado Carrillo lives on, and his death was a ruse. But U.S.
authorities verified the autopsy results, and scientific evidence
was bolstered by a leadership war that ensued. After Carrillo's
death, drug gangsters in Juarez waged a fierce power struggle,
murdering an estimated 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such dangers, residents take stoic comfort in the
knowledge that most of the casualties were somehow linked to
trafficking activities.
</P>
<P>
   `You have to get on with life,'' said Nathanael Castillo, 35, a
mechanic who lives and works near the burial ranch. `The ones who
find trouble are usually those who go looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   `People are used to dead people turning up every day,'' agreed
Martinez. ``I think a lot of families will be waiting now for word
about loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Many street poles in Juarez have crosses painted on them to
commemorate what locals call ``los desaparecidos.'' The loss of
loved ones left friends and relatives scarred, and the discovery of
mass graves has re-opened those wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible,'' said Jaime Hervella, co-director of the El
Paso-based Relatives of Disappeared Persons. Hervella has a list of
196 people whose whereabouts are unknown. Among them is his godson,
a U.S. Navy veteran and communications expert whose technology
helped Mexican authorities capture drug shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The missing are not just drug traffickers and informants, but a
cross-section of U.S. and Mexican citizens. Hervella said it is
unclear why some people get kidnapped, and it is even more
uncertain what becomes of them. In many cases, however, witnesses
reported that the body snatchers were dressed as police or
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The El Paso organization pressured the Mexican government into
assigning four special prosecutors in the past three years - none
of whom unraveled the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the victims are discovered in a mass burial, Hervella
said, it will bring the anguish of finality. ``Up 'til now, we all
had hope that our loved ones would be found in military jails,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, federal agents in Arizona say they've never seen a
comparable homicide spree along the Sonoran border. There are
scores of drug-related murders here each year, but the closest
parallel occurred in 1989 when 13 murder victims were found in a
well outside of Agua Prieta, across the border from Douglas. Jim
Molesa, DEA spokesman in Phoenix, said those killings were
attributed to Hector Fragoso Burgueno, the leader of a
marijuana-smuggling syndicate. Fragoso also was implicated that
year in the slaughter of five men in a Tucson shed. Molesa said he
was arrested by U.S. authorities and extradited to Mexico for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona authorities say early reports from Juarez also are
surprising because many victims purportedly were government
informants.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hall, an FBI special agent in Phoenix, said no bureau sources
have been murdered in Arizona during the recent past. Molesa said
one DEA informant was gunned down in Tucson this year by drug
gangsters, but that case did not involve Mexican syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Molesa said, U.S. law officers are finding it
increasingly difficult to operate in Mexico because of fear and
corruption. Just last week, a pair of agents from the DEA and FBI
were held at gunpoint by a dozen men - including some wearing
Tamaluipas state police uniforms - near Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen reportedly wanted to kidnap a suspected informant who
was with the agents. Molesa said one of the assailants, suspected
narco-trafficker Oziel Cardenas Guillen, threatened the agents
saying, `This is my country, my territory. I control it here. You
don't. So get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Molesa said revelations in Juarez suggest that the organization
there was very sloppy, or hellbent on sending ``a distinct
message'' to rivals and snitches. The latter explanation is more
likely, he added.

   Protecting Your Idea Until It Can Be Sold 
 &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;         c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: &LR;  I have an idea for a marketing/advertising campaign for a &LR; 
 &LR; very large, very well-known company but I lack advertising &LR; 
 &LR; experience and am not sure what my next step should be. Who &LR;

<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Ideas by themselves cannot be copyrighted. That means
``anyone who releases them into the marketplace risks having them
ripped off,'' according to lawyer Debora Jacobs, author of ``Small
Business Legal Smarts (Bloomberg Press, $16.95). However, if you
can put your idea in a tangible form like a song, slogan, picture,
cartoon or brochure, you have a better chance of protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It sounds like you have no connection with the company, so the
first thing to do would be finding the appropriate person to deal
with, such as the marketing vice president or product manager.
Jacobs recommends phoning that person and trying to set up a
face-to-face meeting. Going through the advertising agency
increases the layers of people and the chances that your idea, if
it is truly a bright one, could be stolen.
</P>
<P>
   If your contact asks for more information before setting up a
meeting, you can ask the person to sign an agreement not to
disclose your topics of discussion. However, if the person refuses,
you might not have many options.
</P>
<P>
   You can also write a letter describing your idea in writing, for
example, a slogan, and attach a copyright notice with it plus your
name and date. That puts the recipient on notice that you have
registered a copyright or plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This won't guarantee that someone won't take your idea, but it
should lessen the chances.
</P>
<P>
   For more information and details on how to apply for a copyright
online, contact the U.S. Copyright Office at  &LR; lcweb.loc.gov &LR; 
 &LR; /copyright &LR; . Also check out chapters on intellectual property
protection in business books like Jacobs'.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that a lot of people have ``better ideas'' for
other people's businesses, and the one you are trying to reach may
have heard it all before. On the other hand, businesses often pay
big bucks for marketing ideas that ignite sales. If yours is one of
them and the company expresses an interest, Jacobs suggests you
might ask for a modest lump-sum payment plus a bonus tied to sales
increases.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you would want an agreement in writing and likely
would need to consult a lawyer who specializes in intellectual
property to hash out the details.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; More on SEPs
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I'm self-employed with one employee who works 28 hours per
week. I have an SEP IRA but can't seem to get a straight answer
from a CPA or tax attorney as to the requirements for setting up a
retirement account for my employee and funding it. How long can I
keep the employee out? One year, three years or not at all? And is
there an hourly or annual minimum pay requirement?
</P>
<P>
   A: The custodian for your Simplified Employee Pension plan
should have the answers. When employers set up an SEP IRA, they
must specify the requirements for employees. Employees older than
21 cannot be excluded from the plan, according to Danville CPA Mary
Kay Foss.
</P>
<P>
   Employers have the option to include younger workers, and they
also can elect to exclude any worker who has not been with the
company for as much as three years or makes less than $400
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, once an employee has been with you at least
three years, is over 21 or makes $400 or more, you have no choice
but to include them in your SEP plan.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Form 5305-SEP lists all the requirements in the instructions
printed on the form. Foss notes that many employers do not
anticipate having employees when they establish such a plan. She
also sees some stingy employers drop their SEP plans and adopt
less-costly retirement plans just before employees become eligible
for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   You should consult a plan administration company for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   Ooops
</P>
<P>
   Apologies to reader Gretchen Beck, whose name I misspelled in
last week's column.

FREE SMOKES ARE MAILED TO ARIZONANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Rob Evans quit his pack-a-day habit when a heart
attack nearly killed him in 1990. Now, out of the blue, R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. is mailing him free packs of Winstons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' the 51-year-old Tempe social worker said
Tuesday, Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   So were other Phoenix area residents who within the past month
received unsolicited canisters or book-size parcels containing two
to four packets of cigarettes. One of the recipients was a woman
whose toddler opened the family mail to find the free smokes.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the complaints of Evans and several others, Arizona
Attorney General Janet Napolitano has demanded an explanation from
R.J. Reynolds and threatened to get a court order to stop the
mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano accused the tobacco company of violating an agreement
to settle a lawsuit by Arizona and other states for the health care
costs of poor people who smoke. The agreement bans any marketing
that could put cigarettes into the hands of anyone under 21.
</P>
<P>
   She also announced a hotline set up to log complaints from the
public. The number is (602) 542-5763 and, for people living out of
the Phoenix area, toll-free 1-800-352-8431.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds representative John Singleton said no cigarettes
should have been mailed to anyone who had not certified in writing
that he was 21 or older. ``What we're being accused of wouldn't
happen under our procedures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Christensen of the Arizona Department of Health Services
said the state spends about $15 million a year on advertising to
prevent young people from smoking. ``Suddenly, there's this
scheme,'' he said. ``Providing addiction starter kits. This is
really amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The toddler's mother, whose name was not released by
Napolitano's office, fumed in a complaint to the attorney general.
``Did you know that my 4-year-old was playing with cigarettes?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano said other complaints came from people who had quit
smoking for health reasons or were taking medication to end their
nicotine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has yet to ratify its $3 billion share of the master
settlement because of a dispute in the state Supreme Court over
claims by Maricopa and other counties for a 32 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   That does not prevent Arizona from seeking a court order to stop
the cigarette mailings as well as seeking a possible civil fine,
Napolitano said. She has demanded a meeting with R.J. Reynolds
officials, as required by the master lawsuit settlement, before
taking court action.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said R.J. Reynolds will explain the cigarette mailing.
``It is our intention to comply with the letter and the spirit of
the master settlement in every aspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are thinly disguised efforts to target youth,'' she
said. ``To get kids who may pick them up in the mail first _ to get
them to start smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The mailings are addressed to specific individuals and contain a
``Dear Smoker'' questionnaire that asks the recipient to respond
after smoking ``enough of the cigarettes to form an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it means `form an addiction,' '' Napolitano said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said his 20-year-old son is trying desperately to quit
smoking. ``I can't imagine that these tobacco companies conceive
that it would be OK to send these cigarettes through the mail,'' he
said. &QL;

GEORGE AS CAPT. KIRK? IT'S
 `ULTIMATE TREK'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  (UNDATED) - It would be easy to
dismiss Ultimate Trek: Star Trek's Greatest Moments as a show that
appeals only to hard-core fans of the series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what's the point? That's true of all Star Trek shows from
the original to the ensuing knockoffs. Trekkies love all things
Trek; the rest of us scratch our heads and wonder whether a pocket
protector is really a necessary fashion accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there have been some strong television moments in the
four series. And the goal of Ultimate Trek is to dole those out in
easy-to-digest snippets: ``Ultimate Time-Travel Moments,''
``Ultimate Vil lains,'' ``Ultimate One-Liners,'' that kind of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   As a concept, it's rather spotty. If you buy into the whole Star
Trek universe, it's a show that demands your attention for an
entire hour. Whatever merits any of the series have, limited though
they may be, are lost in the cut-and-paste format.
</P>
<P>
   But Ultimate Trek is still worth watching even if you don't know
that Tiberius is James Kirk's middle name, and the reason is
simple: Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved Alexander as George Costanza on Seinfeld, wait till
you catch him as Capt. Kirk. He appears as the captain of the
Enterprise during bits that set up the clips - something about how
a Y2K bug will destroy the Star Trek signal, a development he and
Spock and Dr. McCoy must prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the specious plot. Just sit back and enjoy Alexander, who
has William Shatner's bizarre acting mannerisms down cold. The
goofy toupee and the too-tight shirt are just gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Gravy for the viewer, that is. Al exander said seeing himself
squeezed into the captain's outfit made a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I not only started a crash diet, I'm seriously considering
plastic surgery, liposuction, whatever it takes,'' he said in a
conference call last week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a moment that Alexander is ridiculing Shatner in
his hilarious performance. Quite the contrary. As anyone who has
heard him on Howard Stern's radio show can attest, Alexander, who
once appeared in an episode of Star Trek: Voyager, is a
full-fledged Trekkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the original series goes and the films go, I'm damn
near an authority,'' he said. ``It would frighten you how much I
know about it. Because it certainly fright ens me.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Alexander tell it, Shatner is a major reason for his
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even want to be an actor,'' he said. ``I just wanted
to captain the Enterprise. I thought that was a wonderful career
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   One he now has achieved. Seriously, though, he loves Shatner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really, by and large, Shat ner's performance that took
these ridiculous production situations and turned them into rather
compelling stories,'' Alexander said. ``He was so invested in the
importance - the universal importance - of that stuff that it
really made it very, very exciting work.''
</P>
<P>
   If he sounds like a Frenchman talking about Jerry Lewis, you
should hear Alexander rave about why the show remains popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Trek really does its home work as far as its science
goes and its commitment to pulling off effects and pulling off the
creation of the physical world of the future,'' he said. ``I think
true, die-hard science-fiction fans like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always has a sense of humor about itself. It's also always
had a sense of not importance as much as a mission, in a way. All
the series have tried to tackle issues that are relevant to all of
us and to do it in a way that encompasses this entertainment. And
because they're able to abstract it into this future world, it
seems to have very little threat to a viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Fan. Big fan. So much so that Alexander contends that his
acting is full of Shatner's quirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever see me do stage work or some of my more dramatic
work, you will actually notice that I have inherited that sort of
halting, search ing, staccato rhythm of Shatner from time to
time,'' Alexander said, ``his emphasis on unusual parts of any
given line of dialogue. . . . Not the larger-than-life movements
that he does but some of the smaller tics, I actually sort of
picked up. I have to concentrate not to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has played his dream role, perhaps Alexander can
answer the ultimate Star Trek question: What accounts for pudgy
Capt. Kirk's status as an interspecies babe magnet?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great line in one of the Batman films where a girl
is coming on to Batman and he says, `It must be the car. Chicks
love the car.' It might be true of the ship. He's got a pretty
impressive ship there that he's totally in charge of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the sense of command. . . . It could be he's got
that little phaser thing on the hip. It could be the flying double
drop-kick. I don't know. It may be just all in his attitude. But
whatever it is, it sure as hell is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it fails to work for Alexander's Kirk during an Ultimate
Trek bit, one that contains the best moment of the show. When Kirk,
Spock and McCoy see Borg Lingerie, they naturally assume it's a
shop run by the evil Borg. Rushing inside, they are instead greeted
by several beauti ful women wearing bras and panties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it been seven years already?'' the Spock character asks,
and that tells you all you need to know. If you get that joke,
you'll love Ultimate Trek. If you don't, you'll wonder what all the
fuss is over.

COMMENTARY: THUGS AND GOONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for changes in 9th, 10th and 11th grafs, bgng: Bruce
Teitelbaum.) 
(jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James Carville is sorry he called the mayor of New
York a thug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really shouldn't have used that word,'' the Democratic
strategist concedes. ``There is actually a better word: goon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gonna use bully. And tyrant, but that was too regal, too
much like George III. Mean-spirited? The congressional Republicans
have already stolen that word. So I'm kinda left with goon.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Washington's pit bull pitted against New York's pit
bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani and I _ that's perfect,'' Carville exults. ``He and I
are at about the same level. Yeah, I'm sort of a political goon.
But I ain't running for Senate. He's a man without any public
compassion and he fights with everybody over everything. It would
be like having me for a senator. It would be a big disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   As he goes after ``the Murdoch/Giuliani crowd,'' the War Room
general who strafed Gennifer Flowers, George Bush, Paula Jones,
Kenneth Starr and Benjamin Netanyahu now has opponents worthy of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I don't go pickin' on the lame, the halt and the
blind,'' Carville says. ``Giuliani loves to attack little people.
He enjoys it.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press'' last Sunday, the bald, boisterous one said
he had called Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign to offer to rant at
Rudy: ``Corporal Cueball is volunteering. I'm going to New York,
I'm setting up committees, and we're going to call it the Committee
to Combat Thuggery, and we're going to take on all these thugs in
the Giuliani campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, a Giuliani adviser, ripostes: ``I find it
fascinating that we're accused of being negative by the same people
who are calling us thugs.'' He decried ``the imported nasty
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the mayor's camp feel the word ``thugs'' was intended to
conjure up the image of an Italian gang. Carville denies any
Godfather-esque implications: ``What else do you call somebody who
jails the homeless at Thanksgiving? The Godfather would have never
jailed 100 homeless people. He would have sent them out some
soup.''
</P>
<P>
   As his ``cueballers'' cheer on Hillary and keep tabs on Rudy, he
will wave a red flag. ``I can be the rodeo clown to Giuliani's
bull, to try to deflect the bull away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But won't the presence of the ragin' Cajun just enhance the
impression of outsiders descending on Gotham?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rudy Giuliani can go to Texas and raise money,'' Carville
says, ``we can go to New York and raise Cain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic barker will not be able to toy with this
righteous prosecutor as he toyed with the last. Ken Starr was naive
and politically inept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then you get a perfect fat pitch you get to
clobber,'' Carville says happily.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Stickin','' he sums up his method of
vengeful, partisan attack: ``It's hard for somebody to hit you when
you have your fist in their face.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Mrs. Clinton had done to earn Pat Moynihan's seat,
Carville shot back: ``She's been on the board of directors of
Wal-Mart. How many people have run for the Senate on less than
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about George Stephanopoulos' observation in Newsweek that
Mrs. Clinton can be ``a clumsy tactician prone to
second-guessing,'' Carville agreed. ``She can be a little
hard-headed from time to time.'' But he predicted: ``she's going to
wear very well. I think she's got a really good personality. She's
fun. There are some people who don't like ambitious women and they
ain't going to vote for her. We've lost 'em. Never had 'em. Not
going to get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   While it has been wonderfully effective, Carville's tactic of
demonizing attackers of the Clintons has a way of preventing
ethical questions from being aired, and allowed Bill Clinton to
evade responsibility for his own bad behavior. When does a
strategist become an enabler?
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably am,'' he replies. ``That is a legitimate
observation. But I ain't going to fall out with anybody but my wife
over sex. And you know what? That son of a ... has always been good
to me. He has always been good to my mother. In the end, by and
large, I think he is a pretty kind guy. And to me, he has never
committed the ultimate sin and that is being gratuitously cruel to
little people and that is what I don't like about Giuliani.''

POLLUTION ALERT IS ON FOR THE PHOENIX AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - For the first time in four years, Phoenix area
pollution levels for carbon monoxide violated federal health
standards on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The violation triggered a high-pollution alert that will last
through at least 10 a.m. today, Dec. 1. If a second reading above
federal health standards is recorded this year, Phoenix's hopes of
shedding its ``serious'' label for carbon monoxide will be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in pollution readings at a west-central Phoenix site
surprised and perplexed air-quality officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sharp peak,'' said Jo Crumbaker, air-quality
manager for Maricopa County's Environmental Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, carbon monoxide levels build gradually, fueled by
vehicle exhaust trapped in stagnant air. But Monday's, Nov. 29,
midday reading of 6.8 parts per million had jumped to 9.9 ppm by 11
p.m. and peaked at 10.5 ppm by 1 a.m. Tuesday, Nov. 30. Readings
exceeding 9 ppm are unhealthful, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The high readings were recorded by a pollution monitor near the
intersection of Grand Avenue, Thomas Road and 27th Avenue. Because
the two high readings occurred within the same time frame, they
count as one violation.
</P>
<P>
   Crumbaker said county environmental officials don't know why the
carbon monoxide readings jumped so far, so fast. A quick check
Tuesday, Nov. 30, showed the monitor was working properly.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of high readings likely would doom attempts to
get the EPA to reclassify the Phoenix area's carbon monoxide levels
and declare them in compliance with health standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area also is rated ``serious'' for ozone and
particulate pollution, and prospects for complying with federal
standards are dim. In November, the EPA said it would impose limits
on new or expanding businesses by March unless the Phoenix could
come up with a sufficient plan to fight particulate pollution. By
September, Arizona could face the loss of federal
highway-construction funds if a plan is not in place.
</P>
<P>
   During the high-pollution advisory, Phoenix area residents are
asked to reduce their driving and to use transit, carpool or
combine their trips. A ban on wood-burning fireplaces also is in
effect, except for those homes with EPA-approved wood stoves and
fireplace inserts. &QL;

TAXPAYERS TO GET LESS BANG FOR MORE BUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Phoenix taxpayers may foot much of the $1.5 million
tab for the city's downtown New Year's Eve bash.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll get less bang for their buck.
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go, Phoenix Celebration 2000 was dramatically
scaled back because corporate sponsors were reluctant to kick in
money.
</P>
<P>
   The party's planning committee also has met behind closed doors
since July, skirting the Arizona Open Meeting Law, even though it's
spending $525,000 of city money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two years of planning, the glitches are not altogether
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city said it wanted a millennium event that would be very
big scale, that would be affordable to virtually everyone in the
city, and that's a tough thing to pull off,'' said Grant Woods,
chairman of the party's planning committee, Citizens for the
Community Celebration Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The New Year's Eve party will feature 34 bands, including the
Gin Blossoms, Three Dog Night and Waylon Jennings, on three stages
in downtown Phoenix. Tickets are $10 in advance and $15 on the day
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the event originally was a much grander affair. Six stages
were to feature a variety of acts from the decades of the 1940s and
on.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in early September when it became clear that
corporate sponsors weren't kicking in the money to defray the
original cost estimate of $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent that somewhere, somehow they were going to
have to pare down the number of acts, the physical size and the
special effects,'' said Mike Whiting, a city administrator in
charge of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Nov. 29, the committee had raised $245,000, a far
cry from the $2 million originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   With the downscaled event came contracts that the committee
suddenly couldn't afford to honor. But in doing so, the committee
and city staff angered the agents that had lined up 15 entertainers
that were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said they were canceling the contracts, I told them
they couldn't do that,'' said Charlie Johnston, who, as owner of
Select Artists Associates and a committee member, had negotiated
for the acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Grant (Woods), `You're going to get a lot of lawsuits.'
''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Two weeks after they were canceled, the talent
agency representing three bands fired off a terse letter to Phoenix
Mayor Skip Rimsza, demanding that its $100,000 contract be honored.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent letters from the William Morris Agency made it clear
that it would sue to get its money. The city later caved in, and
the bands will perform as part of the Celebration 2000 party.
</P>
<P>
   The flap prompted Johnston, a volunteer on the original panel
and its successor, to resign and demand that his name be taken off
all the committee's bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`ve been in business for 34 years. My credibility was on the
line. It was a devasting experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston also wasn't happy with the way the committee's
accounting was handled.
</P>
<P>
   City records indicate that the committee filed its articles of
incorporation as a non-profit, tax-exempt entity with the Arizona
Corporation Commission in April. In mid-June, the city gave the
committee a $25,000 grant as seed money.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the city lent the committee $500,000 with the
stipulation that $100,000 be repaid before the Celebration 2000
party.
</P>
<P>
   But those transfers took place before the city had officially
contracted with the committee to host the party.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he wasn't comfortable with the financial setup.
</P>
<P>
   It also is unclear whether the committee will be able to repay
the balance of the $500,000 loan.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent budget for the event puts the party's costs at
nearly $1.5 million, with more than $824,000 going to the artists,
accommodations and booking agents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the committee plans to do in the case of a shortfall,
the city's Whiting said, ``I prefer to just think we're going to be
very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods had a different answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city will pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the party makes or loses money depends, in large part,
on how many people show up for it.
</P>
<P>
   The panel estimates 115,000 people will attend, which may be
overly optimistic for a first-time event. Across town, organizers
of the Tempe Block Party are expecting 150,000 for its 15th annual
bash.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers of both events admit that estimating crowds this
year is tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a one-time event, and we haven't done it before,''
Whiting said. ``But I think our estimates are very conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to sponsor a New Year's Eve bash next year for
what purists would call the real turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods has a suggestion if the city decides to go ahead with
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice for the next year is to reverse roles and have city
staff run the operation with input from a volunteer committee,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so would mean the city would have to request bids from
contractors and meet in public under the public open meetings law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll just have to do that,'' Woods said. ``It's too
difficult to do something this big (by) depending on volunteers.'' &QL;

 Bank Delays Installation of New Computer System  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In an apparent effort to cut costs, North Carolina's Bank of
America said it has put off installing its own computer and
management systems in its recently acquired California branches
until 2001, as much as a year later than originally planned.
<P>
   Making the switch is one of the last and biggest steps in
combining San Francisco's old BofA and the former NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a time when BofA is struggling to meet
analysts' earnings estimates. It is carrying out a wide-ranging
program to shed staff and slash expenses, especially in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   BofA ``is getting very aggressive in trying to get cost
savings,'' said Joseph Morford, an analyst with the brokerage firm
Dain Rauscher Wessels. BofA's cost-cutting program reflects the
tough time the bank seems to be having generating income matching
Wall Street expectations, Morford said.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank acquired roughly 1,000 branches in California when
it bought BofA.
</P>
<P>
   It eventually plans to convert all of these branches into a
``model branch'' system developed by the old NationsBank. The
conversion involves changing the computer, staffing and incentive
pay systems to generate more income from customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the computer system would provide information about
customers' banking history that would help employees sell more
products.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion was supposed to be completed in the fall of 2000.
Now BofA says it won't be finished until sometime in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   BofA spokesman Peter Magnani called the postponement ``a prudent
business decision,'' saying it provides more time for staff
training and frees up resources that can be invested elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   BofA employees, who asked not to be identified, said they were
told the postponement of systems conversions seemed to be an effort
to accelerate cost savings and hold off on costly merger
integration expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts project that it will cost more than $1 billion to
convert all the branches of the former BofA to the new system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only branches in several Southwestern states have been
changed over.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Tejera, an analyst with the Seattle brokerage firm Ragen
MacKenzie, said the delay is ``troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer you postpone it, the longer you postpone the
revenue benefits of the merger,'' Tejera said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say BofA's revenue squeeze is forcing it to scramble to
meet profit expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the bank filed documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission showing that its third-quarter profit was
boosted by several ununusual items.
</P>
<P>
   Without those items, which were not disclosed when BofA
originally reported earnings in October, the bank would have fallen
short of Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's stock has fallen about 9 percent since the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   In another apparent cost-cutting move, the bank seems to be
handing out pink slips faster and more broadly than originally
expected, employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen San Francisco finance staff members have lost
their jobs in the past few weeks as corporate financial reporting
operations were closed in the city. Employees estimate that several
hundred Northern California jobs have been eliminated in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   BofA declined to provide specific information. ``We have said
consistently that there were going to be job reductions both in
California and throughout the system, both merger related and
because the business environment is constantly changing,'' Magnani
said. ``We're not going to quantify the reductions locally.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has said it expects to lay off between 5,000 and 8,000
employees nationwide ut of an original head count of roughly
180,000 when the two banks combined.

DRUG EVILS SHROUD BORDER IN COLD FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY AND DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (JUAREZ, MEXICO) - As U.S. and Mexican officials began to
unearth corpses here Tuesday, Nov. 30, they also were exhuming a
cold fear buried along the drug-bloodied border.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, people have simply disappeared in this
city of 1.5 million people, suspected casualties of narco violence
and the powerful Carrillo Fuentes cartel. Others have been gunned
down in the streets amid ruthless drug-trafficking wars.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alonso Aguilar, 33, was one who vanished.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of May 1, 1998, two men dressed in black
fatigues showed up to talk to Aguilar, an auto-body repairman.
Alonso's brother, Roman, says nobody knew whether they were police
or thugs. The gunmen hauled Alonso away in a gray car. His wife and
six children never heard from him again.
</P>
<P>
   `We began to worry because he never came home,'' Roman Alonso
said &UR; Tuesday, Nov. 30, standing outside the massive gates of the
ranch where authorities were digging for bodies. He was circulating
a flier with his brother's picture. ``We don't know why they took
him.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Mayor Gustavo Elizondo complained that his
city's dark reputation is undeserved and that Juarez is a victim of
drug trafficking by outsiders. ``The Juarez Cartel is made up of
South Americans, some Mexicans, and some bad Americans,'' groused
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But local residents say there is no concealing the reality that
blood runs often in the streets of Juarez. Just last week, a man
was gunned down while dining at a popular downtown restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   `They don't know if he was killed over a woman, money or
drugs,'' said ice-cream vendor Salvador Martinez, 43, shrugging his
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this mayhem is blamed on the Juarez Cartel, among
Mexico's four largest. Amado Carrillo-Fuentes took over the
syndicate in 1992 when kingpin Rafael Aguilar Guajardo, once a
Mexican drug agent, was shot down in Cancun. As the Colombian
cartels faltered under U.S. pressure, Carrillo expanded his power
and political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Among those suspected of taking bribes: former Mexican drug czar
Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, who was arrested by the Mexican government
in 1997 and sentenced to 32 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo died in July 1997 of complications from plastic
surgery. Today, the cartel persists under several leaders,
including Amado's brother, Vicente Carrillo, who faces criminal
charges in Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans, untrusting of authorities and the media, believe
Amado Carrillo lives on, and his death was a ruse. But U.S.
authorities verified the autopsy results, and scientific evidence
was bolstered by a leadership war that ensued. After Carrillo's
death, drug gangsters in Juarez waged a fierce power struggle,
murdering an estimated 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such dangers, residents take stoic comfort in the
knowledge that most of the casualties were somehow linked to
trafficking activities.
</P>
<P>
   `You have to get on with life,'' said Nathanael Castillo, 35, a
mechanic who lives and works near the burial ranch. `The ones who
find trouble are usually those who go looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   `People are used to dead people turning up every day,'' agreed
Martinez. ``I think a lot of families will be waiting now for word
about loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Many street poles in Juarez have crosses painted on them to
commemorate what locals call ``los desaparecidos.'' The loss of
loved ones left friends and relatives scarred, and the discovery of
mass graves has re-opened those wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible,'' said Jaime Hervella, co-director of the El
Paso-based Relatives of Disappeared Persons. Hervella has a list of
196 people whose whereabouts are unknown. Among them is his godson,
a U.S. Navy veteran and communications expert whose technology
helped Mexican authorities capture drug shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The missing are not just drug traffickers and informants, but a
cross-section of U.S. and Mexican citizens. Hervella said it is
unclear why some people get kidnapped, and it is even more
uncertain what becomes of them. In many cases, however, witnesses
reported that the body snatchers were dressed as police or
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The El Paso organization pressured the Mexican government into
assigning four special prosecutors in the past three years - none
of whom unraveled the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the victims are discovered in a mass burial, Hervella
said, it will bring the anguish of finality. ``Up 'til now, we all
had hope that our loved ones would be found in military jails,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, federal agents in Arizona say they've never seen a
comparable homicide spree along the Sonoran border. There are
scores of drug-related murders here each year, but the closest
parallel occurred in 1989 when 13 murder victims were found in a
well outside of Agua Prieta, across the border from Douglas. Jim
Molesa, DEA spokesman in Phoenix, said those killings were
attributed to Hector Fragoso Burgueno, the leader of a
marijuana-smuggling syndicate. Fragoso also was implicated that
year in the slaughter of five men in a Tucson shed. Molesa said he
was arrested by U.S. authorities and extradited to Mexico for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona authorities say early reports from Juarez also are
surprising because many victims purportedly were government
informants.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hall, an FBI special agent in Phoenix, said no bureau sources
have been murdered in Arizona during the recent past. Molesa said
one DEA informant was gunned down in Tucson this year by drug
gangsters, but that case did not involve Mexican syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Molesa said, U.S. law officers are finding it
increasingly difficult to operate in Mexico because of fear and
corruption. Just last week, a pair of agents from the DEA and FBI
were held at gunpoint by a dozen men - including some wearing
Tamaluipas state police uniforms - near Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen reportedly wanted to kidnap a suspected informant who
was with the agents. Molesa said one of the assailants, suspected
narco-trafficker Oziel Cardenas Guillen, threatened the agents
saying, `This is my country, my territory. I control it here. You
don't. So get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Molesa said revelations in Juarez suggest that the organization
there was very sloppy, or hellbent on sending ``a distinct
message'' to rivals and snitches. The latter explanation is more
likely, he added.

 New services help small businesses get online  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; T om Johnson, an avid collector of Franciscan pottery and an
eBay buyer and seller, started his own online business in San
Francisco last year to sell antiques, fine art and collectibles.
<P>
   Rather than buy and sell their own wares, Johnson and his
partner in Michigan elected to display stuff owned by others and
take a 2 percent to 10 percent commission of the sales price.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ruby Lane ( &LR; www.rubylane.com &LR; ) has about 20,000 items for
sale at any time from more than 200 individuals and dealers and
generates more than $10,000 a month in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Getting online is becoming more of a necessity for the 20
million U.S. small businesses that account for nearly half of all
employment and a third of economic output. According to recent
surveys, nearly a quarter of all U.S. households bought something
over the Internet during the past year and online sales are
projected to mushroom from $20billion this year to $184 billion in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of small businesses have a Web presence, compared
with 19 percent a year ago, and 71 percent of those who sell online
view the Internet as ``essential'' to their development.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimism, more than 40 percent of small businesses
say they have neither the staff nor the time to maintain a Web
site, according to Prodigy Communications Corp. And the smaller the
company, the greater the problem. Only 1 in 4 companies with fewer
than 10 employees has an Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson and his partner both worked in computers and
high-tech consulting, they found that to make their virtual gallery
a success, they needed some sophisticated online services.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a growing number of large companies like Microsoft,
Yahoo! &LR;  and IBM, and Internet startups have created Web portals to
meet the needs of small and growing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is partial to an online marketing and management product
called ClickTrade created by San Francisco's Link Exchange. As a
sign of the company's strategic promise, it was acquired for
$265million a year ago by Microsoft and is now the center of
Microsoft's bCentral suite of services for online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ClickTrade helps businesses drive traffic to their Web sites by
setting up affiliate networks with other sites. Ruby Lane, for
example, uses it to pay more than 1,100 partners a 3-cent to
10-cent commission for every person who clicks on Ruby Lane's link
from their site. On top of that, it pays 30 percent of the total
commissions to bCentral to handle the cumbersome chores of sending
affiliates their commission checks and providing detailed reports
of all the online activity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson figures the service is well worth it. ``For every $100
we spend, we get more than $200 in revenues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in mid-October, Microsoft's bCentral helps businesses
in three key areas: getting started online by connecting to the Web
and building a Web site, promoting and marketing online, and
managing more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is hardly alone in storming the business-to-business
(B2B) market. AOL, Citibank, Excite, IBM, Intuit, Yahoo and others
have started online portals to connect to businesses. A growing
number of local companies including Bigstep.com, eCongo.com and
Freemerchant.com are even offering businesses free services to
create a Web site, set up a virtual store, market and manage it,
and track the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Oklahoma land rush,'' said small-business
analyst Raymond Boggs of IDC in Framingham, Mass. ``Established
companies and new ones like DigitalWork.com, Encanto Networks and
SmartAge are all getting into the B2B space.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for small businesses is figuring out what they
need and paying for only the options they need. That can be
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's equivalent to 1905, when there were about 200
automakers,'' said Boggs. ``You could wait about 15 years until you
have a Big 3.'' But he recommends finding a service provider you
feel comfortable with and making the leap. ``Even if you pick the
wrong one, it will probably put you in better shape than not
picking anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many small businesses remain skeptical. One of the
problems is the ``fear factor,'' according to Microsoft bCentral
Group Product Manager Jon Elvekrog. In addition, he noted,
``Business information is scattered across the Web, and a lot of
sites offer static information. For example, they give you
information about how to run an ad campaign rather than tools to
let you just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   To help businesses get started online, bCentral offers Internet
access from $21.95 to $80 a month (depending on the speed), domain
name registration for $35 a year and, coming soon, Web site
building and hosting services with prices starting at $19.95 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   BCentral's marketing services come in packages for $19.99 a
month to $599 a year. Offerings also are available a la carte:
</P>
<P>
   Web site listings on up to 400 search engines for $59.
</P>
<P>
   Affordable ads for as little as $100 on leading Web sites such
as Yahoo and MSN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Free ad exchanges with 450,000 other business Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Affiliate program in which a business pays a fee to other Web
sites that send it customers.
</P>
<P>
   BCentral also offers services to help small businesses manage
their online operations: shopping for office supplies, comparing
shipping rates, booking business travel and checking customers'
credit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Amy Ossenbruggen, who recently started the Amy Oh Designs
jewelry business in San Francisco, is a fan of several bCentral
online tools, including ClickTrade, Banner Network to swap ads with
other online sites and ListBot to build an online customer mailing
list. The services ``are useful in building clientele and keeping
in touch with your customers,'' Ossenbruggen said.
</P>
<P>
   But another San Francisco merchant has yet to commit. Pete
Mulvihill, general manager of Green Apple Books and Music on
Clement Street, said he was approached by Microsoft and is
intrigued by it bCentral services.
</P>
<P>
   But he is uncertain just which bCentral plan to buy. With 20,000
used books in inventory, he figures bCentral's most basic plan is
insufficient and its most expensive plan may be more than he needs.

GEORGE AS CAPT. KIRK? IT'S
 `ULTIMATE TREK'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  (UNDATED) - It would be easy to
dismiss Ultimate Trek: Star Trek's Greatest Moments as a show that
appeals only to hard-core fans of the series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what's the point? That's true of all Star Trek shows from
the original to the ensuing knockoffs. Trekkies love all things
Trek; the rest of us scratch our heads and wonder whether a pocket
protector is really a necessary fashion accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there have been some strong television moments in the
four series. And the goal of Ultimate Trek is to dole those out in
easy-to-digest snippets: ``Ultimate Time-Travel Moments,''
``Ultimate Vil lains,'' ``Ultimate One-Liners,'' that kind of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   As a concept, it's rather spotty. If you buy into the whole Star
Trek universe, it's a show that demands your attention for an
entire hour. Whatever merits any of the series have, limited though
they may be, are lost in the cut-and-paste format.
</P>
<P>
   But Ultimate Trek is still worth watching even if you don't know
that Tiberius is James Kirk's middle name, and the reason is
simple: Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved Alexander as George Costanza on Seinfeld, wait till
you catch him as Capt. Kirk. He appears as the captain of the
Enterprise during bits that set up the clips - something about how
a Y2K bug will destroy the Star Trek signal, a development he and
Spock and Dr. McCoy must prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the specious plot. Just sit back and enjoy Alexander, who
has William Shatner's bizarre acting mannerisms down cold. The
goofy toupee and the too-tight shirt are just gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Gravy for the viewer, that is. Al exander said seeing himself
squeezed into the captain's outfit made a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I not only started a crash diet, I'm seriously considering
plastic surgery, liposuction, whatever it takes,'' he said in a
conference call last week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a moment that Alexander is ridiculing Shatner in
his hilarious performance. Quite the contrary. As anyone who has
heard him on Howard Stern's radio show can attest, Alexander, who
once appeared in an episode of Star Trek: Voyager, is a
full-fledged Trekkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the original series goes and the films go, I'm damn
near an authority,'' he said. ``It would frighten you how much I
know about it. Because it certainly fright ens me.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Alexander tell it, Shatner is a major reason for his
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even want to be an actor,'' he said. ``I just wanted
to captain the Enterprise. I thought that was a wonderful career
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   One he now has achieved. Seriously, though, he loves Shatner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really, by and large, Shat ner's performance that took
these ridiculous production situations and turned them into rather
compelling stories,'' Alexander said. ``He was so invested in the
importance - the universal importance - of that stuff that it
really made it very, very exciting work.''
</P>
<P>
   If he sounds like a Frenchman talking about Jerry Lewis, you
should hear Alexander rave about why the show remains popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Trek really does its home work as far as its science
goes and its commitment to pulling off effects and pulling off the
creation of the physical world of the future,'' he said. ``I think
true, die-hard science-fiction fans like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always has a sense of humor about itself. It's also always
had a sense of not importance as much as a mission, in a way. All
the series have tried to tackle issues that are relevant to all of
us and to do it in a way that encompasses this entertainment. And
because they're able to abstract it into this future world, it
seems to have very little threat to a viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Fan. Big fan. So much so that Alexander contends that his
acting is full of Shatner's quirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever see me do stage work or some of my more dramatic
work, you will actually notice that I have inherited that sort of
halting, search ing, staccato rhythm of Shatner from time to
time,'' Alexander said, ``his emphasis on unusual parts of any
given line of dialogue. . . . Not the larger-than-life movements
that he does but some of the smaller tics, I actually sort of
picked up. I have to concentrate not to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has played his dream role, perhaps Alexander can
answer the ultimate Star Trek question: What accounts for pudgy
Capt. Kirk's status as an interspecies babe magnet?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great line in one of the Batman films where a girl
is coming on to Batman and he says, `It must be the car. Chicks
love the car.' It might be true of the ship. He's got a pretty
impressive ship there that he's totally in charge of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the sense of command. . . . It could be he's got
that little phaser thing on the hip. It could be the flying double
drop-kick. I don't know. It may be just all in his attitude. But
whatever it is, it sure as hell is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it fails to work for Alexander's Kirk during an Ultimate
Trek bit, one that contains the best moment of the show. When Kirk,
Spock and McCoy see Borg Lingerie, they naturally assume it's a
shop run by the evil Borg. Rushing inside, they are instead greeted
by several beauti ful women wearing bras and panties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it been seven years already?'' the Spock character asks,
and that tells you all you need to know. If you get that joke,
you'll love Ultimate Trek. If you don't, you'll wonder what all the
fuss is over.

TAXPAYERS TO GET LESS BANG FOR MORE BUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Phoenix taxpayers may foot much of the $1.5 million
tab for the city's downtown New Year's Eve bash.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll get less bang for their buck.
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go, Phoenix Celebration 2000 was dramatically
scaled back because corporate sponsors were reluctant to kick in
money.
</P>
<P>
   The party's planning committee also has met behind closed doors
since July, skirting the Arizona Open Meeting Law, even though it's
spending $525,000 of city money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two years of planning, the glitches are not altogether
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city said it wanted a millennium event that would be very
big scale, that would be affordable to virtually everyone in the
city, and that's a tough thing to pull off,'' said Grant Woods,
chairman of the party's planning committee, Citizens for the
Community Celebration Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The New Year's Eve party will feature 34 bands, including the
Gin Blossoms, Three Dog Night and Waylon Jennings, on three stages
in downtown Phoenix. Tickets are $10 in advance and $15 on the day
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the event originally was a much grander affair. Six stages
were to feature a variety of acts from the decades of the 1940s and
on.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in early September when it became clear that
corporate sponsors weren't kicking in the money to defray the
original cost estimate of $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent that somewhere, somehow they were going to
have to pare down the number of acts, the physical size and the
special effects,'' said Mike Whiting, a city administrator in
charge of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Nov. 29, the committee had raised $245,000, a far
cry from the $2 million originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   With the downscaled event came contracts that the committee
suddenly couldn't afford to honor. But in doing so, the committee
and city staff angered the agents that had lined up 15 entertainers
that were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said they were canceling the contracts, I told them
they couldn't do that,'' said Charlie Johnston, who, as owner of
Select Artists Associates and a committee member, had negotiated
for the acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Grant (Woods), `You're going to get a lot of lawsuits.'
''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Two weeks after they were canceled, the talent
agency representing three bands fired off a terse letter to Phoenix
Mayor Skip Rimsza, demanding that its $100,000 contract be honored.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent letters from the William Morris Agency made it clear
that it would sue to get its money. The city later caved in, and
the bands will perform as part of the Celebration 2000 party.
</P>
<P>
   The flap prompted Johnston, a volunteer on the original panel
and its successor, to resign and demand that his name be taken off
all the committee's bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`ve been in business for 34 years. My credibility was on the
line. It was a devasting experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston also wasn't happy with the way the committee's
accounting was handled.
</P>
<P>
   City records indicate that the committee filed its articles of
incorporation as a non-profit, tax-exempt entity with the Arizona
Corporation Commission in April. In mid-June, the city gave the
committee a $25,000 grant as seed money.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the city lent the committee $500,000 with the
stipulation that $100,000 be repaid before the Celebration 2000
party.
</P>
<P>
   But those transfers took place before the city had officially
contracted with the committee to host the party.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he wasn't comfortable with the financial setup.
</P>
<P>
   It also is unclear whether the committee will be able to repay
the balance of the $500,000 loan.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent budget for the event puts the party's costs at
nearly $1.5 million, with more than $824,000 going to the artists,
accommodations and booking agents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the committee plans to do in the case of a shortfall,
the city's Whiting said, ``I prefer to just think we're going to be
very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods had a different answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city will pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the party makes or loses money depends, in large part,
on how many people show up for it.
</P>
<P>
   The panel estimates 115,000 people will attend, which may be
overly optimistic for a first-time event. Across town, organizers
of the Tempe Block Party are expecting 150,000 for its 15th annual
bash.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers of both events admit that estimating crowds this
year is tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a one-time event, and we haven't done it before,''
Whiting said. ``But I think our estimates are very conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to sponsor a New Year's Eve bash next year for
what purists would call the real turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods has a suggestion if the city decides to go ahead with
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice for the next year is to reverse roles and have city
staff run the operation with input from a volunteer committee,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so would mean the city would have to request bids from
contractors and meet in public under the public open meetings law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll just have to do that,'' Woods said. ``It's too
difficult to do something this big (by) depending on volunteers.'' &QL;

PROTESTERS FACE DOWN POLICE, WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Withstanding tear gas, rubber pellets and nightsticks,
thousands of protesters faced down the World Trade Organization and
police in Seattle Tuesday, forcing authorities to order a curfew
and call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   After night fell, police swept through downtown, pushing
protesters out of the curfew area with a blanket of tear and pepper
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters forced cancellation of the WTO's opening ceremonies
Tuesday morning at the Paramount Theater and for much of the day
faced down out-numbered police on streets littered with the refuse
of chaos: protest signs, spent tear gas canisters and broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters all along planned to occupy downtown and to halt the
opening ceremonies. One protester summed up the day in white spray
paint on a bank's picture window, writing ``We win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who were protesting the opening of the WTO in fact were
successful today,'' admitted Police Chief Norm Stamper.
</P>
<P>
   The unrelenting, day-long street battles prompted Gov. Gary
Locke to call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether police were in control of the
demonstrations, Mayor Paul Schell _ who declared a state of civil
emergency and the 7 p.m.-7:30 a.m. curvew _ said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration had people who marched in the 60s _ the
last thing I wanted was to be mayor of a city that called in the
National Guard,'' Schell said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he nudged Stamper, who hemmed before saying, ``From a
public safety standpoint, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, protesters raged through the streets, while gangs used
the cover of chaos to commit strong-armed robberies and loot some
businesses, including a Starbucks at Sixth and Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 200 riot-trained Guardsmen who are to deploy
Wednesday, Locke also ordered 300 additional state troopers to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in modern history that the National Guard
has been called into Seattle, and the curfew is apparently the
first since World War II, when a U.S. Army general ordered
Japanese-Americans off the streets at night.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper defended his 1,200 officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most respects it's gone the way we planned it to,'' he told
reporters. ``Seattle has not stopped being a city because there are
demonstrators on its streets. We obviously had to draw lines when a
demonstration reaches a point where ... public safety is placed at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   While the police had been in negotiations with dozens of protest
groups for months, the chief said the city underestimated the
number who hadn't asked permission to demonstrate and were bent on
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the National Guard was a ``last-ditch'' contingency.
</P>
<P>
   Police made only 22 arrests before the curfew, but Schell
rejected suggestions that mass arrests would have defused the
melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just arrest people for no reason,'' Schell said. He
also suggested the city lacked room to house an army of detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Top Clinton administration officials, meanwhile, declined to
criticize Seattle officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city today faced a very difficult situation,'' said Gene
Sperling, a national economic adviser. ``None of us ... have the
facts to try to second-guess and critique the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Though protesters seemed to be everywhere, few took part in
violence, broke windows, painted slogans on walls our fought
police. On some street corners, spontaneous carnivals broke out.
People danced. Jugglers juggled, and a woman practiced her
Hula-hoop. A young man strode through the crowd on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really bummed out that a few hundred out-of-control
protesters are undermining the important, peaceful message brought
downtown today by tens of thousands of demonstators,'' said an
exhausted Ron Judd, executive secretary of the King County Labor
Council-AFL-CIO after 25,000 union members marched through
downtown. ``A hundred and fifty out-of-control anarchists that we
suspected all along might be a problem are getting all the
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd said some of the anarchists had taken labor signs and were
pretending to be union members.
</P>
<P>
   Most protesters had also cleared out of downtown by the time
police began enforcing the curfew between Interstate 5 and the
waterfront and Yessler Way north to Denny Way.
</P>
<P>
   After dark, police moved west down Pike Street to the Seattle
Sheraton, shooting flash-bang concussion grenades and tear gas at a
crowd of more than 1,000. Two platoons of police in riot gear
followed protesters down Pike Street, firing tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cleaning the streets,'' one police officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors, stopped at Third and Pike, screamed in response:
``Animals, you animals, go back to your jungle, you animals!''
</P>
<P>
   King County Sheriff's Sgt. H.F. McLauchlan wasn't taking it
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go home at night, and take this uniform off, who am I?
I'm just like them. But right now they are talking to a uniform and
not me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who set off the riot was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a medic for the protesters all day long,'' said a
Colorado man named Bob. ``And even though I saw some things people
might say were violent, I think the police over reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, police shot tear gas into a peaceful crowd and
at a lone protester at Pine and Fifth who was simply waving a
Mexican flag.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Lewis, an 18-year-old journalism student from Emory
College in Atlanta, was standing on trash can when tear gas hit her
full in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't supposed to happen to us,'' she said through tears,
sitting on the sidewalk while two women rinsed her eyes with
saline.
</P>
<P>
   At Fourth and Pike, five overturned trash containers littered
the intersection, and was was set ablaze as the echo of tear gas
guns sounded in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a good night to go shopping,'' deadpanned a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tried to go about their business risked being drawn
into the mess. Late in the day, protesters at Sixth and Stewart
hijacked an Emerald City Garbage Disposal truck on its way to the
dump, blocking it with newspapers and trash cans to use it for
protection against police.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck, whose name was not known Tuesday, said
over his cellular telephone that he felt annoyed, not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us have got to go to work,'' he told a reporter. ``I
wish they (the police) would use tear gas so I can just go.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver later moved the debris and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of Ben Bridge Jewelers at Fourth and Union looked at
the crowd of protestors and police just outside the bars of his
closed shop, shaking his head and rubbing eyes stinging with tear
gas.a
</P>
<P>
   Most downtown businesses closed early, though Emmanuel
Marianakis, owner of Olympic Broiler, said he planned to stay open
until the authorities told him to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter whether they're demonstrators or with WTO, they have
to eat,'' said Marianakis, ``And I sell food.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Metro buses were boarded by protesters who assaulted
drivers, pulled battery plugs and slashed tires, said King County
Executive Ron Sims. More security will be on the buses Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to rumors that the WTO would leave Seattle, Terry
Laggner-Brown, spokeswoman for the Washington Council of
International Trade, denied the rumors. The council brought the WTO
to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing here in the WTO press office, and I can assure
you that this meeting will continue,'' she said. ``It's taking
place as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from 135 countries were prevented from attending
meetings at the Paramount in the morning, but business proceedings
were held in the afternoon as police squeezed delegates through
lines of protesters to the Washington Trade and Convention Center.
Some delegates were mauled in the process, but none were reported
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The National Lawyers Guild faxed an angry letter to Schell
Tuesday afternoon, complaining of excessive police force. The
guild, with 150 legalers at the protests, claimed rubber
bullets were fired by police at lest twice and said officers beat a
television cameraman and chased down a woman to dose her with
pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper refused to confirm that rubber bullets were used, but
other officials said much smaller and less-dangerous rubber pellets
and bean bags were used. The non-lethal methods are often used in
crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   There were apparently no serious injuries, though Harborview
Medical Center treated three people who had been gassed. Virginia
Mason Medical Center treated five for gas and one for a minor
rubber pellet injury. Swedish Medical Center treated three for gas
and one for injuries from a fistfight.
</P>
<P>
   The huge and orderly labor march seemed to calm things mid-day,
but violence flared later on Fourth Avenue near Pike and Union
Streets. It began when a small group of self-styled anarchists
started throwing bottles at police, and used hammers and crowbars
to shatter store windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right to hurt someone,'' said Rain, a
17-year-old who joined in the rampage. ``But property destruction
is not violent ... And we're not just going to lay down and say,
``Peace, Love, let me give you a flower, piggie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters from a variety of groups, labor marchers and
University of Washington students then set trash containers and
protest signs afire. King County deputies responded by lobbing in a
dozen tear-gas grenandes.
</P>
<P>
   Young people were running, rubbing their eyes, but other
protesters rushed to take their place and the deputies threw more
canisters. Some protesters tossed the canisters back.
</P>
<P>
   Windows were broken at the Bank of America on Pike between
Fourth and Fifth, as well as at Starbucks, Washington Mutual Bank,
Warner Bros., Banana Republic, Nordstrom, FAO Schwartz and
McDonald's. A red ``A'' _ the symbol for anarchy _ was
spray-painted on some buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Windows were ``tagged'' with spray paint and broken at the
Eileen Fisher women's clothing store on Sixth, and at the Speedo
store three doors down.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I heard a `pop,''' said Chuck Kroll, manager
said of Speedo store. ``I said to myself, `Welcome to the WTO!'''
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of another downtown building, someone painted in
black, ``We are winning, don't forget.''

POLLUTION ALERT IS ON FOR THE PHOENIX AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - For the first time in four years, Phoenix area
pollution levels for carbon monoxide violated federal health
standards on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The violation triggered a high-pollution alert that will last
through at least 10 a.m. today, Dec. 1. If a second reading above
federal health standards is recorded this year, Phoenix's hopes of
shedding its ``serious'' label for carbon monoxide will be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in pollution readings at a west-central Phoenix site
surprised and perplexed air-quality officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sharp peak,'' said Jo Crumbaker, air-quality
manager for Maricopa County's Environmental Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, carbon monoxide levels build gradually, fueled by
vehicle exhaust trapped in stagnant air. But Monday's, Nov. 29,
midday reading of 6.8 parts per million had jumped to 9.9 ppm by 11
p.m. and peaked at 10.5 ppm by 1 a.m. Tuesday, Nov. 30. Readings
exceeding 9 ppm are unhealthful, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The high readings were recorded by a pollution monitor near the
intersection of Grand Avenue, Thomas Road and 27th Avenue. Because
the two high readings occurred within the same time frame, they
count as one violation.
</P>
<P>
   Crumbaker said county environmental officials don't know why the
carbon monoxide readings jumped so far, so fast. A quick check
Tuesday, Nov. 30, showed the monitor was working properly.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of high readings likely would doom attempts to
get the EPA to reclassify the Phoenix area's carbon monoxide levels
and declare them in compliance with health standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area also is rated ``serious'' for ozone and
particulate pollution, and prospects for complying with federal
standards are dim. In November, the EPA said it would impose limits
on new or expanding businesses by March unless the Phoenix could
come up with a sufficient plan to fight particulate pollution. By
September, Arizona could face the loss of federal
highway-construction funds if a plan is not in place.
</P>
<P>
   During the high-pollution advisory, Phoenix area residents are
asked to reduce their driving and to use transit, carpool or
combine their trips. A ban on wood-burning fireplaces also is in
effect, except for those homes with EPA-approved wood stoves and
fireplace inserts. &QL;

   (PHOENIX) - Rob Evans quit his pack-a-day habit when a heart
attack nearly killed him in 1990. Now, out of the blue, R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. is mailing him free packs of Winstons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' the 51-year-old Tempe social worker said
Tuesday, Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   So were other Phoenix area residents who within the past month
received unsolicited canisters or book-size parcels containing two
to four packets of cigarettes. One of the recipients was a woman
whose toddler opened the family mail to find the free smokes.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the complaints of Evans and several others, Arizona
Attorney General Janet Napolitano has demanded an explanation from
R.J. Reynolds and threatened to get a court order to stop the
mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano accused the tobacco company of violating an agreement
to settle a lawsuit by Arizona and other states for the health care
costs of poor people who smoke. The agreement bans any marketing
that could put cigarettes into the hands of anyone under 21.
</P>
<P>
   She also announced a hotline set up to log complaints from the
public. The number is (602) 542-5763 and, for people living out of
the Phoenix area, toll-free 1-800-352-8431.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds representative John Singleton said no cigarettes
should have been mailed to anyone who had not certified in writing
that he was 21 or older. ``What we're being accused of wouldn't
happen under our procedures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Christensen of the Arizona Department of Health Services
said the state spends about $15 million a year on advertising to
prevent young people from smoking. ``Suddenly, there's this
scheme,'' he said. ``Providing addiction starter kits. This is
really amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The toddler's mother, whose name was not released by
Napolitano's office, fumed in a complaint to the attorney general.
``Did you know that my 4-year-old was playing with cigarettes?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano said other complaints came from people who had quit
smoking for health reasons or were taking medication to end their
nicotine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has yet to ratify its $3 billion share of the master
settlement because of a dispute in the state Supreme Court over
claims by Maricopa and other counties for a 32 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   That does not prevent Arizona from seeking a court order to stop
the cigarette mailings as well as seeking a possible civil fine,
Napolitano said. She has demanded a meeting with R.J. Reynolds
officials, as required by the master lawsuit settlement, before
taking court action.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said R.J. Reynolds will explain the cigarette mailing.
``It is our intention to comply with the letter and the spirit of
the master settlement in every aspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are thinly disguised efforts to target youth,'' she
said. ``To get kids who may pick them up in the mail first _ to get
them to start smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The mailings are addressed to specific individuals and contain a
``Dear Smoker'' questionnaire that asks the recipient to respond
after smoking ``enough of the cigarettes to form an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it means `form an addiction,' '' Napolitano said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said his 20-year-old son is trying desperately to quit
smoking. ``I can't imagine that these tobacco companies conceive
that it would be OK to send these cigarettes through the mail,'' he
said. &QL;

GEORGE AS CAPT. KIRK? IT'S
 `ULTIMATE TREK'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  (UNDATED) - It would be easy to
dismiss Ultimate Trek: Star Trek's Greatest Moments as a show that
appeals only to hard-core fans of the series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what's the point? That's true of all Star Trek shows from
the original to the ensuing knockoffs. Trekkies love all things
Trek; the rest of us scratch our heads and wonder whether a pocket
protector is really a necessary fashion accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there have been some strong television moments in the
four series. And the goal of Ultimate Trek is to dole those out in
easy-to-digest snippets: ``Ultimate Time-Travel Moments,''
``Ultimate Vil lains,'' ``Ultimate One-Liners,'' that kind of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   As a concept, it's rather spotty. If you buy into the whole Star
Trek universe, it's a show that demands your attention for an
entire hour. Whatever merits any of the series have, limited though
they may be, are lost in the cut-and-paste format.
</P>
<P>
   But Ultimate Trek is still worth watching even if you don't know
that Tiberius is James Kirk's middle name, and the reason is
simple: Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   If you loved Alexander as George Costanza on Seinfeld, wait till
you catch him as Capt. Kirk. He appears as the captain of the
Enterprise during bits that set up the clips - something about how
a Y2K bug will destroy the Star Trek signal, a development he and
Spock and Dr. McCoy must prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the specious plot. Just sit back and enjoy Alexander, who
has William Shatner's bizarre acting mannerisms down cold. The
goofy toupee and the too-tight shirt are just gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Gravy for the viewer, that is. Al exander said seeing himself
squeezed into the captain's outfit made a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I not only started a crash diet, I'm seriously considering
plastic surgery, liposuction, whatever it takes,'' he said in a
conference call last week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a moment that Alexander is ridiculing Shatner in
his hilarious performance. Quite the contrary. As anyone who has
heard him on Howard Stern's radio show can attest, Alexander, who
once appeared in an episode of Star Trek: Voyager, is a
full-fledged Trekkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the original series goes and the films go, I'm damn
near an authority,'' he said. ``It would frighten you how much I
know about it. Because it certainly fright ens me.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Alexander tell it, Shatner is a major reason for his
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even want to be an actor,'' he said. ``I just wanted
to captain the Enterprise. I thought that was a wonderful career
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   One he now has achieved. Seriously, though, he loves Shatner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really, by and large, Shat ner's performance that took
these ridiculous production situations and turned them into rather
compelling stories,'' Alexander said. ``He was so invested in the
importance - the universal importance - of that stuff that it
really made it very, very exciting work.''
</P>
<P>
   If he sounds like a Frenchman talking about Jerry Lewis, you
should hear Alexander rave about why the show remains popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Trek really does its home work as far as its science
goes and its commitment to pulling off effects and pulling off the
creation of the physical world of the future,'' he said. ``I think
true, die-hard science-fiction fans like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always has a sense of humor about itself. It's also always
had a sense of not importance as much as a mission, in a way. All
the series have tried to tackle issues that are relevant to all of
us and to do it in a way that encompasses this entertainment. And
because they're able to abstract it into this future world, it
seems to have very little threat to a viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Fan. Big fan. So much so that Alexander contends that his
acting is full of Shatner's quirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever see me do stage work or some of my more dramatic
work, you will actually notice that I have inherited that sort of
halting, search ing, staccato rhythm of Shatner from time to
time,'' Alexander said, ``his emphasis on unusual parts of any
given line of dialogue. . . . Not the larger-than-life movements
that he does but some of the smaller tics, I actually sort of
picked up. I have to concentrate not to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has played his dream role, perhaps Alexander can
answer the ultimate Star Trek question: What accounts for pudgy
Capt. Kirk's status as an interspecies babe magnet?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great line in one of the Batman films where a girl
is coming on to Batman and he says, `It must be the car. Chicks
love the car.' It might be true of the ship. He's got a pretty
impressive ship there that he's totally in charge of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the sense of command. . . . It could be he's got
that little phaser thing on the hip. It could be the flying double
drop-kick. I don't know. It may be just all in his attitude. But
whatever it is, it sure as hell is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it fails to work for Alexander's Kirk during an Ultimate
Trek bit, one that contains the best moment of the show. When Kirk,
Spock and McCoy see Borg Lingerie, they naturally assume it's a
shop run by the evil Borg. Rushing inside, they are instead greeted
by several beauti ful women wearing bras and panties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it been seven years already?'' the Spock character asks,
and that tells you all you need to know. If you get that joke,
you'll love Ultimate Trek. If you don't, you'll wonder what all the
fuss is over.

NETS COLLAPSE, LOSE TO WIZARDS, 85-78 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Nets lost a 15-point lead in the
third quarter, they lost their offense in the closing minutes, and
they lost another disheartening game. Failing to score for more
than five minutes down the stretch, the woeful Nets (2-13) were
beaten by the Washington Wizards, 85-78, Tuesday night at
Continental Arena. It was the Nets' 10th loss in their last 11
games, and this defeat was more painful because they actually
controlled play for most of the game, before scoring just 11 points
in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With the game hanging in the balance, the Nets collapsed. After
a tip-in by Jamie Feick gave the Nets a 77-73 lead with 5 minutes
53 seconds to play, they never scored another field goal. Every
Nets player in the game faltered down the stretch, from Keith Van
Horn, who had a game-high 24 points but missed a crucial jumper, to
Stephon Marbury (14 points), who had two turnovers and missed a
3-pointer during the final four minutes. As the Nets looked at each
other and waited for someone to step forward, nobody did. The
Wizards (5-10) are one of the two teams the Nets have beaten this
season, but the Nets found still another way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Washington took its first lead since the first quarter on a
3-point play by Juwan Howard (23 points) as he made a layup while
being fouled by Johnny Newman with 4:25 left. Howard added the free
throw to put the Wizards ahead, 78-77, and one could sense the Nets
wilting.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton (14 points), a rookie from the University of
Connecticut, followed with a key 3-pointer that gave Washington an
81-77 lead with 2:39 left. After both teams missed shots, Feick (15
points, 16 rebounds) made one of two free throws to cut
Washington's lead to 81-78 with 48.1 seconds left, but New Jersey
scored no more.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Williams provided the final dagger when he made a
sensational over-the-shoulder tip-in of an air ball by Tracy
Murray; it gave the Wizards an 83-78 lead with 24.9 seconds to
play. The Nets called a timeout and huddled dejectedly around their
beleaguered head coach, Don Casey, but it was another night when
neither Casey nor his players had answers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets led by 67-52 late in the third quarter, but Washington
closed within 67-59 by the start of the fourth quarter, setting the
stage for its come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   Playing one of their strongest halves of the season, the Nets
controlled play and led, 49-35. There were two keys for the Nets:
the return of Kerry Kittles, and the return of Van Horn's jump
shot.
</P>
<P>
   In only his second game this season, and his first game since
Nov. 15, Kittles tested his sore right knee and looked as if he had
hardly been away. Kittles started at shooting guard, made his first
two shots and contributed 8 first-half points in 18 solid minutes.
Though he wore a protective wrap on his knee, Kittles ran without a
limp, moved well and elevated strongly on his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a lot of practice time, but I have to go out and
see what I can do,'' Kittles said before the game. ``This is like
my everything _ my practice, my training camp, my preseason. The
difference is, these are real games.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kittles finished the game with those same 8 points in 33
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn broke a shooting slump to lead all first-half scorers
with 16 points but finished 7 for 20.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nets' injury woes continued. Their starting center, Jim
McIlvaine, bruised his back in a hard first-quarter fall and did
not return. The backup guard Lucious Harris (stomach flu) was also
forced to leave in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   When the second half began, the Nets had just nine available
players. The injured Jayson Williams, Kendall Gill and Scott
Burrell were on the bench in street clothes, and Casey wondered
what else could go wrong. ``Am I paying for past sins?'' Casey said
as he passed the scorer's table before the second half.

PROTESTERS FACE DOWN POLICE, WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Withstanding tear gas, rubber pellets and nightsticks,
thousands of protesters faced down the World Trade Organization and
police in Seattle Tuesday, forcing authorities to order a curfew
and call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   After night fell, police swept through downtown, pushing
protesters out of the curfew area with a blanket of tear and pepper
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters forced cancellation of the WTO's opening ceremonies
Tuesday morning at the Paramount Theater and for much of the day
faced down out-numbered police on streets littered with the refuse
of chaos: protest signs, spent tear gas canisters and broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters all along planned to occupy downtown and to halt the
opening ceremonies. One protester summed up the day in white spray
paint on a bank's picture window, writing ``We win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who were protesting the opening of the WTO in fact were
successful today,'' admitted Police Chief Norm Stamper.
</P>
<P>
   The unrelenting, day-long street battles prompted Gov. Gary
Locke to call out the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether police were in control of the
demonstrations, Mayor Paul Schell _ who declared a state of civil
emergency and the 7 p.m.-7:30 a.m. curvew _ said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration had people who marched in the 60s _ the
last thing I wanted was to be mayor of a city that called in the
National Guard,'' Schell said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he nudged Stamper, who hemmed before saying, ``From a
public safety standpoint, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, protesters raged through the streets, while gangs used
the cover of chaos to commit strong-armed robberies and loot some
businesses, including a Starbucks at Sixth and Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 200 riot-trained Guardsmen who are to deploy
Wednesday, Locke also ordered 300 additional state troopers to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in modern history that the National Guard
has been called into Seattle, and the curfew is apparently the
first since World War II, when a U.S. Army general ordered
Japanese-Americans off the streets at night.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper defended his 1,200 officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most respects it's gone the way we planned it to,'' he told
reporters. ``Seattle has not stopped being a city because there are
demonstrators on its streets. We obviously had to draw lines when a
demonstration reaches a point where ... public safety is placed at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   While the police had been in negotiations with dozens of protest
groups for months, the chief said the city underestimated the
number who hadn't asked permission to demonstrate and were bent on
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the National Guard was a ``last-ditch'' contingency.
</P>
<P>
   Police made only 22 arrests before the curfew, but Schell
rejected suggestions that mass arrests would have defused the
melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just arrest people for no reason,'' Schell said. He
also suggested the city lacked room to house an army of detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Top Clinton administration officials, meanwhile, declined to
criticize Seattle officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city today faced a very difficult situation,'' said Gene
Sperling, a national economic adviser. ``None of us ... have the
facts to try to second-guess and critique the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Though protesters seemed to be everywhere, few took part in
violence, broke windows, painted slogans on walls our fought
police. On some street corners, spontaneous carnivals broke out.
People danced. Jugglers juggled, and a woman practiced her
Hula-hoop. A young man strode through the crowd on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really bummed out that a few hundred out-of-control
protesters are undermining the important, peaceful message brought
downtown today by tens of thousands of demonstators,'' said an
exhausted Ron Judd, executive secretary of the King County Labor
Council-AFL-CIO after 25,000 union members marched through
downtown. ``A hundred and fifty out-of-control anarchists that we
suspected all along might be a problem are getting all the
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd said some of the anarchists had taken labor signs and were
pretending to be union members.
</P>
<P>
   Most protesters had also cleared out of downtown by the time
police began enforcing the curfew between Interstate 5 and the
waterfront and Yessler Way north to Denny Way.
</P>
<P>
   After dark, police moved west down Pike Street to the Seattle
Sheraton, shooting flash-bang concussion grenades and tear gas at a
crowd of more than 1,000. Two platoons of police in riot gear
followed protesters down Pike Street, firing tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cleaning the streets,'' one police officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors, stopped at Third and Pike, screamed in response:
``Animals, you animals, go back to your jungle, you animals!''
</P>
<P>
   King County Sheriff's Sgt. H.F. McLauchlan wasn't taking it
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go home at night, and take this uniform off, who am I?
I'm just like them. But right now they are talking to a uniform and
not me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who set off the riot was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a medic for the protesters all day long,'' said a
Colorado man named Bob. ``And even though I saw some things people
might say were violent, I think the police over reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, police shot tear gas into a peaceful crowd and
at a lone protester at Pine and Fifth who was simply waving a
Mexican flag.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Lewis, an 18-year-old journalism student from Emory
College in Atlanta, was standing on trash can when tear gas hit her
full in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't supposed to happen to us,'' she said through tears,
sitting on the sidewalk while two women rinsed her eyes with
saline.
</P>
<P>
   At Fourth and Pike, five overturned trash containers littered
the intersection, and was was set ablaze as the echo of tear gas
guns sounded in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a good night to go shopping,'' deadpanned a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tried to go about their business risked being drawn
into the mess. Late in the day, protesters at Sixth and Stewart
hijacked an Emerald City Garbage Disposal truck on its way to the
dump, blocking it with newspapers and trash cans to use it for
protection against police.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck, whose name was not known Tuesday, said
over his cellular telephone that he felt annoyed, not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us have got to go to work,'' he told a reporter. ``I
wish they (the police) would use tear gas so I can just go.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver later moved the debris and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of Ben Bridge Jewelers at Fourth and Union looked at
the crowd of protestors and police just outside the bars of his
closed shop, shaking his head and rubbing eyes stinging with tear
gas.a
</P>
<P>
   Most downtown businesses closed early, though Emmanuel
Marianakis, owner of Olympic Broiler, said he planned to stay open
until the authorities told him to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter whether they're demonstrators or with WTO, they have
to eat,'' said Marianakis, ``And I sell food.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Metro buses were boarded by protesters who assaulted
drivers, pulled battery plugs and slashed tires, said King County
Executive Ron Sims. More security will be on the buses Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to rumors that the WTO would leave Seattle, Terry
Laggner-Brown, spokeswoman for the Washington Council of
International Trade, denied the rumors. The council brought the WTO
to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing here in the WTO press office, and I can assure
you that this meeting will continue,'' she said. ``It's taking
place as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from 135 countries were prevented from attending
meetings at the Paramount in the morning, but business proceedings
were held in the afternoon as police squeezed delegates through
lines of protesters to the Washington Trade and Convention Center.
Some delegates were mauled in the process, but none were reported
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The National Lawyers Guild faxed an angry letter to Schell
Tuesday afternoon, complaining of excessive police force. The
guild, with 150 legal observers at the protests, claimed rubber
bullets were fired by police at lest twice and said officers beat a
television cameraman and chased down a woman to dose her with
pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper refused to confirm that rubber bullets were used, but
other officials said much smaller and less-dangerous rubber pellets
and bean bags were used. The non-lethal methods are often used in
crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   There were apparently no serious injuries, though Harborview
Medical Center treated three people who had been gassed. Virginia
Mason Medical Center treated five for gas and one for a minor
rubber pellet injury. Swedish Medical Center treated three for gas
and one for injuries from a fistfight.
</P>
<P>
   The huge and orderly labor march seemed to calm things mid-day,
but violence flared later on Fourth Avenue near Pike and Union
Streets. It began when a small group of self-styled anarchists
started throwing bottles at police, and used hammers and crowbars
to shatter store windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right to hurt someone,'' said Rain, a
17-year-old who joined in the rampage. ``But property destruction
is not violent ... And we're not just going to lay down and say,
``Peace, Love, let me give you a flower, piggie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters from a variety of groups, labor marchers and
University of Washington students then set trash containers and
protest signs afire. King County deputies responded by lobbing in a
dozen tear-gas grenandes.
</P>
<P>
   Young people were running, rubbing their eyes, but other
protesters rushed to take their place and the deputies threw more
canisters. Some protesters tossed the canisters back.
</P>
<P>
   Windows were broken at the Bank of America on Pike between
Fourth and Fifth, as well as at Starbucks, Washington Mutual Bank,
Warner Bros., Banana Republic, Nordstrom, FAO Schwartz and
McDonald's. A red ``A'' _ the symbol for anarchy _ was
spray-painted on some buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Windows were ``tagged'' with spray paint and broken at the
Eileen Fisher women's clothing store on Sixth, and at the Speedo
store three doors down.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I heard a `pop,''' said Chuck Kroll, manager
said of Speedo store. ``I said to myself, `Welcome to the WTO!'''
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of another downtown building, someone painted in
black, ``We are winning, don't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters D. Parvaz, Vanessa Ho, Kimberly A.C. Wilson, Mike
Barber, Angela Galloway, Robert L. Jamieson Jr., Judd Slivka, Tom
Paulson, Kristin Dizon, Ruth Schubert, George Foster, Heath Foster,

NYC POLICE CHARGE PANHANDLER IN BRICK ATTACK ON WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A panhandler with a criminal record that stretches
back nearly two decades was arrested Tuesday and charged with
attempted murder in the Nov. 16 brick attack of a young woman on a
midtown Manhattan street after a witness to the assault identified
him in a lineup, police officials said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by police as Paris Drake, 31, was charged
with attempted murder in the second-degree, assault and weapons
possession in the attack, which left Nicole Barrett, a 27-year-old
office worker, with a critical head injury that required two
operations at Bellevue Hospital Center. Drake was expected to be
arraigned Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced the arrest late
Tuesday night at the Midtown South police precinct on West 35th
Street, where he heralded the work of detectives and said he had
told the Barrett family of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped and saw the Barrett family before coming here,''
Safir said. ``I'm not going to tell you what they said, but you can
probably guess that they were relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The highly publicized attack immediately led to speculation by
police that a person who was homeless and possibly mentally ill was
responsible, and three days later Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration announced that the homeless had no right to sleep on
city streets and would face arrest for refusing shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Although police arrested more than 100 homeless people since the
measure was announced, city officials said Tuesday that it was not
clear if Drake was homeless, nor was there any indication that he
had a history of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Beck, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless
Services, checked the department's computer data base and said
there was no record that Drake had ever been in the city's homeless
shelter system.
</P>
<P>
   Drake became a prime suspect when an inmate on Rikers Island
told the authorities that Drake, who had been arrested Nov. 23 on a
low-level drug charge and was being held on Rikers, bragged about
the attack to the inmate, said law enforcement officials. The
inmate was released into the custody of detectives, who drove him
around midtown Monday until he spotted Drake at the Port Authority
Bus Terminal and pointed him out, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Drake underwent hours of questioning by detectives, police
officials said, and did not confess to the crime. But Tuesday, law
enforcement officials said one of several witnesses to the attack
brought in for a police lineup positively identified Drake as Ms.
Barrett's assailant. Investigators also believed that Drake closely
resembled the sketch of the suspect that was made public after the
attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, after Drake was first detained, however, prosecutors
from the Manhattan district attorney's Office were hesitant about
the police case because no one had positively identified Drake as
the assailant, said one law enforcement official. Early Tuesday,
prosecutors remained reluctant to file charges, the official said,
but then Drake was identified in the lineup and an assistant
district attorney arrived at the precinct to review evidence and
found it in order.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials also said Drake, with his long
criminal record, fit the profile of a violent and dangerous
criminal. First arrested in 1982, when he was 14, Drake would be
arrested nearly 21 more times, mostly on drug-related charges. He
has spent more than seven of the last 10 years in state prisons on
charges ranging from drug dealing to assaulting a prison guard.
Officials said that on every occasion, Drake's requests for early
parole were denied and he served the maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy that the parole board wanted to keep in. Every
opportunity it had, the parole board held him,'' said Tom Grant,
spokesman for the New York State Division of Parole. ``They had a
pretty good beat on him. It looks like he didn't do well in a
corrections setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Drake did find his way onto the street. This year, Drake _
after a finishing a prison term in upstate New York _ was arrested
at least twice on low-level drug charges, according to two law
enforcement officials. The latest arrest came Nov. 23, just six
days after the attack on Ms. Barrett, when Drake was sent to Rikers
on the drug charge. ``He has been a career criminal. He has a rap
sheet pages long,'' said a law enforcement official familiar with
Drake's record.
</P>
<P>
   Safir reiterated his criticism of the criminal justice system
Tuesday night, alluding to the fact that Drake had committed a
crime while on parole in the past. Drake was not on parole when Ms.
Barrett was attacked, however. ``You have to wonder about the
criminal justice system when someone like this is out on the
streets,'' said Safir, who has called for parole to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Drake used a paving stone to bash Ms. Barrett from
behind as she prepared to cross Madison Avenue at 42nd Street, an
unprovoked assault that reminded New Yorkers that despite the drop
in crime in recent years, random violence can easily shatter
perceptions of a safe city. The attack also cast a public eye on
the issue of mentally unstable homeless people because officials
initially believed the attacker was homeless, like several other
mentally disturbed people who in recent years have committed random
violent crimes that have brought attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrrett was admitted to Bellevue Hospital Center in
critical condition and underwent two operations to relieve the
pressure on her brain caused by a skull fracture she suffered. The
young woman, who received flowers and cards from hundreds of
well-wishers and was visited by Giuliani and Safir, has since been
moved out of the intensive care unit and is now alert and able to
talk with her family.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Downtown Seattle was placed under curfew, and the
National Guard was called in Tuesday after sometimes violent
protests by thousands of people forced a postponement of the
opening of a major international trade conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disorders, President Clinton was still scheduled to
arrive early Wednesday for the meeting of the World Trade
Organization, which he had hoped would showcase American leadership
on free trade. The global organization is meant to resolve trade
disputes and promote free trade, and the Seattle meeting is
intended to open a new round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters have descended on Seattle with an eclectic
array of grievances, most centered around the sentiment that the
trade organization is a handmaiden of corporate interests whose
rulings undermine health, labor and environmental protections
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day the protesters surrounded the convention hall,
pinned trade dignitaries in their hotels and stopped traffic on
several intersections. By late afternoon, there was a barrage of
tear gas canisters fired as Mayor Paul Schell declared a state of
emergency in the downtown area, asked for the National Guard and
ordered a curfew that would last until sunrise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, in announcing that he was calling in at least
200 troops from the state National Guard, said the troops were
``trained in crowd control'' and would be unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The police used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber pellets at
some intersections to break up the demonstrators. A small group of
men, dressed in black clothing and masks and ignoring cries of
``Shame on you!'' from other protesters, smashed windows and
spray-painted graffiti at downtown stores like Nordstrom, Niketown,
Starbucks and the Gap. Both were jarring sights in a city that
prides itself on its laid-back image.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other scheduled
speakers for opening ceremonies Tuesday morning were unable to get
through the crowd, which in many cases blocked intersections by
linking hands or lying down on the street.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of protesters already gathered downtown and about
20,000 additional marchers in a union-backed rally headed that way,
the trade body's director-general, Mike Moore, the former prime
minister of New Zealand, announced early Tuesday afternoon that the
opening ceremonies would be put off. But he vowed that the trade
talks would go on. In fact, he held meetings Tuesday with a few
trade ministers who managed to leave their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiating groups are in full swing,'' Moore said. ``This
conference will be a success.'' Outside, protesters chanted:
``Whose world? Our world! Whose streets? Our streets!''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction of the trade delegates here seemed to run the gamut,
from bewilderment to bemusement to, in some cases, anger. As
demonstrators shouted ``Go home! Go home!'' a German delegate,
Arnold Schwez, made his way back inside the Sheraton Hotel after he
could not get through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people don't understand the benefits of free trade to
the developing nations,'' Schwez said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday night, as Christmas lights and displays came on in
parts of downtown streets, demonstrators continued to hold their
position on the streets. A few fires, most set in trash cans,
burned in the street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day,'' Moore told reporters. ``To those who
argue that we should stop our work, I say: Tell that to the poor,
to the marginalized around the world who are looking to us to help
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Seattle police, Clem Benton, said Tuesday
evening that he could confirm at least 19 arrests of protesters on
Tuesday, several of whom were charged with assault. That number
appeared likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued to move through parts of downtown with armored
personnel carriers. As white clouds of tear gas passed down the
streets, protesters coughed, cried and asked for water. Farther
back, groups of demonstrators chanted: ``The whole world is
watching!''
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators said they believed the bursts of tear gas
were unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few instances, uniformed officers fired
rubber-coated capsules at protesters who the police believed were
charging police lines. The pellets, which the police said contained
chemical irritants, hit some of the protesters in the leg or the
arm, causing visible welts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here peacefully, we just want our message to be
heard,'' said Gloria Haselwander, a 21-year-old clerk in a Seattle
music store. She said she believes that the world trade group's
rulings contribute to environmental destruction and ever-greater
gaps between the world's richest people and its poorest. ``We kept
saying, `No violence, no violence,' but there was just this mass of
gas. My throat hurts, my lungs still hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Simpich, a lawyer from San Francisco, said most protesters
were intent on being nonviolent, but also were intent on continuing
their demonstrations until the trade body's procedures were
reformed to take account of health and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep marching until the process is open and until they
let the people in the door when the decisions are made,'' said
Simpich, who started his day in the rainy, predawn darkness by
gathering with other protesters in a park near the city's Pike
Place Market and then marching toward the convention hall. Rain
continued intermittently through the morning, but then stopped for
most of the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our goal,'' said Simpich, ``and one of these days it
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor King, who works in a bookstore in Edmonton, Alberta, said
he deplored the window-smashing and other acts of destruction, but
felt that they should not deter from the message of the thousands
who marched nonviolently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in most ways, the day was incredibly successful,''
said King, who was wearing a yellow rain slicker that proclaimed
the Seattle march to be the ``Protest of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mayor Schell and other city leaders, who had once eagerly
sought the meeting to showcase Seattle's role as a major exporter
in one of the most trade-dependent regions of the country, the
immediate focus Tuesday evening was simply on restoring order. But
they were bound to face questions in the days ahead about their
preparations for protests and, perhaps, to face conflicting bursts
of criticism about the police moving too harshly on the protesters
or not acting aggressively enough to head off the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators were clearly opposed to the
window-smashing and other destructive acts by a small knot of
protesters, most of whom were young men dressed in black, wearing
masks and declining to give their names when asked by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchy rules!'' said one, carrying a trash can down the
street and then using it to smash a window of a Starbucks coffee
shop.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday evening, both the mayor and the
city's police chief, Norm Stamper, said they respected the right of
protesters to gather here, and they blamed the violence on a small
percentage of those in the crowd. ``We have demonstrators who are
continuing to express their point of view,'' said Stamper. ``Most
are doing it nonviolently, some are doing it violently.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was unable to deliver his
speech to delegates. In his prepared text, he said: ``Unless we
convince developing countries that globalization really does
benefit them, the backlash against it will become irresistible.
That would be a tragedy for the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday morning, close to 20,000 union members and their
allies packed Memorial Stadium, next to the Space Needle, to hear
anti-WTO speakers. The speakers ranged from James Hoffa, the
Teamsters union president, to Carl Pope, the executive director of
the Sierra Club, and Wei Jingsheng, a Chinese dissident.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker voiced anger that, in their depiction, the
trade organization favored corporations and overturned national
laws that protected the environment, endangered species and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Several union leaders also belittled the trade group's push for
free trade, saying it has encouraged American companies to move
operations overseas where workers are paid far less and have few
rights.
</P>
<P>
   To thunderous applause, Jay Mazur, president of the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said, ``The rules
of this new global economy have been rigged against workers and
we're not going to play by them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A few union leaders took a protectionist tone, condemning the
flood of imports, which they said had wiped out hundreds of
thousands of well-paying American manufacturing jobs. But most of
the union leaders focused on pressuring the WTO to protect workers'
rights as a way to lift living standards around the world and close
the growing gap between rich and poor in many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, said, ``Until the WTO
addresses these issues, we should not and must not permit our
country to participate in a new round of trade negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, the union members, joined by environmentalists
and other protesters, began a two-mile-long march that skirted the
area of the sit-ins and the tear gas. Protesters carried signs that
included, ``Labor Rights Not Trade Wrongs,'' ``End Corporate Rule''
and ``Make the Global Economy Work for Working People.''
</P>
<P>
   As the marchers snaked through downtown, most of the best-known
downtown department stores, including Nordstrom and Bon Marche,
were closed. Even many Starbucks were shut, with a protester
painting ``We Want Fair Wages'' on the door of a Starbucks on Third
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters marched past the Westin Hotel, where the American
delegation is staying. The hotel was ringed by city buses that were
purposely parked bumper to bumper to prevent the WTO's critics from
approaching the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The sit-ins brought traffic in many parts of the city to a
standstill and angered many motorists. A sit-in at the corner of
Sixth Avenue and Seneca Street prevented cars from leaving a
freeway exit during the morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Derouin, a customer service worker for Amazon.com. who
was trapped for half an hour after taking the Seneca Street exit,
said, ``I sympathize with them, but I wish they didn't put me out
like this. But if I didn't have a job, I'd probably be out there
protesting with them.''

L.A. POLICE COMMISSION OKs AMMO SALES BAN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Beth Barrett  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Police Commission has narrowly
recommended banning the sale of live ammunition within the city.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-2 vote Tuesday on what would be one of the most sweeping
bans in the country sends the issue to the City Council's Public
Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure allows the sale of ammunition only to active and
retired peace officers and military personnel for official duties
as well as at firing ranges where all the bullets would have to be
consumed. Antique ammunition and blank ammunition also would be
exempted under the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is broad-based,'' said Assistant City Attorney Henry
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The commission delayed consideration of an alternate plan that
would have set up a permit system to buy and sell ammunition until
the staffing implications can be further studied.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the ban, including parents who had lost children
to gun violence, said it was a step toward further reducing crime
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Milonopoulos, 12, of Studio City, about 11 miles northwest
of downtown Los Angeles, has been a youth leader in the
anti-violence movement since the 1997 North Hollywood bank robbery
shootout near his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we feel as though we've given a voice to all the kids
in the city,'' Milonopoulos said. ``We all need to stand up for the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Dean Hansell initially hesitated to move forward on
the recommendation, citing state laws that could leave the city
open to legal challenges. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer
has been asked to review a previous ruling that the state preempts
local governments in regulating the sale of ammunition. Hansell
voted with the majority after commissioners said the council
committee was ready to move ahead on the proposal. Hansell was
joined by commission president Gerald L. Chaleff and commissioner
T. Warren Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Chaleff said that while he remained concerned how effective such
a ban would be in light of nearby cities continuing to sell
ammunition, he was persuaded L.A. needs to start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes making a statement is enough,'' Chaleff said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners Herbert F. Boeckmann and Raquelle de la Rocha
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Boeckmann said the commission should not rush to put in place a
``quick fix'' that might not work, saying the focus on gun violence
should be on the perpetrators of criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally the wrong way to go about this, it goes
against our rights,'' Boeckmann said.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rocha said a complete ban would be ``too extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association of America officials said the city
was trying to end-run state laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was any other civil right, but guns, the city would
never dream of doing this,'' said Attorney Chuck Michel, who
equated the measure with trying to ban abortions by banning medical
instruments. &QL;

STRONG L.A. AREA ECONOMY PREDICTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(also moving on national and California wires)  
By Gregory J. Wilcox  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Southern California is powering into 2000 thanks
to a surprisingly strong economy that is being fueled in part by
Asia's recovery, according to a forecast to be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The outlying areas of Ventura County and the Inland Empire north
and east of Los Angeles are expected to record the biggest gains in
nonfarm employment through 2001, according to the semiannual report
from the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., while sprawling
Los Angeles County will record smaller, but still solid, growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of momentum in the economy,''
said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the nonprofit LAEDC.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two years, Ventura County's nonfarm employment
is expected to grow by 3.9 percent. It will be followed by the
Riverside-San Bernardino region with a growth rate of 3.8 percent,
Orange County with a 2.9 percent rate and Los Angeles with a 1.9
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County's economy added 10,000 new jobs during 1998, an
amount that will probably be equaled this year and surpassed in the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ventura County economy has gone on a tear all of a sudden.
Did somebody give them a big jolt of vitamins?'' Kyser said,
half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those jobs are in the high-technology sector, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles will also reach two major milestones by the close of
2000. The county is expected to recover all the nonfarm jobs lost
during the economic restructuring of the early 1990s, by most
accounts the deepest slump since the Great Depression, and its
population will break the 10 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you are feeling pinched for space, you are,'' Kyser
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new forecast, an update from a preliminary report issued in
July, benefits from watching the region's economy grow quicker than
expected during the ensuing five months. During the first part of
the next decade, the growth will slow from the current pace but
remain solid nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, said that Kyser's assessment matches up well with the
state forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing certainly has been the confirmation that the
Asian economies are recovering,'' Gibson said. ``That had been the
expectation with fingers crossed warily. Now the evidence is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, international trade and tourism are two of the Southern
California sectors that will benefit the most in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden the export activity went from a negative to a
positive. We've almost had to run to keep up with the numbers that
are coming out on exports,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact from the surge in these sectors will occur in
the communities surrounding the ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles, the South Bay, East Los Angeles County and the Inland
Empire. A ripple effect will be felt in the San Gabriel and San
Fernando valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment sector will also be pulled along by the Asian
rebound, especially independents looking for distribution deals.
When the Far East's economy headed south, a lot of those
distribution deals dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Now South Korean buyers are coming back into a market that could
get even bigger with China's participation in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While Kyser's forecast bodes well for the region, he did sound
several cautionary notes. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- Consumer exhaustion will be a major concern next year as the
debt ratio approaches what is considered the ``red zone,'' where 20
percent of personal income is tied up with installment payments.
``We could strangle ourselves with slick plastic,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   -- The run-up in equity prices, while making lots of people
rich, is creating an asset bubble that concerns some financial
wizards, especially Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Fears of a market meltdown will persist into 2000, and a 30 percent
market loss in one or two consecutive trading days could be
catastrophic to consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   -- Labor shortages could derail economic growth next year by
sending manufacturers overseas.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
In the best of all college football worlds, the University of
Houston's current search for a new football coach would conclude in
about 10 days with the hiring of the next Bill Yeoman.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember, however, that Yeoman's qualities _ burnished first on
Earl Blaik's Army staff that also included Vince Lombardi, then
honed by Duffy Daugherty at Michigan State _ were not readily
apparent in wins and losses after Yeoman's arrival at UH. In fact,
Yeoman and the athletic director who hired him, the late Harry
Fouke, were both hung in effigy during 2-8 and 2-6-1 campaigns in
Yeoman's second and third seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The next hire will be the Cougars' ninth since the program began
in 1946, not a high rate of turnover but one that is skewed by
Yeoman's 25 seasons. These days, no coach, unless he is named
Paterno or Bowden (Bobby, that is) sticks around for that number of
heartaches and highs.
</P>
<P>
   One important part of the decision that faces UH athletic
director Chet Gladchuk is picking a coach who not only can
reinvigorate the school's mostly lethargic alumni (and others who
might buy season tickets or contribute financially) but also would
not leave shortly after the job looks like it is on the way to
getting done.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, legal ways such as buyout penalties to
guard against that, but even that method is not foolproof, as
Tulane discovered a year ago when Clemson was convinced Tommy
Bowden was its man.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that current Oklahoma State assistant head coach Tommy
Kaiser likely would fulfill the loyalty quotient as a UH alumnus
(he played football and baseball) and former assistant coach. He
also understands the high school recruiting environment in Texas as
well as UH's place in the city's congested sports environment.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser has made it clear he is interested in the position.
Whether that interest is mutual is hard to tell. Gladchuk says he
has had many inquiries _ ``some of them surprising'' _ since the
Nov. 21 dismissal of Kim Helton, whose seven seasons and 24 wins do
not begin to tell the full story via won-lost percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's name joins a number of others that have surfaced since
the job came open. Former Auburn coach Terry Bowden, one of the
most widely rumored, is also one of the most interesting. But he
recently signed an extension with ABC to remain in the TV studio,
and there probably would be higher-profile, higher-paying
opportunities than UH in the future if Bowden really wants to
return to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas coach John Mackovic, also in the TV analyst's chair
these days, is not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Rodriguez, currently Tommy Bowden's offensive coordinator
at Clemson and before that at Tulane, seems qualified to be a
Division I-A head coach, and a highly successful one at that.
Rodriguez was an interim head coach at Tulane and impressed with
his skill at that job until he was surprisingly bypassed when
Bowden's old job was filled.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Rodriguez is expected to be the next coach at Texas
Tech, possibly as early as Dec. 7, the first day the position could
be filled under state employment guidelines. Rodriguez interviewed
with Tech officials once, then returned to Lubbock with his wife
last Friday to consider a new house.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma offensive coordinator Mike Leach, who formerly tutored
quarterback Tim Couch at Kentucky, also interviewed at Tech but has
been noncommittal about other positions while the Sooners prepare
for a bowl. His interest in UH, if any, is hard to gauge.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who insist that Jack Pardee, the former Cougars
and Houston Oilers head coach, is ready to step away from his
current life on the ranch and into the film room again. Pardee, for
all his immense pro and collegiate experience, may not fully
realize the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   One current Division I-A head coach whose name has surfaced at
UH and North Carolina State is Louisiana Tech's Jack Bicknell III,
whose first season with the Bulldogs produced an 8-3 record.
Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay had run-and-shoot-type
passing figures in the kind of offensive system that might entice
paying customers to UH's Robertson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bicknell's father, Jack Bicknell, coached Doug Flutie at Boston
College and against Yeoman's Cougars in the 1985 Cotton Bowl.
Gladchuk was the AD at Boston College before he came to UH and
after the elder Bicknell had left BC. The hiring of the son would
make for a nice story line, but the young Bicknell just completed
the first year of a five-year contract. Associates say he is happy
in Ruston, La., where Tech faces the tough prospect of one more
season as an independent before joining the Western Athletic
Conference in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   UH's reported commitment to significantly increase the $300,000
annual financial package paid to Helton, perhaps to as much as
$500,000, might sway Bicknell. It seemingly will not do so with
Rodriguez, who could expect to receive that much, or slightly more,
at Tech as Spike Dykes' successor.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk says head coaching experience at the Division I-Alevel
``would be another feather in the cap'' for candidates but not
necessarily decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not precluding anyone,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk's vision of the new man includes one who understands
the Cougars' past accomplishments and tradition; can build
relationships with Texas high school coaches; can excite alumni and
embrace UH fans; brings a knowledge of the technical aspects of the
game; and, perhaps most important, is able to lead the program.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, it sounds like another Yeoman.

PHOENIX _ Out of the frying pan and into the microwave.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the anger-filled intensity of Canada's boorish reception to
the trapdoor welcome mat Jason Kidd will have rolled out in the
desert, Steve Francis just moves on to the next hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: The Kid vs. Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' said the Rockets rookie as he relaxed wearing his fancy
print boxer shorts and a broad smile, ``it doesn't ever get any
easier in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a lot of ways, it doesn't get much harder, either.
</P>
<P>
   As his career unfolds over the next decade, there will surely
not be many nights like Monday, when he was treated slightly better
than an ax murderer by a Vancouver crowd that for a while had a lot
of good, clean, pumped-up fun and then eventually stepped over the
line. Way over.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to wave signs that mocked him and to chant his
name in a singsong voice, but quite another to toss lemons and
tomatoes and change onto the court. You see, it's a simple
boundary, really, and maybe the Canadians will eventually learn it
if one of their teams sticks around long enough to finally make the
playoffs: You keep the produce in the refrigerator and the loose
change in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is acceptable to taunt Francis for acting _ in
their eyes _ like a spoiled brat who rejected their team and their
entire frozen way of life, it is way beyond any standard of good
taste to bring members of his family into the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me that some of the people near our bench were
yelling things about my grandmother and about my mom being dead,''
Francis said. ``That really shocked me.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he never let that show. Instead he showed them.
</P>
<P>
   If several years down the line Francis blossoms into the
superstar the Rockets believe he'll become, that first night in
front of the raucous crowd inside General Motors Place might be
viewed as a pivotal point in his development.
</P>
<P>
   Because for all the emotions churning inside him, he never let
them boil over into his job. This truly was the best we have seen
of Francis to date. He was explosive and yet under control. He was
the star soloist of the show and yet kept his place within the
Rockets' orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   For all the gaudy numbers he carried with him through customs
and out of Canada _ 24 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds _ the
most impressive was the zero in the turnover department.
</P>
<P>
   Francis ran the fast break when he could but for the first time
this year never ran ahead of himself or his teammates. He didn't
try to force the spectacular pass but fed the other Rockets a
steady diet of opportunities for good shots.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared, in a way, the rowdy atmosphere worked to his
benefit. It made him concentrate harder, focus his attention more
directly on the task at hand while he blocked out the distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think it helped,'' Francis said. ``I knew that if I
got caught up in all of the stuff, then it was going to spread to
the whole team. The coach told me to just stay into the game. And I
called my grandmother in the afternoon, and she told me the same
thing. She said it was going to be bad. But I didn't know how bad.
It was a lot worse than anything I've ever experienced before at
any level.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he was throughout the night, bouncing around like a
kindergartner at recess, grinning and laughing and letting his
former University of Maryland teammate Obinna Ekezie know all about
it after his flamboyant bounce-the-ball-off-the-glass-one-handed
layup, drawing a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just asking Obinna how he liked that one,'' Francis
said. ``And the ref thought I was taunting. I knew then that I had
to pull it back a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver media called him sullen and sour, which is
actually anything but his engaging, childlike personality. He tried
to explain how much he enjoys living and playing in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love me there,'' Francis said. ``I'm like a baby Hakeem.
I do everything they ask. If they want me to go out into the
community, I go out into the community. If they want me to stay
after practice, I stay after practice. That's the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubbly and upbeat, coachable and eager to learn, proud of the
way he stood up to the situation in Vancouver but aware enough to
know a whole new challenge awaits tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be humble after something like that,'' Francis
said. ``It's one game. And now I get Jason Kidd, one of the great
point guards. The thing I've learned about the NBA is that the ball
keeps rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   One month in, and The Kid is growing.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ At first glance it would seem typical of the Rockets'
season that on the day Hakeem Olajuwon was found to have a hernia,
extending his stay on the shelf to as much as six weeks, it was
considered good news.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But this reaction was not the result of calluses from the
November to forget. Nor have the Rockets ceased to value the
talents of their 16-year icon.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Rockets needed was to add injury to insult.
But if Olajuwon must be hurt and lost, the Rockets believe he could
prove better off with the more serious but more easily repaired
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The inguinal hernia will require surgery this morning, a
45-minute outpatient procedure. But rather than the initially
diagnosed muscle strain that was causing so much pain in Olajuwon's
groin, the hernia should be less likely to cause ongoing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon can rehabilitate. And team physicians believe when
Olajuwon returns, he will be able to leave the injury behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, even though it sounds worse, it probably is better
in the long haul than a true groin problem,'' Rockets team
physician Dr. Walter Lowe said Tuesday. ``A groin injury can be so
unpredictable and cause recurring problems. (With the hernia) he
can be taken care of, get well and come back without any symptoms
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may keep him out a couple more weeks than an isolated minor
groin strain. But with this, he can be well and able to play
through this year and the rest of his career. It's something that
can be fixed and heal and (he can) be back on the basketball court
fairly quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said the injury probably occurred when Olajuwon reached to
knock the ball from Trail Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis on Friday.
But he said chronic groin problems made Olajuwon, 36, susceptible
to the more severe groin injury and the hernia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hernias are often the straw that broke the camel's back,''
Lowe said. ``He's had soreness off and on, nothing to limit his
agility but enough that he could be hurt with the wrong twist and
pressure. We should downplay the groin strain. The pain and
swelling is from the hernia.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Rockets, the loss of Olajuwon could be considered the
latest bit of misfortune. But if they can find the bright side in
the discovery of the hernia, they also can accept the latest bit of
news well-trained for dealing with adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always concerned about the players and their health and
well-being,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``It's good to hear the
doctor has that positive outlook on it. It's part of the business.
We can't use that as an excuse and have to keep striving to get
better. It gives a lot of guys an opportunity to play and be
involved offensively. We did go to Hakeem a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary recipient of the extra playing time has been center
Kelvin Cato. He played 32 minutes against the Grizzlies on Monday,
scoring 13 points, grabbing 10 rebounds and blocking five shots. He
had 13 points and 12 rebounds against the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no difference whether you start or come off the bench,
you still have a job to do,'' Cato said. ``I do have to just stay
down. I can't get into foul trouble, so I can stay on the floor.
But that's it. I just know I have to go play, whether it's 10
minutes, 12 minutes or 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have worked with Cato to make him more disciplined
defensively. But the motivation has not been solely to avoid foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him to play solid defense where people have got to go
through you, not by you because you left your feet,'' Tomjanovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Cato unavailable to come off the bench, Tomjanovich has
added rookie Kenny Thomas to the rotation. Carlos Rogers also has
worked at center and both forward spots. But he was already getting
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had not played in a game that had not been decided. But
he played 20 minutes against the Grizzlies. He made just two of
eight shots, but one came down the stretch in the fourth quarter.
He grabbed six rebounds and was effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep going to him and see what he's got,''
Tomjanovich said. ``I'm sure he'll have his ups and downs. But I
was very pleased with how he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this stuff is new to him, just being in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with Thomas in the mix, the changes in the rotation
could be more complicated than making Cato a starter and giving
minutes to Thomas. Cato is not considered an inside, post-up player
through whom to run the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have worked to add more variety and motion to the
offense. But if Charles Barkley and Steve Francis sit at the same
time, the Rockets can be without a player to initiate or create
half-court offense. If Cato and Barkley sit at the same time, they
can be left without a rebounding force. When the Rockets go deep
into the bench, only Cuttino Mobley can consistently get his own
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to keep looking at how we substitute,''
Tomjanovich said. ``We had gotten into a rotation with Dream and
Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Rockets this season, even when things work, they
don't seem to last. At least Tuesday, when they received bad news,
they found some good _ a turn of events they would like to turn
into a trend.

STRONG L.A. AREA ECONOMY PREDICTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(also moving on the financial and national wires)  
By Gregory J. Wilcox  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Southern California is powering into 2000 thanks
to a surprisingly strong economy that is being fueled in part by
Asia's recovery, according to a forecast to be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The outlying areas of Ventura County and the Inland Empire north
and east of Los Angeles are expected to record the biggest gains in
nonfarm employment through 2001, according to the semiannual report
from the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., while sprawling
Los Angeles County will record smaller, but still solid, growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of momentum in the economy,''
said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the nonprofit LAEDC.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two years, Ventura County's nonfarm employment
is expected to grow by 3.9 percent. It will be followed by the
Riverside-San Bernardino region with a growth rate of 3.8 percent,
Orange County with a 2.9 percent rate and Los Angeles with a 1.9
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County's economy added 10,000 new jobs during 1998, an
amount that will probably be equaled this year and surpassed in the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ventura County economy has gone on a tear all of a sudden.
Did somebody give them a big jolt of vitamins?'' Kyser said,
half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those jobs are in the high-technology sector, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles will also reach two major milestones by the close of
2000. The county is expected to recover all the nonfarm jobs lost
during the economic restructuring of the early 1990s, by most
accounts the deepest slump since the Great Depression, and its
population will break the 10 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you are feeling pinched for space, you are,'' Kyser
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new forecast, an update from a preliminary report issued in
July, benefits from watching the region's economy grow quicker than
expected during the ensuing five months. During the first part of
the next decade, the growth will slow from the current pace but
remain solid nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, said that Kyser's assessment matches up well with the
state forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing certainly has been the confirmation that the
Asian economies are recovering,'' Gibson said. ``That had been the
expectation with fingers crossed warily. Now the evidence is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, international trade and tourism are two of the Southern
California sectors that will benefit the most in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden the export activity went from a negative to a
positive. We've almost had to run to keep up with the numbers that
are coming out on exports,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact from the surge in these sectors will occur in
the communities surrounding the ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles, the South Bay, East Los Angeles County and the Inland
Empire. A ripple effect will be felt in the San Gabriel and San
Fernando valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment sector will also be pulled along by the Asian
rebound, especially independents looking for distribution deals.
When the Far East's economy headed south, a lot of those
distribution deals dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Now South Korean buyers are coming back into a market that could
get even bigger with China's participation in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While Kyser's forecast bodes well for the region, he did sound
several cautionary notes. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- Consumer exhaustion will be a major concern next year as the
debt ratio approaches what is considered the ``red zone,'' where 20
percent of personal income is tied up with installment payments.
``We could strangle ourselves with slick plastic,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   -- The run-up in equity prices, while making lots of people
rich, is creating an asset bubble that concerns some financial
wizards, especially Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Fears of a market meltdown will persist into 2000, and a 30 percent
market loss in one or two consecutive trading days could be
catastrophic to consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   -- Labor shortages could derail economic growth next year by
sending manufacturers overseas.

MILLION MOMS TO MARCH ON D.C.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took the shooting that wounded Loren Lieb's
5-year-old son to push gun control to the forefront of her mind.
</P>
<P>
   The gunshot wounds borne by Lieb's son, Joshua Stepakoff, in the
wake of an Aug. 10 attack on the North Valley Jewish Community
Center near Los Angeles have become emblematic of the scar that
hate crimes have left nationwide. Now Lieb is a member of a
movement to band 1 million women together next Mother's Day to
demand gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that you think is always in someone
else's back yard,'' Lieb said.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Northridge, 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles, she
said Joshua to this day speaks little about the traumatic event.
She was one of several mothers who joined Sen. Dianne Feinstein in
rallying local support Tuesday for the Million Mom March scheduled
for May 14 in Washington, D.C. She could be among as many as 50
from the Jewish Community Center to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Powers, California coordinator of the event, said she had
horrific memories after a gunman stormed the center _ while her
son, Nathan, 5, was there _ and wounded three children, a teen-ager
and an adult before killing a mail carrier. She sought counseling
but decided she needed to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about the march, I thought that's the way I can
participate,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to see 20,000 women from California join the march in
which they will lobby for gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that they will break this deadlock is to have the
mothers of America come back to Washington and say enough is
enough,'' said Feinstein during the rally at the Sportsmen's Lodge
in Studio City, about 11 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack in which Joshua and four others were wounded _
a white supremacist has been charged with the crimes _ the Jewish
Community Center board president, Nancy Parris-Moskowitz, learned
of the march from Feinstein at a prayer breakfast hosted by
President Bill Clinton. She took the news back to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   Powers called for retailers to support the event and said
mothers, in return, would patronize the stores. She said the
march's power could prompt substantial changes in gun-control laws
that organizers say have been stymied for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a million moms standing up and being a force in
Congress can make a difference,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bills for which march supporters advocate passage deal with
loopholes in sales of guns at gun shows, trigger locks,
availability of assault weapons and regulations limiting who can
legally use guns.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Turner, a 48-year-old resident of the city of Lawndale about
19 miles south of Los Angeles, said time has not dulled the pain
she feels over her son Hank, who was shot and killed by two other
young men in 1989, But she said her spirits are raised by the idea
of the march. She and her granddaughter, 5, rang a ceremonial bell
Tuesday in memory of children killed by guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought of seeing one million women united in a common
cause other than shopping is (it's) going to be an awesome sight,''
said Turner, honorary chairwoman of Women Against Gun Violence.

LAUSD INVESTIGATOR WANTS FUNDS TO STUDY PAYROLL ABUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(also running on California wire)  
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Unified's top investigator says he
needs more money to fully investigate fraud and waste in the school
district's $5 billion payroll, having already uncovered ``ghost
employees'' and other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the payroll system is now set up creates a great
opportunity for people to commit fraud,'' said Don Mullinax,
director of the LAUSD Internal Audits and Special Investigations
Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Caprice Young, who heads the budget and audit
subcommittee, said she will push for an immediate and extensive
investigation of the financial malfeasance, which was reported last
week by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have millions and millions of dollars that are being wasted
and misused,'' Young said. ``It's infuriating that the district's
financial systems are in a such a complete disarray. The money
being lost should be going to the classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   A former investigator for the U.S. Senate, Mullinax on Tuesday
detailed the problems in a Nov. 18 memorandum to the district's
Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to find out what other school districts and large
companies in the private sector do,'' Mullinax said. ``I couldn't
afford within my current budget to investigate the problem and look
for answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax's initial review of the payroll showed employees often
fail to sign in and out as required and improperly change entries
on their time cards. He also concluded that the district is paying
out ``excessive amounts of overtime with little, if any, evidence
of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   He also charged the district regularly cuts checks for ``ghost
employees'' _ people who either don't work for the district or who
fail to show up to their assigned posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't change the payroll system, we are just setting
ourselves up,'' Mullinax said. ``The district's system is one of
the most antiquated that I have ever seen. We're moving into the
21st century and everyone else is going to leave us standing here
holding our stubby pencils.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax and Young estimated a review of the payroll system
would cost ``several thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Young, senior administrators who prepared the
budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year did not view fixing the
payroll problems as a priority. ``I don't know what they were
thinking,'' Young said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers spent Tuesday evening attempting to
find out if perfect attendance accrues enough mojo points to fix a
report card.
</P>
<P>
   For the first game in two weeks, the team roll call was 100
percent ``Yo.''
</P>
<P>
   But when class started, the Clippers flunked shooting, they
earned an incomplete in passing and their `D' was minus all the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The final grade was an `L' administered by the Phoenix Suns, who
seemed as disinterested as the 10,233 subjects at Staples Center
who sat through a 94-80 Clipper defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd had 20 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists in dragging
the Suns to victory, with Tom Gugliotta adding 16 (to go with 11
rebounds) and Cliff Robinson throwing in 19 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips should have posed for a class picture while the
opportunity was hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go out there and perform well,'' rookie forward
Lamar Odom (14 points) said of the class reunion, ``like we miss
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with everyone attending, something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a seven-game, foot-sprain vacation was Maurice
Taylor (15 points, 8 rebounds); point guard Eric Murdock's
disagreeable right knee was quiet enough for action; and Derek
Anderson's facial muscle inflammation was defeated by the miracle
of medication. Anderson, a likely free-agent-to-be, continued
playing himself out of town, scoring 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels weird,'' Anderson said of the Clips' relatively
healthy squad, ``because we have to bring it back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was a bit more convincing: ``I think we'll do all
right,'' he said, providing a pre-game forecast for the Clippers'
full house.
</P>
<P>
   They were miles from all right in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was busted for his second personal foul only three
minutes into his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   With their offensive sets resembling the final round of a Vogue
contest, the Clippers shot 35 percent from the field, demonstrated
enough love to hand out just four assists (they are - by far - the
NBA's worst in that category), but only entered the second period
down 25-21.
</P>
<P>
   With Kidd attempting to coerce his cronies into action, Phoenix
had led by as many as 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' second unit held the Clips at bay for much of round
two, but when the starters returned, Anderson sparked a rally with
11 of his 13 first-half points in the period. A pass from Tyrone
Nesby led to an acrobatic, buzzer-beating Anderson layup that made
it 42-42 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns actually fell behind shortly after the second half
began, but ran off to a 10-point lead and entered the fourth with a
67-59 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone thinking the Clippers were all set to make a serious
run already has flunked Clippers 101.

POLICE CHARGE PANHANDLER IN BRICK ATTACK ON WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) 
(sw) 
 By JUAN FORERO and JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A panhandler with a criminal record that stretches
back nearly two decades was arrested on Tuesday and charged with
attempted murder in the Nov. 16 brick attack of a young woman on a
midtown Manhattan street, police officials said on Tuesday night.
The arrest was made after a witness to the assault identified the
man in a lineup, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by the police as Paris Drake, 31, was
charged with attempted murder in the second-degree, assault and
weapons possession in the attack, which left Nicole Barrett, a
27-year-old office worker, with a critical head injury that
required two operations at Bellevue Hospital Center. Drake was
expected to be arraigned on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced the arrest late
Tuesday night at the Midtown South Precinct station house on West
35th Street, where he heralded the work of detectives and said he
had told the Barrett family of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped and saw the Barrett family before coming here,''
Safir said. ``I'm not going to tell you what they said, but you can
probably guess that they were relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials did not provide a motive for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The highly publicized attack immediately led to speculation by
the police that a person who was homeless and possibly mentally ill
was responsible, and three days later, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration announced that the homeless had no right to sleep on
city streets and would face arrest for refusing shelter. The police
have arrested more than 100 homeless people since the measure was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The police said on Tuesday night that Drake sold drugs and was a
panhandler, and Safir described him as homeless. But other police
and city officials said on Tuesday that it was not clear if Drake
was homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Beck, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless
Services, said there was no record that Drake had ever been in the
city's homeless shelter system, and investigators said he had
apparently been living with a girlfriend recently in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Safir also said there was no indication that Drake had a history
of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was returning from a trip to Texas on Tuesday night
and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Drake became the prime suspect when an inmate on Rikers Island
told the authorities that Drake, who had been arrested on Nov. 23
on a low-level drug charge and was being held on Rikers, bragged
about the attack to the inmate, law enforcement officials said. The
inmate was released into the custody of detectives, who drove him
around midtown on Monday until he spotted Drake at the Port
Authority Bus Terminal and pointed him out, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Drake underwent hours of questioning by detectives, police
officials said, and did not confess to the crime. But on Tuesday, a
law enforcement official said one of several witnesses to the
attack brought in for a police lineup positively identified Drake
as Ms. Barrett's assailant. Investigators also believed that Drake
closely resembled the sketch of the suspect that was made public
after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Drake, with his long criminal
record, fit the profile of a violent and dangerous criminal. First
arrested in 1982 when he was 14, Drake was arrested 23 more times
over the years, mostly on drug-related charges. He has spent more
than 7 of the last 10 years in state prisons on charges ranging
from drug dealing to assaulting a prison guard. Officials said that
on every occasion, Drake's requests for early parole were denied
and he served the maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing a prison term in upstate New York this summer,
he was arrested four times, on charges including selling drugs and
assault, according to law enforcement officials. The latest arrest
was on Nov. 23, just seven days after the attack on Ms. Barrett,
when Drake was sent to Rikers on the drug charge.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Drake used a paving stone to bash Ms. Barrett
from behind as she prepared to cross Madison Avenue at 42nd Street,
an unprovoked assault that reminded New Yorkers that despite the
drop in crime in recent years, random violence can easily shatter
perceptions of a safe city. The attack also cast a public eye on
the issue of mentally unstable homeless people because officials
initially believed the attacker was homeless, like several other
mentally disturbed people who in recent years have committed random
violent crimes that have brought attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrrett was admitted to Bellevue in critical condition. The
young woman received flowers and cards from hundreds of
well-wishers and was visited by Giuliani and Safir after the
attack. She has recovered dramatically and is now in stable
condition, alert and able to talk with her family.

CAR WASH ROMANCE NO MERE SOAP OPERA
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sonny Knight should have caught on when Sharie
McGarray had her car washed two or three times a week at the car
wash he managed in Valencia, northeast of Los Angeles, but it took
him two years to realize she had taken a shine to him.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the two, who run Sonny and Sharie's Hillbilly Hot
Dog Stand in West Virginia, returned home to marry _ yes, at the
car wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in as much as five times a week,'' Knight said, hours
before Tuesday's ceremony. ``She would make up reasons, like saying
she ran through the sprinkler or needed more gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did that just to be close to me. I didn't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple opted for the deluxe wedding, with 130 guests. She
wore a white gown and cowboy hat. Her white boots had rhinestones
shinier than the polished rims on a '69 Camaro.
</P>
<P>
   Knight sported black jeans, a cowboy hat and a jacket, of
course. This was, after all, a formal affair.
</P>
<P>
   It was three years ago when Sharie McGarray started going to the
Valencia AutoSpa car wash _ drawn to Knight like a 16-year-old to
bubblegum-scented air freshener.
</P>
<P>
   She spied on him before the Valencia AutoSpa opened to see who
dropped him off, and drove by in the evening to see if he left with
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't ask anyone,'' McGarray said. ``I didn't know if he
was married or gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to be noticed, McGarray, 42, would make up excuses _ her
pedals perhaps weren't cleaned just right _ and she would ask to
see the manager.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until one day when local Judge Alan Rosenfield showed
interest in the AutoSpa's best customer after spotting a bottle of
wine in her trunk that Knight stepped into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that she was waiting for the right person and that
that bottle of wine was for Mr. Right,'' Knight said. ``I was
almost jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight told her then and there that he wanted to share the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield threw in the towel _ in fact he married the pair, who
say it was he who ignited their spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good friend,'' Knight added. ``When I moved in, he
backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   AutoSpa owners Randy Cressall and Dave Wilke put on the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so much in love,'' said Randy Cressall, co-owner of
the AutoSpa. ``They are so devoted to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonny's like a member of the family,'' Cressall added. ``It's
not the most appropriate place but they had such a wonderful
experience meeting here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Knight said. It was the perfect spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people ski dive or jump out of airplanes,'' McGarray
said. ``This is what means the most to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's exchange of vows was the couple's second wedding. The
two were married at 9:09 on Sept. 9 at home in West Virginia, where
they moved last year. Knight's brother is in need of a lung lobe
transplant and he is on standby as a donor.
</P>
<P>
   A third wedding is planned for Friday in Texas, where more of
McGarray's family lives. While McGarray's wedding gown will stay
the same, she will get a new wedding ring for each ceremony _ a
three-ring marriage of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Once back home in West Virginia, they'll go back to the business
of running Sonny and Sharie's Hillbilly Hotdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be together and we love hot dogs,'' Knight said.
``It's a great combination.''

MOTHER ARRESTED IN SONS' SLAYINGS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just hours before a scheduled night vigil for
three boys shot to death in their family's exclusive hilltop
mansion, their mother was arrested on suspicion of murdering her
sons.
</P>
<P>
   Following her arrest on Tuesday, Socorro ``Cora'' Caro was
transferred from a private hospital in Thousand Oaks, 40 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, to Ventura County Medical Center in
Ventura, another 20 miles west. She was listed in serious and
stable condition in the jail ward, recovering from a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   She has yet to speak with authorities about the Nov. 22
incident, having asked for an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the first time authorities identified Caro as a
suspect, although they had said from the start that the case
involved domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on all the evidence we have . . . it all points to her
being the only one who shot,'' said Ventura County sheriff's
spokesman Eric Nishimoto. ``We have probable cause to point to her
as the only shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials also believe she shot herself in the right side of her
head after firing a single bullet into the heads of three of her
four sons.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said late last week that ballistics tests showed
that a .38-caliber revolver found in the home was used for all the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators do not know whether the mother, known for
volunteering at her sons' school, has retained an
attorney,Nishimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to detail the evidence gathered during
investigations at the Caros' Presilla Road mansion, which have
continued since last week's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's family, some of whom live in a home she and her
husband own in Granada Hills, have declined to comment on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Caro's arrest came a week after the boys' father,
rheumatologist Xavier J. Caro, found his sons _ Xavier ``Joey''
Caro Jr., 11; Michael Anthony Caro, 8; and Christopher Laurence
Caro, 5 _ dead in their beds when he arrived home about 11:20 p.m.
He found his wife wounded in another room.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor called 911 and was holding the couple's fourth son,
an unidentified toddler who was unharmed, when police arrived.
Police spent most of the next day, Nov. 23, interviewing the
52-year-old doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still investigating, or at least validating, his
whereabouts and activity,'' Nishimoto said. ``Obviously, we're
still waiting on a lot of information to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourners were planning to gather Tuesday evening for a vigil
service for the boys at Padre Serra Parish in Camarillo, where the
family attended church.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral for the boys is scheduled there today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply saddened by it,'' said Leslie Randall, whose son
was in Joey's fifth-grade class at Santa Rosa Elementary School.
She said that a week after the tragedy, the community is still in
shock.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Norris, a board member of the Pleasant Valley School
District, said Cora Caro's arrest does not mean she is guilty of
the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shocking thing is not that the mother was arrested but
that someone would kill children,'' Norris added. ``That was such a
tragedy. We have such a nice, safe community that that would happen
to our children is a shock.''

SURVEY SAYS WOMEN IN CHARGE OF HOUSEHOLD BUYS, SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(will also move on California and national wires)  
By Jason Z. Cohen  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marketeers take note: Women _ especially those who
own businesses _ buy lots of things not normally associated with
women.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message behind a survey to be released today by the
National Foundation for Women Business Owners.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the survey finds, it's a woman who is
behind a household's choice of Internet service providers, cable
television, telephone and insurance agents, among others. And women
_ especially business owners _ place a premium on service and
convenience, preferring to pay someone else to do a lot of
household chores that women a century ago were expected to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey is finally pointing out that women business owners
are smart businesspeople,'' said Susan Eigenbrodt, president of
California's Ventura County chapter of the National Association of
Women Business Owners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also shows women make buying decisions for the whole
house, Eigenbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a much stronger buying force than people ever realized
and we are making decisions,'' Eigenbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's results demonstrate that women business owners have
an increasing impact on the economy, said Vicki Eagleson Arndt, a
member of the Ventura County businesswomen's group. The foundation
estimates there are 9.1 million women-owned businesses in United
States and 1.2 million in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge buying unit. It's a huge opportunity for people to
focus in on the way women buy and the way women do business,''
Arndt said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which has a margin of error of 5.3 percent, was
conducted during June by Minneapolis-based CJ Olson Market
Research. A total of 370 women business owners and 365 working
women were surveyed by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   It's hauntingly accurate, said Arndt.
</P>
<P>
   Both women said the survey's findings bore an uncanny similarity
to their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of it absolutely equals my life down to the
realization that I could spend seven hours cleaning my itty bitty
house or I could spend seven hours working, pay someone to clean
the house and be more economically efficient,'' Eigenbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   As business owners and the principal organizers in their
households, both women said they place a premium on convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows women who own businesses are more likely than
women employees to hire someone to do their house cleaning and
their lawn care.

SURVEY SAYS WOMEN IN CHARGE OF HOUSEHOLD BUYS, SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marketeers take note: Women _ especially those who
own businesses _ buy lots of things not normally associated with
women.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message behind a survey to be released today by the
National Foundation for Women Business Owners.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the survey finds, it's a woman who is
behind a household's choice of Internet service providers, cable
television, telephone and insurance agents, among others. And women
_ especially business owners _ place a premium on service and
convenience, preferring to pay someone else to do a lot of
household chores that women a century ago were expected to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey is finally pointing out that women business owners
are smart businesspeople,'' said Susan Eigenbrodt, president of
California's Ventura County chapter of the National Association of
Women Business Owners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also shows women make buying decisions for the whole
house, Eigenbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a much stronger buying force than people ever realized
and we are making decisions,'' Eigenbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's results demonstrate that women business owners have
an increasing impact on the economy, said Vicki Eagleson Arndt, a
member of the Ventura County businesswomen's group. The foundation
estimates there are 9.1 million women-owned businesses in United
States and 1.2 million in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge buying unit. It's a huge opportunity for people to
focus in on the way women buy and the way women do business,''
Arndt said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which has a margin of error of 5.3 percent, was
conducted during June by Minneapolis-based CJ Olson Market
Research. A total of 370 women business owners and 365 working
women were surveyed by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   It's hauntingly accurate, said Arndt.
</P>
<P>
   Both women said the survey's findings bore an uncanny similarity
to their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of it absolutely equals my life down to the
realization that I could spend seven hours cleaning my itty bitty
house or I could spend seven hours working, pay someone to clean
the house and be more economically efficient,'' Eigenbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   As business owners and the principal organizers in their
households, both women said they place a premium on convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows women who own businesses are more likely than
women employees to hire someone to do their house cleaning and
their lawn care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will pay for convenience,'' Arndt said. ``I'll pay someone
to cut my lawn and clean my pool so I don't have to. It's a time
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Women business owners also make more frequent use of the
Internet for purchases and investing than do their counterparts who
are employed by someone else, the survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time effectiveness has become a major factor in my life. I run
my errands, as much of them online as humanly possible,''
Eigenbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some marketers are already taking notice.
</P>

service provider NetZero. The company strives to paint itself as a

LAKERS IMPOSE ORDER IN CHAOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Politics and basketball converged in the Great
Northwest on Tuesday, and didn't it figure that Phil Jackson was at
ground zero of the fracas. But only in his role as Lakers coach,
not in a throw-back to his 1960s protesting youth.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson left the chanting and grandstanding to tens of thousands
of Generation X demonstrators, whose opposition to the World Trade
Organization convention clogged the downtown streets surrounding
the Lakers' hotel and threatened to cancel Tuesday night's game
against the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes-violent demonstrations prompted officials to
impose a 7 p.m. curfew and declare a state of civil emergency, but
the game went on without incident.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers, unfazed by clouds of tear gas, random vandalism
and occasional violence, made their own statement, of a decidedly
nonpolitical nature.
</P>
<P>
   They imposed an embargo on the Sonics' high-powered offense,
including L.A. import Ruben Patterson, and cruised to a 101-77
victory before 17,072 at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal played one of his shortest stints of the
season, 33 minutes, but compressed his production to finish with 27
points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots. Patterson, the former
Laker and self-proclaimed ``Kobe Stopper,'' did put O'Neal in early
foul trouble with drives the hoop and led the Sonics with 19
points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers had the game in hand by halftime. And by the
fourth quarter the only suspense left was whether the Lakers could
extend a recent trend of defensive dominance. They did, holding
their third consecutive opponent under 85 points, a feat not
achieved by the franchise since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   And they dealt Seattle its first home loss in seven games this
season. But this was no ordinary day at home for the Sonics, who
had to stay in a downtown hotel overnight because of the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Strange days, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different day,'' said Lakers guard Derek Fisher. ``But we
really didn't have much to do with that. We just continued to hope
we would remain safe within our rooms.... Hopefully, we can get out
of here safe now. The saga's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   And impossible for anyone here for the day to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the NBA is indeed a global commodity, the Lakers
never expected to find themselves mired in the middle of a protest
on free trade. Yet here was a pro basketball game transposed with
arrests, tear-gas clouds and police blockades _ all happening
simultaneously within several blocks of KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the NBA commissioner's office monitored the
activity all day and was prepared to cancel the game at the first
sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, political-minded and a confidant to presidential
candidate Bill Bradley, stayed abreast of events listening to
National Public Radio in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' bus ride to the afternoon shoot-around was delayed
by protesters filling the downtown streets near the Four Seasons
hotel, which also housed several international dignitaries. It took
a police escort to transport the Lakers safely to the arena for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, police and Four Seasons security decided to
lock the doors for safety _ and momentarily trapped the Lakers'
unsuspecting public-relations director on the street.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Lakers reached the arena prior to the game, the
national guard had been mobilized. By an hour before tipoff, a
state of civil emergency had been declared.
</P>
<P>
   But most players were unaware of, and seemingly unmoved by, the
politics. If anything, they were annoyed by the constant
thunderclaps of tear-gas guns being fired in the streets as they
tried to nap in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside KeyArena, the only sign of the unrest was on the
television monitors broadcasting live coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much of a murmur from (the players),'' Jackson
said. ``We had to turn around to face some protesters to back the
bus up the street. That was an interesting reaction, to going from
these people involved with world trade to figuring out it was the
Lakers in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't talk to (the players) about it, except to tell them
what the WTO was. I gave them an idea what it was and what it
involved. They didn't quite know what the significance was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a product of '60s activism himself, smiled his approval
of the protests, at least the peaceful ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad to see this age group motivated to protest
something,'' he said. ``I think it's great. I just hope that they
can carry this from such global perspective to individual action.''

LAKERS, O'NEAL EXPOSE SONICS' CENTRAL FLAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Having failed to attract a massive outbreak of bubonic
plague for Seattle's first week of the holiday shopping season, the
local civic, business and political geniuses settled for their
second and third choices: the World Trade Organization and
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   With leadership like this, can the Ebola virus be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   One must be careful in drawing comparisons, however.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers are required by the NBA to
show up here twice a year, making one of those appearances Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO, well, somebody volunteered us for that.
</P>
<P>
   Wait till we find the clowns responsible for allowing downtown
to be gashed up. Bet they backed the bus tunnel and the Mariners
owners, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that attitude smacks of protest. Many would say we've
had enough of that to last us the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this moment of the Grand Bellyache, if we are to
indulge a protest of the sporting kind, let's offer this one: The
Sonics must stop this business of playing basketball without a
center.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily today, or this month. Or even this season. We
want to be flexible here, particularly in the absence of gas masks.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime in the long, fruitful life of, say, club president
Wally Walker's 2-year-old daughter, it would be intriguing to
witness the simplicity of arcing a pass into a Sonics behemoth in
the low post and watch his backside overwhelm helpless opponents
like an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   That scene took place almost endlessly Tuesday at KeyArena,
where O'Neal executed the Gluteal Smother with his peculiar
lumbering grace. He had 27 points in a 101-77 rout of the Sonics
that had lost the element of contest by halftime. There was more
fire in downtown dumpsters.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Sonics didn't deploy all available means against
O'Neal, including the WTO protesters, who made a ceaseless racket
outside the Lakers' downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a loud day,'' said O'Neal afterward. ``Somebody had a
drum set outside, and they were at it the whole time. I tried to
sleep, but I couldn't. I'd lay there and tell myself, `I don't hear
it, I don't hear it.' But I was concentrating so hard on that, I
got a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what might have happened had O'Neal been rested and
ready. The National Guard would have had a second job.
</P>
<P>
   The damage wreaked inside KeyArena was hardly unfamiliar. The
Gluteal Smother was the primary weapon in dispatching the Sonics
when last they were in the playoffs. You remember the playoffs,
don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Back in the spring of Nineteen and Ninety-Eight, the Sonics were
savaged 4-1 in the second round by the Lakers in large part because
they couldn't get out from under O'Neal's large parts. Although
last season the Sonics and Lakers split the four-game
regular-season series, fact is, it didn't count for anything
because of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, O'Neal is a vexation for every opponent. In the eight
games prior to Tuesday night, he had averaged 37 points, 14
rebounds and 4.7 assists, shooting 52 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is,'' said Sonics coach Paul Westphal, ``the best player in
the game. They can score because they can have a dry spell and
throw it into Shaq and get something good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the essential difference between this year's Sonics and
Lakers. With the Sonics, everything and everyone must go well to
succeed. With Shaq, there's slack.
</P>
<P>
   A good big man can get his team points more easily. For the
Sonics, easy points left when Jack Sikma was traded to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Sonics are built to concede the middle to O'Neal and
any like-size lummox who doesn't get in the way of his own feet.
The Sonics are the NBA's second-shortest team and have exactly zero
players who are big and mean enough to visit the paint regularly,
much less own it.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they are a terrible team, as the 11-3 record
before Tuesday night attests. But with the Lakers, San Antonio
Spurs, Portland Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings more than
adequately equipped in the galoot department, the Sonics'
impressive November mark is destined to shrivel once they engage
the Western Conference's passel of big uglies.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was among the initial tests, and the Sonics
flunked. Horace Grant flailed nobly in the pivot, but he's no more
a center than Lucy Ricardo. He's a good power forward, and a good
enough center against the Clippers. But when the Sonics begin
Sunday a run against four quality teams, results are likely to go
more along the lines of Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the Sonics are without heart. Ruben Patterson, a
one-year Laker, thrashed and crashed for 19 points to lead Seattle
Tuesday, evoking memories for a courtside visitor, Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Laker superstar, in the company of Starbucks chairman and
business partner Howard Schultz, ruminated on Ruben's participation
in informal pickup games at UCLA during the summer after his
drafting by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game we played, he said, `I got Magic,''' Johnson said.
``That told me something.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd go after me every time. I always told him I was smarter
than he was. But you know, after I got done playing against him, I
had to take naps a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Johnson said he admired the heart shown by
Patterson, Grant and Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means something,'' said Johnson, tapping his chest. ``I'd
like to see some of that on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, heart goes only so far. Patterson is 6-foot-5,
O'Neal 7-1. In a league where size still matters, the Sonics can
dish all the heart they want. O'Neal remains much closer to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   Some truths just don't go away.

NORTHRIDGE UPSETS FRESNO STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO _ Sure, its opponent was missing an All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Think the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team cares? The
Matadors pulled off what could be the most important win in school
history Tuesday night _ a 69-66 victory over heavily favored Fresno
State.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (2-1) went up by as many as 16 points in the second half,
held on and shocked a sellout crowd 10,220 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, with their roster full of high school all-stars,
including Naismith Award candidate Courtney Alexander, were
outplayed by Northridge players who probably never hit FSU head
coach Jerry Tarkanian's recruiting radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of win I've dreamed of for this program for
four years,'' said CSUN head coach Bobby Braswell, who had a
one-word answer when asked if it was the biggest win in school
history:
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to enjoy this win, we're going to savor it,''
Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN got a game-high 27 points from Brian Heinle and
outrebounded Fresno State 53-36. The Matadors also hit four crucial
free throws in the final two minutes to keep the Bulldogs (3-3)
from playing for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive baskets by Heinle and Markus Carr gave CSUN a 38-28
lead with 15:39 left _ and the crowd was stunned by how handily the
Matadors were beating the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   When Hewitt Rolle made an easy layup to increase the CSUN lead
to 45-34, the fans were angry, lustily booing the Bulldogs off the
court during a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Heinle once again, with a 3-pointer to make it
48-34. Then an uncontested dunk by Andre Larry with 10:34 made it
52-34.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Fresno State team picked to win the Western Athletic
Conference and coming off a championship-game appearance this past
weekend at the Hawaii Pacific Thanksgiving Classic.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Fresno State made just one of its first 10
shots to allow CSUN to build confidence early. After a sluggish
start _ the Matadors missed their first five shots and didn't score
until Larry's 18-footer from the top of the key with 15 minutes
left in the first half _ CSUN outplayed Fresno State through much
of the game's first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Three-pointers by Heinle and Marco McCain were highlights of a
14-3 run over six minutes. Heinle's three with 9:24 left gave CSUN
a 16-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Heinle, the benched center who scored 21 points in
Saturday's home win against Cal State Dominguez Hills, who ignited
the Matadors. His dribble-drive and dunk around center Melvin Ely,
one of the Bulldogs' best players, gave CSUN a 14-9 lead at the
10-minute mark of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   After Fresno State brought the sellout crowd back into the game
with a dunk by Ely to cut the CSUN lead to 22-21, CSUN answered
with crisp inside passes which resulted in easy layups.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Parris (11 points, 11 rebounds) capped the half with a
driving lay in at the buzzer to increase the Matadors' lead to
32-25.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN shot just 37 percent in the first half (14 of 38) but the
Bulldogs were worse _ 27 percent (9 for 33). That included a
3-for-18 performance from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs shot 34 percent (24 for 71) in the game, including
12 of 44 (27 percent) on 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Fresno State's pathetic shooting performance has to be
credited to CSUN's defensive changes. The Matadors started the game
in a zone, then went man-to-man, then went back to zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out and play our game and we did,'' said
Heinle, who made 11 of 19 shots and also had four assists in just
28 minutes.

with a lecture. Instead, they are instructed to file a report with
the school authorities, so that a uniform policy can run its
course, and no offending student escapes punishment. By Dirk

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD FIRES BELMONT DEVELOPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(will also move on the California wire)  
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles school board has voted unanimously
to fire the developer of the Belmont Learning Center and declared a
state of emergency at the site of the nation's costliest high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating the battle between Los Angeles Unified and Temple
Beaudry Partners, the district's top investigator revealed that he
had issued a subpoena for documents to the developer last week and
fired off four identical demands to subcontractors moments before
the board's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions push the nation's second largest school district
closer to a nasty legal showdown with the developer, led by Kajima
Urban Development, over construction of what could turn out to be a
$282 million school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kajima is out,'' said board member David Tokofsky. ``We would
have to re-engage them. It's a choice the board would have to make.
We'd decide.''
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous decree on Tuesday, the board blamed Kajima for
failing to meet last week's deadline to board up the partially
completed high school and suspend construction. Nearly half of the
complex remains exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The board action, which requires approval from the county
superintendent, authorized LAUSD project manager Edwin Weyrauch to
hire a new contractor to weatherproof the campus and padlock the
property.
</P>
<P>
   If the board opts to finish building the environmentally
troubled school, it would be required to first vote to go forward
and then agree upon a developer to complete the work, said Richard
Sheehan, the district's top lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the law firm representing the district in
negotiations with the developer maintained the vote did not break
the original development agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``No options have been closed,'' said a lawyer for the district.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Temple Beaudry Partners said it has
``fully and faithfully met all of its contractual obligations'' and
hinted at legal action, saying it would focus on ``resolving
contractual issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have consistently tried to work cooperatively with the
district in a partnership that would assist the district in
achieving its goal of providing a facility in a severely
under-served area. We are disappointed that the partnership is now
ended,'' said Kenneth J. Reizes, a project executive for Kajima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district is being disingenuous in saying we are unable or
unwilling to complete the work.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the district and Kajima began to
deteriorate in June, after the Daily News revealed the developer
had given incomplete data to the Los Angeles City Fire Department
about the extent of methane gas problems at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont was designed to include a shopping mall, low-income
housing and classroom space for 5,000 students. But it sits
half-completed atop an oil field seeping potentially deadly and
explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   While $170 million has been invested in Belmont, it remains
unclear if the environmental problems will prevent the school from
opening safely. The district would have to invest another $112
million _ almost exactly the same price of a new high school _ to
complete the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for state experts to finish environmental tests at the
site, the board first ordered the developer to slow construction in
mid-July and authorized spending no more than $2.2 million through
Oct. 15 to protect the site from vandals and weather. The board
agreed to extend the deadline on five occasions, finally agreeing
to spend $550,000 more to close the site by Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, the developer refused to sign the modified
agreement and demanded that the district itemize the tasks it
wanted completed. In response, Weyrauch sent the developer a list
of 46 areas that needed to be weatherproofed. The tasks ranged from
closing up windows with plywood to completing masonry, and an
extension to Dec. 17 was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Kajima balked at the new time limit, arguing it would take three
months to complete the long list of work, and Weyrauch charged the
developer had violated its contract to build Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The developer responded by ridiculing LAUSD management of the
project in a two-page letter, calling the direction ``arbitrary,
vague and misleading to the point of providing impossible tasks and
deadlines.''
</P>
<P>
   By finding that an emergency condition exists at Belmont, the
board permitted Weyrauch to hire a contractor without its approval
or competitive bidding. State law requires the county
superintendent to sign off on the board vote.
</P>
<P>
   The board authorized Weyrauch to get estimates from three
contractors to secure the site for no more than $1.2 million. The
work is expected to be completed Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Don Mullinax, director of the LAUSD Internal Audits and Special
Investigations branch, said he issued subpoenas to the developer
and subcontractors to ``safeguard'' documents in light of the
``deteriorating relationship'' between the firms and the district.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Temple Beaudry Partners, Mullinax issued subpoenas to
Turner/Kajima, a joint construction venture; Weingardener Masonry;
Downey Electric Inc.; and Keenan, Hopkins, Suder and Stowell
Contractors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the school board has indicated they are leaning
toward abandoning Belmont. A vote on the fate of the school will
likely take place next week.

LAKERS WIN AMID SEATTLE CHAOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Amid one of the greatest civil protests in decades,
the Lakers took a cue from the rowdy demonstrations that surrounded
them.
</P>
<P>
   They blockaded, they disrupted, they raised fists and they
chanted a bit. They just didn't have to leave the safe confines of
KeyArena to do any of it.
</P>
<P>
   As tens of thousands protested world trade policies just down
the street, the Lakers imposed their own kind of embargo on the
hometown Seattle SuperSonics and their low-wage labor import, Ruben
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive demonstration was a profound success, resulting in
a 101-77 rout Tuesday night in front of 17,072 protest-weary fans.
</P>
<P>
   It figured the Lakers would win this battle in the midst of a
global trade debate. They are led, after all, by 1960s child Phil
Jackson. The political-minded coach steered clear of the fracas on
the streets, though he enthusiastically approved of the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   It all made for a bizarre juxtaposition of sports and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Strange days, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different day,'' said Lakers guard Derek Fisher. ``But we
really didn't have much to do with that. We just continued to hope
we would remain safe within our (hotel) rooms. . . . Hopefully, we
can get out of here safe now. The saga's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   And impossible for anyone here for the day to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters against the World Trade Organization clogged the
downtown streets surrounding the Lakers' hotel and the resulting
chaos threatened to cancel the game.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes-violent demonstrations prompted officials to
impose a 7 p.m. curfew and declare a state of civil emergency, but
the game went on without incident and the arena filled to
near-capacity for the 7 p.m. tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers, unfazed by clouds of tear gas, random vandalism
and occasional violence, made their own statement, of a decidedly
nonpolitical nature. They handed the Sonics their first home loss
in seven games this season.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, they made a little history of their own,
holding their third straight opponent under 85 points, a feat not
achieved by the Lakers since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal played one of his shortest stints of the
season, 33 minutes, but compressed his production to finish with 27
points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots. And they didn't let
Patterson, the former Laker and self-proclaimed ``Kobe Stopper,''
do too much damage. Patterson did put O'Neal in early foul trouble
with drives to the hoop and led the Sonics with 19 points. But the
Lakers had the game in hand by halftime, sporting a 13-point lead
on the Sonics' home floor.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary day at home for the Sonics, who had to
stay in a downtown hotel overnight because of the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been more fun to go down to Nordstrom and protest
than to play that game,'' quipped Seattle coach Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Television coverage of the game was transposed with
round-the-clock coverage of arrests, tear-gas clouds and police
blockades _ all happening within several blocks of KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the NBA commissioner's office monitored the
activity all day and was prepared to cancel the game at the first
sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a confidant to presidential candidate Bill Bradley,
stayed abreast of events listening to National Public Radio in his
hotel room. And he smiled his approval of the protests, at least
the peaceful ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad to see this age group motivated to protest
something,'' Jackson said. ``I think it's great. I just hope that
they can carry this from such global perspective to individual
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' awareness of events was limited to having their
mid-afternoon naps at the Four Seasons hotel disrupted by the
firing of police rifles shooting rubber bullets and tear-gas
canisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a drowsy day,'' O'Neal said. ``Drums, screaming, arguing.
I didn't get enough rest today.''
</P>
<P>
   Players watched the events on TV and out their hotel windows.
Then their bus ride to the afternoon shoot-around was delayed by
protesters filling the downtown streets near the Four Seasons,
which also housed several international dignitaries. It took a
police escort to transport the Lakers safely to the arena for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, police and hotel security decided to lock
the doors for safety _ and momentarily trapped the Lakers'
unsuspecting public-relations director on the street.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Lakers reached the arena prior to the game, the
national guard had been mobilized. By an hour before tipoff, a
state of civil emergency had been declared.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers couldn't help but leave with a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting,'' Fisher said. ``We travel a lot and we
see a lot of interesting things. But that's something that you go
through your career _ and talk NBA stories to tell the grandkids, I
mean, !ital!that's!off! a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a little bit about the situation, kind of how some
of the (protesters) feel, but you never get your message across
with violence. It's unfortunate that in this world where we have so
much to be thankful for that we still almost have to go to war to
get our point across.''

LAKERS ROMP AS SONICS SUFFER FIRST HOME LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With World Trade Organization protests, civil unrest
and the need for the National Guard to patrol Seattle streets,
KeyArena figured to be a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   However, home was hardly a haven for the Sonics, who were
bulldozed by the Los Angeles Lakers, 101-77, Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In their first loss this season at KeyArena, the Sonics were
smothered by an impressive Laker defense. The Sonics shot a dismal
39 percent and never got closer than 10 points after falling behind
52-39 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Much like those outside events, this one got ugly in a hurry.
The Sonics' usually high-octane offense managed just 16 points in
the second quarter and 18 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics point guard Gary Payton was so disenchanted by the loss
that he unleashed a verbal tirade in a corridor near the team's
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Payton could be heard calling for his agent, Aaron Goodwin,
outside of Coach Paul Westphal's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better do something about these (expletive),'' Payton
could be heard screaming. ``I'm tired of these (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   The commotion was so belligerent that teammates Horace Grant and
Vernon Maxwell sprung from the seats. They both rushed out of a
locker room filled with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely frustrated by the loss,'' Westphal said in a
statement after the incident. ``Tempers flared. This was about the
fifth or sixth on the totem pole this year. I'm not going to worry
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A witness to an earlier incident said that Goodwin approached
Payton on the Sonics' bench during the fourth quarter. Goodwin
asked Payton what was going on, referring to the blowout. Payton
then stood up, pointed to Westphal and said ``Ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time Payton exploded after a big loss.
Payton delivered similar fireworks after a 30-point loss at
Portland last season.
</P>
<P>
   Payton and his agent left without comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is curious why Payton blew up because of a defeat
just 15 games into an 82-game season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because Payton had to sit through a merciless
fourth quarter. Payton left the game after the third period with 12
points, six rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 75-59 at that point. Their biggest deficit
was 101-73 with 1:04 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker was adamant about not using the game to gauge the
Sonics. They are 11-4 and the Pacific Division rival Lakers left
11-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to throw this away,'' said Baker, who finished
with 12 points and 10 rebounds. ``We're better than we played. We
were horrible. This team can't beat us by 30 points. We can beat
this team on any night.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time, the Sonics will at least have backup.
</P>
<P>
   Shammond Williams, Greg Foster, Rashard Lewis, Vernon Maxwell,
Chuck Person and Vladimir Stepania each came off the bench in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   None of them brought anything.
</P>
<P>
   That group combined to shoot 1-for-13 in the first half.
Maxwell, normally the offensive canon off the bench, was the
biggest culprit. He missed his first six shots.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell (1-for-10) is playing with sore right knee. He never
found his rhythm while the starters made 14 of 27 shots. It was
deflating considering the Sonics pounced on the Lakers early, and
built a 21-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sonics undoing came in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 35-33 with 5:54 left in the second, the Sonics managed to
score just one more field goal before halftime. The Lakers,
meanwhile, went on a 19-4 run that ended the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were lulled into a slower tempo than they prefer
because of Laker center Shaquille O'Neal's presence down low. The
Sonics missed open shots and were unable to score easy baskets in
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they were on their feet,'' Lakers coach Phil
Jackson said. `` ... I heard they had to stay in hotels rather than
in their homes. That makes it kind of a road game for them so they
are still undefeated at home as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the game was never a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, WTO protests did not spill into the Seattle Center area
near KeyArena. Both teams arrived on time. None of the Sonics
experienced traffic problems because Monday night they stayed at a
hotel within a mile of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been more fun to go down to Nordstrom to protest
than to play that game,'' Westphal joked.
</P>
<P>
   It was about the only humor one could find.

JARRETT CAPTURES DRIVER OF YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly crowned NASCAR Winston Cup champion Dale Jarrett will
leave New York City with some additional honors this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has been voted 1999 Driver of the Year, outpolling CART
rookie champion Juan Montoya for the award's 33rd edition. Jarrett,
who is in New York this week for festivities leading to the NASCAR
awards banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria on Friday night, will be
honored as the year's top driver during a luncheon at Le Cirque
2000 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and Montoya were the only drivers named in final secret
balloting conducted by a 15-member panel of motorsports
journalists, including this reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, 43, is the fifth Cup champion in the past six years to
be voted the award, joining Dale Earnhardt (1994) and Jeff Gordon
(1995, 1997-98). NHRA Funny Car champion John Force won the award
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything comes out of this whole thing ... as much as
anything, I hope our story is a little bit of an inspiration to
others,'' said Jarrett, who joins car-owner Robert Yates and crew
chief Todd Parrott as first-time series champions. ``Perseverance
pays off and hard work and dedication. I think that's a story that
can be told by Todd, Robert and myself. Hopefully, it'll be
somewhat of an inspiration to these other aspiring drivers, owners,
crew chiefs and crew members alike, that if you work hard and
dedicate yourself to what you're doing, then you can become
champions. You're never too old.''

   Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit
Taurus, won four races in 34 starts this year. But he racked up 24
top-five and 29 top-10 finishes en route to winning the
championship over native Texan Bobby Labonte by 201 points.

<P>
   Montoya, 24, of Colombia, won seven of 20 Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Series events driving the No. 4 Reynard-Honda
owned by Chip Ganassi.

<P>
   Earlier, Cup rookie-of-the-year candidate Tony Stewart took
fourth-quarter Driver of the Year honors. Stewart, who won all
three of his record-setting Cup races during the fourth quarter,
earned 12 of 15 first-place votes and 120 points. Dale Earnhardt
Jr., who clinched his second consecutive NASCAR Busch Series
championship this year, was second with 37 points.

 49ERS DYNASTY ISN'T COMING BACK  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Welcome to the Fannies, the awards show honoring
people who distinguish themselves in the field of athletics while
sitting on their ... fannies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the award for the worst fans in sports. The envelope,
please.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Denver Broncos' fans! They pack snowballs around
batteries and hurl 'em off the upper deck. Hilarious, cowardly and
potentially lethal! Rocky Mountains Fever _ catch it!
</P>
<P>
   Now the big winners. Drum roll, please!
</P>
<P>
   It's San Francisco 49ers fans!
</P>
<P>
   (Whooo! NIII-NURRR fans, we're No. 1! Yeahhh!)
</P>
<P>
   Today we salute their boorish and delusional sense of
entitlement. Niners fans had an 18-year dynasty dropped in their
nacho-stained and beer-soaked laps and assumed it was their
birthright.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, this is not an anti-booing screed. Boo away. An NFL
game ain't the junior high production of ``Our Town.'' The players
are mercenaries who are paid handsomely to suffer gruesome injuries
for your viewing pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   What's unbecoming is the whining and hand-wringing of 49ers
fans, the ``How could my team do this to me, a son of San
Francisco?'' It's the indignation and shame.
</P>
<P>
   Niners fans are caught in a time warp. The NFL has regulated
dynasties out of existence. The league targeted the 49ers like the
government went after Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   You've had your last 18-year orgy, 49ers fans. Wake up and snort
the coffee. Life is hard, the 49ers suck. Try to take it like a
man, or woman, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   FORGET POKEMON: The hot toy for Christmas might be the Tyson
doll, the first gay black man doll.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson sells for $50.95 at Does Your Father Know, on Castro
Street, but hurry, because the heat is on. Boxer Mike Tyson's
people (famous boxers have ``people'') are threatening to sue the
dollmaker, and so are representatives of supermodel Tyson Beckford.
</P>
<P>
   I hear the Tyson Chicken Co. people are considering a lawsuit,
too, but their case will be weakened by the fact that all of their
chickens are white, straight and female.
</P>
<P>
   JUST IN TIME for the newish Millennium, Spenger's Seafood Grotto
is ready to step back into the past.
</P>
<P>
   The million-year-old Berkeley eatery reopens Saturday after long
renovation, and this could become the seafood capital of the known
universe.
</P>
<P>
   There's new stuff on the menu, but I am assured that all
traditions will be honored, too. Example: Martinis are stirred, not
shaken. Same with memories.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD CENTRAL: Yes, you get all your irrelevant eating news here.
A recent mention of weird food fusion led to these bits of tid:
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cochran reports a recent visit to a German restaurant in
Syracuse, N.Y., where she tried the Reuben egg roll _ corned beef
and sauerkraut in the rice wrap. ... Another reader says don't
forget about the old Berkeley joint, Robbie's Chinese-American
Hofbrau. ... And Ken Thompson dined at the English pub Fox and
Goose in Sacramento and ordered the Eggs Benedict Arnold. They
turned on him.
</P>
<P>
   PUZZLED by e-addresses? So was Grant Richards, who saw an ad
board on the side of a bus for ``gotahoe.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a hoe''? Is this a web site for a garden-tool store, or
for a pimp?
</P>
<P>
   THE DMV fines us if we're not up to date, so how do they explain
this:
</P>
<P>
   Debby Baizer overpaid her registration fee, so the DMV sent her
a refund check, along with a note on DMV letterhead that states
that the governor of California is Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The gov that keeps on giving. At least the DMV has used up all
its Reagan stationery.
</P>
<P>
   LOUSY TIPPER? Not Danny Glover, says taxi driver Alley Cat, in
response to item about Glover stiffing a local waiter. ``I took him
home from the airport, he gave me $40 on a $32 fare.``
</P>
<P>
   Other readers, and at least one local cabbie, tell me Glover's
gripe about New York cabbies not picking up black riders goes for
S.F., too.
</P>
<P>
   JUST IN CASE you have a body part free when you're driving to
work, cell-phoning, coffee-drinking, radio-punching, bird-flipping
and toenail-polishing, there's this: Commuter Aerobics. ``Don't
spin your wheels, squeeze your butt,'' says the ad, and for many
reasons I don't want to hear any more, OK?
</P>
<P>
   DULY NOTED: Construction workers who assemble the steel
framework of a building are not steelworkers, but ironworkers.
Steelworkers work in steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what's the proper way to refer to people who iron
shirts or steal steel.

 CLINTON COLLECTS HALF-MILLION IN S.F. _ AND BOOSTS MAYOR  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton made a pit stop in San
Francisco Tuesday, picking up $500,000 in contributions for the
Democratic battles ahead and using the opportunity to cheer on
embattled Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle,
the president stopped for a luncheon with 50 guests at the Pacific
Heights home of venture capitalist Bill Hambrecht and his wife,
Sally, where attendees paid $5,000 to $20,000 to eat dim sum before
a stunning panoramic view of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was a fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee and was attended by leading Democrats, including
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt; Senator Barbara Boxer, San
Francisco Bay Area Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Ellen Tauscher and
Lynn Woolsey; and California Democratic Party Chair Art Torres.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks to go before his runoff election, the fate of
Brown was clearly Topic A among the deep-pocketed Democratic
donors.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor _ long a star attraction at such big-ticket party
fund-raisers _ has touted his close relationships with Clinton,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
Democratic Governor Gray Davis. But now Brown finds himself in an
unexpectedly tough re-election battle against Supervisor Tom
Ammiano, a fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi subtly acknowledged the mayor's troubles when she
addressed Clinton and introduced him to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, no matter what you've heard, (Brown is) our
great, present and  &UR; future  &LR; mayor of San Francisco,'' she said to
warm applause.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has clearly taken an interest in Brown's
predicament. As Clinton disembarked from Air Force One at San
Francisco International Airport, presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart asked a reporter about the most recent polls on the
mayoral runoff. But he didn't know the name of Brown's challenger.
``Who is he again?'' Lockhart asked.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's fund-raiser in the Hambrecht home, Brown appeared
the very image of the connected Democrat. He hunkered down with
Clinton, delivering an animated and apparently side-splitting
update on his current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton _ who recorded radio commercials and
telephone voice messages on Brown's behalf during the general
election in November _ never explicitly endorsed the mayor or
appealed for votes for him.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded Democrats of the administration's record on
education, parental leave and other issues, and praised Pelosi and
Gephardt for spearheading a campaign to win back the House
leadership for the Democrats in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting 50 seats around the country, at least six of
them in California,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also pointedly reminded Democratic loyalists that
San Francisco _ and, by inference, Brown himself _ has supported
his administration in critical fights with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so indebted to California. San Francisco has been so good
to me and Hillary, the vice president and Mrs. Gore,'' he told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And he underscored his longtime and occasionally teasing
friendship with Brown before a sympathetic audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot from Willie Brown,'' Clinton said,
gesturing to the mayor, who stood by in a resplendent steel-gray
suit. ``I've learned to dress better.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton laughed aloud. ``I never thought I'd live long
enough to see him in a race where somebody is running to the left
of him,'' he said, as Brown grinned. ``I don't know if there's any
oxygen left over there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, Clinton added, ``I'm still learning from
you. And I thank you, Mr. Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's kind words for Brown may carry some weight.
Polls show that California voters still overwhelmingly approve of
Clinton's job performance, even though they don't like him
personally.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiments about Brown were repeated by Torres, the state
Democratic Party chairman, who left no doubt as to where his
support lies in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's doing great. It's all going to come down to
getting out the vote. And that's what we're going to do,'' said
Torres, adding that absentee ballots and precinct walking will be
crucial among key voter groups like African Americans, Asians and
Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   And while some have criticized Brown for frequenting such
high-priced fund-raisers, Torres argued that the mayor's political
relationships have worked to the advantage of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (his connections) are very important in terms of what
the mayor's been able to bring to the city,'' he said. ``That
depends on the relationships he's made over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving San Francisco, Clinton flew to Los Angeles, where
he called on Congress to extend the current background checks on
prospective gun buyers, to ban violent juvenile offenders from
possessing guns when they turn 21, to require child safety locks on
every handgun and to prohibit the importation of high-capacity
ammunition clips.

PROTESTERS FORCE CANCELLATION OF TRADE SUMMIT'S OPENING SESSION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Chaos ruled the streets of downtown Seattle Tuesday,
as confrontations between riot police and thousands of dancing,
shouting protesters forced the World Trade Organization to cancel
the opening session of a three-day summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets in
unsuccessful attempts to clear the streets of crowds who &LR; that kept
diplomats such as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and WTO Director-General Mike Moore
trapped in their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   After the morning ceremony was canceled, enough diplomats were
able to sneak through the barriers set up by protesters and police
to enter the Washington State Convention Center for the scheduled
afternoon plenary session.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the largest acts of mass civil disobedience in
U.S. history, a mix of carnival, peaceful rally and riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have witnessed a very sad day,'' Moore said late in the
day. However, he said that despite the rocky start, the 135
assembled nations would succeed in starting a new round of
multinational trade negotiations to lower tariffs and other
barriers on agriculture products, manufactured goods, and service
industries such as banking and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conference will be a success,'' Moore said. ``The issues
are too important to be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mayor Paul Schell declared a state of emergency last
night, ordering a curfew from 7 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. Washington Gov.
Gary Locke called in up to 200 unarmed members of the National
Guard to assist city and state police.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's move appeared an act of desperation after police failed
to forcibly remove protesters who had chained themselves together
as &LR; and formed human barriers on the pavement. Several protesters
were injured by rubber bullets and tear gas fired by police,
sometimes at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   At least 22 protesters were arrested _ fewer than had been
expected, a result of authorities' apparent decision to displace
protesters without arresting them.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few demonstrators managed to hurl the police tear-gas
canisters back across the barricades, and a few unoccupied police
cars were vandalized, there was no violence against police.
</P>
<P>
   However, small groups of young renegades took advantage of the
pandemonium to smash store windows and loot. They were still
roaming through downtown late last night, playing a cat-and mouse
game with police.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 mostly youthful protesters at the convention center
were joined by a march of AFL-CIO members and supporters that
swelled to about 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to change WTO or we're going to get rid of WTO,''
Teamsters President James Hoffa Jr. told the union members at a
rally before they reached downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The protests underscored the growing controversy around the WTO.
Backers say the world body is essential for facilitating trade and
investment across the globe. But opponents say it favors
corporations and undermines national laws that protect the
environment, endangered species and consumers. Union leaders also
said the WTO's push for free trade encourages American companies to
move operations overseas, where workers are paid far less and have
few rights.
</P>
<P>
   The wide variety of complaints about the WTO was evident from
the kaleidoscope of humanity in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes, music and elaborate puppets were the order of the day.
There were sea turtles, dancing South Korean fishermen, a group
called the Radical Cheerleaders and even a troupe of Santas. Most
of the demonstrators were peaceful, espousing nonviolence. But
their message of protest against the WTO's policies was marred by
the small number of masked anarchists wearing black who engaged in
sporadic acts of vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   The violence wasn't appreciated by most, and produced some
unusual, spontaneous forms of law and order. For example, as the
crowds were reaching critical mass in midafternoon, several young
toughs broke into a Starbucks coffee bar (which, like nearly all
downtown stores, had closed for the day). They opened the front
door triumphantly, expecting the masses outside to enter and loot
the place.
</P>
<P>
   But the spectators reacted indignantly. ``Close the door!''
several shouted. ``No violence!'' The vandals were shoved aside.
For the rest of the day, protesters stood guard outside the smashed
windows, protecting the premises.
</P>
<P>
   However, after the curfew drove most people from the area, the
vandals returned and looted the premises.
</P>
<P>
   The main organizers of the day's events condemned the
destruction, and called on supporters to return this morning to
sweep up the debris and scrub away the graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vandalism doesn't represent in any way the tens of
thousands of people who peaceably protested against the WTO,'' said
Medea Benjamin, co-director of Global Exchange, a San
Francisco-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials from other countries expressed outrage that
protesters had been allowed to delay the start of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Asfour, the Jordanian minister of industry and trade,
said he had not been able to get to the convention center because
the odor of gas used by the police was wafting over the official
entrance designated for his use.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like us who came from thousands of miles and to find no
organization _ it's very sad,'' Asfour said.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries are strongly opposed to demands that the
WTO take into account labor and environmental standards in its
trade negotiations. They see this as a veiled effort at
protectionism by rich nations seeking to take away the competitive
advantages of lower wage scales and more lax environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Lamy, Europe's chief trade commissioner, said Tuesday's
street protests show that the talks are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happening outside has an influence on the
negotiations,'' Lamy said. The U.S. position ``is even less
possible after the demonstrations than before'' because the public
has social concerns that need to be addressed, he said.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By PAUL KRUGMAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If a picture is worth a thousand words, a two-page spread in The
New York Times, featuring more than a dozen pictures, can speak
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, the lavish Nov. 15 advertisement by the Turning
Point Project, a coalition of activists opposed to globalization in
general and the World Trade Organization in particular, said more
than any merely verbal exposition about what really motivates those
activists could. Indeed, it revealed quite a bit more than its
sponsors intended.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for the ad was the WTO ``ministerial'' taking place
in Seattle this week. The WTO has become to leftist mythology what
the United Nations is to the militia movement: the center of a
global conspiracy against all that is good and decent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the ``ultra-secretive'' WTO has become a
sort of super-governmental body that forces nations to bow to the
wishes of multinational corporations. It destroys local cultures,
the headline on the ad read ``Global Monoculture''; it despoils the
environment; and it rides roughshod over democracy, forcing
governments to remove laws that conflict with its sinister
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Like most successful urban legends, this one is based on a
sliver of truth. The gradual global progress toward free trade that
began in the 1930s, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced the Trade
Agreements Program, has always depended on international
negotiations: I'll reduce my tariffs if you reduce yours.
</P>
<P>
   But there has always been the problem of governments that give
with one hand and take away with the other, that dutifully remove
tariffs and then use other excuses to keep imports out.
(Certainement, there is free trade within the European Union, but
those British cows, they are not safe.)
</P>
<P>
   To make agreements work there has to be some kind of
quasi-judicial process that determines when ostensibly domestic
measures are de facto a reimposition of trade barriers and hence a
violation of treaty. Under the pre-WTO system, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this process was slow and
cumbersome. It has now become swifter and more decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some of its decisions can be challenged: Was the
U.S. ban on dolphin-unsafe tuna really a trade barrier in disguise?
</P>
<P>
   But the much-feared power of the WTO to overrule local laws is
strictly limited to enforcement of the spirit of existing
agreements. It cannot in any important way force countries that are
skeptical about the benefits of globalization to open themselves
further to foreign trade and investment. If most countries
nonetheless are eager or at least willing to participate in
globalization, it is because they are convinced that it is in their
own interests.
</P>
<P>
   And by and large they are right. The raw fact is that every
successful example of economic development this past century--every
case of a poor nation that worked its way up to a more or less
decent, or at least dramatically better, standard of living--has
taken place via globalization; that is, by producing for the world
market rather than trying for self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers who do that production for the global market
are very badly paid by First World standards. But to claim that
they have been impoverished by globalization, you have to carefully
ignore comparisons across time and space--namely, you have to
forget that those workers were even poorer before the new exporting
jobs became available and ignore the fact that those who do not
have access to the global market are far worse off than those who
do.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis of 1997-99 temporarily gave those who claim
that globalization is bad for workers everywhere a bit of
ammunition, but the crisis did not go on forever, and anyway the
solution to future crises surely involves some policing of
short-term capital movements rather than a retreat from
globalization as a whole. Even the Malaysians continue to welcome
long-term foreign investors and place their faith on manufactured
exports.
</P>
<P>
   What about the environment? Certainly some forests have been cut
down to feed global markets. But nations that are heedless of the
environment are quite capable of doing immense damage without the
help of multinational corporations--just ask the Eastern Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   For what it is worth, the most conspicuous examples of
environmental pillage in the Third World today have nothing to do
with the WTO. The forest fires that envelop Southeast Asia in an
annual smoke cloud are set by land-hungry locals; the subsidized
destruction of Amazonian rain forests began as part of a Brazilian
strategy of inward-looking development.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, integration of the world economy, which puts
national actions under international scrutiny, is probably on
balance a force toward better, not worse, environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   But anyway, these are side issues, because what that
advertisement makes clear--clearer, I suspect, than its sponsors
intended--is that the opposition to globalization actually has very
little to do with wages or the environment. After all, leaving
aside a photo of tree stumps and another of an outfall pipe, here
are the horrors of globalization the Turning Point Project chose to
illustrate:
</P>
<P>
   A highway interchange, a parking lot filled with cars, a traffic
jam, suburban tract housing, an apartment building with numerous
satellite dishes, an office with many computer screens, office
workers on a busy street, high-rise office buildings, a ``factory
farm'' with many chickens, a supermarket aisle, a McDonald's arch.
</P>
<P>
   Each picture was accompanied by a caption asking, ``Is this Los
Angeles or Cairo?'' ``Is this India or London?'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   What is so horrible about these scenes? Here's what the ad says,
``A few decades ago, it was still possible to leave home and go
somewhere else: The architecture was different, the landscape was
different, the language, dress, and values were different. That was
a time when we could speak of cultural diversity. But with economic
globalization, diversity is fast disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't argue with that; lives there the tourist with soul so
dead that he does not wish that he could visit rural France, or
Mexico City, or for that matter Kansas City the way they were,
rather than the way they are? But the world is not run for the
edification of tourists. It is or should be run for the benefit of
ordinary people in their daily lives. And that is where the
indignation of the Turning Point people starts to seem rather
strange.
</P>
<P>
   For surely the most striking thing about the horrors of
globalization illustrated in those photos is that for most of the
world's people they represent aspirations, things they wish they
had, rather than ominous threats. Traffic jams and ugly
interchanges are annoying, but most people would gladly accept that
annoyance in exchange for the freedom that comes with owning a car
(and more to the point, being wealthy enough to afford one). Tract
housing and apartment buildings may be ugly, but they are paradise
compared with village huts or urban shanties. Wearing a suit and
working at a computer in an office tower are, believe it or not,
preferable to backbreaking work in a rice paddy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course what is good for the individual is not always
good if everyone else does it too. Having a big house with a garden
is nice, but seeing the countryside covered by suburban sprawl is
not, and we might all be better off if we could all agree (or be
convinced by tax incentives) to take up a bit less space.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for cultural choices: Boston residents who indulge
their taste for Canadian divas do undermine the prospects of local
singer-songwriters and might be collectively better off if local
radio stations had some kind of cultural content rule. But there is
a very fine line between such arguments for collective action and
supercilious paternalism, especially when cultural matters are
concerned; are we warning societies about unintended consequences
or are we simply disagreeing with individual tastes?
</P>
<P>
   And it is very clear from the advertisement in The Times that
the Turning Point Project--and the whole movement it
represents--are on the supercilious side of that line. Although
they talk of freedom and democracy, their key demand is that
individuals be prevented from getting what they want--that
governments be free, nay encouraged, to deny individuals the right
to drive cars, work in offices, eat cheeseburgers, and watch
satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Presumably because people will really be happier if they
retain their traditional ``language, dress, and values.'' Thus,
Spaniards would be happier if they still dressed in black and let
narrow-minded priests run their lives, and residents of the
American South would be happier if planters still sipped mint
juleps, wore white suits, and accepted traditional deference from
sharecroppers ... instead of living in this ``dreary'' modern world
in which Madrid is just like Paris and Atlanta is just like New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Well, somehow I suspect that the residents of Madrid and
Atlanta, while they may regret some loss of tradition, prefer
modernity. And you know what? I think the rest of the world has the
right to make the same choice.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As I walked to work this morning, a man stood on a street corner
shouting, ``Do you know Jesus? Repent! Repent or suffer eternal
torments in Hell!''
 &HT;    Since I live in Memphis, I figured this brother to be a
Pentecostal or a Southern Baptist.
 &HT;    Whatever the case, I knew that I -- as an Episcopalian -- was
fresh evangelistic meat, so I crossed the street.
 &HT;    Never enter into a discussion with street-corner evangelists. I
have told them they give Christians a bad name and pleaded with
them to preach God's love. They don't listen. Even if you are a
Christian, they refuse to believe you unless you are their
particular kind of Christian. Talking is not an option.
 &HT;    On Nov. 28, the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan
Chicago, representing the city's Roman Catholic Archdiocese and
thirty-nine other Christian and Jewish organizations, criticized a
Southern Baptist evangelistic plan to target their city with
100,000 missionaries next summer.
 &HT;    While the Council recognized the rights of Southern Baptists to
engage in evangelism, they questioned the wisdom of such an effort,
saying, ``a campaign of the nature and scope you envision could
contribute to a climate conducive to hate crimes.'' Citing concern
for Jews, Muslims and Hindus, they urged Baptist leaders to ``enter
into discussion with us and reconsider your plans.''
 &HT;    R. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Seminary in
Louisville, responded: ``To link New Testament evangelism with hate
crimes is cowardice posing as compassion. Fortunately, Southern
Baptists do not receive orders from Chicago's Council of Religious
Leaders, but from the New Testament and the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ.''
 &HT;    What those folks up north don't know is that their (implicit)
accusation -- Southern Baptists are narrow-minded bigots -- are
fightin' words. Chicago's council may desire consensus and
cooperation, but they only fuelled the Southern Baptist fire to
evangelize those spiritually blind northerners.
 &HT;    Talking to a bunch of liberal religious leaders is not part of
God's plan -- except, perhaps, to convert them.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the Chicago debacle prefigures that which is to
come in cities across the nation. Earlier this year, Southern
Baptists launched the ``Strategic Focus Cities'' initiative to
evangelize major metropolitan areas. Ostensibly, they just want to
``share'' Jesus. In reality, however, the Southern Baptist
Convention (SBC) wants to extend its influence to other parts of
the country by starting 60,000 new churches -- mostly in the North
and West -- by 2020.
 &HT;    Until recently, the 15-million-member SBC has been a regional
denomination. Not widely known elsewhere, it is a social, cultural
and political powerhouse in the South, where it serves as a
quasi-official religious establishment.
 &HT;    Here in Memphis, non-Southern Baptists refer to Adrian Rogers,
pastor of the city's largest Southern Baptist church, as ``Pope
Adrian,'' a moniker befitting his influence.
 &HT;    In their home region, Southern Baptists need not listen to
anyone. They do as they please. Over the last two decades, they
purged their denomination, insisting on strict theological and
moral conformity.
 &HT;    The current leaders, self-proclaimed ``Fundamentalists,'' do not
negotiate. As dissenting Southern Baptists know, they only dictate
terms of surrender. They are not used to talking to -- or invited
to discussions with -- other Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jews,
northerners, apostates and nonbelievers.
 &HT;    With any luck, as Southern Baptists attempt to become a
``national'' church, they will become less rigid and willing to
cooperate with other people of faith to promote the spiritual
welfare of all. The Chicago confrontation will not be the last.
Other groups of religious leaders, who have toiled to make their
communities better places, will insist that Southern Baptists come
to a common faith table.
 &HT;    Those of us who have lived in the North and West understand the
delicate complexity of religious pluralism, and the potential that
fundamentalist religion possesses for creating (even unintended)
violence. The narrow bigotry of the current Southern Baptist
leadership won't (I hope and pray) play in Peoria or Chicago or
Boston.
 &HT;    They are free to shout from street corners or send 100,000
missionaries to an already spiritually vital city. The Council of
Religious Leaders in Chicago has graciously asked them to slow down
their evangelistic assault -- inviting them instead to discuss
religious diversity and pluralism.
 &HT;    I wonder as I listen to this regional religious cross talk: What
would Jesus do? But having observed the SBC over the last decade, I
suspect the campaign will go on as scheduled. If I were those
Chicago leaders, I'd have just crossed to the other side of the
street.

 &HT;    Dole to get UD's Leadership with Virtue Award
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ She served five U.S. presidents and tried to
become one herself. She led the nation's largest philanthropic
organization for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Elizabeth Dole, included in Americans' list of the
world's top 10 most admired women, will add yet another distinction
to an already packed resume: She will receive the University of
Dayton's first Leadership with Virtue Award.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was selected from among more than two dozen nominees, said
Jack Proud, chairman of the virtue award selection committee and
past president of UD's national alumni association. The
association, along with the university, sponsors the award.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations came from UD alumni around the country and from
Miami Valley community members, Proud said.
</P>
<P>
   UD officials unveiled the Leadership with Virtue award in April,
saying it will be presented annually to leaders who blend a high
level of integrity, vision, inclusion and emotional balance with
their professional achievements.
</P>
<P>
   UD officials have scheduled a news conference Thursday to
announce Dole's selection. UD is organizing a leadership symposium
to accompany the presentation of the first award Feb.10.
</P>
<P>
   The university also plans to endow a one-year scholarship in
each recipient's name to be awarded to a UD junior.
</P>
<P>
   Dole ``really personifies the criteria we were looking for,''
Proud said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has served as Federal Trade Commission member, secretary of
transportation and secretary of labor. For eight years, until
January 1999, she served as president of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Women Executives in State Government gave Dole its
Lifetime Achievement Award for helping women and minorities break
through the ``glass ceiling.'' Later that year, she was inducted
into the Safety and Health Hall of Fame International for
accomplishments in transportation, workplace and blood safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's name emerged last year when UD officials and alumni began
organizing the annual award, Proud said, but her name was removed
from the list when she announced her candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the award to an active political candidate would have
been viewed as overly partisan, Proud said. But when Dole bowed out
of the race earlier this fall, her name was restored to
consideration.

 &HT;    A license to bore: family e-mail tales
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I've finally figured out the mystery of the
personal, lengthy and, yes, often dull family Christmas newsletters
I've been getting by e-mail from Dan Eggleston.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wonders of e-mail, I've been receiving old
holiday newsletters from Eggleston for -- few months or so.
</P>
<P>
   But until Saturday, when I messaged him back by e-mail to ask
him about these holiday newsletters, I didn't know who Eggleston
is.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't e-mail great? Have you noticed how much of it makes you
wonder, ``Why the heck are they sending me this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The year started off with lots of family and company
combined,'' begins a 1956 Yule newsletter Eggleston shipped me.
``Our cousin Frank Caldwell and his Hawaiian wife Emily sent us a
Christmas card from nearby and ended up living with us for several
months. The high spot of the visit was when Frank drove down to
Florida to bring back Emily's daughter Ilima and her three small
fry. While Ilima danced hulas with the Ringling circus tour,
Mahailani, Kaikili, and Keavi, ranging from 3 1/2 down to 1 1/2,
kept us busy and amused.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, except for Ringling, I have no idea who any of these
people are.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, these holiday greetings are the work of the
late Lester Allen Eggleston of San Antonio, a fire protection
engineer for Esso who sent out an annual Christmas newsletter to
300 to 400 people from 1955 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   And now they are being recirculated via e-mail to 37 people by
his son, Dan Eggleston, 53, a math teacher at Lamar Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   And I am on the list. Some people are just born lucky.
</P>
<P>
   I should mention that each newsletter is thousands of words
long. Every French horn lesson, bout of tonsillitis and new
household appliance is chronicled.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Dan sending these things out? ``Ah, I feel they're
interesting and they sort of comment on our culture back in the
'50s and '60s,'' Dan said. ``So people our age, it would bring back
memories of what it was like back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, like real boring.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the Egglestons are a wonderful family. And it's
thoughtful of Dan to share his family's history with me through his
dad's Christmas letters. Otherwise I wouldn't have known that in
1963 ``Pixie the Pup is as black as ever'' and ``trails after Polly
all day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that e-mail makes me wonder if the information age has
been misnamed. Maybe it should have been named the unsolicited note
age.
</P>
<P>
   I've even come up with a system that lets me identify trash
e-mail without even reading it. If the header listing the names of
the recipients is as long as the text, it's out of there. And any
``opportunity of a lifetime'' e-mail with $ signs sprinkled
throughout the text gets the ax immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``In August the deep freeze quit,'' the '56 Christmas newsletter
reveals. ``Getting a new one in the cellar was an undertaking!''
And if Uncle Ernie had gotten a hernia during the process, I'm sure
we would have heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   So how are these family newsletters received by the people who
get them? ``Some people just read them and don't say anything,''
Dan admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.

 &HT;    Imploring saints has ring to it
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Call the insurance company, my husband would say
from time to time, after my wedding band walked away from the
nightstand one night.
</P>
<P>
   Jim thinks that a missing object should be declared forever lost
within, say, five seconds of its disappearance. I take a much more
hopeful view, preferring to wait at least five years. My jewelry
box is full of mismatched earrings, the sock drawer stuffed with
unmatched socks.
</P>
<P>
   This is not because I am the perennial optimist of the pair.
Quite the contrary. He's the one who had a happy-go-lucky, normal
childhood; I'm the one who developed the premature frown mark from
worrying about nuclear disarmament and world hunger.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that I grew up with St. Anthony, and Jim did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Jim is a Methodist. His church is glorious this time of year,
bedecked with greens, resplendent with ribbons and Christmas trees.
But it's also a bit lonely, with nary an icon or a saint to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   How do they manage? They can't invoke St. Anne when they need to
find a mate: ``St. Anne, St. Anne, send me a man.'' They can't bury
a St. Joseph statue when they need to sell their house. They can't
soothe toothaches by imploring St. Apollonia, or ease business
tension by calling on St. Raphael, patron saint of happy meetings.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the most useful saint of all: the 13th-century
St. Anthony of Padua, the patron saint of lost articles.
</P>
<P>
   No, we weren't one of those vulgar Catholic households in which
you chanted, ``Tony, Tony, look around, something's lost and can't
be found.'' But when something stubbornly refused to turn up, Mom
would start singing to St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Is it pure superstition, mere quaint Catholic custom? Not so,
says Father Jerry Chinchar, a campus minister at the University of
Dayton. ``St. Anthony is my buddy; he helps me out a lot,''
Chinchar says. ``I like the image that the saints are our friends _
our friends who have already made it, and are face to face with
God. It's not as if we can't go to God, but sometimes it's easier
to go to a friend who might have an in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the great Christian tradition that we're not alone in
our journey of faith, that we're in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike our parents, Catholics of my generation are a bit
sheepish about the whole business. We call on St. Anthony only when
all other hope is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call the insurance company,'' Jim said after the wedding band
had been missing for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want another ring,'' I whined. ``I want this one.
It has sentimental value.''
</P>
<P>
   I lost the ring in the house, so it had to be here somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   We did a top-to-bottom house cleaning, peering under every rug,
every love seat, every bureau. We vacuumed and sifted through the
vacuum bag. No ring.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I told myself, time for the heavy artillery: St. Anthony. I
said a silent prayer, even sang Mom's old song when Jim wasn't in
earshot.
</P>
<P>
   That night, before I flopped into bed, I fished once again in my
ring-holder, as I had 1,000 times before. I turned over my
lightning-bolt TCB pin. Underneath it, perma-bonded with something
green _ lollipop residue _ lay my wedding band.
</P>
<P>
   It had been in my ring-holder all along, stuck underneath my
lightning-bolt pin. TCB, for Taking Care of Business.
</P>
<P>
   As in Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, as in St. Anthony.

 &HT;    Hospital bureaucracy hinders doctors, kills patients
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ You have less to fear sharing the road with a
no-brakes, double-clutching 18-wheeler driven by sleep-deprived
trucker with white-line fever than you have checking yourself into
a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. hospitals alone, medical mistakes kill between 44,000
and 98,000 Americans. The nation's annual highway death toll is
about 43,450.
</P>
<P>
   This little bombshell was dropped on the American public Monday
in a new report by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Equity in outrage needs to be directed toward deaths due to
medical errors compared to deaths due to highway accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Mothers Against Drunk Driving is a respected
nationwide organization that works diligently to impose stricter
penalties against motorists who drive while impaired by alcohol.
MADD members deserve credit for changing pubic attitudes as well as
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to MADD, Mothers Against Medical Mistakes, or some
similar name, would be a far larger organization if size
corresponds to risk.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 98,000 Americans are killed each year due to medical
errors in hospitals alone. That number (more than double annual
highway fatalities) does not count all the other Americans who die
due to medical errors committed outside U.S. hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   American patients killed each year due to medical errors likely
is double the number of Americans killed in the nine-year Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   Health care in the United States, according to the report, ``is
a decade or more behind other high-risk industries in its attention
to ensuring basic safety'' to avoid such deadly errors as making
wrong diagnoses, removing wrong organs or prescribing wrong drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a remark that hovered between sarcasm and despair, the
chairman of the panel that conducted the study, William Richardson,
said, ``These stunningly high rates of medical errors _ resulting
in deaths, permanent disability and unnecessary suffering _ are
simply unacceptable in a medical system that promises first to `do
no harm.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician recognized as
the father of medicine, who said, ``As to diseases, make a habit of
two things _ to help, or at least, to do no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor friend of mine, now passed on, once told me that
doctors would have nothing to fear from malpractice lawsuits if
they treated their patients as friends and practiced the medicine
they learned in medical school.
</P>
<P>
   He told the same thing to his colleagues at a county medical
society meeting during a discussion of malpractice lawsuits and
medical liability insurance. As a result, he lost all patient
referrals from fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Hippocrates also lamented that the most distinguished art of
medicine ``through the ignorance of those who practice it, and of
those who casually judge such practitioners, it is now of all the
arts by far the least esteemed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now, more than two millennia later, we are back where we
started. Bad medical practices are giving health-care providers a
bad name.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that doctors caused many of their own problems.
Patients who have been talked down to by arrogant doctors do not
hesitate to sue just to get even, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors nowadays are more like my old doctor friend, friendly
and respectful. Now, however, they are surrounded by infuriating
layers of arrogant bureaucracy in HMOs, clinics, and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Patient safety is jeopardized now less by the recklessness of
individual doctors or nurses than by the way clinics, hospitals and
pharmacies operate, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Many more Americans are killed in hospitals than in highway
accidents. Try to ignore that fact.

 &HT;    Georgia seeking to cultivate new field
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Georgia, biotech _ pardon the pun _ is growing.
</P>
<P>
   You could tell by the number of hands reaching out to greet
Russell ``Rusty'' French as he maneuvered slowly toward a table at
the Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 investors, professionals and company executives
had gathered at the tony hotel last month for the first-ever
investor forum for biotechnology in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   French, a partner with the venture capital firm of Noro-Mosely,
was stopped every few feet to grasp another hand _ an entrepreneur
searching for an injection of capital or maybe a rival investor
like French hoping to strike biotech paydirt.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of companies wanted to be there, and organizers pared the
field down to 21 hopefuls, including a handful from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have done this conference five years ago,'' French
said. ``We wouldn't have had the critical mass. And five years from
now, it's just going to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   But that combustion depends on a kind of chain-reaction in the
region, he said. ``We need more successes to drive investment in
this region. This generates investment and investment enables
success.''
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, the process of building a biotech industry is
picking up speed. The question is, can the acceleration continue?
</P>
<P>
   Three factors are crucial: research, talent and money. That
brew, often seasoned with state funds, produced the spectacular
growth of all manner of technology in Silicon Valley. The same mix
is at work in pretty much every area where biotech is prospering,
including Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard biotech play is the same as any technology,''
said Dan Giannini, analyst with PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``The right
resources, the right research, the right people willing to invest.
Atlanta is a little behind the technology curve, but it is coming
into its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The climate is right: the economy of the region _ especially
Atlanta _ has been growing with an allure that persuades
professionals by the thousands to head south looking for better
weather and cheaper housing. Meanwhile, research ideas spill from
schools into the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But to be commercialized, those notions need money _ patient
money.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Internet dominates headlines, biotech
entrepreneurs and scientists are building a sector with growth that
is far slower, but with possibilities potentially even more
radical. The Internet seems poised to accelerate communication, to
reshape the economy and to transform how humans gather and use
information. Biotech, by contrast, may transform who we are.
</P>
<P>
   The sector for a while during the 1980s was the darling of Wall
Street, then slumped. Companies that needed federal approval for
for food products often took nearly a decade to move from lab to
market.
</P>
<P>
   The sector still has grand promise, but _ unlike the Net _ its
potential payback is measured in years, not weeks, days or hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Georgia began investing in infrastructure
and recruiting the experts needed to build a biotech industry.
Laboratories were funded and positions of ``eminent scholar''
established by the Georgia Research Alliance, a coalition of
government, university and industry.
</P>
<P>
   About half the GRA's investments are now in life sciences,
according to GRA President William J. Todd. ``There is great
opportunity, and we are at the very early stages of seeing a
return. All the indications are very positive. We think that it's
beginning to pay dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   With success of companies like Artherogenics, and Inhibitex,
Georgia will not be left out of the next wave of technology, Todd
said. ``We do believe that the next 20 years will be defined as the
age of biology, just the last 20 years have been the age of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Georgia remains a bit player in biotech.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Silicon Valley and Boston, biotech has already
gone through several cycles of hype and disappointment, producing
hundreds of hopefuls and even _ in Amgen and Genentech _ a few
multibillion dollar companies. The nation has 1,283 biotech
companies, according to the Biotechnology Industry Association. The
deepest well of biotech is California, with several hundred
companies, followed by Massachusetts, New Jersey and the
Baltimore-Washington corridor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, an informal survey produced the names of about 40
mostly small companies in Georgia with a biotech or biomedical
slant. Some, like Proxima Therapeutics are makers of devices. Some,
like Solvay Pharmaceuticals, are units of larger companies based
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Athens-based ProLinia, work at the very core of
biotech _ cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively modest collection of companies, money is
flowing to biotech in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has some of the key factors for biotech success _
chiefly an energetic system of universities that spin off biotech
companies and the research and talent needed to fuel them.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia has programs in agriculture and
veterinary medicine that are among the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech recently christened the Parker Petit Institute for
Bioengineering and Bioscience.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University has a nationally respected medical school and
solid science programs and plans a high-profile biotech center.
</P>
<P>
   Cadres of researchers toil at Georgia State and Clark Atlanta
University, whose graduates include many scientists and
technicians. The city also boasts one of the world's elite research
engines, the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the biotech sector proves the interplay of commerce
and research.
</P>
<P>
   Among Georgia companies based on biomedical and biotechnology
developed at UGA are Abel Scientific, Aureozyme, AviGenics, EPD
International, Pharmamax Biomedical, Pharmasset, ProLinia,
Recombinant Peptide Technologies, Spay Safe, United AgriCorp., and
Zymex Scientific.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Georgia-based, biotech companies spun out by Emory are
AtheroGenics, CytRx, Neotonus, Novoste and Pharmasset.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong life sciences programs in the universities,
there is no surplus of talented, experienced managers. For them,
Atlanta's positives as a place to live are balanced with a career
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to convince somebody to leave an area where, if their
job goes away, they know they will find another job quickly,'' said
William Johnston, president and chief executive of Inhibitex Inc.
``The downside of biotech in Atlanta is that I have to say (to a
potential executive) that I will give you a quality of life step up
that is worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To trump that concern, companies can use enticements like stock
in the future as well as the lure of the area itself. Ultimately,
it is a career and a life decision _ and all sorts of choices are
possible, said AviGenics President and Chief Executive Officer Carl
Marhaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are interested in taking on that risk, and some
people are not,'' shrugged Marhaver, who commutes to his Athens
office from Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   From research comes ideas, but without funding _ and the right
expertise _ those notions can stall.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ChemFree, which produces freeze-dried grease-eating
microbes that clean engines. When the company went looking for
money, it took a year of searching to find in Norcross-based
Intelligent Systems an investor to purchase a majority stake, said
Vice President Tom McNally. ``We approached a lot of conventional
sources. For most of the venture capitalists, it was too far out
five years ago. The idea of using bugs to eat grease was pretty
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   But one year's bizarre idea could be the next year's
conventional wisdom. That interchange between entrepreneur and
investor is the way the deal is done, no matter the technology or
geography, said Lothar Krinke, principal in the health industries
practice of consultant A.T. Kearney. ``The engine has always been
and will continue to be good ideas and good people. But cash right
now is tight. All the venture capital money is going to e-business,
not biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance Technology Ventures was created in the early 1990s to
pump capital to promising companies, especially in metro Atlanta.
The fund last year gave $76 million to 11 companies. Among the
fund's $100 million in investments are several in biotech,
including EnSurg, Inhibitex and AtheroGenics.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henos, a general partner in ATV, says the Southeast has
made progress, although remaining far behind the venture centers of
Boston and Silicon Valley. ``Atlanta and the Southeast _ the region
is a strong No. 3 or No. 4.''
</P>
<P>
   At least some money now is looking for biotechnology, coming
from within the South _ and outside.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Atlanta-based Noro-Moseley, investors at last
month's conference included Alpharetta-based Cordova Ventures,
Intersouth Partners of Durham and California-based Silicon Valley
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's more established players can serve as a source of
scientists and support for newcomers to the sector.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those in the emerging sector still fear for its
future.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston praised the state's focus on getting companies afloat
but warned that many may founder when released from the protection
of the university incubator. ``Atlanta is not a fertile environment
right now to take a company from the incubator to the next step.
That's a gap, and the big issue is capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a large cluster of companies handicaps development,
he said. ``It's very hard to find lab space or get somebody to
build a lab building for you. In Boston, a developer knows that if
the (biotech) company goes out of business or moves, somebody else
will take the space. Until we get a critical mass here, it is going
to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Atlanta doesn't boast spectacular numbers of research
institutions, endless oceans of venture capital or hundreds of
already flourishing biotech companies, the area does have all three
components in more modest supply _ and that is often enough.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Proxima Therapeutics, based in Alpharetta mostly by
happenstance and yet apparently happy to stay and grow. Proxima
makes devices _ catheters _ that can deliver concentrated radiation
to a limited area after surgery for brain or breast cancer. The
technology is now in clinical testing at five locations, including
Emory, but it was developed by a doctor at Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Patrick, Proxima president and CEO, said he was hired
when it was still a ``virtual'' company. He happened to be in
Atlanta. So he built the company here. When he looked for someone
to test the brain tumor procedure, he found Dr. Jeff Olson at
Emory. When it was time to test the breast cancer procedure, the
work was done at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   About half the top executives were recruited from elsewhere,
Patrick said. ``We have had excellent luck attracting people to
Atlanta. We have 16 employees and virtually no turnover. The few
issues that we have in Atlanta are outweighed by positives.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Proxima is has found the money it needed. A 1997
financing brought $4 million. A second round last year raked in
$11.8 million, Patrick said. ``We have raised more than $16
million. None of it from Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   M. Christine Jacobs, the chairman, president and CEO of
Buford-based Theragenics, argues that the region will not become a
biomed or biotech hotbed until the sector becomes a priority.
Schools and government could do more, she said. ``No university has
ever met with us and said, 'what kind of student could we help you
with?' Instead, they just crank them out and let us decide if they
fit our mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Theragenics, which makes tiny radioactive ``seeds'' that are
implanted in prostate cancers to deliver radiation locally, is an
oldster by biotech standards, founded in 1981 and taken public in
1987. But its experience buttresses the notion that the South is
not yet fully funding its entrepreneurs. ``The reality is that when
we really needed money and support we had to go somewhere else,''
Jacobs said. ``To a new company, I would say, fight to keep
yourself in the South, but be ready to travel to get your money.''
</P>
<P>
   For those accustomed to the blitz of Internet hype or the
multibillion deals of the huge telecommunications companies,
biotech may seem like a slow-moving curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their languid development, biotech companies look to
provide valuable tools to some large, lucrative markets. While
their time horizon may be long, many of their targets translate
into billions of dollars in treatments and diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Proxima Therapeutics hopes to be in the market in
a year, and that market is potentially lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1.2 million new cases of cancer diagnosed in the
United States each year. About 800,000 of them are ``solid'' tumors
that might be candidates for removal and follow-up radiation _ and
the more effective the radiation, the better the chance for a cure
without side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   Once Proxima succeeds, the company would likely stay, Patrick
said. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Inertia,'' he said. ``We've got relationships with lawyers and
advisers. We've got a solid team, and people like it here. I can't
imagine telling people that in six months we are moving to Silicon
Valley. You've been living in a new house and now you'll only be
able to afford an apartment. Or to Boston. People would picture a
much smaller house. With snow on the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   AtheroGenics is developing new drugs to treat cancer and
atherosclerosis. Russell Medford, CEO, president and co-founder of
the 48-employee firm, says the economics are potentially huge.
</P>
<P>
   While optimistic, Medford said the company is still shy of
making a profit on its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schering-Plough has bet that it will work on humans,
signing a contract with ArtheroGenics worth an estimated $189
million. Schering-Plough, an $8.1 billion-a-year company, obtains
the right to develop, manufacture and market the AtheroGenics drug.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of arrangement _ or even an outright acquisition _ is
a common goal for start-up biotech companies, since they cannot
hope to develop the muscular worldwide distribution system of a
giant pharmaceutical company. But first, a company must mount
convincing evidence that its technology works _ and that takes
money.
</P>
<P>
   AtheroGenics is currently flush, having announced $15.9 million
injection of cash earlier this year by Cordova Ventures and other
investors.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, grease-eating microbe producer ChemFree, the
17-person company founded in 1993, sees a huge, largely untapped
market and an immediate opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Stice was lured from a Massachusetts company by the
GRA's offer of an eminent scholar position at the University of
Georgia. Stice founded ProLinia, a company devoted to development
of technology for cloning animals, enabling farmers to multiply the
best animals in their herds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the lab cloning right now,'' Stice said. ``We expect
about 50 to 100 animals next year. We'll be selling product next
year. We'll be selling calves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Southeast starting so far behind the nation's
biotech centers, is there reason to hope that the region can
compete?
</P>
<P>
   Proxima Therapeutics' CEO Patrick says the region and the
biomedical sector need each other. ``I think it's important for
Atlanta to have some very successful biomed companies. I would like
to think it could be us.''

 &HT;    Firm covers chicken and the egg
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It used to be that when you mentioned incubators and
chickens, you were likely to mean the heaters that kept baby chicks
warm so they could grow up to lay the eggs that made more chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might be referring to the offices and labs of a company
that is genetically engineering the chickens and that's growing up
in an incubator that nurtures new companies.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics Inc. occupies part of an incubator for small biotech
companies at the University of Georgia. The company is working on
technologies aimed at producing both better chickens and more
nutritious and healthy eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Like the baby chicks in a traditional poultry farm, AviGenics
represents a kind of hope. The company is far too young and small
to produce revenue _ let alone profit. But the Georgia Research
Alliance, a coalition of state, industry and academia, is nurturing
AviGenics in partnership with the University of Georgia. The hope
is that AviGenics and similar companies will within a few years
produce products that will improve the work done by Georgia
agriculture, while benefiting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it is hoped they will be growing, healthy,
profitable companies whose success will ripple through the
community.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics was born in the research lab of UGA scientist Robert
Ivarie.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company also plans to clone superior chickens for
food, AviGenics believes its technology can be used to produce
generic pharmaceuticals when the patents expire on many of the
lucrative drugs now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth reflects the range of needs in Georgia
biotech.
</P>
<P>
   First: talent.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics has been advertising four job openings with vastly
different criteria. A vice president of strategic planning must
have more than five years' experience in a ``medium or large life
sciences company.''
</P>
<P>
   A research associate for cell biology needs a bachelor's of
science or master's degree as well as several years experience in
``tissue culture.''
</P>
<P>
   A technician needs a bachelor's degree in one of the right
sciences _ experience with DNA cloning preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, AviGenics is seeking a poultry caretaker, someone with
experience caring for and breeding chickens.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 18-employee company has hired locally but has also
recruited talent from as far away as Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   President and Chief Executive Carl Marhaver praised the
University of Georgia for producing high-caliber graduates, but
acknowledged that the area is not flush with experienced biotech
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athens (Georgia) is not the perfect spot, but we are not going
to let that be an obstacle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Second: money.
</P>
<P>
   The company raised $4 million last year in venture funding and
is now looking for a $10 million injection. Marhaver said he often
hears talk of investors ignoring biotech in order to jump on the
latest ``dot.com'' with an Internet scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think they don't care anymore about a diversified
portfolio? There is still venture capital for good returns on an
investment in biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many struggling start-ups, AviGenics would also be pleased
to have a large pharmaceutical company buy a majority stake,
Marhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Third: research.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics works in labs built as part of an effort by the
Georgia Research Alliance and the University of Georgia to lure and
nurture biotech. Among the other tenants is ProLinia Inc., a
company that is focused on cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Marhaver said the efforts at nudging along biotech have made a
difference for AviGenics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GRA and UGA have made it easy for us to stay and to be
successful,'' Marhaver said. ``Without them, a lot of us wouldn't
get as far as we do.''

 &HT;    Surfing the Net to save you time
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bonnie Bertram can thank a novel for her job.
</P>
<P>
   On a six-hour flight from Silicon Valley to Atlanta, Bertram was
locked in a debate about the book with a guy sitting next to her.
She liked it. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought the entire plane ride, across the country,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Still arguing at the time they reached baggage claim at
Hartsfield International Airport, the guy _ Jim Lanzone, co-founder
of Atlanta-based eTour.com _ liked Bertram so much he offered her a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone pictured Bertram as the new editor in chief for eTour, a
Web-surfing guide that combs the Internet for what it deems the
best, quirkiest and most creative Web sites. As Queen Surfer,
Bertram would lead a group of young and scrappy professional Web
surfers who sift the Internet in search of ``cool'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   It was a job that paid $60,000 to $90,000 annually, plus stock
options. It was a great offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram wasn't interested _ at first.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a decade of journalism experience, Bertram was
covering the Internet when she met Lanzone. A 1986 graduate of the
University of California at Berkeley with dual degrees in English
and humanities, she had steadily worked her way up the ladder. Her
first job was as an editorial assistant (read: glorified secretary)
for Seventeen magazine, after which she went on to land jobs that
included an assistant editor spot at Premier magazine and a
producer's post at ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Fortune,'' the television
program that sent her on assignment to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With this career path behind her, eTour was a detour that
Bertram didn't care to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I initially said no because I had always thought that
interactive jobs were for people who couldn't cut it in the
traditional media,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bertram was intrigued with the Web. ``It was
such a fascinating world, and I felt like I was an outsider,'' she
recalls. ``I wanted to be a part of the news, not just covering it.
I thought if I could be on the ground floor, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Bertram officially took the Surfer Queen throne in September,
after unofficially trying the job for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, the move from producer to surfer wasn't the step down
she had once figured. ``I was totally wrong,'' Bertram says. ``The
Internet is the story now. We just skip the step of writing the
story and bring (Web sites) directly to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The surfers for eTour claim to harvest the best of the best for
their more than half-million members. Unlike some services that use
computer programs or Artificial Intelligence to track high-traffic
Web pages, Bertram says her staff does the work of judging what's
worthy to be included on the eTour database.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just taking you to where the traffic is, we're
taking you to good sites,'' contends Bertram, who spends much of
her time supervising site selection.
</P>
<P>
   ETour scans ``best sites'' lists such as those published by
Artigen, New York magazine, The New Yorker and Mademoiselle
magazine, in addition to wading through the nooks and crannies of
the Net in search of sites. The surfers look for sites that aren't
too commercial, don't take too long to download and that are
creative, fun _ and clean, says Bertram.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful,'' she laughs. ``The sites that seem
totally innocent, you have to click through like four times because
you never know what's in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ETour arranges its best recommendations in broad categories that
span areas such as arts and entertainment, news, shopping and
sports. The firm plans to add African-American, Hispanic and other
special interests by mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to this free service customize their interest lists
by choosing to receive sites within more than 100 categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll say to you, `You like gardening? Cooking? We'll give you
the best gardening, cooking sites out there,' '' says Bertram.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram and crew tackle current events in much the same way. In
their new Watercooler feature, they pull together a hodgepodge of
related sites.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example: Following a federal judge's finding of fact
declaring Microsoft a monopoly, eTour produced hyperlinks that
ranged from excerpts from speeches delivered by Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates to the wacky ``Mr. T Takes on Bill Gates'' Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every real story has an online component,'' says Bertram.

 &HT;    Georgia seeking to cultivate new field
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Georgia, biotech _ pardon the pun _ is growing.
</P>
<P>
   You could tell by the number of hands reaching out to greet
Russell ``Rusty'' French as he maneuvered slowly toward a table at
the Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 investors, professionals and company executives
had gathered at the tony hotel last month for the first-ever
investor forum for biotechnology in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   French, a partner with the venture capital firm of Noro-Mosely,
was stopped every few feet to grasp another hand _ an entrepreneur
searching for an injection of capital or maybe a rival investor
like French hoping to strike biotech paydirt.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of companies wanted to be there, and organizers pared the
field down to 21 hopefuls, including a handful from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have done this conference five years ago,'' French
said. ``We wouldn't have had the critical mass. And five years from
now, it's just going to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   But that combustion depends on a kind of chain-reaction in the
region, he said. ``We need more successes to drive investment in
this region. This generates investment and investment enables
success.''
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, the process of building a biotech industry is
picking up speed. The question is, can the acceleration continue?
</P>
<P>
   Three factors are crucial: research, talent and money. That
brew, often seasoned with state funds, produced the spectacular
growth of all manner of technology in Silicon Valley. The same mix
is at work in pretty much every area where biotech is prospering,
including Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard biotech play is the same as any technology,''
said Dan Giannini, analyst with PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``The right
resources, the right research, the right people willing to invest.
Atlanta is a little behind the technology curve, but it is coming
into its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The climate is right: the economy of the region _ especially
Atlanta _ has been growing with an allure that persuades
professionals by the thousands to head south looking for better
weather and cheaper housing. Meanwhile, research ideas spill from
schools into the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But to be commercialized, those notions need money _ patient
money.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Internet dominates headlines, biotech
entrepreneurs and scientists are building a sector with growth that
is far slower, but with possibilities potentially even more
radical. The Internet seems poised to accelerate communication, to
reshape the economy and to transform how humans gather and use
information. Biotech, by contrast, may transform who we are.
</P>
<P>
   The sector for a while during the 1980s was the darling of Wall
Street, then slumped. Companies that needed federal approval for
for food products often took nearly a decade to move from lab to
market.
</P>
<P>
   The sector still has grand promise, but _ unlike the Net _ its
potential payback is measured in years, not weeks, days or hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Georgia began investing in infrastructure
and recruiting the experts needed to build a biotech industry.
Laboratories were funded and positions of ``eminent scholar''
established by the Georgia Research Alliance, a coalition of
government, university and industry.
</P>
<P>
   About half the GRA's investments are now in life sciences,
according to GRA President William J. Todd. ``There is great
opportunity, and we are at the very early stages of seeing a
return. All the indications are very positive. We think that it's
beginning to pay dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   With success of companies like Artherogenics, and Inhibitex,
Georgia will not be left out of the next wave of technology, Todd
said. ``We do believe that the next 20 years will be defined as the
age of biology, just the last 20 years have been the age of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Georgia remains a bit player in biotech.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Silicon Valley and Boston, biotech has already
gone through several cycles of hype and disappointment, producing
hundreds of hopefuls and even _ in Amgen and Genentech _ a few
multibillion dollar companies. The nation has 1,283 biotech
companies, according to the Biotechnology Industry Association. The
deepest well of biotech is California, with several hundred
companies, followed by Massachusetts, New Jersey and the
Baltimore-Washington corridor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, an informal survey produced the names of about 40
mostly small companies in Georgia with a biotech or biomedical
slant. Some, like Proxima Therapeutics are makers of devices. Some,
like Solvay Pharmaceuticals, are units of larger companies based
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Athens-based ProLinia, work at the very core of
biotech _ cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively modest collection of companies, money is
flowing to biotech in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has some of the key factors for biotech success _
chiefly an energetic system of universities that spin off biotech
companies and the research and talent needed to fuel them.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia has programs in agriculture and
veterinary medicine that are among the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech recently christened the Parker Petit Institute for
Bioengineering and Bioscience.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University has a nationally respected medical school and
solid science programs and plans a high-profile biotech center.
</P>
<P>
   Cadres of researchers toil at Georgia State and Clark Atlanta
University, whose graduates include many scientists and
technicians. The city also boasts one of the world's elite research
engines, the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the biotech sector proves the interplay of commerce
and research.
</P>
<P>
   Among Georgia companies based on biomedical and biotechnology
developed at UGA are Abel Scientific, Aureozyme, AviGenics, EPD
International, Pharmamax Biomedical, Pharmasset, ProLinia,
Recombinant Peptide Technologies, Spay Safe, United AgriCorp., and
Zymex Scientific.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Georgia-based, biotech companies spun out by Emory are
AtheroGenics, CytRx, Neotonus, Novoste and Pharmasset.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong life sciences programs in the universities,
there is no surplus of talented, experienced managers. For them,
Atlanta's positives as a place to live are balanced with a career
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to convince somebody to leave an area where, if their
job goes away, they know they will find another job quickly,'' said
William Johnston, president and chief executive of Inhibitex Inc.
``The downside of biotech in Atlanta is that I have to say (to a
potential executive) that I will give you a quality of life step up
that is worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To trump that concern, companies can use enticements like stock
in the future as well as the lure of the area itself. Ultimately,
it is a career and a life decision _ and all sorts of choices are
possible, said AviGenics President and Chief Executive Officer Carl
Marhaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are interested in taking on that risk, and some
people are not,'' shrugged Marhaver, who commutes to his Athens
office from Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   From research comes ideas, but without funding _ and the right
expertise _ those notions can stall.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ChemFree, which produces freeze-dried grease-eating
microbes that clean engines. When the company went looking for
money, it took a year of searching to find in Norcross-based
Intelligent Systems an investor to purchase a majority stake, said
Vice President Tom McNally. ``We approached a lot of conventional
sources. For most of the venture capitalists, it was too far out
five years ago. The idea of using bugs to eat grease was pretty
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   But one year's bizarre idea could be the next year's
conventional wisdom. That interchange between entrepreneur and
investor is the way the deal is done, no matter the technology or
geography, said Lothar Krinke, principal in the health industries
practice of consultant A.T. Kearney. ``The engine has always been
and will continue to be good ideas and good people. But cash right
now is tight. All the venture capital money is going to e-business,
not biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance Technology Ventures was created in the early 1990s to
pump capital to promising companies, especially in metro Atlanta.
The fund last year gave $76 million to 11 companies. Among the
fund's $100 million in investments are several in biotech,
including EnSurg, Inhibitex and AtheroGenics.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henos, a general partner in ATV, says the Southeast has
made progress, although remaining far behind the venture centers of
Boston and Silicon Valley. ``Atlanta and the Southeast _ the region
is a strong No. 3 or No. 4.''
</P>
<P>
   At least some money now is looking for biotechnology, coming
from within the South _ and outside.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Atlanta-based Noro-Moseley, investors at last
month's conference included Alpharetta-based Cordova Ventures,
Intersouth Partners of Durham and California-based Silicon Valley
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's more established players can serve as a source of
scientists and support for newcomers to the sector.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those in the emerging sector still fear for its
future.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston praised the state's focus on getting companies afloat
but warned that many may founder when released from the protection
of the university incubator. ``Atlanta is not a fertile environment
right now to take a company from the incubator to the next step.
That's a gap, and the big issue is capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a large cluster of companies handicaps development,
he said. ``It's very hard to find lab space or get somebody to
build a lab building for you. In Boston, a developer knows that if
the (biotech) company goes out of business or moves, somebody else
will take the space. Until we get a critical mass here, it is going
to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Atlanta doesn't boast spectacular numbers of research
institutions, endless oceans of venture capital or hundreds of
already flourishing biotech companies, the area does have all three
components in more modest supply _ and that is often enough.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Proxima Therapeutics, based in Alpharetta mostly by
happenstance and yet apparently happy to stay and grow. Proxima
makes devices _ catheters _ that can deliver concentrated radiation
to a limited area after surgery for brain or breast cancer. The
technology is now in clinical testing at five locations, including
Emory, but it was developed by a doctor at Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Patrick, Proxima president and CEO, said he was hired
when it was still a ``virtual'' company. He happened to be in
Atlanta. So he built the company here. When he looked for someone
to test the brain tumor procedure, he found Dr. Jeff Olson at
Emory. When it was time to test the breast cancer procedure, the
work was done at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   About half the top executives were recruited from elsewhere,
Patrick said. ``We have had excellent luck attracting people to
Atlanta. We have 16 employees and virtually no turnover. The few
issues that we have in Atlanta are outweighed by positives.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Proxima is has found the money it needed. A 1997
financing brought $4 million. A second round last year raked in
$11.8 million, Patrick said. ``We have raised more than $16
million. None of it from Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   M. Christine Jacobs, the chairman, president and CEO of
Buford-based Theragenics, argues that the region will not become a
biomed or biotech hotbed until the sector becomes a priority.
Schools and government could do more, she said. ``No university has
ever met with us and said, 'what kind of student could we help you
with?' Instead, they just crank them out and let us decide if they
fit our mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Theragenics, which makes tiny radioactive ``seeds'' that are
implanted in prostate cancers to deliver radiation locally, is an
oldster by biotech standards, founded in 1981 and taken public in
1987. But its experience buttresses the notion that the South is
not yet fully funding its entrepreneurs. ``The reality is that when
we really needed money and support we had to go somewhere else,''
Jacobs said. ``To a new company, I would say, fight to keep
yourself in the South, but be ready to travel to get your money.''
</P>
<P>
   For those accustomed to the blitz of Internet hype or the
multibillion deals of the huge telecommunications companies,
biotech may seem like a slow-moving curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their languid development, biotech companies look to
provide valuable tools to some large, lucrative markets. While
their time horizon may be long, many of their targets translate
into billions of dollars in treatments and diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Proxima Therapeutics hopes to be in the market in
a year, and that market is potentially lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1.2 million new cases of cancer diagnosed in the
United States each year. About 800,000 of them are ``solid'' tumors
that might be candidates for removal and follow-up radiation _ and
the more effective the radiation, the better the chance for a cure
without side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   Once Proxima succeeds, the company would likely stay, Patrick
said. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Inertia,'' he said. ``We've got relationships with lawyers and
advisers. We've got a solid team, and people like it here. I can't
imagine telling people that in six months we are moving to Silicon
Valley. You've been living in a new house and now you'll only be
able to afford an apartment. Or to Boston. People would picture a
much smaller house. With snow on the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   AtheroGenics is developing new drugs to treat cancer and
atherosclerosis. Russell Medford, CEO, president and co-founder of
the 48-employee firm, says the economics are potentially huge.
</P>
<P>
   While optimistic, Medford said the company is still shy of
making a profit on its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schering-Plough has bet that it will work on humans,
signing a contract with ArtheroGenics worth an estimated $189
million. Schering-Plough, an $8.1 billion-a-year company, obtains
the right to develop, manufacture and market the AtheroGenics drug.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of arrangement _ or even an outright acquisition _ is
a common goal for start-up biotech companies, since they cannot
hope to develop the muscular worldwide distribution system of a
giant pharmaceutical company. But first, a company must mount
convincing evidence that its technology works _ and that takes
money.
</P>
<P>
   AtheroGenics is currently flush, having announced $15.9 million
injection of cash earlier this year by Cordova Ventures and other
investors.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, grease-eating microbe producer ChemFree, the
17-person company founded in 1993, sees a huge, largely untapped
market and an immediate opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Stice was lured from a Massachusetts company by the
GRA's offer of an eminent scholar position at the University of
Georgia. Stice founded ProLinia, a company devoted to development
of technology for cloning animals, enabling farmers to multiply the
best animals in their herds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the lab cloning right now,'' Stice said. ``We expect
about 50 to 100 animals next year. We'll be selling product next
year. We'll be selling calves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Southeast starting so far behind the nation's
biotech centers, is there reason to hope that the region can
compete?
</P>
<P>
   Proxima Therapeutics' CEO Patrick says the region and the
biomedical sector need each other. ``I think it's important for
Atlanta to have some very successful biomed companies. I would like
to think it could be us.''

 &HT;    Firm covers chicken and the egg
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It used to be that when you mentioned incubators and
chickens, you were likely to mean the heaters that kept baby chicks
warm so they could grow up to lay the eggs that made more chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might be referring to the offices and labs of a company
that is genetically engineering the chickens and that's growing up
in an incubator that nurtures new companies.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics Inc. occupies part of an incubator for small biotech
companies at the University of Georgia. The company is working on
technologies aimed at producing both better chickens and more
nutritious and healthy eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Like the baby chicks in a traditional poultry farm, AviGenics
represents a kind of hope. The company is far too young and small
to produce revenue _ let alone profit. But the Georgia Research
Alliance, a coalition of state, industry and academia, is nurturing
AviGenics in partnership with the University of Georgia. The hope
is that AviGenics and similar companies will within a few years
produce products that will improve the work done by Georgia
agriculture, while benefiting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it is hoped they will be growing, healthy,
profitable companies whose success will ripple through the
community.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics was born in the research lab of UGA scientist Robert
Ivarie.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company also plans to clone superior chickens for
food, AviGenics believes its technology can be used to produce
generic pharmaceuticals when the patents expire on many of the
lucrative drugs now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth reflects the range of needs in Georgia
biotech.
</P>
<P>
   First: talent.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics has been advertising four job openings with vastly
different criteria. A vice president of strategic planning must
have more than five years' experience in a ``medium or large life
sciences company.''
</P>
<P>
   A research associate for cell biology needs a bachelor's of
science or master's degree as well as several years experience in
``tissue culture.''
</P>
<P>
   A technician needs a bachelor's degree in one of the right
sciences _ experience with DNA cloning preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, AviGenics is seeking a poultry caretaker, someone with
experience caring for and breeding chickens.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 18-employee company has hired locally but has also
recruited talent from as far away as Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   President and Chief Executive Carl Marhaver praised the
University of Georgia for producing high-caliber graduates, but
acknowledged that the area is not flush with experienced biotech
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athens (Georgia) is not the perfect spot, but we are not going
to let that be an obstacle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Second: money.
</P>
<P>
   The company raised $4 million last year in venture funding and
is now looking for a $10 million injection. Marhaver said he often
hears talk of investors ignoring biotech in order to jump on the
latest ``dot.com'' with an Internet scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think they don't care anymore about a diversified
portfolio? There is still venture capital for good returns on an
investment in biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many struggling start-ups, AviGenics would also be pleased
to have a large pharmaceutical company buy a majority stake,
Marhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Third: research.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics works in labs built as part of an effort by the
Georgia Research Alliance and the University of Georgia to lure and
nurture biotech. Among the other tenants is ProLinia Inc., a
company that is focused on cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Marhaver said the efforts at nudging along biotech have made a
difference for AviGenics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GRA and UGA have made it easy for us to stay and to be
successful,'' Marhaver said. ``Without them, a lot of us wouldn't
get as far as we do.''

 &HT;    Surfing the Net to save you time
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bonnie Bertram can thank a novel for her job.
</P>
<P>
   On a six-hour flight from Silicon Valley to Atlanta, Bertram was
locked in a debate about the book with a guy sitting next to her.
She liked it. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought the entire plane ride, across the country,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Still arguing at the time they reached baggage claim at
Hartsfield International Airport, the guy _ Jim Lanzone, co-founder
of Atlanta-based eTour.com _ liked Bertram so much he offered her a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone pictured Bertram as the new editor in chief for eTour, a
Web-surfing guide that combs the Internet for what it deems the
best, quirkiest and most creative Web sites. As Queen Surfer,
Bertram would lead a group of young and scrappy professional Web
surfers who sift the Internet in search of ``cool'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   It was a job that paid $60,000 to $90,000 annually, plus stock
options. It was a great offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram wasn't interested _ at first.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a decade of journalism experience, Bertram was
covering the Internet when she met Lanzone. A 1986 graduate of the
University of California at Berkeley with dual degrees in English
and humanities, she had steadily worked her way up the ladder. Her
first job was as an editorial assistant (read: glorified secretary)
for Seventeen magazine, after which she went on to land jobs that
included an assistant editor spot at Premier magazine and a
producer's post at ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Fortune,'' the television
program that sent her on assignment to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With this career path behind her, eTour was a detour that
Bertram didn't care to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I initially said no because I had always thought that
interactive jobs were for people who couldn't cut it in the
traditional media,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bertram was intrigued with the Web. ``It was
such a fascinating world, and I felt like I was an outsider,'' she
recalls. ``I wanted to be a part of the news, not just covering it.
I thought if I could be on the ground floor, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Bertram officially took the Surfer Queen throne in September,
after unofficially trying the job for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, the move from producer to surfer wasn't the step down
she had once figured. ``I was totally wrong,'' Bertram says. ``The
Internet is the story now. We just skip the step of writing the
story and bring (Web sites) directly to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The surfers for eTour claim to harvest the best of the best for
their more than half-million members. Unlike some services that use
computer programs or Artificial Intelligence to track high-traffic
Web pages, Bertram says her staff does the work of judging what's
worthy to be included on the eTour database.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just taking you to where the traffic is, we're
taking you to good sites,'' contends Bertram, who spends much of
her time supervising site selection.
</P>
<P>
   ETour scans ``best sites'' lists such as those published by
Artigen, New York magazine, The New Yorker and Mademoiselle
magazine, in addition to wading through the nooks and crannies of
the Net in search of sites. The surfers look for sites that aren't
too commercial, don't take too long to download and that are
creative, fun _ and clean, says Bertram.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful,'' she laughs. ``The sites that seem
totally innocent, you have to click through like four times because
you never know what's in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ETour arranges its best recommendations in broad categories that
span areas such as arts and entertainment, news, shopping and
sports. The firm plans to add African-American, Hispanic and other
special interests by mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to this free service customize their interest lists
by choosing to receive sites within more than 100 categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll say to you, `You like gardening? Cooking? We'll give you
the best gardening, cooking sites out there,' '' says Bertram.
</P>
<P>
   Bertram and crew tackle current events in much the same way. In
their new Watercooler feature, they pull together a hodgepodge of
related sites.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example: Following a federal judge's finding of fact
declaring Microsoft a monopoly, eTour produced hyperlinks that
ranged from excerpts from speeches delivered by Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates to the wacky ``Mr. T Takes on Bill Gates'' Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every real story has an online component,'' says Bertram.

 &HT;    So, you don't believe in Florida reindeer? Read onBy Tim
O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ So there's no miniature sleigh with
eight tiny reindeer. And no little old driver, so lively and quick.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, this is South Florida. You get two reindeer, not so tiny,
and be happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Zoo at Dreher Park is doing you and your kids a
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Your tropical-born offspring have never seen genuine
antler-growing, lichen-eating, sleigh-pulling reindeer?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Chelsea and her 8-month-old calf, Mistletoe. (Dasher,
Dancer, et al. were otherwise engaged). On the weekend, have your
picture taken with Chelsea. $6. BYOS (Bring Your Own Santa).
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer only come through here once a year, usually at
night,'' explained zoo curator Dave Wood scientifically.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo has created a mock-up of the Teller Station, 72 miles
north of Nome, Alaska, where reindeer research is done, to make the
reindeer (a.k.a. caribou) feel comfy in their sand corral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Rudolph?'' 4-year-old Heather Doolin of Stuart wanted
to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudolph is still at the North Pole. He's exercising for the
big trip,'' explained Assistant Education Curator Kristen
Christensen, who also knows what are reindeer games and whether
reindeer do, in fact, live at the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea and Mistletoe are from Snowmass, Colo. The Flying Deer
Ranch rents them out for the season _ $4,700 a pair through Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   But then the semi-permanent snow-white tent built to withstand
140 mph winds and the pair of air-conditioners keeping the reindeer
chilled at 54 degrees cost $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin and Peggy Brown, longtime zoo supporters, donated the tent
which will remain and be used for money-raising events, lectures
and education classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break even or keep our attendance up, then it will be a
success,'' Wood said. Volunteers are selling reindeer antler
headbands and other trinkets. Kids can touch genuine reindeer
antlers and examine food that reindeer eat.
</P>
<P>
   Adults can learn a little, too. Reindeer are raised for food by
the Inuit, the people once called Eskimos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like beef, but it's 22 percent protein and 3
percent fat,'' explained zoo volunteer Chris Fisher. Lean beef is
about 10 percent fat. ``It has the taste and consistency of beef.
The Inuit prefer it to chicken or beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Reindeer a la Rudolph. Goes best with a nice cabernet.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Montgomery Ward department store invented ``Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer'' in 1935?
</P>
<P>
   _ Reindeer antlers are like fingerprints, unique to each? And
that antlers fall off each year and grow back more elaborately?
</P>
<P>
   _ It wasn't until 1949 that cowboy singer Gene Autry recorded
the first version of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer?
</P>
<P>
   _ The wide hooves of reindeer act as snowshoes in the snow and
as paddles when they swim?
</P>
<P>
   _ Reindeer didn't become part of the American scene until
Clement Moore wrote A Visit from St. Nicholas in 1823?

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    TAKE ONE OF TWO
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, I read in two newspapers that Bob Barr
had been fined for fund-raising irregularities. Details of the
settlement differed in the two articles. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The settlement between Barr (R-Ga.) and the Federal Election
Commission was for just over $28,000. The complaints stemmed from
Barr's first election to Congress in 1994 and his subsequent 1996
re-election campaign. The FEC found that Barr had accepted some
$100,000 in contributions during the two elections that exceeded
the $1,000-a-person limit that individuals can give. The commission
also found that Barr had failed to report certain contributions
every 48 hours, failed to identify occupations of some of his
donors, and failed to itemize some of his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   FEC spokeswoman Sharon Snyder said the conciliation agreements
called for a $12,055 civil penalty in the 1994 campaign and a
$16,000 civil penalty in the 1996 campaign. Details can be found
online at the Federal Election Commission Web site _ www.fec.gov _
by looking under news releases and clicking on ``August 27, 1999 _
Compliance Cases Made Public.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr's attorney, Benjamin Ginsberg, said at the time that Barr
didn't intentionally violate the FEC rules. The congressman has
hired a full-time staffer to make sure that future contributions
meet the rules, and his computer software has been updated to
double-check his donor lists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I find the bluish-purple headlights on newer cars blinding
and very dangerous at night. What makes them so bright, and are
they legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: The high-intensity-discharge headlights use xenon gas to
produce an azure-white light that approximates dayight. As
explained in the April issue of Consumer Reports, both the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the American Automobile
Association have reported mounting complaints from motorists who,
like you, find the lights distracting, especially head-on.
</P>
<P>
   While NHTSA confirms that the new headlights meet all
requirements and aren't any brighter than old ones, glare can be a
problem. The sharp contrast between lit and unlit areas also may
give oncoming motorists a temporary sense of being blinded.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports advises motorists whose vehicles have such
lights to keep them properly aimed by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have misplaced my 16-year-old daughter's Social Security
card, and I'm amazed at how many times in the recent past I've been
asked to show it. How do we go about getting another one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Social Security's toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213, and
ask for an application for a replacement. Be prepared to provide
original or certified copies of approved identity documents. Check
www.ssa.gov for online information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone where I work told me that Mary Kay Bergman died. She
was doing voices for the TV program ``South Park.'' Do you have any
details?
</P>
<P>
   A: She died Nov. 11 of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the
head, according to the Los Angeles Coroner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, 38, who gave voice to the mothers of such ``South
Park'' characters as Stan, Cartman and Kenny, was found dead by her
husband, Dino Andrade, in their home near Venice, Calif. Her
attorney, Robert Harrison, told The Associated Press that her death
was a complete surprise, and that she had shown no signs of
depression. ``She did leave a note, a reason, but it didn't make
any sense,'' he said. ``She was a victim of mental illness and no
one knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran voice-over performer was heard on both the ``Comedy
Central'' TV series and the movie ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut.'' Her credits also included supplying voices for the ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' video game and for movies
such as ``The Iron Giant'' and ``Mulan.'' In recent years, she had
inherited the role of Daphne in the new ``Scooby-Doo'' videos.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the controversial estate of the late Howard Hughes ever
been settled?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It was finalized in October 1990, 14 years after the
reclusive billionaire's death. When the dust settled from one of
the most protracted estate battles in American history _ mainly
because Hughes left no will _ Hughes' 22 cousins and their
descendants were named to receive $1 billion. According to a report
in Forbes, legal fees involved in the resolution of the affair
amounted to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   William Rice Lummis, a Houston lawyer whose mother was Hughes'
aunt and his closest remaining relative, was the court-appointed
administrator. He reportedly convinced the cousins to quit
squabbling and agree on a potential division of the spoils. Lummis
himself borrowed $190 million to reinvest in Hughes' helicopter
business, turned it around, and sold it for $470 million, according
to Forbes. He also settled claims against the estate by the
Internal Revenue Service and California and Texas, where Hughes had
business interests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cash settlements, it was reported that the
cousins and descendants retained stock in Hughes-related companies
that are developing real estate projects in Nevada and California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the M in Texas A&AMP;M stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: When it opened on Oct. 4, 1876, the school was named
Agricultual and Mechanical College of Texas. In 1963, the name was
changed to Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that photo ID is needed to board an airplane. Do I
have to comply?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some airlines won't let you board if you refuse to provide
it. So why create a problem? The Federal Aviation Administration
recommends that everyone _ minors excepted _ have photo ID to
expedite check-in procedures. If you don't have a photo ID, the FAA
says to be sure you have two pieces of identification, one of which
must be issued by a government authority. Otherwise, you may face
additional security scrutiny. And that will slow things down.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jimy Williams of the Boston Red Sox has been named the
American League manager of the year. What can you tell me about his
early background, and how can I write him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Williams was born Oct. 4, 1943, in Arroyo Grande, Calif. He
graduated from Arroyo Grande High School and Fresno State
University in California, where he was an All California Collegiate
All-Star during his last two years. In 1963-64, he played at
Sturgis (South Dakota) in the semi-pro Basin League, and in 1964 he
also played for the Alaska Goldpanners. He then went to Waterloo
(Iowa) of the Midwest League, followed by the St. Louis Cardinals
of the National League. He has always played shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   A shoulder injury in the winter of 1969 shortened his pro
playing career, and he retired as an active player in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he obtained his first managing job with the
Angels Quad Cities of Midwest League. Over the next 32 years, he
had coaching and managing jobs with several minor league teams,
followed by stints with the Toronto Blue Jays, Atlanta Braves, and
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Write him in care of the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park, 4 Yawkey
Way, Boston, MA 02215.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A report on state divorce rates said that except for Nevada,
most were in the South. Will you list all the states and their
ranking? Surely some of the other high-ranking states were outside
the Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the list as compiled by the Associated Press, based on
1998 statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center
for Health Statistics. As reported, Nevada has the highest divorce
rate. Following Nevada, this is the order:
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee; Arkansas; Alabama; Oklahoma; New Hampshire; Wyoming;
Idaho; Kentucky; Arizona; Florida; Alaska; West Virginia;
Washington; Texas; North Carolina; Missouri; Mississippi; Georgia;
Oregon; New Mexico; Delaware; Virginia; Vermont; Utah; Maine; Ohio;
Kansas; Hawaii; Michigan; Nebraska; South Carolina; Montana; South
Dakota; Wisconsin; Illinois; Iowa; North Dakota; Minnesota;
Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Maryland; New Jersey; Connecticut;
Massachusetts; New York.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics weren't available on Colorado, California, Illinois
and Louisiana. And the ranking of Texas is based on statistics from
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Federal Reserve instituted a ``neutral bias''
toward interest rates. Isn't that an oxymoron? Wouldn't ``neutral
stance'' be more correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: It may sound oxymoronic, but it's the conventional phrase
used to describe the Fed's deliberate decision not to lean one way
or the other on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A program on the History Channel referred to something called
the ``Paris gun,'' but didn't give any details. I know it was used
in World War I, but I'd like to know more about it. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: The term ``Paris gun'' was given to any of three long-range
210mm German guns used to bombard Paris between March 23 and Aug.
7, 1918. Most of the emplacements were in the St. Gobain Wood near
Laon, 70 miles from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The gun _ Pariskanonen in German _ had a barrel almost 120 feet
long, and could fire a 275-pound projectile to a range of about 80
miles. When the guns' first shells landed on Paris, people thought
they had been dropped from German bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Paris guns fired 203 shells against the city, but
they failed to produce the panic and population exodus that the
Germans hoped to achieve. The advance of the Allied armies in
August 1918 ended the shelling.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When did American Samoa, Guam and Puerto Rico become part of
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: American Samoa, a U.S. possession, was acquired by the United
States in stages between 1900 and 1925. Guam was ceded by Spain to
the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, and
became a territory on Aug. 1, 1950. Puerto Rico, a U.S.
commonwealth, was surrendered by Spain to the United States, also
in 1898, under the Treaty of Paris, with the first U.S. civil
governor appointed under the terms of the Organic Act of 1900,
known as the Foraker Act.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the book ``Band of Brothers,'' about E Company, 506th
Regiment, 101st Airborne, in France during World War II, author
Stephen Ambrose relates how a Pvt. Fritz Niland lost three brothers
in combat in one week. As a sole surviving son, he was ordered back
to the United States. Was this incident a basis for the movie
``Saving Private Ryan''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Accounts of this incident were in the news in the summer
of 1998 when the movie was receiving so much publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ambrose stated that the narrative kernel for
the fictional account of Private Ryan was taken from ``Band of
Brothers,'' which documented the case of Fritz Niland of Tonawanda,
N.Y. Two of his brothers were killed in the D-Day invasion, and a
third was killed in Burma. Their mother received three telegrams
from the War Department (the Defense Department didn't yet exist)
within a short time frame notifying her of her sons' deaths. So her
fourth son, fighting in France, was snatched out of the front lines
by the Army and sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz has cancer.
How can his fans send him get-well messages? What is the outlook
for future cartoon strips?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mail can be sent to Schulz at his home, One Snoopy Place,
Santa Rosa, CA 95403-2665. The cartoonist, who turns 77 today, was
diagnosed with colon cancer after undergoing emergency surgery Nov.
16 to clear a blocked abdominal aorta. Newhouse News Service
reported that Schulz will undergo chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   United Feature Syndicate, which distributes the Peanuts comic
strip, said Schulz has worked ahead, so his daily strips are
completed for this year, and Sunday strips are completed through
Feb. 14. The syndicate added that it ``hopes and expects'' Schulz
will be able to produce new material for 2000, but if he chooses
not to do so, Peanuts strips commencing with those from 1974 will
be substituted.

   Q: Is it possible to order a videotape of a PBS program?
</P>
<P>
   A: In some cases, yes, but all programs aren't available on
tape. There are two ways to check the complete listing of videos
offered through PBS Home Video: online at http://shop.pbs.org/ or
by calling PBS Home Video at 1-800-645-4727.

<P>
   Q: I've heard several stories over the years about Ronald Reagan
and his military service, or lack of it. Can you set the record
straight for me?
</P>
<P>
   A: On April 14, 1942, Reagan, by then an actor with such movies
as ``Love Is on the Air'' and Dark Victory'' to his credit, entered
the Army Air Corps as a second lieutenant of cavalry in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The book ``Facts About the Presidents'' says his poor eyesight
disqualified him for combat duty. Between 1942 and 1945, he made
training films for the Army. On Dec. 9, 1945, with the rank of
captain, he received an honorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that Georgia's first governor, John
Adam Treutlen, was brutally murdered after he moved to South
Carolina. It quoted the author of a new pamphlet about him as
saying he was drawn and quartered in front of his family. What
happened to cause such an awful event?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are few reliable details on Treutlen's murder, and the
``why'' is complicated, said Helene Riley, professor of German at
Clemson University and author of ``John Adam Treutlen: The European
Heritage of Georgia's First Governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Treutlen had many enemies as well as supporters, Riley said.
Among his enemies was William Henry Drayton of South Carolina, who
actively pursued South Carolina's efforts to annex Georgia. As
governor, Treutlen issued a proclamation offering a reward of 100
pounds for the capture of Drayton or his followers, Riley
explained. There also were disputes between rival factions of the
immigrant Salzburger community of Lutherans at Ebenezer, Ga., where
Treutlen and John Caspar Wertsch were leaders of the factions.
</P>
<P>
   When the English invaded Georgia, Treutlen fled to South
Carolina. His murder took place between January and April 1782 when
several Tories or refugees ``cut him to pieces with a sword,'' as
Riley put it. His fate wasn't reported until May 1783. The episode
is documented in the December 1965 Georgia Historical Quarterly,
No. 4, available at libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read about the Cold War Memorial for those who served in
the military, but not necessarily during wartime. I didn't keep the
information, and now I need it. I believe it's different from the
World War II Memorial, a la Tom Hanks. Can you refresh my memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not a memorial, in the manner of the proposed World War
II Memorial. What you're thinking about is the Cold War Recognition
Certificate. Established by Congress as part of the fiscal 1998
National Defense Authorization Act, the certificate is symbolic,
with no financial or other type of reward.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the armed forces and federal government civilian
personnel ``who faithfully served the United States during the Cold
War era'' are eligible. The specified dates for service are Sept.
2, 1945, to Dec. 26, 1991. The easiest way to request a certificate
is by using the request form at this Web site _
http://coldwar.army.mil/ _ but it also can be accomplished by
sending an application letter, along with documentation proving
service during the period, to Cold War, 4035 Ridge Top Road,
Fairfax, VA 22030; or faxing it to 1-800-723-9262 or 703-275-6749.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptable documentation includes any government form _ copy,
not original, because it can't be returned _ that includes the
applicant's name and Social Security number (or military service or
foreign service number) and dates of service. Expect a six-month
delay before receiving the certificate.
</P>
<P>
   For recorded information, call 703-275-6279.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the comic strip Dilbert, what is the name of Dilbert's
pointy-haired boss?
</P>
<P>
   A: The boss character has no name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What American microbeers does Michael Jackson, described as
``the world's top brew expert,'' rate the highest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 57-year-old Briton, heralded by the Encyclopedia of Beer
as ``the world's pre-eminent authority,'' is impressed with, to
name a few microbrews nationally, Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale and
Tuppers' Hop Pocket Pils, Anchor Liberty Ale, Sierra Nevada Pale
Ale and Celis White.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My swimming instructor at the YMCA taught me what she called
a Trudgen stroke. She couldn't explain the origin of the name. Can
you?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the stroke in which the swimmer uses a double
over-arm motion and a scissors kick. It's named after British
amateur swimmer John Arthur Trudgen (1852-1902), who introduced it
to Europe in 1893 after seeing it used in South America. The stroke
is regarded as the first successful above-water arm action used in
swimming. Trudgen popularized the idea of minimizing water
resistance by bringing both arms out of the water, which paved the
way for the now-common front (or Australian) crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The printer printed our company Christmas cards wrong and we
have 500 that we can't use. I remember reading about a place to
send old cards where children cut off the fronts to make new cards.
Do you have that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: St. Jude's Ranch for Children, a Nevada community focusing on
the needs of abused, abandoned and neglected children of all races
and faiths, is the place.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Jude's Born Again Recycling Program started more than 30
years ago with children taking the fronts of used cards and gluing
them to preprinted card backs, then selling the cards to the
public. Children earn 15 cents for every card they make. Used
Christmas cards form the bulk of the program, but other greeting
cards are welcome, too, so it's a year-round operation. St. Jude's
requests that people send the card fronts only, with no writing on
the reverse. They need to be a size that can be trimmed to fit
5-by-7-inch card backs. Send the card fronts to: St. Jude's Ranch
for Children, 100 St. Jude's St., Boulder City, NV 89005.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to buy ``new'' cards made by the children can
call 1-800-492-3562. The cost for 10 cards in a package is $6.50.
Telephone orders are charged to a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in Ship 41, Delta's refurbished DC-3. Is it
available for viewing by the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Delta's James Ray said the plane will be used only for
major air shows and Delta-sponsored events. Its recent introductory
flight was for the benefit of Delta employees and others involved
in this particular aircraft during its initial operation by the
airline. Ship 41, named for the last two digits of its original
identification number (28341), was the second DC-3 purchased by
Delta and the first, in 1940, to carry Delta passengers on a
regularly scheduled flight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the the actor who portrays Officer Davis on the TV
series ``Third Watch,'' and what is his background? Where can fans
write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coby Bell plays Ty Davis Jr. A native of Orange County,
Calif., Bell is the son of Broadway veteran Michel Bell (``The
Civil War''). Before signing on for ``Third Watch,'' Bell was in
the cast of ``L.A. Doctors,'' playing Patrick Owen.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is an honors graduate of San Jose State University in
California. His first TV role was on NBC's ``ER,'' and he also has
appeared on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Players,'' ``Smart
Guy'' and ``The Parent Hood.'' His bio says that during his down
time, Bell enjoys playing basketball and tennis. He also sings and
plays keyboard in a band. He's active in the Big Brother mentoring
program, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bell lives in New York, where ``Third Watch'' is filmed. Write
him in care of NBC, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While driving through South Carolina recently, we noticed
every single overpass on I-85 had a big red bow on it. Is this for
the holidays, or does it symbolize something else?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's intended to be a more serious message than ``happy
holidays,'' said a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of
Transportation. The bows are meant to call attention to the dangers
posed by drunk drivers. They were furnished by Mothers Against
Drunk Driving (MADD).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, I read in two newspapers that Bob Barr
had been fined for fund-raising irregularities. Details of the
settlement differed in the two articles. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The settlement between Barr (R-Ga.) and the Federal Election
Commission was for just over $28,000. The complaints stemmed from
Barr's first election to Congress in 1994 and his subsequent 1996
re-election campaign. The FEC found that Barr had accepted some
$100,000 in contributions during the two elections that exceeded
the $1,000-a-person limit that individuals can give. The commission
also found that Barr had failed to report certain contributions
every 48 hours, failed to identify occupations of some of his
donors, and failed to itemize some of his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   FEC spokeswoman Sharon Snyder said the conciliation agreements
called for a $12,055 civil penalty in the 1994 campaign and a
$16,000 civil penalty in the 1996 campaign. Details can be found
online at the Federal Election Commission Web site _ www.fec.gov _
by looking under news releases and clicking on ``August 27, 1999 _
Compliance Cases Made Public.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr's attorney, Benjamin Ginsberg, said at the time that Barr
didn't intentionally violate the FEC rules. The congressman has
hired a full-time staffer to make sure that future contributions
meet the rules, and his computer software has been updated to
double-check his donor lists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I find the bluish-purple headlights on newer cars blinding
and very dangerous at night. What makes them so bright, and are
they legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: The high-intensity-discharge headlights use xenon gas to
produce an azure-white light that approximates dayight. As
explained in the April issue of Consumer Reports, both the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the American Automobile
Association have reported mounting complaints from motorists who,
like you, find the lights distracting, especially head-on.
</P>
<P>
   While NHTSA confirms that the new headlights meet all
requirements and aren't any brighter than old ones, glare can be a
problem. The sharp contrast between lit and unlit areas also may
give oncoming motorists a temporary sense of being blinded.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports advises motorists whose vehicles have such
lights to keep them properly aimed by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have misplaced my 16-year-old daughter's Social Security
card, and I'm amazed at how many times in the recent past I've been
asked to show it. How do we go about getting another one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Social Security's toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213, and
ask for an application for a replacement. Be prepared to provide
original or certified copies of approved identity documents. Check
www.ssa.gov for online information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone where I work told me that Mary Kay Bergman died. She
was doing voices for the TV program ``South Park.'' Do you have any
details?
</P>
<P>
   A: She died Nov. 11 of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the
head, according to the Los Angeles Coroner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, 38, who gave voice to the mothers of such ``South
Park'' characters as Stan, Cartman and Kenny, was found dead by her
husband, Dino Andrade, in their home near Venice, Calif. Her
attorney, Robert Harrison, told The Associated Press that her death
was a complete surprise, and that she had shown no signs of
depression. ``She did leave a note, a reason, but it didn't make
any sense,'' he said. ``She was a victim of mental illness and no
one knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran voice-over performer was heard on both the ``Comedy
Central'' TV series and the movie ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut.'' Her credits also included supplying voices for the ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' video game and for movies
such as ``The Iron Giant'' and ``Mulan.'' In recent years, she had
inherited the role of Daphne in the new ``Scooby-Doo'' videos.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the controversial estate of the late Howard Hughes ever
been settled?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It was finalized in October 1990, 14 years after the
reclusive billionaire's death. When the dust settled from one of
the most protracted estate battles in American history _ mainly
because Hughes left no will _ Hughes' 22 cousins and their
descendants were named to receive $1 billion. According to a report
in Forbes, legal fees involved in the resolution of the affair
amounted to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   William Rice Lummis, a Houston lawyer whose mother was Hughes'
aunt and his closest remaining relative, was the court-appointed
administrator. He reportedly convinced the cousins to quit
squabbling and agree on a potential division of the spoils. Lummis
himself borrowed $190 million to reinvest in Hughes' helicopter
business, turned it around, and sold it for $470 million, according
to Forbes. He also settled claims against the estate by the
Internal Revenue Service and California and Texas, where Hughes had
business interests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cash settlements, it was reported that the
cousins and descendants retained stock in Hughes-related companies
that are developing real estate projects in Nevada and California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the M in Texas A&AMP;M stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: When it opened on Oct. 4, 1876, the school was named
Agricultual and Mechanical College of Texas. In 1963, the name was
changed to Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that photo ID is needed to board an airplane. Do I
have to comply?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some airlines won't let you board if you refuse to provide
it. So why create a problem? The Federal Aviation Administration
recommends that everyone _ minors excepted _ have photo ID to
expedite check-in procedures. If you don't have a photo ID, the FAA
says to be sure you have two pieces of identification, one of which
must be issued by a government authority. Otherwise, you may face
additional security scrutiny. And that will slow things down.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jimy Williams of the Boston Red Sox has been named the
American League manager of the year. What can you tell me about his
early background, and how can I write him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Williams was born Oct. 4, 1943, in Arroyo Grande, Calif. He
graduated from Arroyo Grande High School and Fresno State
University in California, where he was an All California Collegiate
All-Star during his last two years. In 1963-64, he played at
Sturgis (South Dakota) in the semi-pro Basin League, and in 1964 he
also played for the Alaska Goldpanners. He then went to Waterloo
(Iowa) of the Midwest League, followed by the St. Louis Cardinals
of the National League. He has always played shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   A shoulder injury in the winter of 1969 shortened his pro
playing career, and he retired as an active player in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he obtained his first managing job with the
Angels Quad Cities of Midwest League. Over the next 32 years, he
had coaching and managing jobs with several minor league teams,
followed by stints with the Toronto Blue Jays, Atlanta Braves, and
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Write him in care of the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park, 4 Yawkey
Way, Boston, MA 02215.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A report on state divorce rates said that except for Nevada,
most were in the South. Will you list all the states and their
ranking? Surely some of the other high-ranking states were outside
the Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the list as compiled by the Associated Press, based on
1998 statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center
for Health Statistics. As reported, Nevada has the highest divorce
rate. Following Nevada, this is the order:
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee; Arkansas; Alabama; Oklahoma; New Hampshire; Wyoming;
Idaho; Kentucky; Arizona; Florida; Alaska; West Virginia;
Washington; Texas; North Carolina; Missouri; Mississippi; Georgia;
Oregon; New Mexico; Delaware; Virginia; Vermont; Utah; Maine; Ohio;
Kansas; Hawaii; Michigan; Nebraska; South Carolina; Montana; South
Dakota; Wisconsin; Illinois; Iowa; North Dakota; Minnesota;
Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Maryland; New Jersey; Connecticut;
Massachusetts; New York.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics weren't available on Colorado, California, Illinois
and Louisiana. And the ranking of Texas is based on statistics from
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Federal Reserve instituted a ``neutral bias''
toward interest rates. Isn't that an oxymoron? Wouldn't ``neutral
stance'' be more correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: It may sound oxymoronic, but it's the conventional phrase
used to describe the Fed's deliberate decision not to lean one way
or the other on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A program on the History Channel referred to something called
the ``Paris gun,'' but didn't give any details. I know it was used
in World War I, but I'd like to know more about it. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: The term ``Paris gun'' was given to any of three long-range
210mm German guns used to bombard Paris between March 23 and Aug.
7, 1918. Most of the emplacements were in the St. Gobain Wood near
Laon, 70 miles from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The gun _ Pariskanonen in German _ had a barrel almost 120 feet
long, and could fire a 275-pound projectile to a range of about 80
miles. When the guns' first shells landed on Paris, people thought
they had been dropped from German bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Paris guns fired 203 shells against the city, but
they failed to produce the panic and population exodus that the
Germans hoped to achieve. The advance of the Allied armies in
August 1918 ended the shelling.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When did American Samoa, Guam and Puerto Rico become part of
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: American Samoa, a U.S. possession, was acquired by the United
States in stages between 1900 and 1925. Guam was ceded by Spain to
the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, and
became a territory on Aug. 1, 1950. Puerto Rico, a U.S.
commonwealth, was surrendered by Spain to the United States, also
in 1898, under the Treaty of Paris, with the first U.S. civil
governor appointed under the terms of the Organic Act of 1900,
known as the Foraker Act.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the book ``Band of Brothers,'' about E Company, 506th
Regiment, 101st Airborne, in France during World War II, author
Stephen Ambrose relates how a Pvt. Fritz Niland lost three brothers
in combat in one week. As a sole surviving son, he was ordered back
to the United States. Was this incident a basis for the movie
``Saving Private Ryan''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Accounts of this incident were in the news in the summer
of 1998 when the movie was receiving so much publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ambrose stated that the narrative kernel for
the fictional account of Private Ryan was taken from ``Band of
Brothers,'' which documented the case of Fritz Niland of Tonawanda,
N.Y. Two of his brothers were killed in the D-Day invasion, and a
third was killed in Burma. Their mother received three telegrams
from the War Department (the Defense Department didn't yet exist)
within a short time frame notifying her of her sons' deaths. So her
fourth son, fighting in France, was snatched out of the front lines
by the Army and sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz has cancer.
How can his fans send him get-well messages? What is the outlook
for future cartoon strips?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mail can be sent to Schulz at his home, One Snoopy Place,
Santa Rosa, CA 95403-2665. The cartoonist, who turns 77 today, was
diagnosed with colon cancer after undergoing emergency surgery Nov.
16 to clear a blocked abdominal aorta. Newhouse News Service
reported that Schulz will undergo chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   United Feature Syndicate, which distributes the Peanuts comic
strip, said Schulz has worked ahead, so his daily strips are
completed for this year, and Sunday strips are completed through
Feb. 14. The syndicate added that it ``hopes and expects'' Schulz
will be able to produce new material for 2000, but if he chooses
not to do so, Peanuts strips commencing with those from 1974 will
be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to order a videotape of a PBS program?
</P>
<P>
   A: In some cases, yes, but all programs aren't available on
tape. There are two ways to check the complete listing of videos
offered through PBS Home Video: online at http://shop.pbs.org/ or
by calling PBS Home Video at 1-800-645-4727.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard several stories over the years about Ronald Reagan
and his military service, or lack of it. Can you set the record
straight for me?
</P>
<P>
   A: On April 14, 1942, Reagan, by then an actor with such movies
as ``Love Is on the Air'' and Dark Victory'' to his credit, entered
the Army Air Corps as a second lieutenant of cavalry in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The book ``Facts About the Presidents'' says his poor eyesight
disqualified him for combat duty. Between 1942 and 1945, he made
training films for the Army. On Dec. 9, 1945, with the rank of
captain, he received an honorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that Georgia's first governor, John
Adam Treutlen, was brutally murdered after he moved to South
Carolina. It quoted the author of a new pamphlet about him as
saying he was drawn and quartered in front of his family. What
happened to cause such an awful event?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are few reliable details on Treutlen's murder, and the
``why'' is complicated, said Helene Riley, professor of German at
Clemson University and author of ``John Adam Treutlen: The European
Heritage of Georgia's First Governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Treutlen had many enemies as well as supporters, Riley said.
Among his enemies was William Henry Drayton of South Carolina, who
actively pursued South Carolina's efforts to annex Georgia. As
governor, Treutlen issued a proclamation offering a reward of 100
pounds for the capture of Drayton or his followers, Riley
explained. There also were disputes between rival factions of the
immigrant Salzburger community of Lutherans at Ebenezer, Ga., where
Treutlen and John Caspar Wertsch were leaders of the factions.
</P>
<P>
   When the English invaded Georgia, Treutlen fled to South
Carolina. His murder took place between January and April 1782 when
several Tories or refugees ``cut him to pieces with a sword,'' as
Riley put it. His fate wasn't reported until May 1783. The episode
is documented in the December 1965 Georgia Historical Quarterly,
No. 4, available at libraries.

   Q: In the comic strip Dilbert, what is the name of Dilbert's
pointy-haired boss?
</P>
<P>
   A: The boss character has no name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What American microbeers does Michael Jackson, described as
``the world's top brew expert,'' rate the highest?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 57-year-old Briton, heralded by the Encyclopedia of Beer
as ``the world's pre-eminent authority,'' is impressed with, to
name a few microbrews nationally, Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale and
Tuppers' Hop Pocket Pils, Anchor Liberty Ale, Sierra Nevada Pale
Ale and Celis White.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My swimming instructor at the YMCA taught me what she called
a Trudgen stroke. She couldn't explain the origin of the name. Can
you?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the stroke in which the swimmer uses a double
over-arm motion and a scissors kick. It's named after British
amateur swimmer John Arthur Trudgen (1852-1902), who introduced it
to Europe in 1893 after seeing it used in South America. The stroke
is regarded as the first successful above-water arm action used in
swimming. Trudgen popularized the idea of minimizing water
resistance by bringing both arms out of the water, which paved the
way for the now-common front (or Australian) crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The printer printed our company Christmas cards wrong and we
have 500 that we can't use. I remember reading about a place to
send old cards where children cut off the fronts to make new cards.
Do you have that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: St. Jude's Ranch for Children, a Nevada community focusing on
the needs of abused, abandoned and neglected children of all races
and faiths, is the place.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Jude's Born Again Recycling Program started more than 30
years ago with children taking the fronts of used cards and gluing
them to preprinted card backs, then selling the cards to the
public. Children earn 15 cents for every card they make. Used
Christmas cards form the bulk of the program, but other greeting
cards are welcome, too, so it's a year-round operation. St. Jude's
requests that people send the card fronts only, with no writing on
the reverse. They need to be a size that can be trimmed to fit
5-by-7-inch card backs. Send the card fronts to: St. Jude's Ranch
for Children, 100 St. Jude's St., Boulder City, NV 89005.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to buy ``new'' cards made by the children can
call 1-800-492-3562. The cost for 10 cards in a package is $6.50.
Telephone orders are charged to a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in Ship 41, Delta's refurbished DC-3. Is it
available for viewing by the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Delta's James Ray said the plane will be used only for
major air shows and Delta-sponsored events. Its recent introductory
flight was for the benefit of Delta employees and others involved
in this particular aircraft during its initial operation by the
airline. Ship 41, named for the last two digits of its original
identification number (28341), was the second DC-3 purchased by
Delta and the first, in 1940, to carry Delta passengers on a
regularly scheduled flight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the the actor who portrays Officer Davis on the TV
series ``Third Watch,'' and what is his background? Where can fans
write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coby Bell plays Ty Davis Jr. A native of Orange County,
Calif., Bell is the son of Broadway veteran Michel Bell (``The
Civil War''). Before signing on for ``Third Watch,'' Bell was in
the cast of ``L.A. Doctors,'' playing Patrick Owen.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is an honors graduate of San Jose State University in
California. His first TV role was on NBC's ``ER,'' and he also has
appeared on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Players,'' ``Smart
Guy'' and ``The Parent Hood.'' His bio says that during his down
time, Bell enjoys playing basketball and tennis. He also sings and
plays keyboard in a band. He's active in the Big Brother mentoring
program, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bell lives in New York, where ``Third Watch'' is filmed. Write
him in care of NBC, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While driving through South Carolina recently, we noticed
every single overpass on I-85 had a big red bow on it. Is this for
the holidays, or does it symbolize something else?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's intended to be a more serious message than ``happy
holidays,'' said a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of
Transportation. The bows are meant to call attention to the dangers
posed by drunk drivers. They were furnished by Mothers Against
Drunk Driving (MADD).

 &HT;    Tray chic: know your options before purchasing a holiday party
platter
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's party season. Make that party tray season,
when office managers and party hosts order a time-saving platter of
meats and cheeses for holiday celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Every supermarket offers them. We wondered about differences in
price and quality. The natural question is which is the best, or at
least the best value.
</P>
<P>
   So we ordered six trays from five supermarkets and a deli. To be
sure of comparing similar party trays, we ordered the standard
meat-and-cheese platter at each business. Prices ranged from $18.95
to $54.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the trays were billed as serving 10 to 14, with one
serving eight to 10. At the two stores that sell the trays with a
per-person price, we ordered a tray for 12. However, when all the
trays were weighed it was obvious the stores' definition of
portions varied. Total tray weights ranged from 4 pounds, 6 ounces
to 7 pounds, 8 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered the party trays anonymously a day in advance and
weighed them on a postal scale. We scrutinized them and tasted
them.
</P>
<P>
   Our conclusion: You get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   The party tray from DiSalvo's Deli &AMP; Italian Store offered the
best quality, with generous servings of top-grade meats and the
bonus of a mound of house-marinated imported olives tucked inside a
border of marinated tomatoes. The cheeses were arranged on a
separate tray. This party tray also was the most expensive, at
$4.50 per person, or $54 for a tray to serve 12. That price may be
deceptive since DiSalvo's meat and cheese trays weighed in at 7 1/2
pounds, considerably more than all the others _ and obviously able
to feed more guests. The ham and the roast beef, cooked to a
blushing medium, won high marks from tasters.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the budget-priced trays included lower-quality
meat.
</P>
<P>
   Of the lower-priced trays, one from Cub was a good value. The
quality of some of the meats and the amount (the platter weighed 5
pounds, 10 ounces) made the $24.99 price attractive. The only
drawback is that the meat and cheese were piled high on a small
platter, making it difficult to extract a single piece.
</P>
<P>
   One tip: Before you decide, ask questions about the products
used and be specific when you order. What's billed as ``turkey
breast'' may turn out to be either real turkey breast meat or
processed turkey slices. The ham may be sweet or it may be smoked.
Or it may be chopped and reformed into something resembling a ham.
Roast beef and corned beef are risky to order unless you are paying
top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Below is an assessment of the six trays. Compare these prices
with stores in your own area.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DiSalvo's Deli and Italian Store: Meat and cheese deli tray,
arranged on separate trays, with a choice of three Boar's Head
meats and two cheeses. $4.50 per person, $54 for 12. The combined
trays weighed 7 1/2 pounds. Added attractions: The meats and cheese
arranged on separate platters are ideal for vegetarians. Imported
olives, marinated with rosemary, are a bonus, as is a border of
marinated sliced tomatoes. The customer picks the assortment and
can opt, as an example, for house-marinated and roasted beef. There
is an extra fee for imported meats such as prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dorothy Lane Market: $4 per person, $48 for 12. Weighed 5
pounds. Boar's Head ham, roast beef, turkey breast, corned beef and
Swiss and colby cheeses, garnished with three cherry tomatoes. The
meats are folded into individual cornets, making for an attractive
presentation _ marred by a huge lettuce leaf plopped on top with
the three cherry tomatoes. Moist turkey and roast beef are
appealing, but the ham was quite sweet. Boar's Head has other ham
options, so it's important to specify which one you want.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cub: ``Meat and Cheese Splendor,'' $24.99 to serve 10 to 14.
Weighed 5 pounds, 10 ounces. Includes real turkey breast, ham and
hard salami, as well as a tasteless roast beef and corned beef.
Swiss and American cheese round out the assortment. It is piled
high on a 12-inch platter, too small to be user-friendly. Garnished
with cherry tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Meijer: ``Meat and Cheese Buffet,'' $18.95, serves eight to
10. Weighed 4 pounds, 6 ounces. Includes roast beef, ham, turkey
and corned beef, with Swiss and American cheese. Piled high on a
small platter. Garnished with a mound of sweet pickles and bottled
pimiento olives. The turkey is processed, the squares of chopped
ham tasteless and the slippery beef was rubbery and salty. The
corned beef, surprisingly, had an appealing flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chmiel's: ``Meat and Cheese Platter,'' $2.40 per person;
$28.80 for 12. Weighed 4 pounds, 6 ounces, spread out on a 16-inch
platter, garnished only with a tomato rose and two leaves. This
platter included tasteless beef, boiled ham, processed turkey,
Swiss and hot pepper cheese. Corned beef and salami, colby and
provolone were other choices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kroger: ``Crowd Pleaser,'' $23.95, serves 10 to 14. Weighed 6
pounds. Assortment of luncheon meets and cheeses, including pickle
and pimento loaf, chopped ham, chicken breast, salami, American,
hot pepper and Muenster cheese. This is the heavyweight of the
modestly priced trays, but these are budget deli meats. Even the
chicken breast (not turkey) fell into shreds.

 &HT;    Silence speaks volumes as Disney hypes `Dinosaur'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your trek to see ``Toy Story 2'' follows the path of many
other moviegoers, you're apt to hear a wee voice in the audience
ask, ``Hey, Mom, where's Woody?''
</P>
<P>
   That's because one of the longest promos in movie history _ the
roughly 4.5-minute teaser for Disney's monster-size computer
animated film ``Dinosaur'' _ is playing prior to showings of the
record-setting box-office hit ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The long promo for ``Dinosaur,'' scheduled to debut in May, is a
wordless visual eye-opener with realistic-looking computer animated
dinos strutting their stuff on Earth during the Mesozoic period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That trailer's pretty cool,'' said Lew Breeding, 47, of Sandy
Springs, who saw ``Toy Story 2'' over the weekend. ``It kept going
on and on and on. The scene that blew me away had you following
this pterodactyl, and then it flies over this mesa and here were
all these herds of dinosaurs. It was spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives declined to talk about the film's preview. But
long promos have precedent at Disney: Five years ago, the studio
showed a three-minute, 58 second teaser to ``The Lion King''
featuring Elton John's song ``The Circle of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they really do have a captive audience and it's little
kids, they want to work that to death,'' says Michael Schau, editor
of New York's Entertainment Marketing Letter. ``While people were
assuming they were coming into the middle of a 10-minute cartoon,
all it was saying was, `Watch for us in May.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schau said most movie trailers last about 2.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the kids watching are 5, 6, 7 or 8, but they will be
fascinated,'' he said. ``Disney is just a primo marketer. It seems
like if they do it, they can get by with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the ``Dinosaur'' trailer's lack of a voiced message?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more a trend in overall advertising,'' Schau said.
``It's more about the form, lifestyle or look of something.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ``Dinosaur'' trailer, the movie will have spoken
words from well-known actors voicing the dinos. Among them: Alfre
Woodard, Ossie Davis, D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, Joan
Plowright and Della Reese.

 &HT;    Waking and shaking up America
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By 7 a.m. the parking lot is packed, the politicians
are in place and volunteers are neatly stacking voter registration
cards in the Atlanta Civic Center lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, a self-styled activist named Tom Joyner is clutching a
microphone and explaining the importance of affirmative action and
the need for greater economic empowerment to an all-black audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty heady stuff. That is until Joyner flips the script
and tells his DJ to cue up the Commodores' funky ode to
well-endowed women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a brick . . . HOOOOOUSE ,'' booms from the Civic
Center's house speakers, as Joyner and about 1,000 people who have
answered his wake-up call begin lip-syncing and swinging their hips
to the old-school classic. ``She's mighty, mighty. She's letting it
all hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week on KISS 104, ``The Tom Joyner Morning Show'' is
where thousands of Atlanta radio listeners let it all hang out with
a broadcasting icon who is giving the term ``political party'' a
whole different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner, whose nationally distributed broadcast is based in
Dallas except during frequent ``sky shows'', does much more than
spin records and crack jokes. In the last several years Joyner and
his co-stars have racked up a series of successful boycotts against
companies targeted for their treatment of black consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner has also positioned himself as a potential kingmaker in
African-American political circles. He claims more than 7 million
weekly listeners, including about 225,000 in metro Atlanta. And
while his ratings lag behind younger-skewing Frank Ski at V-103 in
the ``urban contemporary'' market, Joyner is pied piper among
middle-class, middle-age, middle-of-the-road listeners who are most
likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, former South African
President Nelson Mandela, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson have been guests on the show. During his Atlanta
visit, Joyner shared the stage with Mayor Bill Campbell, city
Councilman Michael Bond and state Rep. Vernon Jones. More than 200
people signed voter-registration cards.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Tom Joyner Show' is the single most important mass media
connection to the African-American community,'' Jones tells a
reporter backstage. ``When we're trying to get the word out about
anything, this is one of the best ways to do it. If you're
mentioned on `Tom Joyner Morning Show,' it's a tremendous boost to
your candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner has been wooing listeners with a mix of '70s-era funk
standards, unabashed political advocacy, and broad humor told by
on-air cohorts, including comedians J. Anthony Brown, George
Wallace, Myra J and an outrageous psychic called Miss Dupree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing is what good black radio has always done,''
Joyner says after polishing off a couple of butter crunch cookies
backstage. ``When we were growing up, the disc jockey was
entertaining you, but he was also telling you what was going on in
the community. Back in the civil rights era, that's how we were
getting the message out.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the early '80s, Joyner says, pro-social messages got
lost, as the ``more music, less talk'' format swept the radio
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of activism left black radio,'' Joyner says.
``I'm just trying to bring it back. I have to, because that's how I
was raised.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Morning Show'' still plays its share of mindlessly
funky hits by groups such as the Bar-Kays, Zapp and Sister Sledge,
a typical broadcast is leavened with issues-oriented commentaries
by BET talk show host Tavis Smiley, who often teams up with Joyner
to rally listeners around a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for a cause is what brought Joyner to radio in the
first place. He grew up in Tuskegee, Ala., and graduated in 1968
from Tuskegee Institute, a historically black university. After
college, Joyner got involved in a local movement that changed his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every weekend there wasn't a lot to do in Tuskegee except go
to protest marches,'' Joyner recalls. ``One day we marched because
the radio station wasn't playing enough black music. We were in an
all-black town, and they played all-white music. The station
manager agreed and said, `Who wants to do a show on Saturday?' I
raised my hand, and that's how I got in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner has worked nonstop in radio ever since, at stations in
Montgomery, Memphis and St. Louis. In the mid-'80s, while he was a
morning drive-time jock at KKDA-FM in Dallas, he got a lucrative
offer to do an afternoon show. But there was a catch: The new job
was 900 miles away in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of quitting his gig in Dallas, Joyner commuted every day
by plane between the two cities, earning him the nickname ``The Fly
Jock.'' The name stuck, although the slang definition of the term
``fly'' _ to be cool _ doesn't seem to suit him at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   In person Joyner wears fashionably draped clothes that hide a
modest middle-age paunch, and at times he speaks in a low burble
that makes him seem shy. But if he's trying to prove a point or
make a joke, his voice quickens and his eyes flash with the
mischievous glint of a teenager who's been joy riding in Dad's new
Buick.
</P>
<P>
   His infectious on-air personality and growing listenership
caught the attention of the ABC Radio Networks, which syndicated
his show in 1994. Still based in Dallas, the show is heard in 99
markets and has become a national bully pulpit to influence
institutions Joyner believes have treated blacks unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his earliest major campaigns, Joyner organized an
on-air protest against Christie's auction house in New York in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to auction off some slave memorabilia, as if
slavery is memorable,'' Joyner remembers with a wry smile. ``I
heard they had this policy of not auctioning off anything from the
Holocaust, and I felt that wasn't right because slavery was a
holocaust too.'' Listeners deluged the upper-crust auction house
with calls, convincing Christie's and the consignor to donate the
items to a museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made us aware of how certain groups looked at this,'' says
Christie's spokeswoman Vredy Lytsman. ``It was better this way, and
everybody was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victory came in 1998 when Joyner exposed an internal
memo circulated at the New York ad-buying firm Katz Media Group,
which advised its clients not to advertise on minority-owned radio
stations because they should be looking for ``prospects, not
suspects.'' Katz Radio President Stu Olds eventually apologized for
the memo on Joyner's show and promised to personally solicit
companies to advertise on black stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pick the fights we think we can win. We don't ever want to
lose,'' Joyner says. ``Every time we do one and we win, it further
empowers people to think they can make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner's latest coup was perhaps his biggest, but also his
messiest.
</P>
<P>
   In October Joyner set his crosshairs on CompUSA, a national
computer retailer he criticized for failing to advertise in black
media outlets. He urged his listeners to call, write and e-mail the
company to complain. Later he told fans to send in receipts to
prove they had purchased merchandise from
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went on for two weeks, and I got no response from them,''
Joyner said. ``Then one day I got this fax on CompUSA's letterhead
and it was a nasty memo about black people, and I said `Dang, this
ain't cool.' '' Incensed, Joyner read the fax on the air. After
being contacted by a reporter, Joyner found out the memo was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked legit to me, but nobody checked it,'' he said. ``It
pointed out a vulnerability in our way of doing things. It was a
cheap shot and I was blindsided.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner also apologized after learning his claim that the company
had no black board members was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he continued the protest. ABC threatened to take him off the
air, claiming fear of a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary. They said they were going to unplug the show,''
Joyner said. ``I told them I was coming to work. It was a
showdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner went on the air that day, and so did the CompUSA protest.
After 10 weeks, company President James F. Halpin met with Joyner
and Smiley in Dallas. Halpin later appeared on Joyner's show, where
he agreed to hire a black advertising agency and offered a 10
percent discount to listeners who mailed in store receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our actions were absolutely influenced by the campaign,''
acknowledged Suzanne Shelton, CompUSA's director of public affairs.
``Besides, we like all our customers and thought it was the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying for more business for black media might seem
self-serving, but Jeff Axelrod, assistant managing editor for trade
paper Records &AMP; Radio, says Joyner's campaigns are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stations with minority formats have not gotten the same share
of ad dollars as white stations,'' Axelrod says. ``When he raises
awareness about this issue, he may benefit indirectly, but he's
also making things better for thousands of radio employees across
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans say it's that kind of take-no-prisoners integrity that
has made Joyner a bona fide leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps me informed about what's going on in America, and I
know I can trust him,'' said Lorine Singleton Hall, a 32-year-old
Decatur real estate agent. ``He has so much power in the community,
but he's still so down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall got more than a daily dose of information at the Civic
Center show. She also won a pair of round-trip airline tickets for
dancing to ``Shake Your Rump to the Funk.''
</P>
<P>
   William Boone, a professor of political science at Clark Atlanta
University, doesn't do much rump-shaking these days, and he didn't
attend the Atlanta show. But he tunes in sometimes on his way to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Joyner has been able to hit a certain group of black baby
boomers who are not tuned in to traditional black leaders, and I
think he's done that by mixing the serious and the non-serious,''
Boone says. ``I guess there is a concern that the serious message
will get clouded or glossed over, but to get that message across
you have to talk to people where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner says his duty is to keep white companies on their toes
when it comes to his on-air constituency. But what about
black-owned companies and politicians?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't criticize them,'' Joyner says squarely. ``Any
problem I have with a black person, I deal with personally. We need
to settle whatever problems we have with each other behind closed
doors and come out united.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone sees an inherent risk in that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a problem with not being self-critical,'' he
says. ``You run the risk of portraying everything black as good and
everything white as bad, which allows you to be exploited by your
own people. Even in the interest of solidarity, you can still be
self-critical.''
</P>
<P>
   But other longtime listeners don't seem to mind. Ronnie
Crawford, 32, of Buckhead says there are few entertainers like
Joyner who are willing to put their careers and their reputations
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to show him support and show him that we have his
back,'' said Crawford, a management specialist for cemeteries and
funeral homes. ``If we don't support him, black people will lose
out as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Joyner has been devoting more of his time to a pet
project: an eponymous, nonprofit foundation that raises money for
black colleges and universities. Run by his sons, Thomas Jr. and
Oscar, the Tom Joyner Foundation hopes to raise more than $1
million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner said he plans on continuing his radio crusades, although
nobody is raising his dander at the moment. For now he's talking up
the 2000 Census, urging listeners to be counted, and trying to
raise awareness about the upcoming presidential election. Who
knows, maybe he'll invite the candidates for an on-air debate and
an electric slide contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at you, if you can entertain you can influence
people. If you can influence them, you can empower them. If we were
all serious, people would tune us out. If I throw a party every day
and get them laughing, I can tell them something important.''

 &HT;    More about party trays
 &HT;    (EDS: SIDEBAR to PARTY-TRAYS02-COX.)
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't want to hear this, but the rules of food safety apply
to party trays, too.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the food on the party tray _ the meats, cheeses
and dips _ should not stand at room temperature more than two
hours. After that, the food should be pitched because it's been in
the danger zone when bacteria breed for too long.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some of those meats may be laced with
preservatives doesn't protect them. The bacteria may have been on
the meat slicer or the employee's hands.
</P>
<P>
   If pitching food sounds wasteful, plan ahead and hold some food
back. Refill the tray or have a spare tray already made up to take
to the table after two hours. If possible, position the party tray
on a bed of ice for extended shelf life.

 &HT;    Around the world with knockout reds
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a hot-air balloon, you can go around the world in 80 days _
if you're Rex Harrison, and you've got money to burn.
</P>
<P>
   At your local wine shop, you can go around the world in 80
seconds, and it won't cost you anywhere near as much.
</P>
<P>
   Now that winter-like temperatures have finally arrived, let's
use red wines to take that worldwide trip. Reds just seem to taste
better when you can see your breath outside. Or inside, depending
on your home ventilation system.
</P>
<P>
   Let's focus on a handful of wines that are fairly widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1998 Rosemount Estate Shiraz (Diamond Label) from Australia,
$10.99-$11.99: This is a relatively one-dimensional wine, but wow,
what a dimension! There is amazing concentration of fruit, to the
point that even the bubbles that form alongside the glass after a
robust pour appear Welch's-purple. Shiraz is the Australian term
for the syrah grape of France and California, grown in warmer
climates and producing rich, sturdy dry reds. This Australian red
has been remarkably consistent over the years, but the '98 packs a
little more oomph than usual. If you're a fan of rich, red
zinfandels but balk at the rising price of zins, check out this and
other shiraz-based wines from Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1995 Veramonte Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile, $7.99-$9.99: I
haven't tried newer vintages of this wine, but the '95 is a
knockout. A totally different wine from the Shiraz, this dry red
offers complexity in both the aromas and flavors _ a lot of
different things going on in the glass that add up to more than the
sum of its parts. The nose is almost Bordeaux-like, with hints of
cedar, and the wine wears its few years of age very well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Marietta Old Vine Lot 24 from California, $14.99: Marietta has
made a name for itself as a winery that packs great value into
every bottle, and this nonvintage offering from a field blend of
several types of red-wine grapes (zinfandel, petite sirah,
carignanne, gamay) is no exception. Sturdy, with lots of backbone,
this newest release would drink well now with a hearty meal, but
could also improve with a couple of years of additional aging. If
you're lucky, you might find a few bottles of the Lot 23 around,
perhaps for $12.99, and it's every bit as good as the Lot 24.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1999 Georges Duboeuf Beaujolais Nouveau, from France, $9.69:
We mentioned this last week before tasting it, and were pleasantly
surprised. All of this year's nouveau wines from the Beaujolais
region are a cut above the nouveaus of the last few years, and
that's a welcome development, because interest in the
third-Thursday-in-November release of the just-fermented Gamay
grape juice seems to be on the wane. Duboeuf's version appears to
be the most widely available French nouveau and is at or near the
top of this year's crop, of which there are several. The wine is
fresh and grapy, but has a little more backbone than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Shew! Four continents, evenly split between the Northern and
Southern hemispheres, for what, $40 and change? Now if only we
could rack up frequent-flyer miles this way.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Call the insurance company, my
husband would say from time to time, after my wedding band walked
away from the nightstand one night. Jim thinks that a missing
object should be declared forever lost within, say, five seconds of
its disappearance. I take a much more hopeful view, preferring to
wait at least five years. This is not because I am the perennial
optimist of the pair. The difference is that I grew up with St.
Anthony, and Jim did not. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Up to 98,000 Americans are
killed each year due to medical errors in hospitals alone. That
number (more than double annual highway fatalities) does not count
all the other Americans who die due to medical errors committed
outside U.S. hospitals. American patients killed each year due to
medical errors likely is double the number of Americans killed in
the nine-year Vietnam War. Many more Americans are killed in
hospitals than in highway accidents. Try to ignore that fact.
(Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ I've finally figured out the
mystery of the personal, lengthy and, yes, often dull family
Christmas newsletters I've been getting by e-mail from Dan
Eggleston. Because of the wonders of e-mail, I've been receiving
old holiday newsletters from Eggleston for -- few months or so. But
until Saturday, when I messaged him back by e-mail to ask him about
these holiday newsletters, I didn't know who Eggleston is. Isn't
e-mail great? (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   WRESTLING-TOYS _ Step into the aisles of wrestling toys in local
stores and the lights seem to go just a bit dimmer. That's because
you're surrounded by black. You're surrounded by the glaring,
sinister faces of wrestling figures dressed as fiends. Psychotic
murderers. Death's heads. They reach out with hands that are too
big for their bodies, the better to strangle opponents. They even
snarl at you when you press their buttons. ``You cannot kill what
is already dead!'' bellows one World Wrestling Federation star in a
toy known as Wall Talker. Many of these toys are directly modeled
on shows that are rated TV-14 for violence and sexual innuendo. Yet
nearly all, including Wall Talker, are labeled ``for ages 4 and
up.'' (Hulbert, Cox News Service)

   WRESTLING-TOYS _ Step into the aisles of wrestling toys in local

you're surrounded by black. You're surrounded by the glaring,
sinister faces of wrestling figures dressed as fiends. Psychotic
murderers. Death's heads. They reach out with hands that are too
big for their bodies, the better to strangle opponents. They even
snarl at you when you press their buttons. ``You cannot kill what
is already dead!'' bellows one World Wrestling Federation star in a
toy known as Wall Talker. Many of these toys are directly modeled
on shows that are rated TV-14 for violence and sexual innuendo. Yet
nearly all, including Wall Talker, are labeled ``for ages 4 and
up.'' (Hulbert, Cox News Service)

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Call the insurance company, my
husband would say from time to time, after my wedding band walked
away from the nightstand one night. Jim thinks that a missing
object should be declared forever lost within, say, five seconds of
its disappearance. I take a much more hopeful view, preferring to
wait at least five years. This is not because I am the perennial

outside U.S. hospitals. American patients killed each year due to
medical errors likely is double the number of Americans killed in

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES:
 &HT;    Seventh in a series
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ Here I am in a town called Aix, as in
``X'' marks the spot, at a hotel named Le Pigonnet, as in ``Voila!
Here comes another of zee fat pigeons for us to pluck.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now I'm at the hotel bar, nursing a glass of the local
wine and trying to make friends, which is not so easy where there's
hardly any English spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my wife is in our room, nursing a headache, most
likely lying down with a cold washcloth on her forehead and the
drapes closed. Most definitely, the drapes are closed
</P>
<P>
   The room, on the third floor, looks out through French doors and
over a small balcony to a garden below. There are no rooms directly
across from ours. But if someone in the adjacent wing were to lean
out far enough ...
</P>
<P>
   Which was exactly what happened, my wife said, while I was in
the bathroom and she was reclining on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that she looked up just in time to see a gentleman of
Japanese appearance hanging from his hotel window and snapping away
with a camera focused in her direction.
</P>
<P>
   C'est ah so.
</P>
<P>
   So it was, all by myself, that I was sampling the Coteaux
d'Aix-en-Provence, what is considered the ``aco'' wine in the Cote
de Provence region. A-OK by me, as far as it goes. That's the
trouble with wine. It takes it awhile to get you where you're
going.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the fellow standing a few steps down the bar from me,
sipping Scotch and soda, no ice. Hollywood handsome, he was, almost
to the point of being pretty. Picture James Bond's sissy younger
brother. It didn't help that he was wearing an ascot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you from?'' I asked, friendly like.
</P>
<P>
   ``England,'' he replied, studious of his glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``What part?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``South,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I became intent on securing something more than an answer of a
single word. After all, that's my business - getting people to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Texas,'' I allowed, hooking a thumb in my belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bravo,'' he allowed, still not looking up.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cooper never said ``Yep'' with more finality.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help wondering, but refrained from asking, how'd he
like to try to finish his drink with that ascot shoved down his
throat.
</P>
<P>
   But why bother? It was a lovely evening in a lovely place, a
city of much history and great beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Aix, tourists are told, was founded as Aquae Sextiae in 112 BC
by the Roman conqueror Sextius Calvinius. In 45 BC, Caesar declared
Aix a colony. Thermal baths were developed around 15 BC from local
hot springs.
</P>
<P>
   But skipping ahead, in 1838 the painter Paul Cezanne was born in
Aix. Le Pigonnet was his country house, later converted to a hotel
and has been operated by the same family since 1924.
</P>
<P>
   Aix today boasts a population of some 150,000. Thanks to the
local university, young people fill the sidewalk restaurants and
book shops along tree-lined streets. Always, it seems, there is a
public fountain just around the next corner:
</P>
<P>
   The great fountain (1860) at La Rotonde in the Place General de
Gaulle ... the Fountain of 9 Cannons (1691) halfway up the Cours
Mirabeau avenue ... the Fontaine des Quatre Dauphins (1667) in the
Mazarin district.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Aix! A lovely place, a lovely evening. Indeed, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   Because! That's why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't suppose you have any tequila hid back there?'' I asked
the young bartender.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be in luck, monsieur,'' he said. Sure enough, reaching
back among the lower shelves, he produced a half-filled bottle.
``We don't sell much of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' I said. ``I don't drink much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   I had him pour a straight shot and then, per my instructions,
was provided with salt and a lime wedge.
</P>
<P>
   I hoisted the glass high, without so much as a glance toward the
Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's to Lafayette, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano
Roosevelt!'' I proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after barely managing to down it without choking, I added,
halfway under my breath for whoever might care to hear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Le bravo.''
</P>

CISCO TO OFFER MORE DETAILS ON WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new wireless technology is about to join the contest to
provide high-speed Internet connections to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, a leading Internet technology company, plans to
brief analysts and reporters on Wednesday about a new approach to
wireless communications that would be offered as soon as next year
to provide both voice telephone service and Internet access. The
technology is meant to be a nonmobile _ or fixed _ wireless
alternative to the telephone industry's high-speed digital phone
lines and to the cable television industry's Internet modems.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's briefing will offer the first detailed plans after an
announcement last month by the company, Motorola and 10 other
equipment makers and service providers that said they would create
an industry-standard format for sending Internet data over a
long-existing, little-used set of microwave frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   That frequency band, known as multichannel multipoint
distribution services, or MMDS, was set aside years ago for a form
of wireless subscription television that was meant to compete with
cable television but never really caught on. More recently, MMDS
has been seen as a way for telecommunications giants like Sprint
and MCI Worldcom to compete with the regional Bell operating
companies to provide direct connections to local telephone
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cisco and other equipment makers are trying to push MMDS
into a full-blown voice and Internet-access technology.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the MMDS frequencies requires licenses from the Federal
Communications Commission. But the commission has also set aside
wireless frequencies in a band called the Unlicensed National
Information Infrastructure. This second, unlicensed frequency band
is meant to encourage experimental uses of the airwaves without the
expense of buying or applying for licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cisco's technology will also work with this unlicensed
band, the company predicts that smaller Internet service providers
and communications companies will be able to quickly enter and
compete in the market for high-speed _ or broad band _ Internet
access at relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fixed broad-band wireless access will change the world of
telecommunications as profoundly as mobile telephony,'' said Dale
R. Pfau, a financial analyst at CIBC World Markets in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco executives predicted that consumers would be able to buy
broad band wireless transmitter-receivers _ known as transceivers _
for less than $500 by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Cisco-led alliance's plans is a new wireless
approach developed by a Silicon Valley designer, which deals with a
thorny problem known as ``multipath interference'' that has long
bedeviled communications engineers. At certain frequencies,
wireless communications systems must contend with echoes from
secondary signals that are reflected from buildings or hills and
that arrive at the receiver slightly after the original signals.
</P>
<P>
   Television broadcasts, for example, have long been plagued by
the phenomenon, commonly known as ghosting.
</P>
<P>
   The problem became an intriguing challenge to Greg Raleigh, a
longtime Silicon Valley engineer, who in the early 1990s returned
to Stanford University to study for an advanced degree. Raleigh
realized that with the vast amounts of computer power now available
to perform signal processing it would be possible to transform
multipath interference from a disadvantage into a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh knew that, besides ghosting, there is typically a second
drawback to fixed wireless communications: reliable transmissions
require a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the
receiver. That requirement poses special challenges to network
designers attempting to reach tens of thousands of receivers in an
urban area.
</P>
<P>
   But by using special encoding techniques, Raleigh reasoned, it
might be possible to offer reliable two-way communications that
would not require direct lines of site but would instead use
ghosting echoes as intentional signal paths rather than treating
them as unwanted interference.
</P>
<P>
   With two of his Stanford classmates, Raleigh founded a company,
Clarity Wireless, in an extra room in his home. There, they
developed his theory into a technology called vector orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, or VOFDM.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco acquired Clarity Wireless in 1998 and recently decided to
freely share its technology in an effort to quickly establish it as
an industry standard. So far, besides Motorola, Cisco has secured
commitments from Toshiba, Samsung, Texas Instruments and others to
help develop components of the broadband wireless infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's is not the only approach in the MMDS broad-band data
market, however. The company's wireless competitors will include
Spike Technologies, ADC Telecommunications and Adaptive Broadband.
But Cisco's prominence as an Internet technology vendor, along with
the powerful alliance it has built, could give the company an
inside edge, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real leader as yet, but Cisco has quite a strong
story,'' said Tim Luke, a financial analyst at Lehman Brothers in
New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, some telecommunications analysts point out that MMDS
occupies a relatively limited frequency band. That means, they say,
that communications carriers would need to set up a large number of
transmitters in order to subdivide a metropolitan area into
numerous cells to allow the same channels to be reused in different
parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco executives nevertheless contend that broad-band fixed
wireless technology can be a cost-effective alternative to cable
modems and digital phone lines in urban areas. As for rural areas,
Cisco says that broadband wireless will hold dramatic advantages
over traditional wired or fiber optic networks, which can be costly
ways to provide service in sparsely settled places.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Cisco alliance, if its technology proves viable,
will be in a position to compete for the many companies and
consumers that seem to have developed an insatiable appetite for
Internet data communications bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Service providers like Winstar, Nextlink and Teligent have
already developed a significant business providing so-called
point-to-point broad-band wireless communications in urban areas.
Those services permit corporations and buildings in urban areas to
bypass local telephone and fiber optic communications links and
connect directly to Internet providers or long-distance carriers or
to connect to another branch office in the same metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco intends to make these point-to-point customers the first
target for its new VOFDM technology. The company will soon begin
selling a high-speed wireless system that will permit companies to
extend communications between buildings over relatively short
distances.
</P>
<P>
   The point-to-point wireless microwave equipment market,
according to Pfau of CIBC World Markets, was about $2.56 billion in
1998 and is expected to grow to $5 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The more versatile point-to-multipoint market, which will
develop for consumer and commercial applications, is forecast to
grow to $3 billion in 2004 from less than $200 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh, of Cisco, said that he believed the Cisco technology
had a promising commercial future in part because of new radio
spectrum that will be made available for interactive data
applications.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, for example, there will soon be an auction for radio
spectrum at the 3.5 gigahertz frequencies. Meanwhile, in the United
States, the FCC plans to auction spectrum for interactive data in
the frequency band that until now has been used solely for
ultrahigh frequency, or UHF, television.

   He's back.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lessig, a 38-year-old Harvard professor and Internet
law expert, has been recruited for the Microsoft antitrust case
once again. When U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
prodded the two sides toward settlement talks and appointed a
mediator on Nov. 18, he also said he wanted Lessig to write a
friend-of-the-court brief on his behalf on the issue of
technological tying.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig was removed from the case last year, after serving three
months as a special master _ an outside expert with a broad
mandate. Microsoft had protested, saying Lessig had a ``clear
bias'' against the company. Without addressing the bias claim, an
appeals court removed Lessig, ruling that the case was not an
appropriate one for a special master. This time, Microsoft has not
yet said whether it will object to Lessig.
</P>
<P>
   Reached last week in Berlin, where he has a research fellowship,
Lessig said he was eager to weigh in on the subject of so-called
product tying, which he called ``the toughest issue in the case.''
Jackson asked him to write a 50-page paper on it.
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused Microsoft of tying its Internet
browser to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system, in
an illegal tactic to stifle competition. In his findings of fact on
Nov. 5, Jackson echoed the government's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   But antitrust experts say the tying issue could be vulnerable on
appeal, and that an appeals court in a related case last year said
Microsoft should be free to fold browsing software into Windows if
there was a ``plausible claim'' of consumer benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig isn't saying, but antitrust experts expect him to make
the intellectual case for taking software tying seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Code is law'' is the Lessig refrain. In his new book, ``Code
and Other Laws of Cyberspace'' (Basic Books), he suggests that the
technological architecture of software is an appropriate subject
for government scrutiny, though traditional regulation would be
misguided. ``My argument is not for some top-down form of
control,'' he writes. ``My claim is not that regulators should
occupy Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's views are difficult to dismiss as simply
anti-Microsoft. He gives more weight to the competition Microsoft
faces, for example, than did Jackson, who found that the Linux
operating system was a fringe technology and not likely to
challenge Microsoft anytime soon. ``By 1998,'' Lessig writes, ``it
had become apparent to all that Linux was an important competitor
to the Microsoft operating system.''

   LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YEAR 2000 CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Managers and technical experts working on year 2000 computing
projects are becoming increasingly optimistic, despite delays and
program weaknesses that ought to worry them, according to an
informal coalition of year 2000 analysts who have polled such
professionals in June, September and again this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K experts remain remarkably optimistic even though many of
them report they are not yet completely ready,'' said Edward
Yardeni, the Deutsche Bank economist who has predicted that year
2000 computer disruptions are likely to lead to a worldwide
recession next year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll results, which will be released today, show the
number expecting glitches in their own critical systems edging down
to 33 percent from 34 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 66 percent are confident the power will stay on, up
from 61 percent in September, and 64 percent expect no problems
with phones, up from 59 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, the more than 1,200 respondents are
slightly less inclined to stock up on food and cash than in
previous polls. And those who are doing so will put aside less than
they had planned in September or June.
</P>
<P>
   But such feelings are a triumph of ``hope and trust'' over
facts, according to Yardeni, who developed the poll with Gary
Beach, publisher of CIO magazine, and the Information Systems Audit
and Control Association, a trade group for professionals working on
quality control in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters said the disquieting responses included the 57
percent saying they were still working on year 2000 problems. In
the September poll, only 43 percent had expected to still be
trouble-shooting by now. And in this most recent poll, only 31
percent were far enough along to have actually tested contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters also noted that many repair projects had not been
independently tested and that respondents had relied heavily on
unverified assurances of readiness from suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The poll responses were gathered from Nov. 10-21. The results
are posted at www.peoplepolls.com.

<P>
   A SCHWAB MANAGER REVIEWS `Y2K: THE MOVIE'
</P>
<P>
   You had to be generously willing to suspend disbelief to accept
the plot of ``Y2K: The Movie,'' the recent NBC thriller in which
computing's millennium bug leads to industrial apocalypse and
triggers a nuclear meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   But last Monday, the day after the movie aired, a manager at
Charles Schwab&AMP; Co. rushed to calm the gullible.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail memo that day to some 140 employees, Kathy
Childers, a manager involved with Schwab's year 2000 preparedness
effort, assured employees the year 2000 movie ``would not be the
typical scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although no one knows exactly what will happen, I would like
to set your mind at rest that everything has been done to make
certain that the scenario you saw Sunday will NOT happen,'' Ms.
Childers wrote in her memo.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the note elicited a few derisive snorts from
the tech-savvy employees at San Francisco-based Charles Schwab, who
said they hadn't necessarily been hunkering down with canned goods
and armaments in anticipation of industrial Armageddon on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gable, a Schwab spokesman, said that, however Ms. Childers'
warning may have been perceived, she had intended it to have a
tongue-in-cheek tone _ even if the note did go on to discuss some
of the serious efforts Schwab has made to cope with year 2000
issues, like making contingency computer plans.
</P>
<P>
   The message invited employees of Schwab to Ms. Childers' office
to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   It then concluded, ``I would venture to say that if you are
prepared for an earthquake, then you are prepared for Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be small solace, of course, for anyone who has ever
seen the devastation nature wreaked on Los Angeles in the movie
``Earthquake.''

WEB SITES AND RECORDING LABELS AT IMPASSE ON FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing number of Web sites are offering customized music
programming _ song sets created in response to the personal tastes
of listeners. What the listeners are not hearing is a
behind-the-scenes dispute between the sites and major record
labels, in which tens of millions of dollars may be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The basic issue is how much these Web sites should reimburse
record labels each time they play recordings owned by the labels.
Months of discussions between trade groups representing the two
sides recently petered out, so the issue is set for arbitration
next year. Meanwhile, some Webcasters have been negotiating
individual royalty licenses with the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sites are permitted to continue playing music until
arbitration is completed, the issue may seem insignificant to the
growing number of Internet listeners. But the question may not be
so insignificant to investors in the Web sites, which include
Launch Media, NetRadio, SonicNet (owned by Viacom's MTV) and
Spinner.com (owned by America Online). The royalty fees paid to the
record industry ultimately could become a substantial business
expense.
</P>
<P>
   The stage for the royalty dispute was set in late 1998, when
Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. Like broadcast radio stations, Webcasters are
required to pay licensing fees to copyright owners through Ascap or
BMI, which collect royalties. But on the assumption that digital
distribution raises additional intellectual property issues because
it allows for high-quality copying, the new law requires Webcasters
to pay a licensing fee to record labels that is not required of
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The law did not set a rate for royalty payments by the Internet
companies but did provide for arbitration if the two sides could
not reach an agreement. Trade groups for both sides say the
negotiations, which began early this year, never went much beyond
exploratory talks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two sides are scheduled to file position papers next
month with a three-person arbitration panel to be appointed by the
U.S. Copyright Office. A request by the recording industry for a
deadline extension, filed last week, is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the discussions between individual Web sites
and record companies have said the royalty percentages being asked
by the labels range as high as 15 percent of a site's gross
revenues. Lobbyists for the Web sites say they are arguing for as
low as 1 to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are also open questions about how a Web site would even
measure revenue for purposes of royalty payments _ whether the
count would include advertising, transactions or subscription
revenue, or some combination of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Marks, senior vice president for business affairs for
the Recording Industry Association of America, which is
representing major record labels, declined to say what percentage
the industry hopes to secure in the arbitration process. But he
said the figure should reflect the music's value to the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're paying for the right to build a business using the
content that's been created by record companies and artists,''
Marks said
</P>
<P>
   The Web companies contend that they already are putting money in
the pockets of the recording industry because they are helping to
spur album sales. Further, the sites argue that the royalties
should only be paid on revenue directly related to the use of a
copyrighted song, such as from a banner advertisement displayed
while a song is played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paying for a performance right, we're not paying for the
right to be in business,'' said Jonathan Potter, director of the
Digital Media Association, a trade group that includes many of the
large music Webcasters. Potter said the recording industry had
approached individual Webcasters asking for 15 percent of gross
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   What both sides agree upon is that customized, Internet-based
``radio'' is a growing force. The concept is that Web sites poll
listeners for their music preferences, both artist and genre. The
sites then create hundreds of radio ``stations,'' each reflecting
the musical tastes of a narrow category of visitors to their sites.
The categories listed under Vintage Rock on Spinner.com, for
example, include British invasion, psychedelic and surf.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published two weeks ago indicates that online radio
listening is popular among college students. Webnoize, an online
publication covering the new media music industry, found that of
4,000 students surveyed, 63.4 percent were interested in Internet
radio for niche programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a great demand for these services,'' said
Joanne Marino, editor in chief of Webnoize, who said Web
communities like Yahoo or Geocities may find it necessary to add a
personalized radio component to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, from the Recording Industry Association of America, said
the record industry had signed many licensing deals with Webcasting
companies, but declined to provide a figure.
</P>
<P>
   The association provided the name of only one company with which
it had reached a deal: Musicmusicmusic Inc., which operates a
service called RadioMoi.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that agreement, Potter of the Digital Music Association
said he knew of no other such licensing deals. He contends that the
record industry wants to make it seem that more deals have been
signed to induce Webcasters to negotiate individually, rather than
as a group through arbitration.

DOMAIN IDENTITIES ERODE AS GROUPS CROSS DOT-SUFFIX LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID F. GALLAGHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that you could tell a lot about a Web site just by
looking at the letters after the ``dot'' in its address. But as
competition for prime Internet addresses intensifies, the most
popular dot suffixes for domain names _ .com, .net and .org _ are
losing the meanings they once had.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, .com was designated for businesses, while .net was
for groups or companies involved in network access to the Internet
and .org was associated with nonprofit organizations. But not
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since about two or three years ago, there is no distinction
between .com, .net and .org,'' said Christopher Clough, a spokesman
for Network Solutions, the largest Internet name registrar. ``It's
all up to the registrant and self-selection.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that the business of registering names has been opened
to competition, other registrars are all too happy to ignore the
informal rules to keep customers satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies wanting a snappy Web address that may no
longer be available in the popular .com category are pushing into
.org and .net territory. In other cases, major companies have
registered across the board to protect trademarks, and nonprofit
organizations, politicians and government agencies are going for
the cachet and easy recall of a .com address.
</P>
<P>
   Until last summer, when it lost its government-sanctioned
monopoly on .com, .net and .org registrations, Network Solutions
made most decisions about who should get which address. Clough said
that in the past the company informally reviewed new domain
registrations to verify that they were appropriate for a particular
category. But in 1995, as new registrations increased, he said, it
became clear that the screening practice was slowing down the
registration process too much. So the company stopped checking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Network Solutions encourages customers to register multiple
names to cover all three suffixes. ``Anyone may register Web
addresses in .com, .net, and .org,'' says the help section of the
company's Web site (www.networksolutions.com). ``In fact, the best
way to protect the uniqueness of your online identity and brands is
to register or reserve Web addresses in all of the top-level
domains.'' It may also be the best way for Network Solutions to
make money because it charges $35 a year for each name.
</P>
<P>
   This blurring of the lines can be confusing because Web surfers
often rely on suffixes for clues to the nature and source of a Web
site. The prospect of an unscrupulous commercial enterprise posing
as a nonprofit fund-raiser by using the .org domain, for example,
worries some experts _ even if there is no evidence yet of such
hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael M. Roberts, interim president and chief executive of
Icann _ the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,
the network's new governing body _ said the notion that .com, .net
and .org were now all the same was ``not a universally popular
view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Network Solutions started giving people names without
asking any of the old questions, things just got very muddy,''
Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, especially larger ones, have followed Network
Solutions' advice by covering all the domain-name bases. The
Coca-Cola Co., for example, has registered cocacola.org, coke.org
and coke.net _ all of which send surfers to Coke's home page,
www.coke.com.
</P>
<P>
   And many registrants who might have fit better into another
category have chosen .com addresses. A growing number of political
campaigns are taking this option, on the assumption that .com is a
better-known designation than the .org suffix that presidential
candidates used in the 1996 campaign. This year, many have selected
.com addresses, which they are promoting in their print and
broadcast advertising. The list includes georgewbush.com,
mccain2000.com, algore2000.com and billbradley.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on all the advertising that Yahoo and Amazon and
everyone else has done, .com has permeated the culture in a way
that .org has not,'' Lynn Reid, an Internet political strategist
who is a senior adviser to Bill Bradley's campaign, said.
</P>
<P>
   But with some .com addresses having sold for more than $1
million, and with nearly six million .com names already taken, some
businesses are opting for .net or .org addresses.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And a small Internet consulting firm outside Chicago was
confident enough in its choice of .org to make the address part of
its name: the Sitebuilder.org Co. Christopher Bickford, director of
technical services for Sitebuilder.org, said the company was
formerly called ZY Solutions. Then an employee stumbled across the
name sitebuilder.com, which is used by a German company, and
learned that the sitebuilder.org address was available.
</P>
<P>
   Bickford said some of the company's executives opposed the name
because of its nonprofit connotations. ``But the marketing guys and
the sales guys said, `Hey, Sitebuilder! People know what a site
builder is,''' Bickford said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said customers generally did not have problems with the
name. ``We don't represent ourselves as anything but a for-profit
company,'' Bickford said.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years, Joseph Butcher of Seattle has registered a
number of generic-sounding .org and .net names, including
books.org, auction.net, travel.org and computers.org, which he said
he planned to use for either nonprofit or commercial ventures.
Already he has set up a Web site called surplus.net, which is run
as a nonprofit trade association for companies in the
surplus-materials business, which share marketing costs and a
central Web directory. He makes his money by operating the site and
charging the members for services like the designing of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Using any of his .org names in this way would be ``reasonably
true'' to the perception that .org is for nonprofits, he said. But
Butcher, who described himself as ``an old Net guy from way back,''
said he would no longer be opposed to using .org names for strictly
commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone likes the direction the trend is flowing.
Richard Forman, president and chief executive of Register.com, one
of the new registrars of domain names, said that most people still
assume that .org denotes a nonprofit. That is why he contends that
a company using a .org address ``is misleading the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Network Solutions Web site, Register.com suggests
registering a name across the three main domains. But the site's
help pages also list the ``basic rules'' for the various suffixes,
noting for example that .org is recommended for not-for-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Though use of .com, .net and .org is now a free-for-all, the
registration of addresses with some other suffixes is still tightly
controlled. Some countries, for example, are strict about handing
out addresses bearing their two-letter country codes. In Japan, for
instance, an organization or company can register only one .jp
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, .mil is reserved for the military, .gov is
for federal government sites and .edu is for colleges and
universities and other schools. But that has not stopped government
agencies and branches of the military from getting .com addresses
for sites intended to attract the public. Workers at the U.S.
Postal Service have e-mail addresses ending in usps.gov. But the
Postal Service promotes usps.com as its Web address and sells
stamps at Stampsonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the Army has a recruiting site at goarmy.com. Gary Bishop,
Web administrator for the Army Recruiting Command in Fort Knox,
Ky., said the address, which appears in broadcast and print
advertising, was chosen by an advertising agency. ``The .com gave
it more of an advertising flavor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Icann, the Internet governing body, plans early next year to
discuss proposals for new domains, like .firm and .arts, Roberts,
the group's president, said. One question will be whether to keep
the new categories closed, forcing applicants to meet certain
qualifications. But Roberts said it was unlikely that there would
be a move to enforce or encourage any such rules for existing
domains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse has gone from the barn on .com, .net and .org,''
Roberts said.

 &HT;    For E-tailers, shopping season already a success
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only five days into the official holiday shopping
season and online retailers are already reporting record numbers of
shoppers and dwindling supplies of the season's hottest gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping products in stock and providing customer service to
millions of first-time Web shoppers is an uphill battle for
retailers that not every e-commerce site will be able to win in the
war for the $6 to $8 billion consumers are expected to spend online
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holiday shopping will not be problem free, but it does beat
the mall,'' says Jupiter Communications analyst David Schatsky.
``Some sites like JCrew and Toys 'R Us spent a lot of money getting
their houses in order,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Schatsky says the hordes of online shoppers means an increased
number both people accessing the sites and increased orders, which
means the potential for technology failures and shipping foul-ups
are a lot higher than they were last year. He says the biggest
problems consumers are likely to see will be in order delivery not
in accessing the the sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Schatsky's predictions are already evident on several
retailing sites. Several e-tailers have already run out of some of
this season's top-selling items. The Toys 'R Us Web site already
has a caveat on its homepage warning holiday shoppers that many
items advertised on the site might not be available. Many sites
have also run out of Pokemon, the hot Nintendo game and trading
card phenomena, items.
</P>
<P>
   Toy stores running out of toys isn't unusual online or offline
at Christmas, but Bluefly.com, an discount online clothing store
has already run through its stock of trendy pashmina shawls.
Pashmina is a combination of cashmere blended with silk.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bluefly founder and CEO Ken Seiff says that running out
of hot items is the nature of his business. ``We are an off-price
retailer.'' We sell last of season products from 250 designers at
up to 75 per cent off. Sometimes, you get a very limited quantity
of great products. So we sell out of products very frequently and
are continually replenishing with new items.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly's pashmina wraps were selling for $79, much lower than
retail prices of $200 to 400. Seiff says because of the item's
popularity Bluefly opted not to replace it and expects it to be
back in stock late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Even while struggling with sold-out pashmina, Seiff says
business is up 700 per cent over the Friday, Saturday and Sunday
following Thanksgiving Day last year. Like most of online
retailers, Seiff says everything this holiday season depends on
state-of-the-art technology and customer service. ``We upgraded our
hardware and customer service two weeks ago,'' he says. ``We
wouldn't have made it out of the weekend and held up under the
traffic without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic and spending was up at almost every online retailer.
Portal site Yahoo said transaction volume in its shopping and
auction area was up more than 400 per cent Friday from the same day
last year. Yahoo also said that in the 10 days preceding the
so-called ``Black Friday'' Yahoo shopping processed more orders
than during the entire 1998 holiday season. The most requested
items were Pokemon toys, cards and games for kids.
</P>
<P>
   America Online reports that spending over the Thanksgiving
weekend nearly tripled over last year and the number of shoppers
using AOL was 2.5 times higher than last year. Spokeswoman Wendy
Goldberg says AOL shoppers are buying toys, apparel, flowers and
sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People this year are expecting more from online shopping,''
says Goldberg. ``It's out of the experimental phase. They want
great customer service, great tools like search and
personalization. They also want great graphics so they know what
they are buying.''

   As the holidays approach, shopping for gifts and festive meals
becomes a major undertaking for many people. Just about everyone
knows what it is like to leave a store laden with shopping bags,
and since few do their holiday shopping with a backpack, a wheeled
cart or a valet, the plastic handles on those bags often end up
creating new indentations in fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mentken, a New York inventor, thinks shops and stores
should make it possible for customers to walk out with the weight
of their purchases evenly distributed across their shoulders. He
has patented a shopping bag that has back pack straps instead of
handles.
</P>
<P>
   Mentken's bag is built like a conventional grocery or shopping
bag. It is made of heavy paper, squared, with a flat bottom. It
opens to one big compartment. Called BakSak, it folds and unfolds
in the traditional fashion, and weighs about four ounces.
</P>
<P>
   But the bag has straps that are woven through the lip around the
opening. The straps project from one of the long sides of the
opening and extend in a half-loop to the bag bottom, where they are
secured with fasteners. The straps are flat and adjustable. A
cashier can put purchases into the bag and then shoppers can slip
their arms through the straps and hoist the bags onto their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Mentken believes that merchants should like his shopping bags
even more than the ones now in use because the bags will raise
their logos and brand names to eye level. Shoppers all over the
country could become walking advertisements with department store
and designer label bags on their backs. And their hands will be
free for more shopping. Mentken won patent 5,957,354.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SOFTWARE DETERMINES COPYRIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Copyright Office no longer requires that material be
registered in order to gain copyright protection. Placing a
copyright symbol or notice on a written work, art work or
photograph, for example, serves the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But in the electronic age, when original works can be wholly
reproduced with the press of a computer key or the click of a
mouse, people who have created singular sites on the Internet
sometimes want greater reassurance that their compositions are
safeguarded against copying.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Glogau, a Nanuet, N.Y., inventor has patented a software
program that evaluates the contents of a Web site and yields the
relevant registration forms for the U.S. Copyright Office.
</P>
<P>
   Glogau's software examines a site's structure and its features,
such as text, graphics or photographs, to determine what type of
work category each falls into. It accomplishes this by looking at
``tags'' on Web site files and file extensions _ the kind of codes
that identify, for example, whether a file contains a photograph.
The software then decides whether the registration form should be
accompanied by a printed copy of the Web site features involved.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking down the site, the software asks the user whether
he wants to register each feature individually. The user can also
choose to include each component in the registration of the entire
site as one copyrighted entity. Glogau received patent 5,983,351.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.learn2.com _ The current Encyclopedia Brown of the Web,
learn2.com can help you with just about anything you'd want to
learn about, from roasting a turkey to serving as someone's best
man at a wedding. The guides on the site are clear, informative and
fun to read. Check it out and learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   www.dummies.com _ The folks behind the popular ``Dummies'' books
have cobbled together a site that takes the mystery out of not only
the high-tech world but also cooking, gardening, exercise and a
host of other subjects. Adding a daily comic strip to the mix,
dummies.com is for smarties like you.
</P>
<P>
   www.howto.yahoo.com _ If anybody knows how to find stuff on the
Internet, it's Yahoo, the most-used directory of sites on the
Internet. Yahoo's how-to guide covers the basics of Web surfing. It
starts with the reassuring message: ``Welcome to the Web. We're
glad you're here.'' A good place to start if you're new to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   www.ask.com _ Ask Jeeves is supposed to be a kind of Internet
butler _ you ask a question and without hesitation Jeeves brings
you the answer. While the site doesn't always bring back exactly
what you're looking for, Ask Jeeves is the place to go when you
want to learn something basic, such as ``Where can I find a map of
Antarctica?'' A slightly different approach to the search engine,
you might get lucky and learn a thing or two from old Jeeves.

 &HT;    Ergonomic keyboard odd, may be useful
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outfit called Goldtouch has sent me its new
``advanced ergonomic system,'' which includes a keyboard, a mouse,
a mousepad, two wrist rests and a separate numeric keypad.
</P>
<P>
   It's making me seasick.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is hinged in the middle. You can splay the two
sides out. You can also raise the middle of it. Once you have it
just the way you want it, you can lock the whole thing down
securely.
</P>
<P>
   My problem is that I never learned to type properly. I taught
myself, and my technique often involves a little cross-handed work.
Try that on a split keyboard and see what it gets you. I commonly
go for the B key with my right forefinger, and with this keyboard I
keep sticking it into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   To make the keyboard smaller, Goldtouch dispensed with the
right-side keypad and uses a function key to turn the letter keys
on the right half into numeric ones. If that bothers you, you can
get the keypad.
</P>
<P>
   They've also moved the delete key clear to the left corner of
the keyboard, which really flummoxes me.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse is a two-button affair shaped like a buffalo with a
bad list to starboard. It is rather light, but works fine, although
I was never able to properly install its software.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is quite heavy and has a good touch. The mousepad
sticks to the desktop, has a slight slope to the right and has the
distinction of being the only mousepad I've seen that comes with a
user's manual.
</P>
<P>
   The manual goes on about things like splay, ulnar deviation,
lateral inclination and pronation. It also warns that the keyboard
is not intended for purposes such as controlling nuclear facilities
or weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't do things like that, and you have problems with
your ergs, take a look at it. It seems reasonably priced at $219.
More info:www.goldtouch.com.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYFUL MOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Logitech's new Wingman Gaming Mouse, so far as I know, is the
first mouse oriented toward game-playing. Just what makes it a
gaming mouse, other than advertising and the inclusion of a
Japanese game of no particular distinction, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sturdy, handsome mouse, gray in color, and of course,
being from Logitech, it has three buttons. It has a shape
distinctly different from two-button Microsoft mice.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the functions of the device are adjustable through
software. One, however, is not, and that is the sensitivity of the
buttons. Perhaps they are so hair-trigger because this is a Gaming
Mouse, or perhaps I'm just heavy-handed. When I sweep the cursor
across the screen, I leave a trail of menus and dialog boxes
flashing along behind.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the buttons are too easily depressed, both in and out of
games. Otherwise, it's dandy.

 &HT;    Online buying is out of line for some products, services
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All the talk about the online revolution is still
mostly that ... talk. It might be nice to know you can buy a car
from a Web site. But most people still like to do it the old way.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Yahoo Internet Life has a recurring feature called
Old Way/Net Way that puts the Internet to the test. The idea is to
take a task _ like buying a book _ and determine if it is easier to
do on the Internet or the traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue's version of the feature takes a look at
three things: securing a home loan, finding Pokemon stuff and
buying dog food.
</P>
<P>
   The home loan search was a wash. Both methods were relatively
simple. But it took the author a while longer to qualify for the
loan Internet-style.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to find Pokemon is online, where the price and
selection are better than in stores, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
   Dog food is best hunted the old way. The author saved more than
$10 on a 40-pound bag. The shipping costs for heavy items negated
any online cost or time savings.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also asks people what the future holds for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In that article, ever-present attorney Alan Dershowitz offers
his thoughts on the future of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today every handful of haters is integrally linked to every
other handful,'' Dershowitz wrote. ``Together they form a dangerous
network of potential terrorists capable not only of inspiring one
another but also of working in a coordinated matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Film critic Roger Ebert weighs in on what the next millennium's
censorship might include, which is, apparently, very little: ``Is
the regulation of the Internet possible? The practical answer is
`no.'''
</P>
<P>
   BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   The dwindling amount of customer service in the real world
apparently is alive and well on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   A study from Jupiter Communications said more Web sites are not
responding to their customers' e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly study sends e-mails requesting simple support to
125 Web sites in five categories _ content, consumer brands,
travel, retail and financial services. Of those, 46 percent took at
least five days to respond, never responded or didn't have an
e-mail address available on the site. In the same period last year,
38 percent of the sites failed to respond in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping sites were a bit better. More than half the sites
tested responded within one day. But 40 percent took at least five
days, up from 28 percent in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite Web ventures' claims last year that they were going to
focus on customer service as a primary investment and implement
major advances in automated assistance packages, the state of
online customer service continues to decline,'' said Cormac Foster,
a Jupiter analyst. ``Many Web ventures are ignoring the opportunity
to communicate with existing and potential customers, discouraging
brand loyalty and opting out of a user-initiated, one-to-one
relationship by delaying, eliminating or not offering responses to
e-mail. ``
</P>
<P>
   SCORE ONE FOR JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs finally beat Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Upside magazine lists ``the people who
really matter most,'' a ranking of the 100 most influential people
in the digital world. Jobs, co-founder, chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, heads the list, followed by Microsoft
Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 is rounded out by AT&AMP;T Chairman and Chief Executive
Michael Armstrong; Masayoshi Son, founder, president and chief
executive of Softbank; John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco
Systems; Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who now heads Vulcan
Ventures, an increasingly influential venture capital fund; John
Doerr, a partner in the granddaddy of all venture firms, Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers; Lou Gerstner, head of IBM; David
Wetherell, who runs CMGI, which owns search engines Lycos and
AltaVista; and Scott McNealy, co-founder, chairman and chief
executive of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Betty, president and chief executive of EarthLink, which is
set to merge with Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises, ranked
36th.

 &HT;    Pirating music files problematic for record companies, schools
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Record stores haven't gotten much business from
one 23-year-old University of Dayton senior lately _ and he may
never give them a penny more.
</P>
<P>
   He gets his music free from the Internet. Using the university's
high-speed computer lines, he and his friends download songs known
as MP3 files from web sites that post them illegally. He says his
roommate has built a trove of 2,000 songs, and that he has created
his own compact discs from Internet music.
</P>
<P>
   ``About everyone I know does it,'' says the senior. ``I know
people who are filling up their hard drives (with pirated music).''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a 21st century headache for college administrators.
Schools have invested millions to create cutting-edge computer
infrastructures, opening new frontiers of research and learning.
However, those same networks have made it easy for students to
trample copyright protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Untold thousands of digital, CD-quality music files are floating
across the World Wide Web. Some are offered by their creators, who
hope to spur interest in their work by giving away a sample. But
many are copied and traded illegally, depriving musicians and
record companies of money that, according to the Recording Industry
Association of America, is probably exponentially greater than the
$1 million a day lost from bootleg tapes and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an Internet connection can download these files, but
cyber-swiping appears to be especially rampant on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got young people with free time, lots of access, and
they're curious,'' says Barbara Deschapelles, a network
administrator at UD. ``It's kind of a climb the mountain thing:
`What can I get away with?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Dormitories and computer labs at UD, Wright State University,
Sinclair Community College and Antioch use network connections that
are up to 200 times faster than the 56k modems standard on home
computers. That means instead of taking a half hour to download a
5-minute MP3 song, students can do it in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Once they store a song on their computers, they can play it
whenever they like. They also can put it on their personal Web
sites for others to copy.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually how students are caught with pirated music.
Recording industry agents constantly search for web sites that
illegally post copyrighted songs, notifying colleges when such
material is on their networks. That has happened four times at UD
over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Those nabbed with bootlegged music can lose network access and
suffer other penalties, such as fines or community service. But
such busts, rare to begin with, may soon become nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they rarely put MP3s on their Web pages these days.
They usually store the music on their computers' hard drives, which
cannot be accessed by Internet snoopers.
</P>
<P>
   They swap tunes using e-mail and Zip disks, or, in the case of
students at Wright State, through private networks accessible to a
limited number of people. One 18-year-old freshman says that has
allowed him to quickly build a huge collection of MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have almost 1 gigabyte, and that's probably over 10 hours,
probably around a couple of hundred songs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators say they're aware of the vast MP3
exchanges on campus, but maintain there's little they can do about
it. They don't know what students have on their computers unless
they spot a guilty Web site or get tipped off by a foolish action
(one UD student was caught when he tried to send an e-mail
containing a whopping 100MB of MP3s; the transmission failed,
giving technicians a copy of the message).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to spread the word that this is illegal and
people are being caught,'' said UD's Deschapelles. `` ... Most
people probably aren't thinking. I think if they did, it would
occur to them that it was illegal and immoral. It's theft of ideas
and theft of property.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes as news to one 20-year-old UD junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal?'' he says. ``That definitely changes things.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his housemates have hooked a computer loaded with 1,500
MP3 files to a sound system, using it to supply the music during
parties. They also burn songs onto recordable CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The junior says MP3 search engines and television commercials
for products such as CD burners made him think downloading bootleg
music was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's such a new thing that people haven't gotten used
to it being illegal,'' he says. ``It's like, `I never have to go to
Best Buy again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other students, well aware that they are stealing music, have
mixed feelings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, I think we should be able to do it, because
it's our freedom,'' says an 18-year-old Wright State freshman.
``But I'm in a band. I think, `What if we eventually put out a CD
and everyone copied it?' That thought is there, and to be honest,
it probably is hurting the music business.''
</P>
<P>
   UD and Wright State are rewriting their computer ethics
guidelines to be more specific about copyright violations, and both
vow to increase their educational efforts and punish those they
find with illegal files. Meanwhile, the recording industry is
trying to establish a new standard for digital music that will
ensure security.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s, however, are not the final frontier of piracy. Bootleg
software programs and digitized, full-length movies are showing up
on some university networks. UD administrators recently caught one
student offering several downloadable films on his computer,
including one that is still in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the huge movie files download slowly, even
on super-fast networks, and don't run smoothly. That discourages
many students from pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth it,'' says the UD senior. ``Not yet anyway.''

 &HT;    Great game gifts
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Deck the halls, light the menorah, jingle the
bells and have a happy Kwanzaa. It's holiday time, and that means
two things: 1) a temporal joy and peace in the world and 2) rampant
consumerism. While we can't help on the first item, we're all about
the second one. And here is the ultimate wish list for your tiny
anklebyter.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the ultimate object of his or her desire _ anything
Pokemon. The cards and stuffed animals are sure to be popular, but
think of the look on that little tyke's face when you bust out
Hasbro's interactive Pokemon Pikachu Plush ($10, www. pokemon.com).
The Pikachu is interactive in that you squeeze its hands and it
says the word that drives the kids wild, Pikachu! Also, its cheeks
glow red.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the list is Barbie. We know. Barbie used to be a WASPY,
disproportionate sex symbol who made little girls feel inadequate
if they didn't have a tiny waist and huge breasts and date a guy
named Ken. But Barbie has changed. Granted, she's still most of
those things. The difference can be found in Mattel's Working Woman
Barbie ($30, www. mattel.com). That's right, Barbie has gone to
work and she wants to talk all about it. With a touch of a button,
the day-job Barbie says lots of cool things like: ``I have
e-mail!'' ``I love going to work!'' and ``I can't wait to go
dancing with Ken tonight!'' Working Woman Barbie comes equipped
with a laptop, cell phone and a CD-ROM that enables you to design
your own stationery and do lots of other cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done playing your own holiday games and checking
your e-mail for electronic greetings, install Michelle Kwan Figure
Skating ($30, www.ea.com, for PC) for her. In this game, would-be
figure skaters can create their own skaters (they can even use
their own photo and paste it on the character), design a routine,
land triple lutzes and take snapshots of the results. It scores
about a 5.7.
</P>
<P>
   While she's playing with Barbie and spinning Michelle Kwan, he
should be playing with his pal, 2000. Toy Biz's My Pal 2000 ($40,
1-800-634-7539) will surely be a hit this holiday season. This
14-inch handy robot and trusting pal pitches tiny foam balls for a
mini baseball game, plays interactive games with its owner and acts
as a sentry ``guarding'' a child's room from nosey siblings. Along
those lines is Tiger Electronics' new Furby Baby ($25, www.tiger
toys.com). You've met the parents, now meet a chattering younger
generation of Furbies. The Furby babies have 25 percent more
vocabulary and the programmers have added more games and the
ability to insert a pacifier when the Furby gets fussy (and it will
get fussy).
</P>
<P>
   Back on the PC, it's time for Disney's Villains' Revenge _ an
inspired set of games that works on both PCs and Macs. Run the
two-disc CD-ROM and let the kids go to town. The game, in which
Jiminy Cricket guides you through fixing seven classic Disney
stories including Dumbo and Peter Pan, is an animated treat that's
fun, gorgeously animated and easy to play.($30, www.
disneyinteractive.com)
</P>
<P>
   If your little one is more into the console side of things, you
shouldn't miss getting him or her either Universal's Spyro the
Dragon: Ripto's Rage ($50, www.universal.com, for the Playstation)
or Sony's Umjammer Lammy ($50, www.playstation. com, for the
Playstation). This is the second Spyro and he is better than ever.
This game looks better, plays faster and will keep your child more
mesmerized than the last one. And then there's Umjammer Lammy. What
can you say about Umjammer? This game is from the same bent minds
that brought you Parappa the Rapper. Only this time you're trying
to get Umjammer and her band MilkCan to the gig on time. Trust us.
It's great.
</P>
<P>
   Though we can't guarantee your children will have a merry
whatever, we can assure you that, with all these gifts in front of
them, they'll be so busy playing that they won't have time to
complain until the next holiday.

 &HT;    There'll always be an England, a fine place to snag unique gifts
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The British are coming! The British are coming!
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, the British are here, selling everything from
books to breakfast tea on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered the wonders of British shopping at the most
American of Web retailers, Amazon.com. I was hoping to buy several
copies of the new Bridget Jones novel for gifts, only to find the
book hadn't been published in the United States. However, Amazon,
superstore that it is, always adds related music, video or auction
categories that complement whatever product you are looking up.
Scrolling down the page, I saw that the Bridget Jones book was
available on Amazon's auction site. Fifty copies of ``Bridget
Jones: The Edge of Reason'' were available from a San Diego seller
with a top bid of $32. ``Just published abroad!'' the description
trumpeted, ``but you can get it now!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm ready to bid online for vintage Madame Alexander dolls
and Kentucky Derby memorabilia, but there is absolutely no way I'm
going to bid on a book that was published just last month. Then it
hit me: Why not go straight to the source?
</P>
<P>
   Among the many offerings Amazon has is a British branch at
www.amazon.co.uk. Before you could say ``Buckingham Palace,'' I was
on Amazon's British site, and guess what? It had plenty of copies
of ``The Edge of Reason'' in stock. In fact, it was Amazon.co.uk's
best-selling book that week. Another quick click, and I found the
book was available immediately. The cost to U.S. shoppers including
shipping was about $20, less than the asking price from the
California auctioneer. Needless to say, several copies are now
winging their way to my home in plenty of time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I was also hoping to order several paperback volumes of the
popular Harry Potter children's books not yet available in the
United States, but Amazon.co.uk only permits one copy of any Harry
Potter book per U.S. address _ lest they turn up on some online
American auction block, one would imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Smug from my initial success in the international Internet
shopping arena, I've been surfing and browsing some of England's
best-known merchants in search of offbeat holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   For unusual and classy gifts, make an online visit to Harrods
(www.Harrods.com), England's most famous department store. Harrods
knows that American shoppers still make up the bulk of online
shoppers and has done a lot to make them feel at home. This
includes everything from the ``.com'' address instead of the
unfamiliar ``.co.uk'' address to pricing items and shipping costs
in U.S. dollars. The range of items is limited but well-chosen and
gives American shoppers the flavor of what the British store is all
about. Shoppers can order everything from cashmere cardigans to
elaborate food baskets, a Harrods' millennium watch, and teddy
bears and other gifts for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Hamley's, Britain's answer to FAO Schwarz, has a delightful Web
site (www.hamleys.com) that captures the magic of a really, really
big, wonderful toy store, with amusing toys and games for kids and
families. A shopping guide helps select toys by age, price range
and other factors, with surprisingly good results. Pricing is
available in U.S. dollars for American customers.
</P>
<P>
   For home design and accessories and maybe a gift for yourself,
there's no place like Liberty of London
(www.liberty-of-london.com). Known for centuries for its
distinctive patterns that cover everything from wallpaper to
scarves, stationery and umbrellas, the company makes just looking a
treat. Prices are in British currency, with American prices listed
``for comparison only.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some things to keep in mind if you do decide to shop
from international merchants, aside from the usual privacy and
security requirements. Not all merchants provide prices in U.S.
dollars. So to make sure you know just how much you're spending,
use an online currency converter such as J.B.'s Currency Converter
(www.yi.com/home
</P>
<P>
   /BerensJean-Claude/currency
</P>
<P>
   .htm).
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to forget the ``world'' in the phrase ``World
Wide Web.'' However, an international online shopping trip can
yield wonderful surprises.

 &HT;    Atlanta steps up chase for tech capital
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta is not Silicon Valley when it comes to finding
venture capital for start-up computer and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is doing much better at attracting high-tech
investors than several years ago. Or so says the latest issue of
Digital South magazine. It features a cover story on the South's
new ``holy rollers'' _ the so-called angel investors helping
start-up Internet and computer companies in Atlanta and the rest of
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Meet some of the companies leading the way in harnessing digital
technologies to cut costs and streamline operations. They are
featured in the cover story of the December issue of PC Computing.
The results of the magazine's survey may surprise you, for many of
the companies mentioned are neither involved with the Internet nor
computers. Among the entities featured are REI, McKesson HBOC,
Catalog.com, Webcor Builders and the Nature Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If the rate of the new games being released for it is an
indicator, Sega's Dreamcast video console must be doing well.
There's a new title announced almost every week. The latest is
``Touring Car Challenge.'' The game is a simulation of British
touring-car racing. There are seven modes of play, eight teams to
drive for and a network play option for those with an Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Another new Dreamcast game is ``Sega Sports NBA 2K.'' Developed
by Visual Concepts for Sega, this professional basketball game has
realistic-looking players and fans. Graphics are so detailed you
can even see players' eyes blink. The game includes replicas of all
current National Basketball Association teams, their arenas and
playbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Keep up with college basketball at the official site of the
NCAA. The site offers information on all the teams and ways for you
to customize a page to track your favorite team. Merchandise for
sale and a page for kids are also featured. You'll find this site
at www.ncaabasketball.net.

 &HT;    E-cards perfect for the forgetful
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It never fails on a holiday. There were people _
people you care about _ whom you forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the turkey reduced to sandwiches, it's time to make
amends.
</P>
<P>
   That's where electronic greeting cards come in.
</P>
<P>
   They are out of the ordinary and clever, but _ better yet _ they
arrive instantly. After all, you don't have any time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a site called Blue Mountain at www
</P>
<P>
   .bluemountain.com/. It's probably the largest electronic
greeting card site on the Web and has plenty of cards to choose
from.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to add music (there's a good selection) and pick
from sentiments that range from sticky sweet to downright
businesslike. Of course, as with most of these sites, you can also
customize your message.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neat features of this site is the ability to send
cards in severallanguages, including Japanese. Now that the world _
largely thanks to the Internet _ is a smaller family, the ability
to send messages tailored to other cultures is a real plus.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're really international, you should check out
the Digital Postcard at www.all-yours.net/program
</P>
<P>
   /start20?write. If you thought it was neat to be able to send a
card in Japanese, just wait until you see the language selection
there. Maybe if you send your card saying in Arabic or Turkish,
they'll be so distracted that they will forget all about your
social lapse.
</P>
<P>
   The cards at this site can really be customized, and there's
also a database of more than 1,000 photos if you want to get fancy.
You can also include a link to a Web page with your card. If you
have your own Web site, you'll be able to add personal photos. You
can also upload a music or voice file.
</P>
<P>
   One site that is gaining in popularity is called Regard.Com at
www.regards.com/. Like some of the other sites, you can use your
own photos and images here. But one of the real pluses is the
unique animated cards that are available on this site.
</P>
<P>
   Some are so elaborate that they're very much like sending a tiny
cartoon to your friends.
</P>
<P>
   Since one of the card categories here is based on the seasons of
the year, perhaps you can send your friends a card celebrating fall
and forget about Thanksgiving altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow trends on the Internet and the Web know that
Amazon.com wants to become the one stop for almost everything on
the Web _ with its new hardware section, literally including the
kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   So you won't be surprised to learn that you can also find
electronic greeting cards there.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you be surprised to learn that these are some of the
best cards on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about animation earlier, but some of these cards have
animated photos, not cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   It's well worth a visit over to cards.amazon.com to see what is
available.
</P>
<P>
   A site called Digital Greetings hangs its hat on the ability to
make a custom card. This Web page is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .digitalgreetings.com/create
</P>
<P>
   .html. Creating a card is a step-by-step process, and even for
slow learners, it's pretty simple. You pick out illustrations,
headlines and colors, and finally you end up with a card that you
created yourself.

 &HT;    Failures are possible Jan. 1 _ just like on any other day
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have a basement, but it is not filled with bottled
water (one gallon per person per day); nor is there any
freeze-dried food (I favor the beef stroganoff); and the only thing
down there that resembles a firearm is an old soldering gun.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should feel guilty. Or at least get with the program.
Lately I've watched serious-sounding people on TV advise me on what
I should store to be safe when the world ends because of the Y2K
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   All these shows seem to operate with the same script. First, I
am assured that it is foolish to worry. The public relations folks
_ all with nice hair _ from the electric, phone and water companies
tell me that all will be fine. Then these same people start talking
about pouring water into old plastic Coke bottles. It brings back
memories of fallout shelters and the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think there will be a disaster in the United States from
Y2K. But like the experts I see on television, I can't write out an
ironclad guarantee that I'm correct. Some smart people agree with
me; some smart people disagree. So you'll have to decide for
yourself how much to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Today I think I can serve you best by telling you what does
worry me about the Y2K hysteria. Unlike my opinion on how serious
the problem is, I can look you in the eye and tell you that what
you're about to hear is both important and true.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with the fact that almost everyone has heard of Y2K.
And there are movies and books that paint apocalyptic pictures of
what it will bring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the serious attempts on television and in print
to explain Y2K in a fair and honorable way. That means that _ even
in these fair reports _ all the possibilities, including worst-case
scenarios, are explained.
</P>
<P>
   So you have a population that has at least heard about some of
the things that can go wrong. Some of them are like you _ smart,
informed and calm. And there are some idiots, too, the folks who
have been storing guns in the basement along with the basmati rice
and Coke bottles full of water.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if you will the panic that will result if the power goes
out on New Year's Eve, or the day before. Or if one of these people
picks up the telephone to order a pizza and is met by silence. My
gosh a'mercy, it's the end of the world. Grab the Colt and feed in
a clip, lock the doors, and watch the neighbor a few houses down
closely ... he's always seemed odd.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's what scares me.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that somewhere in Atlanta, somewhere in most
major cities, there will be lights that are out on New Year's Eve;
there will be phones that don't work, gas service that is
interrupted and water that doesn't flow.
</P>
<P>
   Any time you try to provide these essential services to a few
million people every hour of every day, there will be outages.
Stuff breaks. Cars hit utility poles. Switches fail. Humans make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens on a typical day, people get annoyed. But when
it happens on New Year's Eve or the next day _ and, like I said, it
will happen somewhere, maybe to you _ I worry that the result could
make the hysteria from the ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast
seem mild.
</P>
<P>
   So _ and I'm kidding, but just a little _ maybe you should spend
New Year's Eve in your basement with the doors locked. I think
you'll be completely safe from glitches caused by the utilities
(besides, even if I'm wrong, it's a fact that humans can live for
hours on end without running water, electricity or telephones). But
I do think that _ given the hysteria _ the basement would be a
terrific place to see in the New Year.

 &HT;    CD kit removes scratches
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``We get calls from people all the time who are
surprised that Wipe Out actually works,'' said Marc Guest, CEO of
the company that manufactures the Wipe Out! CD Repair Kit. ``It's
pretty sad, but people aren't used to products that do exactly what
they claim to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out, a product of the Esprit Development Corp. in
Flemington, N.J., promises to remove scratches from compact discs
and CD-ROMs. The company offers a money-back guarantee if Wipe Out
fails to permanently repair discs as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Guest supplied Cox Newspapers with a Wipe Out sample, and it
worked quite well. It corrected the performance of one consistently
balky CD-ROM and removed a scratch from an intentionally damaged
music CD.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Wipe Out a kit is a bit of a stretch. What actually
comes in the box are instructions, a soft cloth and a bottle of
polishing liquid.
</P>
<P>
   To repair a CD, the user shakes up the polishing liquid and
applies a drop or two to the damaged CD. The user then places the
CD on a hard, flat surface and rubs the liquid into the surface for
a few seconds until the scratch disappears.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Wipe Out Web site, the damage CDs suffer is
usually in the plastic surface of the disc. The data is stored on a
metallic wafer under the plastic where it is protected.
</P>
<P>
   CDs fail when the laser in the CD player or CD-ROM drive
encounters a scratch in the plastic that makes it lose its place in
tracking the data on the metallic wafer underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out is like a liquid sandpaper that removes the scratch and
returns the plastic to its original smooth condition.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out! CD Repair Kit won an Innovation Award at the 1999
Consumer Electronics Show. Guest said nearly 40,000 kits have been
sold so far with only 19 customers asking for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe Out sells for about $15, and Guest said it can be found at
Sam Goody and Tower Record stores. It also can be ordered online
from the Web site at www.cdrepair.com.

DOWNLOAD, RIP AND PLAY WITH MP3 FILES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, a friend of mine brought over a CD, put it in
the CD player, and we listened to songs. There were 16 cuts on the
disc, with music by top-name country stars, light opera and jazz,
all playing clearly and crisply.
</P>
<P>
   Where did he buy this eclectic music collection?
</P>
<P>
   There is no such CD for sale. ``The amazing part of it,'' he
added, ``is that I don't own one of those albums with those songs
on it. I downloaded them all from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a collection of old-time radio shows _ the Great
Gildersleeve, Amos 'n' Andy, the Shadow, Lum and Abner, Jack Benny
_ all downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These little stories give recording-company executives apoplexy.
And at the same time, those executives salivate at the thought of
an easy, cheap way to market, distribute and sell music over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The format used is MP3, industry shorthand for ``Moving Picture
Experts Group audio player 3.'' It's a compression system, used to
slim down audio files so they may be transmitted quickly without
loss of quality when expanded back to their original form.
</P>
<P>
   For the listener, the format means new artists who can never
seem to get accepted by record labels but turn out to be big hits
with the public, can gain exposure for their music on their own Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   A typical 3-minute song, for instance, takes up about 30
megabytes of disk space. Compressed into MP3 format, the file is
about 3 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The file can be played by an MP3 player (WinAmp is a popular one
on the Internet, available from www.winamp.com) on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   It can be transferred to a CD, but CD players can't recognize
the MP3 format. (However, there are some CD players now being
produced that can decompress MP3 files on the fly and play them.
The advantage: A CD, instead of holding 60 minutes of music, can
now hold about 150 to 200 songs.) There are serious legal issues
with posting copyrighted songs on the Internet, but that hasn't
stopped every cut from recently released CDs from showing up in MP3
format soon after the CD's release in stores (and in many cases,
even before). But there are many aspects of MP3 use that are
perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that MP3 is the second-most frequently used
search word on most search engines. (In case you wonder, ``sex'' is
in the lead.) ``I Want My MP3!: How to Download, Rip &AMP; Play Digital
Music'' by Bill Mann (McGraw-Hill; $19.99) gives a complete
overview of MP3. The 374-page book also comes with a CD-ROM that
contains all the software covered in the book, including the
Sonique stand-alone player (one of the popular ones available) and
a collection of MP3 fills.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the press release says, I had MP3 up and running on the
computer in less than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It provides information on installing and setting up players,
using programs that do ripping (taking tracks from CDs and
converting them to MP3), and gives types on utilities for working
with MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites suggested in the book include: www.mp3.com;
www.musicmatch.com; www.rollingstone.tunes.com; www.listen.com.

   Mike Phillips wanted to go home. An animation artist, he had
worked in New York for MTV and in Berlin for a film studio, but he
couldn't get Barrie, a town 60 miles north of Toronto, out of his
mind. ``I missed being able to drive a short distance to the
wilderness,'' said Phillips, 25.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the paucity of animation work there, home he went
this year and began trolling the Internet for work. That is how he
discovered eLance, a jobs bazaar (www.eLance.com) where freelancers
can list their skills and search for work. And though he named a
price that was more than 50 percent above what a New York employer
wanted to pay, he landed an assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is the beneficiary of an economic boom that has driven
unemployment in the United States to its lowest level since
astronauts were landing on the moon and has made employers
desperate for skilled workers. To cater to them, an entirely new
kind of job fair is springing up, run not out of a convention
center but in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ELance and its rivals are the information-age equivalent of the
medieval town square where workers-for-hire called out their
skills. Today's job seekers do the same, but through their computer
keyboards. And whether they are computer programmers in Atlanta or
Finnish translators in San Diego, they can find work without
traveling. For their part, employers gain access to a new pool of
freelancers without having to give them office space or fringe
benefits. Across the economy, said Berrud Sheth, the chief
executive of eLance, ``the supply is sitting all over the world,
and demand is where it is,'' often unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   Though small, the sites tap into three of today's hottest
employment trends: the rise of outsourcing, the Internet revolution
and the surge in people working at home as telecommuters or
small-business owners. In 1998 alone, the number of Americans
identifying themselves as self-employed rose 15 percent, to 10
million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest jobs bazaar is Monster Talent Market, a part of
Monster.com, the most popular Internet job-hunting site. After five
months in business, Monster Talent Market says it has signed up
110,000 independent contractors and more than 7,500 employers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, one of the newest players in the field,
FlexMind.com, is deliberately elitist. The Massachusetts start-up
wants to register only students at a dozen or so of the most
selective universities in the country, assuming that employers
would love to hire them for part-time assignments and that the
students who otherwise might have to wait tables would jump at the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice way for a company to have a low-commitment preview
of an employee,'' said FlexMind chief executive Julius Mokrauer. In
FlexMind's first two months, about 500 students and 40 companies _
including American Express and barnesandnoble.com _ have registered
on the site, Mokrauer said. He left his job as a trader at Lehman
Brothers to start the company last year after hiring a Harvard law
student for $35 an hour and realizing what a bargain that was for
his employer.
</P>
<P>
   FlexMind charges employers 20 percent of whatever they are
paying to the freelancer. Monster takes about 10 percent but no
more than $1,000. ELance, which is now free for both freelancers
and companies, will begin charging next year.
</P>
<P>
   With so many job openings going begging these days, the
freelance Web sites can be a boon to employers. Susan Patnaik, for
example, was having trouble finding an artist in New York to
illustrate a graphic novel _ a type of comic book for adults _ that
she was producing. She had called artists she knew and asked for
recommendations but was striking out.
</P>
<P>
   So she listed the assignment on eLance for $350. Bids started
arriving the next day, and she chose Phillips, even though he
wanted $550, because she was impressed with the samples she had
downloaded. Presto: talent-hungry Ms. Patnaik had her worker, and
job-hungry Phillips had his 25-hour assignment, even though they
live hundreds of miles apart, do not know anybody in common and may
never meet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, $550 is hardly enough for Phillips to live on, and
thus far he has not landed any other jobs through eLance. The site
has not attracted enough companies to offer a primary source of
income for anybody. Even on Monster Talent Market, only two or
three deals are made each week.
</P>
<P>
   From an employer's perspective, the sites can create as many
problems as they solve, since virtually anyone can post a resume.
On eLance, Phillips said, ``It seems like there are a lot of young,
inexperienced artists applying for jobs.'' And HotJobs.com, a rival
to Monster, does not offer an auction site, the company says,
because its clients _ big companies _ have shown little interest.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few big success stories. Benita Kenn quit her
job as a public-relations manager for a California technology
company this year to spend more time with her folk band. She put
her resume on Monster Talent Market and got two jobs. The first,
with a golf merchandise site, began in August and is just ending,
while the other, with a seller of personalized T-shirts and mugs,
began in October. Ms. Kenn has been working an average of 20 hours
a week at pay that she says is typical for a public-relations
consultant. (That would be about $100 an hour, said people in the
industry.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, she uses her old contacts because she said she cannot
rely solely on the auction site. ``Ideally, there would be hordes
of people bidding for me,'' Ms. Kenn said. ``But that's not where
it's at at this point.''

WHAT'S IN A CYBER NAME? $7.5 MILLION FOR THE RIGHT ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what is believed to be the highest price ever
paid for an Internet address, a company here is paying $7.5 million
for the rights to the domain name business.com.
</P>
<P>
   The price is more than twice the previous known record paid for
an Internet domain name _ the $3.3 million that Compaq Computer
Corp. paid last year to buy altavista.com, the name of its search
engine. Compaq purchased the address from a man in San Jose, who
had registered the name to use for his software company.
</P>
<P>
   The seller of business.com, a Houston entrepreneur named Marc
Ostrofsky, bought the name in 1997 from an Internet service
provider in Europe for $150,000. His sale Tuesday is the latest
example of a kind of land-rush mentality on the Internet, in which
speculators and entrepreneurs have been staking claims to domain
names, the cyberspace equivalent of real estate, in hopes that the
addresses will appreciate in value.
</P>
<P>
   The purchaser of the name business.com is Ecompanies, an
``incubator'' that aims to start numerous Internet companies. It
will use the name for what it says will be a broad directory of Web
services available to businesses that it plans to start next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Winebaum, a co-founder of Ecompanies, said the price was
not too high for a brand name, given that Web-based companies are
spending more than $1 million for a 30-second commercial during the
Super Bowl to make their names known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually think the name means a lot,'' said Winebaum, who
ran Walt Disney Co.'s Web business before starting Ecompanies
earlier this year with Sky Dayton, the founder of Earthlink
Network, an Internet service provider. ``It captures what I think
we're building,'' he added. ``I would rather have it like that than
trying to spend a lot to figure out what the brand stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Friedman, an Internet analyst with Goldman Sachs, said
business-to-business electronic commerce could be a $1.5 trillion
business in five years. Given the potential, he said, ``to have one
of the marquis names in that business could be a favorable return
on invested capital.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates, a
leading consultant on branding, said such generic names lack
lasting value. ``It's a huge amount of money for something that
might be a commodity in six months,'' he said. ``Owning generic
domain names will not be a long term play in branding and
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can register a domain name not already in use for $70 for
two years from Network Solutions, a company chartered by the U.S.
government to supervise the system. Speculators and entrepreneurs,
sometimes called ``cybersquatters'' have taken to registering names
that might be wanted by others in hopes of selling them for a big
profit. Some names are being sold through Web auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   But million-dollar deals are rare. The name wine.com was
purchased for $3 million, Wallstreet.com for $1.03 million and
drugs.com for $823,000 according to GreatDomains.com, a Website
that provides a marketplace for buying and selling domain names.
But most prices are far less. An entrepreneur in California
demanded that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. pay $75,000 for a
name the brokerage wants to use for its online stock trading
service. Morgan Stanley offered to pay $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrofsky owns Multimedia Publishing Corp., which published
telecommunications magazines and ran trade shows. He sold those
businesses recently to Primedia for $35 million and said he planned
to use that money to start Web companies. He was planning a
business-oriented Internet site using business.com but also was
willing to sell the name and shopped it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to know when to hold them and when to fold them,''
he said, adding that he believed Winebaum would do a better job
developing a Web site than he would. He and Winebaum said there
were several bidders for the domain, though they would not name
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrofsky, 38, said he owns more than 100 domain names, most
obtained for just $70. When he paid the $150,000 for business.com,
he said, ``I had more than my fair share of people telling me I was
out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostrofsky said he had previously sold the name eflowers.com to
Flowers Direct for $25,000 plus 50 cents from every transaction
made on the site. As part of the deal, Ostrofsky's wife will get
flowers once a month for the rest of her life.

HACKER NAILS STAPLES ONLINE AD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SHELLEY MURPHY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping on line may be the best way to avoid holiday crowds,
but customers visiting Staples' Web site one day last month
encountered a unique problem when they unwittingly found themselves
in a competitor's store.
</P>
<P>
   A hacker broke into the Framingham, Mass. office supply
retailer's Internet site, www.staples.com, on Oct. 9 and posted
advertisements for one of the company's major competitors, Office
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers clicking on Office Depot products were immediately
linked to the home page of Staples' major competitor, which is
based in Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Unamused officials at Staples, Inc. filed a lawsuit in US
District Court in Boston Monday charging that ``John Doe,'' the
unidentified hacker, illegally accessed the company's Web site and
damaged the company by stealing e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the hacker is believed to live in or near
Massachusetts and that the company expects to identify him shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it highly unlikely that one of our competitors
were involved in any way,'' said Shannon Lapierre, public relations
manager of Staples, speculating that the changes to the Web site
may have been a prank.
</P>
<P>
   But Staples, which just announced third-quarter Internet sales
revenue of $24 million, is taking the Web-site intrusion seriously
and is determined to identify the culprit and report him to federal
authorities, Lapierre said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal authorities have been on the lookout for
Internet fraud. Federal law prohibits unauthorized access to a
computer and calls for up to 10 years in prison if damage is
recklessly caused as a result of the breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously e-commerce is a very important part of our business
and very important to the company,'' said Lapierre, noting that
Staples' goal is to have a million on-line customers and a billion
dollars in Internet sales by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Staples, which did $7 billion in sales last year and operates
more than 1,000 office superstores, launched its Web site a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   While monitoring the site Oct. 9, officials noticed that
products advertised throughout the Web site had been deleted and
replaced with products bearing the Office Depot logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dead giveaway,'' Lapierre said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the Office Depot advertisements contained links to
the Florida company's Web site, meaning Staples visitors who
clicked on the illegally advertised products were redirected to the
competitor's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers were diverted from Staples to Office Depot for about an
hour before the problem was corrected, Lapierre said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lost business, Staples alleges it cost the
company time and money to repair its Web site and determine the
extent of the security breach.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Office Depot, the world's largest seller of office
products, were referred to the company's vice president of public
relations, who couldn't be reached for comment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lapierre said the problems created by the hacker were had never
happened to Staples before. ``It's an interesting time we live
in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Staples' stock rose 1/4 Monday to close at 23-13/16 in trading
on the Nasdaq market. Office Depot closed at 11 1/2, down 1/8, on
the New York Stock Exchange.

MTV'S ATTEMPT AT HARMONIC CONVERGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four contestants are suspended on spherical chairs that hang
like miniature meteors on a futuristic set. Their eyes are glued on
host Ahmet Zappa, who is projected on a gigantic screen.
Fashionably bald with a polished pate and aerodynamic glasses, the
animated Zappa pushes his face right up to the camera and does a
shout-out for the folks at home. ``Log on. Do it now,'' he says,
with a kind of ironic urgency. This is, he announces, ``the only
game show where you get to play naked.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-air contenders, who go by such cyber nicknames as
VidKitten, D'Lite, and Flirtz a Lot, are suitably clothed for the
MTV universe, but the folks playing along at home could, in fact,
be competing in the buff. That's part of the zany appeal of
``webRIOT,'' the first interactive game show that allows viewers to
play along on the Internet at MTV.com. The weekday music trivia
show, which debuts on MTV  &UR; today &LR;  at 5 p.m., allows some 50,000
at-home viewers to compete for prizes as they answer the same
questions as the on-air contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, game-show enthusiasts have been playing along at home
for years, screaming answers like ``Who is John Galt?'' and advice
like ``Buy a vowel!'' at their television sets. But with
``webRIOT,'' the answers at home actually count.
</P>
<P>
   The program is an experiment in convergence, the term for the
merging of television and Web programming. As more and more
television viewers go on line, entertainment executives are racing
to find ways to bring the two mediums together. An estimated 23
percent of American households have a computer and television in
the same room, according to a recent study by Paul Kagan Associates
and Showtime Networks, and that number is sure to grow. But past
attempts at convergence have delivered lots of hype and little
substance, doing nothing more than combining taped sitcoms with
live, on-line chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV effort pushes the interactivity a bit further while also
attempting to bring together the enthusiasm for such on-line games
as ``You Don't Know Jack'' with the attitude and swagger of hip-hop
and rap. Zappa, a live wire who admits a fondness for caffeine,
courts the viewers at home with his irreverent patter. Yet he knows
there is something contrived about conducting a conversation with
the cyber audience; the show is taped, so the at-home contestants
are playing ``live'' against a taped broadcast. ``When I do a
shoutout like, `Hey, all you gamers in Cincinnati!' I know it's not
the lamest thing, but it's pretty close,'' Zappa says during a
telephone interview from the ``webRIOT'' studio in Los Angeles. ``I
try to make it entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which will air Monday through Friday, is produced and
taped like most other game shows, although MTV is showing two
different versions on the East and West coasts, which will go on at
different times. ``That's to minimize cheating,'' says Rick
Holzman, vice president of MTV Online. ``We don't want you to be
able to call your friend in Sheboygan for the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is set up to accommodate 25,000 on-line competitors
each for both the East and West coast segments; it also
accommodates players at any connection speed. The top 10 players at
home are announced in a graphic at the end of the show, which
includes other ``live'' graphics recognizing what's happening in
the on-line game. Bright-colored windows pop up on the television
screen to report the on-line activity: In the pilot, these
informational boxes included tidbits like ``USC Grl had two perfect
games in a row. Higher education pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is designed to look like a computer screen with
multiple windows. On the television screen, music videos by such
artists as TLC and the Red Hot Chili Peppers play in one window
while the contestants answer trivia questions about the featured
artists. Factoids pop up in separate windows at appropriate times;
during a Beastie Boys video, the screen flashed this gem: ``The
Supreme Court has never officially recognized the right to party.''
</P>
<P>
   The show tries to blend geek humor and youth culture. The grand
prize for the on-line players is a 2000 Volkswagen Beetle _ or as
Zappa says, a Y2K Bug. On ``webRIOT,'' it's cool to be a nerd.
``I'm a total loser,'' says Zappa, 25. ``I love e-mail, and I love
the Internet.'' He also loves playing the role of cyberhost, both
on and off camera. ``I'm a robot from the future programmed to make
`webRIOT' the most infectious show on the planet,'' he says.
``People are going to catch it like a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a pitch. The host goes on to say that his father,
the late rocker Frank Zappa, landed on another planet and beamed
him back to Earth. The young Zappa will tell you a lot of things,
but he'll also tell you he is ``totally making all this stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   He is claiming to be an android because the show is aiming for a
futuristic feel. At the same time, it is exploiting the
old-fashioned game-show genre that is so popular this season with
the success of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would mistake Zappa for ``Millionaire'' host Regis
Philbin, but he does admit an affection for old quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child I watched them all the time, and I'm peachy pleased
with the whole scenario,'' he says. ``I'm a huge fan of `Press Your
Luck,' `The Price Is Right,' `Let's Make a Deal.' `Tic Tac Dough'
was the best _ and `The Joker's Wild.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``WebRIOT'' is a kind of retro-futuristic-musical hybrid _ ``The
Jetsons'' meet ``Jeopardy.'' But it's still unclear if the on-line
part will work. In January, when ABC tried to synchronize a
televised college bowl game with a Web program, the experiment was
an exercise in frustration because most viewers couldn't access the
Web site. That's why MTV capped the number of contestants _ to
avoid logjams, says Holzman.
</P>
<P>
   MTV has been working up to ``webRIOT'' with experiments in
convergent programming, such as an on-line auction of items from
the ``Real World'' set and a discontinued show called ``Yak Live,''
which let viewers chat on line as they watched music videos on
television. The network faces increasing competition for young
viewers, as on-line entertainment companies like Den.net and
Pseudo.com offer Web programming. Everybody in Hollywood, in fact,
is trying to figure out how to bring their existing products into
the virtual world. But Den, in particular, is aggressively trying
to become ``the MTV of the Y Generation.'' So far, most attempts at
on-line entertainment have simply mimicked television, and it's not
clear yet if ``webRIOT'' is any different. Naturally, Holzman
thinks it is. ``Everyone else wants to be the MTV of the Internet,
but MTV is the MTV of the Internet,'' he says.

 &HT;    Dell focuses on style, simplicity with webpc

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp., the No. 1 personal computer
maker in the United States but still a relatively small force in
the consumer market, unveils a new family of computers today that
is designed to get consumers on the Internet quickly and demystify
PC use.
</P>
<P>
   The webpc is Dell's entry into an emerging era in which sleeker
looking computers conform intuitively to users' wants, thus sparing
them from having to master technical details.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for people who are less concerned about the
technology,'' said Dell spokesman Tad Druart. ``They just want a
machine that gets them on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's new PCs, which will be officially announced by Chief
Executive Michael Dell and others in a 11 a.m. Webcast, will sell
for $999, $1,099 and $1,499. The prices include monitors, but
including a flat-panel monitor with the most expensive webpc would
bring the total cost to $2,349, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   All the major PC makers are working on Internet-driven PCs that
have been stripped of features that added cost and complexity to
the traditional beige boxes. They come only with easy-to-use USB
ports for connecting keyboards and peripherals such as printers, a
trend started by Apple Computer Inc.'s popular iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell acknowledges that Apple's stylish iMac, which began
selling in August 1998, has been a wake-up call for the personal
computer industry to build good-looking, easy-to-use products that
are less intimidating to average users.
</P>
<P>
   The new computers are not designed to be opened by their owners
to upgrade components such as adding memory, special purpose cards
or faster microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need expandability anymore, because all the
functionality is embedded in,'' said Roger Kay of International
Data Corp. ``This small generation of boxes is going to become
predominant in two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dell, other major PC makers such as Compaq Computer
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM Corp. plan to target corporate
customers when they begin shipping their Internet-driven PCs next
year. Compaq, which lost money in the commercial category this
year, sees its IPaq as a weapon to recover accounts lost to Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Dell hasn't talked about plans for a similar PC for commercial
customers, but analysts believe such a product is in the works.
Still, Dell's success in that market frees the company from a sense
of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell's bread-and-butter is the commercial market,'' said Ashok
Kumar of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis-based securities
firm. ``They don't want to loot the revenue potential there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dell has little to lose and much to gain in the consumer
market, it will face a different challenge if it introduces
something like webpc for commercial customers, Kay said. ``I think
everybody risks cannibalizing their corporate business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's webpc keyboard has dedicated buttons for Internet access,
opening an e-mail account and launching Web searches. It also
includes an ``e-support'' button that sends the customer to Dell's
interactive technical-help Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers want, essentially, plug-and-play,'' said Kumar.
``(Vendors) want to minimize the potential for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with monitors included in the price, Dell still is avoiding
the low end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Dell was slow to aggressively court the broad consumer market,
because inexperienced buyers can be costly when they tie up
customer help lines.
</P>
<P>
   With razor-thin profit margins on low-cost computers, just two
calls to the PC company help desk can turn a profitable customer
into an unprofitable one, Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell says its newest PCs will produce fewer problems for
consumers. Moreover, the ``e-support'' button on the keyboard takes
customers through a variety of solutions to common problems that
many users will be able to fix themselves. If that fails, they can
get online help from someone at Dell 24 hours a day, Druart said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell leads the industry in shifting technical support to the
Web, Kumar said. The company's recent and extensive redesign of its
Web pages was driven in large part by its desire to encourage even
novice users to go online for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell says its hourglass-shaped webpcs can be unpacked, plugged
in and clicked on to the Internet in about 10 minutes with
pre-loaded software for access to DellNet, the company's
Internet-access service.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell's major competitors are not expected to ship their
commercial, Internet-driven PCs until next year, Dell will have
immediate competition from customers of Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
AMD, whose Athlon processors have passed Intel Corp.'s Pentium III
in speed, is licensing its EasyPC design to a variety of
manufacturers, mostly overseas. It will be available in December.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the buzz about the new designs, the new era presents
new challenges for PC makers, said Kay of IDC. Style is an obvious
way to distinguish PCs that essentially are the same inside and
cost about the same. But consumer tastes can be fickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into style, you really play a very interesting
game, because you've got to `hit it','' said Kay. ``iMac hit it,
but the Wintel guys are sort of feeling their way through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Druart said the webpcs, designed mostly by Dell, will be
assembled in Huntsville, Ala., by SCI Systems Inc., a large
contract electronics manufacturer. The new family is available only
the United States now, but may be rolled out overseas next year.

   BORDER PATROL: The largest buildup in the Border Patrol's
history has sent an army of agents and millions of dollars in
sophisticated equipment to the southwest border to control illegal
immigration. But five years later, the strategy is failing.
Doubling the number of agents has helped the Border Patrol gain
control in places like San Diego and El Paso, but overall
apprehensions of illegal immigrants has reached an all-time high as
the immigrants have simply gone around the Border Patrol blockades.
An amazing 98 percent of those caught are sent back over the border
without any form of punishment, free to try their luck again. Those
who try to go around the blockades are increasingly dying from the
heat and cold, often after people smugglers, who are thriving,
leave stragglers behind during long marches through harsh terrain.
The critical question now is: Should America continue its
billion-dollar buildup?
