<HEADLINE> China Refutes Western Accusations Against Falun Gong Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's actions against the evil
Falun Gong cult are carried out in accordance with Chinese law and
have been widely acclaimed by the Chinese people, Liu Jing, a
special adviser to the Chinese delegation, said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No responsible government would take a laissez-faire attitude
toward an evil cult and allow it to endanger people's lives, Liu
said at a press briefing on the sideline of the on-going 56th
session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures show that the Falun Gong cult is
responsible for at least 1,559 deaths among its followers as a
result of committing suicides or refusing medical treatment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The cult has also led to more than 650 cases of psychological
disorder, with 11 practitioners becoming homicides and 144 others
physically disabled, while ruining the normal life of thousands of
Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
The illegal activities by Falun Gong have inflicted serious
harm to society with cult ring leader Li Hongzhi and some key
members, in addition to illegally amassing wealth, tricking their
followers into besieging educational and research institutions as
well as government and media offices.
</P>
<P>
It is fully lawful and justified for the Chinese government to
bring key cult members, including Li Chang, to justice and to
issue a warrant for the arrest of Li Hongzhi, said Liu. "All these
actions were carried out strictly in accordance with law. Before
court, Li Chang and other convicts had pleaded guilty."
</P>
<P>
The campaign against Falun Gong has nothing to do with
religious freedom. As a matter of fact, it was some prominent
religious leaders who first revealed the true nature of Falun Gong,
Liu said. Outlawing the evil cult is for the very purpose of
ensuring religious freedom of some 100 million believers of
religions in China.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Liu said that like other evil cults in
the world, Falun Gong concocted and propagated numerous fallacies
to fool its practitioners, so as to control them organizationally
and spiritually.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, some Western countries' accusations against China
are based on such lies spread by Li Hongzhi, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the actual number of Falun Gong followers was 2
million, far fewer than the 100 million claimed by Li Hongzhi, and
that up to now 98 percent of them have distanced themselves from
Falun Gong and returned to normal life.
</P>
<P>
Liu also refuted a report dished up by Falun Gong on so-called
crackdown by the Chinese government on the cult.
</P>
<P>
Investigation revealed that among the 103 cases of "persecution
" contained in the report, 91, or 88.3 percent, are sheer
fabrications and distortions; while 12, or 11.7 percent, are
totally false or non- existent. "In other words, none is true," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Some obsessed practitioners, who gathered in Beijing and
attempted to hold unlawful meetings after the outlawing of the
cult, were persuaded to leave or led away and sent home by the
relevant authorities. The fact was that 35,000 dispatches were
made. But when Falun Gong mentioned it, it turned out to be 35,000
people arrested.
</P>
<P>
"In order to fabricate lies, Falun Gong has made the best use
of their imagination," Liu said. "It is not strange that evil
cults usually start with spreading lies and heresies. For without
cheating, they could not exist."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people cannot but feel outraged and amazed when
some Western countries make accusations against China based on
Falun Gong's fabrications and lies, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Wrath from Annette Lu's Ancestral Home (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annette Lu's elder brother went to the mainland three times
with other family members in Taiwan to hold memorial ceremonies
for the Lu ancestors. He also wrote an introduction for the
genealogy, which said that "though the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits has been away for a century, no one can deny that blood is
thicker than water."
</P>
<P>
Lu Zanchun also remembered that Annette Lu came to Nanjing to
pay a formal visit to honor her ancestors on August 29, 1990, and
as a gesture of respect she drank water from a well in her
ancestral family yard.
</P>
<P>
Annette Lu then said that "drinking the water reminds me that
the well was dug by my ancestors in China."
</P>
<P>
Feng Jiaming, an official who hosted Annette Lu when she came
to Nanjing, said that Lu's pro-Taiwan independence speech not only
betrayed her motherland, but also her family.
</P>
<P>
"If you perversely insist on Taiwan Independence, you will come
to no better end than other traitor in Chinese history," Feng said.

<HEADLINE> Wrath from Annette Lu's Ancestral Home (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Annette Lu's disgraceful act of
advocating Taiwan independence has aroused the wrath of her
distant relatives in their ancestral home in Nanjing County in
east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
All 200 members of the Lu family in the village have asked her
to stop spreading heretical ideas aiming to separate Taiwan from
China's mainland, and warned her not to smear the family name.
</P>
<P>
In an interview today with Xinhua, 63-year-old Lu Zanchun said:
"Reunification of the motherland is what is wanted by all Chinese
and also the main trend of historical development. We, the Lu
family members are blood relatives, and can only be united when
China is unified."
</P>
<P>
"Lu family members in Taiwan should also unite to fight against
'Taiwan Independence', in a bid to realize unification as soon as
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zanchun, who is Annette Lu's nephew, is editing a family
genealogy at the request of the Lu family's Taiwan branch.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that Annette Lu sent her resume and photo and an
inscription in August 1999, to be included in the book.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Thais Splash Joyous Water as Economy Recovers  by Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- With water flying every way,
Bangkok becomes a battlefield Thursday as Thai people celebrate
the traditional Thai New Year which is also called Songkran or the
Water Festival.
</P>
<P>
Water guns, buckets, big bowls and containers of every
description are used as weapons with water as ammunition.
</P>
<P>
But this is a battlefield without enemies. People splash water
on one another joyfully, no matter where you come from, what you
look like or how old you are. The water is good-natured, believed
to flow and take away all bad omens and the inauspicious, as is
especially the case this year.
</P>
<P>
It has been more than two years during which the Thais had to
bear the hardships of an economic crisis. Now, since the economy
has been recovering, they can relax a bit and heartily celebrate
the festival.
</P>
<P>
"If you'll excuse me, I've got some serious business to do!"
yelled Pisut Khloykhlaew, a 20-some man working for a import and
export company, before joining his friends.
</P>
<P>
Pisut, sopped up to the skin, was "caught" in a convenience
store on the flooded Khaosan Road when putting his mobile phone
into a plastic bag in case it will be damaged by water.
</P>
<P>
"Songkran festival is the day that I look forward most in a
year. I can't miss it. This year I have even more reasons to
celebrate because my company's business is improving," Pisut said.
"Tomorrow I will drive out of Bangkok with my friends to other
provinces to celebrate."
</P>
<P>
The export situation has indeed improved a lot in the country
this year, with the export volume reaching 5.57 billion U.S.
dollars in February, a 32.7-percent increase over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Khaosan Road, a foreign backpacker paradise, always turns out
to be the most exciting place to go in Bangkok during the Songkran
festival, which falls between April 13 and 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
Merrymakers on the road, foreigners and locals alike, "attacked
" one another frantically.
</P>
<P>
Most of them waved the 35-baht (90 U.S. cents) long-barrel
squirt guns which have become the weapon of choice this year.
</P>
<P>
But this seems not crazy enough when compared with water tanks,
some of which are spotted on the street, with people standing on
the top, shooting water down on others with huge pipes.
</P>
<P>
In fact, these water tanks were sent by the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration to supply the ammunition -- water --
to the revelers.
</P>
<P>
However, Kanmchorn Luangwaranan, the storekeeper of the Inter
Slide photo shop, looks a little bit upset. The business is not as
good as he expected.
</P>
<P>
"As the economy turned around, many Bangkokains went abroad to
spend their holidays. There are fewer people here this year than
last year," he said gloomily.
</P>
<P>
According to Skyline tour company, bookings to foreign
destinations have soared by 20 to 30 percent from last year's
figures.
</P>
<P>
A salesman of Weekend Tours company said, "Trips (during the
Songkran festival) were booked one to two months in advance. Two
to three times more advance bookings were made than in the past."
</P>
<P>
Thailand sank into recession in 1997 after floating its
currency. However, the country has recovered, from a negative 14-
percent growth in 1998 to an expansion of 4.2 percent last year,
and with a barely discernible inflation rate of 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
More impressively, the country's central planning agency, the
National Economic and Social Development Board, announced recently
that this year's economic growth was on course for a further 4.4-
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
"All the economic news is so encouraging and the future so
bright that we can't help but enjoy ourselves," Smith
Patravanichkul, a businessman working for a car export company,
said.
</P>
<P>
Off Khaosan Road, you still have difficulty to avoid getting
drenched. Driving pickups, the country's largest export automobile
unit, many people took pleasure in pouring water on people in any
open place.
</P>
<P>
"They are pouring water of blessing and sharing their happiness
at the country's improved economic situation with everyone," Smith
said.

Speaking at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission

rights legally privileged to them.

China is a unified multi-ethnic country, and her 55 ethnic
minority groups make up for 8.98 percent of the total population,
Li told the 53-member commission. All 55 ethnic minority groups,

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyz Lawmaker Rejects U.S. Criticism Over Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three Kyrgyz lawmakers on
Thursday accused United States observers of not being objective in
assessing the results of the recent parliamentary election in the
Central Asian republic.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter, the lawmakers said the international
missions had made "a non-objective and even negative assessment"
of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The missions had insisted that the election should be held in
compliance with legislation, which had been prepared with the
assistance of experts for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe "to meet high international standards."
</P>
<P>
"That is why it was on the whole staged on the basis of strict
adherence to democratic principles and in accordance with
international norms," the Interfax news agency quoted the letter
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The arrest in late March of Felix Kulov, an opposition leader,
"was not related to his activity aimed at the state's current
leadership," it said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the arrest "was a logical result of a more-than-two-
year investigation into the criminal and anti-constitutional
activities which he had committed during the years when he
occupied key government positions," the lawmakers said.

At the meetings, they discussed the decades-old Cyprus issue and
agreed that the next round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on
Cyprus should be more substantive and result-oriented, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The National Council vowed to continue seeking a federal
solution, within the framework set out by U.N. Security Council
resolutions, which provide for a bizonal, bicommunal federation in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
This solution, he said, must safeguard human rights and must
comply with the criteria for European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the U.N. has been pushing for reunification of the
island under a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but all
efforts have failed to produce tangible results so far.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two sides on the tiny island have held two
rounds of proximity talks on Cyprus, the first round in New York
last December and the second in Geneva in February, with an aim to
prepare the ground for substantive talks which may lead to a
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks are scheduled to start on May 23 in New
York.

JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will recognize
Palestinian independence after the two sides reach a framework
agreement for final-status issues by the end of May, Israel Channel
One television reported Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Citing a senior source familiar with the negotiations, the

According to the television report, the border between Israel

The borderline is reportedly expected to be demarcated between

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Visit Egypt Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
will pay a day-long visit to Egypt on Sunday for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process,
the Jordanian ambassador in Cairo said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Tarrad al-Fayez said the upcoming visit and the
summit come within the framework of continued coordinations between
the two leaders, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Abdullah will focus on the latest developments of
the Mideast peace process and the two countries' efforts aimed at
helping push forward the peace march on the Palestinian, Syrian and
Lebanese tracks, the news agency quoted al-Fayez as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli final status talks, which the two sides
have planned to conclude by September, on the thorniest issues
including the final borders, the fate of Jerusalem, refugees and
the Jewish settlements have made little progress.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since January
due to disputes over Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan
Heights that the Jewish state occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war
and control of the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will brief Abdullah on his talks in March with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington, which dealt with, among other
things, the Arab-Israeli peace talks, the Jordanian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdullah will keep Mubarak posted on the results of
his recent visits to Belgium and Denmark, which also touched on the
peace process, Al-Fayez added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the first two Arab countries to make peace
with Israel, are keen on mediating in the peace talks between Arab
countries and the Jewish state.

JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will recognize

</P>
<P>
Barak threw all his energy into the Israeli-Palestinian peace
track after he realized recently that chances to advance in the
peace talks with Syria, his favorite endeavor during his first 10
months in office, are really slim.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, he sent negotiators to meet with their
Palestinian counterparts in two rounds of talks at Bolling Air
Force in southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
He also went to Washington in person to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton earlier this week. It was believed that during the summit
Barak put forward the proposal to recognize a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The proposed recognition is also a good-will gesture to satisfy
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who toughened stance on declaring
Palestinian statehood on September 13, the seventh anniversary of
the birth of Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to travel to Washington and meet with
Clinton next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Russia's Ratification of START II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a short statement, Clinton said that the approval of the
treaty by the Duma "builds on decades of cooperation between the
United States and Russia to reduce nuclear arms and clearly
advances the interests of both countries."
</P>
<P>
"START II will make our people safer and our partnership with a
democratic Russia stronger," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It will open the door to further significant steps to reduce
nuclear arms and the nuclear danger, a course that is strongly
supported by the international community and has strong bipartisan
support in the United States," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma ratified the treaty in a vote earlier
Friday. The treaty, which was signed in 1993, was ratified by the
U.S. Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Now we and Russia can and must seize this opportunity to
intensify our discussions on both START III and the ABM (Anti-
Ballistic Missile) treaty, so we can take further concrete steps
this year to strengthen the security of the United States, Russia,
and indeed the whole world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Under START II, the U.S. and Russia must cut the number of
nuclear warheads from 6,000 to no more than 3,500 on each side by
2007. The two countries agreed in 1997 to start their third round
of Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, or START III, once START II
enters into force.

<HEADLINE> South Summit Calls North Countries to Solve Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The foreign debt problem that
overwhelms Third World economies requires industrialized North
countries' participation for a lasting solution which pays
attention to structural causes generating this problem, said the
Final Declaration of the South Summit of the Group of 77.
</P>
<P>
The document says that during the last years, foreign debt-
underdevelopment vicious circle has worsened because the payments
required by creditors have become more onerous for many South
countries, including those with medium and low incomes.
</P>
<P>
The text underscores the need to look along with developed
countries an effective solution for the debt problem, whose actual
amount sums up to 2.5 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Third World leaders who have gathered in Havana since last
Wednesday asked for the concentration of medium income developing
countries' foreign debt reduction agreements and an amplification
of resources destined, for this purpose, to very indebted poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time they said that debt alleviation or
cancellation should not compromise funds destined for official
development assistance, which has been reduced to 0.22 percent of
industrialized countries' gross domestic income versus the 0.7
percent agreed upon in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect the declaration focuses on, to be approved
Friday at the closing of the South Summit, refers to the global
foreign debt strategy that must be followed, and regarding this
issue a finance, economics and development analysis was proposed.

<HEADLINE> South Summit Approves South-South Political Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These concepts are part of the declaration that will be passed
on Friday, at the closing of the five days event. This document is
a strategy the Third World has to fulfill in the new century in
order to favor the development of poor countries.
</P>
<P>
South-South cooperation is regarded by the participating
countries in the Havana event as an efficient mechanism capable of
mobilizing natural resources and human knowledge potentials of
this emerging nations.
</P>
<P>
Also, this sort of cooperation is regarded as a way of
complementing projects in force supported by assisting countries.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state recognize as well the need to overcome
factors that until now have limited the development of horizontal
collaboration, which faces as one of its main obstacles lack of
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
That is why the countries represented in the Havana summit
compromise to identify financing sources, and to design follow-up
mechanisms that help to comply with the agreements accorded by the
Group of 77.
</P>
<P>
Along with the General Declaration, the Action Program
containing over a hundred South-South cooperation projects in the
fields of health, education, science, technology and
communications among other are to be approved.

<HEADLINE> G-77 Summit Calls for Prompt General Acceptance of WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The declaration, approved by the heads of state of the
developing countries assembled at Havana, demands that a
transparent, simple and accelerated process of adhesion to the WTO
take place in agreement with this organization's laws and
dispositions.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the evolution of world trade during the last years,
the document says that market liberalization undertaken by many
developing countries and the role of the WTO have not translated
into the reality, nor guaranteed their full participation in the
multilateral trade system.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the document demands that the WTO carry out
an in-depth revision of the agreement on intellectual property
related to trade, an issue in which highly developed countries
have refrained from easing license and trade marks use, which in
general are in the hands of transnational companies headquartered
in the North.
</P>
<P>
As for trade barriers existing in rich countries, the G-77 text
denounces the use of environmental norms as a new form of
protectionism and proposes that matters related to this norms be
handled by competent international organizations and not by the
WTO.

<HEADLINE> Havana Summit Calls for Stronger South Role in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The first South Summit is to
conclude here on Friday night with Third World leaders vowing to
unite as a group in fighting poverty, demanding a greater say in
world political and economic decision-making process, and joining
developed countries in technical revolution.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and
government of the Group of 77 (G-77), is scheduled to issue two
final documents -- the Declaration and the Program of Plan -- at
the end of the three-day historic event.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 heads of state or government and delegations from 122 G-
77 countries all have one objective: to strengthen South-South
cooperation for common development in developing countries in
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, which opened here Wednesday following two-day
preparatory meetings, was held at the turn of century when many
developing countries are being marginalized in the tide of
globalization, which is characterized by trade, investment,
capital flows and advancements in information technology.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has increased the vulnerability of those
countries of the South, which are in the process of being
integrated into the world economy," the South countries said in
the Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Summit demands the establishment a just and fair
new international political and economic system, and a greater say
in multilateral lending institutions, such as the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Our peoples have run out of patience," Cuban Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque told a meeting of G-77 foreign ministers here
Tuesday. "For decades they have suffered broken promises and are
today living in an economic and social situation that is
increasingly serious and unsustainable."
</P>
<P>
"Nothing we say or do will have any true meaning for our
people unless we can significantly and quickly reduce the shameful
number of those who live in poverty, even as more people than ever
become millionaires," said Belize's Prime Minister Said Musa.
</P>
<P>
"One day, humankind will be called to account: How come you
never made no connection between growing poverty for the many and
booming wealth for a new?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders joining Said are U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, South African President Thabo Mbeki who is also the
chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, Vietnamese President Tran
Duc Long, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez, Palestine leader Yasser Araft, and
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the Summit was Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing,
head of the Chinese Government delegation. "
</P>
<P>
Describing the South Summit as "a grand, pioneering meeting,"
Li said, "In the interests of safeguarding world peace and
promoting development, let us look back over the past and forward
into the future and work together in a cooperative spirit to map
out a strategy for common development in the new century."
</P>
<P>
"The new century will present us both hope and difficulties,"
he said. "We people of developing countries have never been in
want of the courage to surmount difficulties or an undaunted
enterprising spirit."
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that as long as developing countries unite as
one and make tireless efforts, there will firmly stand a peaceful,
stable and prosperous South," he declared.
</P>
<P>
G-77, set up by 77 developing countries in Geneva in 1964, saw
its membership growing to 133 countries, but the original name was
retained because of its historic significance.

<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, G-77 provides the means for the
developing world to articulate and promote its collective economic
interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on all major
international economic issues in the United Nations system, and
promote economic and technical cooperation among developing
countries.

In the final Declaration of the Summit approved by all the 133
member countries of the Group of 77 (G-77) here in the capital

<HEADLINE> Romania, Hungary Seek Legal Terms to Defiled Rivers Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Viktor Orban is in Bucharest for an one-day official visit at
the invitation of his Romanian counterpart Mugur Isarescu.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything in our power to offset the damage
suffered by Hungary," the visiting Hungarian prime minister said,
stressing that this matter can be resolved only by legal ways.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian and Hungarian Governments have already negotiated
and signed an agreement over the environmental protection, which
has cleared the Hungarian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu said for his part that
Romania has already asked the court to state who's responsible for
the damage and what the damages are. He said the only problem with
this agreement was the responsibility of the states in this field,
an issue which Romania pledged to solve, given the worldwide
developments in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu saw the bright side of the story, namely that the two
countries have agreed to cooperate in order to settle the problem.
</P>
<P>
"What matters is that the cooperation has come to life and the
problem will be pragmatically approached by monitoring the
ecological risk-prone areas in Romania and Hungary," Mugur
Isarescu said.
</P>
<P>
Mugur Isarescu said that ecological investments were highly
important and that Romania had broached the idea of winning loans
from the World Bank and the European Community for this purpose.
He said the response had been positive and supplementary funds
would come to help in protecting costly environmental projects.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Ruling Party Urged to Convince People to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has urged leaders of the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM)
to convince people to vote in the forthcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
He made the call while addressing a public rally in Mubende
District near Kampala Friday afternoon, according to a press
release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who is also chairman of the NRM, said that the
leaders and campaigners of the ruling party must explain clearly
to the public why the country should continue with the NRM system.
</P>
<P>
He reminded those at the rally of the major achievements made
by the NRM, including ridding the country of dictatorship,
maintaining democratic rule and reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
These achievements were accomplished due to the internal
strength the NRM has built up within the country, the way it has
organized the economy and the support of many close friends it has
made outside the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the massive support the NRM enjoys is
based on its performance since it came to power in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Under Uganda's Constitution, a referendum is to be held in June
to decide on the country's political system. There are several
systems which have been registered to participate in the
referendum, but the NRM is widely believed to be the winner.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Launch Multimedia Satellite Payload </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Minister of Industry John
Manley announced a plan Friday to develop and launch a
communications satellite payload worth 109 million Canadian
dollars (about 74 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ka band high-speed, multimedia communications payload is a
key part of the Anik F2 satellite to be launched in 2002 by Ottawa-
based satellite operator Telesat Canada at an expense of 600
million Canadian dollars (about 408 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A joint venture of the Canadian Space Agency, Telesat Canada
and two other Canadian companies, the project will provide cheaper,
faster and more highly effective communications services in North
America.
</P>
<P>
It will also expand access to tele-medicine, tele-learning,
tele-working, e-commerce, high-speed Internet and government
services to citizens throughout Canada.
</P>
<P>
Minister Manley said in his announcement of the project that
the country is enhancing its competitiveness in communications
services through "continuing support for leading-edge research and
development."
</P>
<P>
Telesat Canada's Anik F2 will be the first satellite in North
America to carry a digital on-board process. Direct economic
benefits from the Anik F2 Ka band multimedia satellite services
are projected at over 1 billion Canadian dollars (680 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Barak "Very Pessimistic" about Israeli-Syrian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Friday issued the most pessimistic review about peace talks
with Syria since their negotiations broke off in January.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of his Labor party ministers in Tel
Aviv, Barak said he is "very pessimistic" regarding the
negotiations, though he believed a very narrow crack is still left
on the door for a possible resumption, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving on Monday for a summit with U.S President Bill
Clinton in Washington, Barak only said he was not optimistic about
chances of reviving the talks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, which resumed last December after a 45-month
break, hit a snag again in January only after two rounds of
fruitless talks near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the major mediator in the Syrian peace track, had drawn
his rein after his summit with Syrian president Hafez al-Assad in
Geneva on March 26 failed to make progress as expected.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the prospect of the talks, Clinton said the ball
was now in Syria's court, suggesting that he and Barak would wait
for Assad's answers to the Israeli proposal rather than concede to
more Syrian demands.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the Syrian responses reached Washington till now are
not satisfactory for both Clinton and Barak.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Barak said he leaned to pull Israeli soldiers back
from south Lebanon by July on the basis of the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, indicating he nearly gave up all
hopes to reach a peace deal with Syria, the major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, adopted more than two decades ago, calls
for an immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all
Lebanese territory and a return of full sovereignty to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It is now used by Israel as a legitimate framework for a
unilateral withdrawal from its self-styled security zone in south
Lebanon, where growing casualties of Israeli occupation troops
prompted the cabinet determination last month to exit with or
without a deal with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel had exchange views with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, and leaders of France, Canada and other countries, about the
possibility to extending authority of the current U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon to fill the vacuum after Israel troops leave.
</P>
<P>
Barak also warned against any attempt to "test Israel's
response" by lobbing missiles into northern Israel. It was reported
that Hezbollah guerrillas and other groups fighting to end Israeli
occupation in Lebanon had begun to recruit fighters from the 300,
000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanese camps.
</P>
<P>
Barak also promised more economic and security measures for
settlers near the border with Lebanon, in an effort to placate
their worries for possible cross-border guerrilla attack after the
Israeli pullout.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Defends "Legal Violence" in Islam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Friday strongly defended "legal violence" by the
Islamic regime in cracking down on riots to safeguard security.
</P>
<P>
"Legal violence is not only good but necessary" and the Islamic
regime will act "with strength and violence" against all those
resorting to force, aggression, and violation of the law, Khamenei
said.
</P>
<P>
"Legal repression is indispensable because without it there
would be no way of maintaining order and security," Khamenei said
at the Friday prayers at downtown Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the remarks amid mounting political tensions after
reformists allied with President Mohammad Khatami scored a victory
over the conservatives in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"If you do not check this sort of violence, you would face
growing violations in the society," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to protests last week in the northwestern city
of Khalkhal, which took place after the conservative Guardians
Council overturned election results to deprive a reformist
candidate of victory and hand the seat to his conservative rival.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people have been jailed after one of the
demonstrations turned violent, with protestors smashing public
buildings and setting vehicles on fire.
</P>
<P>
"One must act in accordance with the law, even if one has a
complaint," Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people to safeguard national unity and
security, saying that "in the absence of these two factors, the
government would not be able to cope with the economic, social and
cultural problems."

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Visits Israeli Research Center, Kibbutz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
Friday morning visited the Zohar Agriculture Research Center,
accompanied by his Israeli counterpart Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
The research center, located about 100 kilometers southeast of
Jerusalem, is one of Israel's advanced agriculture research and
experimental sites for fruits, vegetables, flowers and plants.
</P>
<P>
At the center, Jiang visited several greenhouses where fruits,
vegetables and flowers are grown, and asked many questions about
their specifications and cultivating process.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president talked with technicians and researchers
with great interest, and praised them for their achievements made
under harsh natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The land and soil conditions in China's western region, such as
in Gansu and Qinghai provinces, are similar with what you have
here," Jiang told the Israeli researchers.
</P>
<P>
"Your techniques of growing fruits and vegetables, including
muskmelon and green pepper, are well worth studying by the Chinese
farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those techniques can be beneficial to accelerating the
development of China's western region, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Jiang visited the En Gedi Kibbutz, about 90
kilometers southeast of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Kibbutz is an agricultural farming community based on common
ownership of the means of production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
At the kibbutz, Jiang visited the dining hall, the home of a
kibbutz member, after being briefed on the history and current
situation of the collective farm.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived in Israel Wednesday on a state
visit. This is the first stop of Jiang's five-nation tour that will
also take him to Palestine, Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Adequate Attention to Disability-Related Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate has called on
the United Nations and all states to pay adequate attention to
disability-related concerns and to ensure the adoption of an
international convention on the rights of persons with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Thursday at the 56th session of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights, Sun Zhonghua, a representative of the
China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF), noted that less and
less importance had been attached by the U.N. system and some
member states to disability since 1992 when the U.N. Decade of
Disabled Persons terminated.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the momentum of the disabled people'
s rights movement shaped in the U.N. decade would be maintained
and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the CDPF had consistently supported and financed
the formulation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of
Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities and the monitoring of
the implementation of the rules. It also highly appreciated the
efforts made by the Special Rapporteur and the panel, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Sun said, the rules were not binding instruments and a
comprehensive convention composed of principles would be
complement to the rules providing guidelines and yardsticks.
</P>
<P>
"The group of persons with disabilities is the most vulnerable
group in all, and the problem of its marginalization is still to
be addressed," he said. "The disabled people need a convention to
promote and protect their human rights at least as urgently as
women and children do."
</P>
<P>
Sun believed that it was about the right time to consider the
elaboration of an international convention because leaders of most
influential international organizations of persons with
disabilities attended the World NGO Summit on Disability in March
this year and adopted the Beijing Declaration on the Rights of
People with Disabilities in the New Century, through which they
strongly urged the U.N. and the members states to adopt the
convention.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in 1999 the Organization of American States
adopted a regional convention to battle the discrimination against
persons with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
"I have to mention here that during the consultation on a
disability-related resolution at the 38th session of the
Commission for Social Development last February, the
representative of the United States kept opposing the expression
requesting the Special Rapporteur to make further explorations to
the possibilities of a convention," Sun said. "Besides, he refused
to accept the fact that persons with disabilities have special
needs or requirements. The ignorance in the disability field and
neglect showed by the U.S. government at consultations were really
surprising."
</P>
<P>
Sun hoped that all states could listen to the voice of persons
with disabilities because their legitimate request deserved a
positive response. What was more, the Beijing Declaration on the
Rights of People with Disabilities in New Century represented the
common desire of one tenth of the total population of the world,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Genocide Victims to Be Compensated with Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some of the Rwandan victims in
the 1994 genocide will be compensated with community service since
not all convicts own valuable property, according to Rwandan News
Agency report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said a study carried out in several prisons, showed
that 67 percent of the convicts were ready to pay compensation in
terms of community service, while 42 percent wanted to pay in
cash.
</P>
<P>
"Compensation should be paid if reconciliation is to be
attained and improve social wellbeing of genocide survivors", said
Frederick Mutagwera, the President of Ibuka association (a
genocide survivors association).
</P>
<P>
" People who had a hand in the genocide are ready to pay for
their crimes in a bid to reconcile", Prof. Gasibirege of the
National University of Rwanda said.
</P>
<P>
Gacaca courts (participatory justice) are set to establish a
prioritisation system for genocide victims supposed to receive
compensation; in order that, all deserving victims may benefit.
</P>
<P>
A number of cases have been heard and compensation orders
issued by court but no single compensation has been paid to
deserving victims. Most of the genocide perpetuators do not have
valuable property to pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
Some half million Rwandans were killed in the genocide in 1994.

JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The privatization of
state-owned assets will generate at least 40 billion rand (about
6.6 billion U.S. dollars) for South Africa over the next three
years, said Public Enterprises Minister Jeff Radebe in Cape Town

</P>
<P>
The bulk of money will come from foreign direct investment in
the "big four" state-owned enterprises, namely Eskom (
electricity), Transnet (transport), Telkom (telecommunication) and
Denel (the country's sole arms manufacturer), he said.
</P>
<P>
Introducing debate on his department's budget vote in the

program will be completed by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program will ensure that the government is
committed to enterprise restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a detailed restructuring plan and timetable has been
submitted to Cabinet and will be made public in May.
</P>
<P>
According to the restructuring plan, Transnet will be broken up
into a series of stand-alone transport businesses within 36 months
and Denel will be corporatized by October this year.

<P>
Over the period, a total of 5,749 cases of cholera and acute
diarrhoea had been notified in the capital city, she said.
</P>
<P>
It seems that in most cases the causative organism was not the
cholera vibrio, she said, citing that out of a sample of 300
people suffering from diarrhoea, it was found that only 15 percent
of them had the cholera vibrio.
</P>
<P>
She said most of the deaths could have been avoided if those
concerned had sought medical help immediately.
</P>
<P>
"People only go to the health units when they are already in a
serious condition," she said. "Sometimes it is difficult to do
anything because of the advanced state of the disease, and the
person ends up losing his life."
</P>
<P>
Ferreira urged Maputo residents to go to health unit as soon as
they start suffering from diarrhoea or fevers, since these could
be the symptoms of cholera or malaria.
</P>
<P>
The people should remain in a state of alert and maintain
maximum personal hygiene, she said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Introduce Value Added Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14(Xinhua) -- The Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA)
has declared that it will commence the Value Added Tax (VAT)
system in the country on November 1, 2000, Rwanda News Agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mutabingwa Aloys, RRA officer in charge of the technical and
legal affairs of the system, was quoted as saying, "this tax
serves the purpose of raising the much needed revenue for
government in the easiest and least painful way, by distributing
the tax burden amongst all consumers in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putting the VAT tax system in place has been one of the
objectives of this year's National Budget, Aloys said, noting that
it had earlier been planned to commence in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Donald Kaberuka, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning,
recently indicated that full participation of Rwanda in the zero
tariff regime of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
would be delayed for the purpose of putting such institutions as
VAT in place.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's neighbors, namely Uganda, Tanzania,and Kenya have
already put the taxation system in place.

<HEADLINE> Eritrean Refugees in Sudan to Be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea, Sudan and the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have recently signed an
agreement on the repatriation of some 160,000 Eritrean refugees in
Sudan over the next six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
Some of the refugees have been in exile in Sudan for as long as
30 years and their return is based on strictly voluntary nature,
said Director Albert-Alain Peters of the UNHCR Africa Bureau here
on Friday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He told the reporters that the UNHCR country representatives
across Africa, together with the directors of regional offices in
Abidjan, Nairobi and Pretoria, just concluded a three-day meeting
to review their progress in operations in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The UNCHR officials discussed the challenges they are facing,
including population displacement due to drought in the Horn of
Africa, the best care and asylum for those long-staying refugees
and the difficulty of raising funds for African operations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, they also decided to create rapid-response
teams for various tasks on the continent, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
Due to fighting and hunger, the number of refugees in southern
Sudan fleeing to neighboring Kenya and Uganda has doubled in the
past month, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR statistics, by the end of 1999, there had
been 3.52 million refugees across the African continent, and this
has not included the 941,100 internally displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Half Lebanese Live Below Poverty Line: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A survey indicates that nearly half
Lebanese families live in "ultra poverty" and more than two-thirds
are enduring below-average living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The survey, made by the General Labor Confederation (GLC) and
released on newspapers Friday, showed that 48 percent of families
were living under "ultra poverty" line.
</P>
<P>
The line was defined as a 592 U.S. dollar monthly salary for a
family of five. Meanwhile 68 percent of families live "at or
around" below-average conditions, which constitute a monthly salary
of 1,100 dollars for a five-member family without educational
expenses.
</P>
<P>
The GLC called on the government to take a "serious and radical
change in its economic policies" to redress the situation.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that, in the period between 1966 and now,
the prices of goods and services have increased 4,954 times. The
increase was more noticeable on certain spending items like
education compared to others like food.
</P>
<P>
But the wages and salaries which rose by only 2,069 percent from
1966 to 2000. The minimum wage in Lebanon presently stands at 200
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stresses Importance of Maintaining Talent Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Securing a healthy national
talent pool of highly trained scientists, technicians and
engineers is important in achieving national goals, said Neal Lane,
the U.S. president's science adviser, in a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the report titled "Ensuring a strong U.S. scientific,
technical, and engineering workforce in the 21st century," Lane
said an adequate reservoir of scientific, technical and
engineering (ST&AMP;E) resources, including human resources, is
indispensable in achieving important national goals, such as a
growing economy, strong defense, healthy population, safe
environment, and high quality of life for citizens.
</P>
<P>
Lane said many types of ST&AMP;E jobs are among the fastest growing
in the U.S. workforce, to the point that demand for workers has
outstripped supply and unemployment in science and engineering
occupations is quite low: about one-half the rate for the entire U.
S. workforce, a rate which itself is at historic low levels.
</P>
<P>
If current trends persist, Lane said, the United States may not
have all of the talent it will need to enable the innovation
process that has given America a strong economy and high quality
of life.
</P>
<P>
"There is already evidence that worker shortages are limiting
economic growth, and industry has repeatedly called for increases
in the visa quotas that allow technically skilled non-immigrants
to work in the United States," Lane said
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, worldwide socioeconomic trends and educational
developments will challenge the preeminence of the United States
in science, technology and engineering -- and challenge its
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Lane cautioned that because other nations also recognize the
importance to sustained economic growth of a highly skilled
workforce, there is fierce international competition for workers
in high-technology growth areas, such as electronics and
information technology, and in other industrial sectors that
increasingly depend on advances in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Lane concluded that if the United States is to maintain
leadership across the frontiers of science, the nation must draw
upon its own full talent pool to ensure its scientific and
technical workplace reflects the face of America.
</P>
<P>
"Since it takes many years to train a scientist or engineer,
the United States must invest now to guarantee the availability of
a skilled and competent workforce for the 21st century, and must
not only educate future ST&AMP;E workers but also provide continuing
education and retraining opportunities," said Lane.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Welcomes Russian Duma's Ratification of START-II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Sweden welcomes Russian State
Duma's ratification of the Russian-U.S. second-phase Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty (START-II), said Swedish Foreign Secretary
Anna Lindh on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of START-II is a step toward the nuclear
disarmament and brings hope to the start of a constructive
dialogue between Russia and the United States for the modification
of the treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
She hopes that Russia could complete the process of the
ratification of the START-II as soon as possible and urges Russia
to take further steps to ratify the treaty on the prohibition of
nuclear test and to reduce by big margin the number of tactical
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Lindh urges the United States to complete the
ratification of the START-II as soon as possible. She also hopes
that Russia and the United States can further reduce strategic and
tactical nuclear weapons during START-III.
</P>
<P>
Lindh said that Sweden's final objective is to have a nuclear-
free world.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready to Cut Nuclear Warheads to 1,500: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to cut down its
strategic stockpile of nuclear warheads to 1,500 instead of the
formerly proposed level of 2,000-2,500, announced Russian
President-elect Vladimir Putin on Friday after the State Duma
ratified the START-II treaty.
</P>
<P>
Russia is ready to reduce its strategic offensive armaments "
naturally on a mutual basis with the United States, to a lower
level than the one provided by the 1997 Helsinki understanding,"
Putin's press service said in an official statement.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of START-II opens the door to the launch of
official talks on the further cutting of Russian and American
strategic offensive armaments in the framework of START-II, it
said.
</P>
<P>
After Friday's Duma session, First Deputy Chief of Russia's
General Staff Colonel General Valery Manilov also said Russia is
ready to reduce its nuclear arsenal "drastically."
</P>
<P>
In recent decades, "the very criteria have changed of what is
unacceptable damage that nuclear weapons can do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Friday's ratification by Russia's lower house of parliament of
the START-II "demonstrates Russia's good will to create a nuclear-
free world and opens for all nuclear countries the way for further
act in accordance with the vector of reason," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He said ratifying a future START-III "would create a practical
platform for beginning a multilateral process of comprehensive
reduction and destruction of nuclear weapons with the involvement
of all nuclear and threshold states and countries possessing a
practical potential for creating nuclear weapons."

again publicly made evil remarks against China and the Chinese
people," Sun said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping's Daughter to Publish New Book on Her Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The youngest daughter of late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has written a soon-to-be-published
new book about her father which highlights his experiences during
the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
"My Father Deng Xiaoping -- Years in Cultural Revolution" was
penned by Xiao Rong, 50, who now serves as vice-president of the
China Association for International Friendly Contact, an non-
governmental organization in China.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that my book will enable people who have experienced
those times to turn the past around, and that it will help
strangers of history to understand it better," Rong said during an
intermission in activities marking the 10th anniversary of the
establishment of the Sasakawa Japan-China Friendship Fund at the
Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of writing the book is to do good for the future
of China," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
The book, which has about 300,000 Chinese characters, depicts
the suffering of Deng and his family, including the twists and
turns that occurred in his political career during the time. About
one-third of the content has never before been revealed to the
public.
</P>
<P>
"The Cultural Revolution was a real thing, and also a painful
lesson for the Party, state and the Chinese people," Xiao said. "
We cannot forget the history, however, we should focus more on how
to open up a new road toward developing the country and socialist
democracy as well as the rule by law."
</P>
<P>
Xiao started writing the book last May, and did extensive
research on the Cultural Revolution and a host of interviews with
some of the elder members of the Chinese leadership.
</P>
<P>
In her previous book, "My Father Deng Xiaoping" published in
1993, Xiao detailed Deng's life from his birth to the founding of
the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"The first book seems to be more historical, and the second
tells readers of my own personal experience," she said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao, born in Chongqing, the capital city of southwest China's
Sichuan Province, studied in a middle school in Beijing at the
beginning of the Cultural Revolution, and then worked in a
countryside in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. She was
reunited with her family in 1970.

NANJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The El Paso, Texas, Rose
Cultivators Association, headed by Dr. B. Merrell Frazer,
presented 160 roses to the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall today.

the Nanjing Massacre of 1937.
</P>
<P>
Texas is a well-known rose cultivation base in the United
States, and giving roses to the memorial hall demonstrates the
American people's wish for everlasting world peace, Dr. Frazer
said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1937, the Japanese army massacred 300,000 Chinese
civilians and soldiers in Nanjing, then the capital of the

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader Rejects U.S.-Style Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Friday rejected any U.S.-style reforms, saying that
Iran's reforms are based on Islam and the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The political or social reforms that the U.S. government wants
to see in Iran are naturally incompatible with Islam and are
certainly despised by Iranian people, Khamenei said at the Friday
prayers in downtown Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
He said the Islamic regime needs reforms in the administrative,
judicial and economic fields as long as there are the slightest
flaws in any aspect of the society, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he claimed that Washington was "opposed to true reforms
in Iran."
</P>
<P>
"All they want are U.S.-style reforms," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami has been pushing for
a variety of social, political and economic reforms since his 1997
election, but his agenda has frequently been stymied by
conservatives, who dominate most of the sensitive state organs.
</P>
<P>
The country has been experiencing high tensions and factional
struggles following the overwhelming victory of the reformists
allied with Khatami in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
A prominent reformist advisor to Khatami was seriously wounded
in an abortive assassination attempt in March, and pressures have
been mounting on the pro-reform press as a number of newspaper
managing directors and journalists were summoned by hard-line
courts.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei accused the U.S. of "seeking to inculcate their own
interpretations of reforms into the minds of Iranian people for
purely private purposes."
</P>
<P>
The Americans do not really advocate reforms in Iran because
they are basically against the 1979 Islamic revolution at its
foundation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that some people in Iran were only repeating the
wishes of the Americans, threatening to "divulge the names of those
people who were promoting the schemes of the country's enemies."

<HEADLINE> World Evolves From Unipolar to Multipolar Singapore Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs S. Jayakumar said here Friday that the world evolves from
a unipolar toward a multipolar one and Asia and Europe should join
their efforts to strengthen the linkages and cooperation between
the two important regions.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar, who doubles as the minister for law, made the
remarks at the opening dinner of the Third Europe-Asia Forum
attended by some 50 representatives from Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM)
member countries for discussions on economic recovery in Asia
following the Asian financial crisis, new economic development in
Europe, prospects for Asia-Europe cooperation and topics
concerning the ASEM summit to be held in Seoul, South Korea, in
October.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar told the forum, which will end Saturday, that East
Asia and Europe should cooperate to facilitate the transition to a
multipolar world from a unipolar one following the end of the Cold
War as the world is likely to evolve in this century toward a
multipolar world with the United States, the European Union (EU),
East Asia, Latin America and Russia as poles.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by 1996 combined strength of the 10 East Asian
countries and the United States each accounted for 25 percent of
the world gross domestic product and the EU 29 percent of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the two-way trade between the EU and East Asia was
greater than that between the EU and the United States and the EU
economy is larger than that of the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of globalization, Jayakumar said Asia and Europe must
brace themselves to embrace globalization, to seize the
opportunities of the new economy, to overcome challenges and to
contribute to the creation of a multi-cultural world.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Third ASEM Summit, the minister expected some
possible deliverables around ASEM's three pillars -- business and
economics, people to people cooperation and political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In the field of economics, he said the first is for all ASEM
countries to strongly reaffirm their commitment to the
multilateral trading system, which the WTO ministerial meeting at
Seattle, the United States, last year failed to launch, and the
second is to strengthen the existing Europe-Asia Business Forum.
</P>
<P>
On people to people cooperation, he urged more efforts to forge
greater linkages between people in Asia and Europe and
fundamentally reform their education system.
</P>
<P>
On political dialogue, Jayakumar suggested that ASEM's
political dialogue should begin with global political and security
issues which are of concern to all ASEM partners.
</P>
<P>
ASEM came into being four years ago when 16 EU leaders and 10
East Asian leaders held their first summit in Bangkok, Thailand.
That summit launched the process of building a new comprehensive
partnership between East Asia and Western Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Surge in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices jumped 0.
7 percent in March, the biggest gain in almost a year, led by
sharp increases in gasoline and other energy prices, the Labor
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the department's Consumer Price Index, the most
closely watched inflation gauge, was the largest since last April,
when consumer prices also rose by 0.7 percent. Many analysts were
anticipating the consumer prices would rise 0.5 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The surge stemmed from a 4.9 percent increase in energy prices,
the largest since last April.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation rose 0.4 percent, the strongest increase in five
years. The core rate rose twice as fast as many analysts were
expecting. The government said rising prices for housing,
transportation and household furnishings accounted for most of the
increase.
</P>
<P>
In February, consumer prices rose 0.5 percent, reflecting
sharply higher energy costs, while the core inflation rate went up
by a mild 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The consumer inflation report comes one day after the
government said inflation at the wholesale level in March shot up
by 1 percent, but the spike was limited to higher energy prices.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 5.8 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for all of 1999.
The pickup in this year's prices mostly reflects rising energy
costs.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates five times since
June 30 to slow the supercharged economy and keep inflation under
control. Given the outlook for strong continuing growth, many
analysts believe the central bank will nudge up rates again on May
16.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said that U.S.
businesses boosted their stockpiles of goods on shelves and
backlogs by 0.5 percent and sales grew by 0.3 percent in February.
Both figures were in line with analysts' expectations.

<HEADLINE> West Africa Donates for Mozambican Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Five West African countries
-- Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, Benin and Togo -- have
joined hands to grant one million French Francs to help the flood
victims of Mozambique, the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
said in a press release available on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A three-man delegation representing the Conseil de I'Entente
(an organization grouping the five West African countries)
delivered Thursday a check to the Mozambican government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the handover ceremony, Tanoh Miamke Djohn,
secretariat of the Conseil de I'Entente, said the West African
countries leaders made the donation as a mark of solidarity with
those affected by the recent flood in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
In response, OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim spoke
highly the donation from the West African countries, saying the
action represents yet another manifestation of attachment of
African leaders to the collective welfare of African peoples.

<HEADLINE> Some 1.3 Million Need Food Aid in Southeast Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 1.3 million drought
victims are waiting for relief in the Ethiopian town of Gode, some
600 kilometers southeast of the capital Addis Ababa, Catherine
Bertini, executive director of the Rome-based World Food Program
(WFP), said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bertini, who visited the town on Wednesday, told a press
conference that many people in the town are dying of
malnourishment,
</P>
<P>
The WFP chief said she could not give specific number of death
in the drought stricken area.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that about 400 people in and around
Gode died daily in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to Bertini, the Ethiopian regional government and
many non- governmental organizations have established relief
centers to distribute relief food and medicine to the drought
victims.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts by the aid workers, many people including
 children who were struggling for lives have survived, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are making assessment as soon as possible about drought
situation in Ethiopia," Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to security problems that are believed to hamper the
relief operation, Bertini said that she had consulted with
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi over the problem.
</P>
<P>
Bertini said to use troops to protect relief operation in some
dangerous areas would be "very very last choice".
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of expanding airlift relief operation in the
drought- stricken areas, the WFP chief said although the
International Committee of Red Cross has begun airlifting food and
medicine to Gode, it could not be the base for the relief program
because there are too many people waiting to be served.
</P>
<P>
Bertini, sent by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to
make field assessment of the current drought situation in the Horn
of Africa, will leave for Djibouti on Saturday and visit Eritrea
and Kenya later on.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 16 million people in the Horn of
Africa are affected by the drought and facing starvation.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Member States of PCB Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission warned
on Friday 14 of the European Union's 15 member states of the
problem of polychlorinated biphenyls disposal.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the union, sent warning
letters to all member states but Finland for their failure to
comply with the commission's provisions about PCB disposal.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, only Finland abided by the requirement of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Polychlorinated biphenyls are highly toxic and persistent
hazardous chemicals that have the tendency to bio-accumulate in
living tissues.
</P>
<P>
"Strict control of PCBs is essential," said EU Environment
Commissioner Margot Wallstrom, "particularly to respond to the
public's concern and prevent these substances from finding their
way into the food chain."
</P>
<P>
Though the production of polychlorinated biphenyls has been
banned and their use has been restricted, PCBs are still widely
present in transformers and capacitors where they are used as
dielectric fluids.
</P>
<P>
PCBs are also used in building materials, carbonless copy paper,
lubricants, surface coatings, adhesives, plasticizers, sealants
and inks.
</P>
<P>
The commission has asked the union member states to streamline
their legislation on the decontamination and disposal of equipment
containing PCBs and to compile inventories of equipment with PCB
volumes above a certain threshold and to report back to the
commission before September 1999.

<HEADLINE> EU Widens Ban on Animal Feed Production From Sludge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Residues of urban, domestic and
industrial waste water from all stages of treatment are now
prohibited from the production of animal feed, the European Union
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, actually widened the ban by re-defining what sewage sludge
is in that the existing prohibition on the recycling of sewage
sludge in animal feed had been interpreted differently in the past
by EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The new prohibition of all wastes from urban, domestic and
industrial waste water treatment plants is irrespective of the
origin or of any further processing of the waste water.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of animal feed materials from process waters in
slaughterhouses and other food or feed industry plants, however,
is made subject to detailed hygiene measures.
</P>
<P>
Feed materials recovered from process water from
slaughterhouses and other food or feed industry plants may still
be used but only under very strict conditions, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Process water conduits must be separated from waste water
collection systems. If using water, they must use clean water or
sea water for fish.
</P>
<P>
David Byrne, EU consumer protection commissioner, said that the
principle that the prohibition of using sewage sludge in animal
nutrition covers all possible residues obtained from the different
steps in the waste water purification treatment process had been
firmly established.
</P>
<P>
"To gain the public's trust, we must be totally clear about
what materials may and may not be used in the production of animal
feed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The commission decided to act after media reported last summer
that sludge from waste water treatment plants was recycled for use
in animal feed.

MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communis Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov described the ratification of START-II by the
State Duma, lower house of parliament, as "a historical mistake"
and "another defeat for Russia."
</P>
<P>
"Our opponents in the Duma have military discipline," he said,

Commenting on the results of the State Duma voting, Zyuganov

Now the Communist leader is said to expect his political
opponents "to sell out the land" and take other decisions "equally
ruinous for the country."
</P>
<P>
At Friday's session, almost all Duma factions, except
Communists, Agrarians, voted for START-II ratification
</P>
<P>
The State Duma supported the pact ratification 288-131 with
four abstentions. The necessary majority was 226.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ratification of START-II Meets Russia's Interests: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The ratification of the 1993
Russian-U.S. second-phase Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START-
II) meets Russia's national interests, said Russian President-
elect Vladimir Putin following the approval of the pact by the
State Duma on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the voting, Putin told the press in the Duma that the
decision "fully meets the national interests of Russia and permits
it not only to keep its nuclear force, but also channel the
necessary funds for maintaining the combat readiness of
conventional armed forces."
</P>
<P>
"Not merely do I welcome it, but I actively support the Duma
decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
On further steps in this sphere, he said the ball was now in
the American court.
</P>
<P>
"Our counterparts in the talks should take further steps. We
are developing good conditions for strengthening international
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia does not need a new arms race at all, Putin stressed
when he showed up in the parliament before the voting to urge
deputies to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Putting off the ratification of START-II, on which the future
of our strategic nuclear forces depends, would be undesirable and
harmful and lead to absurd expenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, with START-II or without, Russia's heavy rockets will
have to be destroyed in seven to 10 years because of their
degradation, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, if Russia ratifies the treaty, the balance of global
forces will be maintained and Washington will be compelled to
ratify START-III, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If, in the wake of our ratification of START-II linked to the
1997 agreements on differentiating strategic and non-strategic ABM
systems, the United States dismantles the 1972 ABM Treaty, we will
pull out of the system of treaty relations on the limitation of
and control over strategic and conventional arms, "said Putin.
</P>
<P>
"We may also think of revising our commitments on tactical arms,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Ratification will make it possible for Russia to reduce
excessive costs and focus limited funds on new arms so as to make
the armed forces more efficient and combat-ready in light of the
fact that Russia now faces local conflicts, Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Cases to Rise 70 Percent by 2015 in Canada: Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of cancer cases will
rise by 70 percent by 2015 in Canada despite remarkable progress
achieved in fighting the disease, the Canadian Cancer Society
warned in its 12th annual report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The society expects 132,100 new cases of cancer this year, up 2
percent from the estimated 129,300 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Canada is facing more cancer cases because of its aging
population and other factors involving heredity, hormonal changes,
food, environment, lack of exercise and smoking.
</P>
<P>
Smoking and obesity are linked to about 60 percent of all
cancers in the report, which pointed out in particular that,
smoking is the reason why lung cancer remains a top killer disease
among both sexes.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer incidence and mortality rates among women continue
to climb and are almost five times as high as those of 1971. Up to
8,400 women are expected to be diagnosed with lung cancer this
year with a death toll of 7,000.
</P>
<P>
Smoking rates are still increasing in the 15-to-19-year age
group and it is higher among young women than young men, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the society stated that Canadians are gaining ground
on several fronts in the battle against cancer as death rates drop
for children, women with breast cancer and men with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to better treatments, death rates for childhood cancers
have fallen by more than 50 percent since the early 1950s, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Very few children survived childhood leukemia 40 years ago, but
today approximately 80 percent of Canadian children suffering from
the disease are alive five years after diagnosis, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer death rates have dropped by 25 percent among
women aged 50 to 69 since 1985 and are at the lowest level since
1950. The trend is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer death rates among men have declined by 24 percent
since 1986 as a result of a drop in smoking rates that began two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The society described early detection as the key to treating
cancer, citing a more accurate mammography and a new form of
prostate specific antigen testing as encouraging work in this area.

BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union approved a
humanitarian aid to Mozambique on Friday to assist victims of the
recent floods in the African country.

<HEADLINE> New Network Solution Debuts on Chinese Campuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A new network solution that is
expected to improve information exchange on campuses made its
trial run in three Chinese universities today.
</P>
<P>
CampusAge, created by a group of Qinghua University students,
was designed to remedy the inconvenience and limited flow of
information on campuses by providing students with on-line
services and news releases about their schools.
</P>
<P>
Using 6.6 million yuan in funding, the Qinghua students put
their studies on hold in January to start a new Internet website,
FanSo.com.
</P>
<P>
The young entrepreneurs believe that revealing campus culture
to the outside will help the public know more about students'
needs, and will promote the development of e-commerce on campus.
</P>
<P>
A report from the China Internet Network Information Center
said that China had 10 million netizens by March this year; 21
percent are college students.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association

friendship between the two countries can be traced back for
decades. Indonesia is among the first countries which recognized
new China after its founding in 1949.
</P>

ago.
</P>
<P>
As both are developing countries, there is still potential to

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Tax Reform in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The overhaul of taxation and
government fees in the countryside is another major reform in
rural China, following the land reform in the 1950s and the two-
decade-old household contract responsibility system initiated in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The new plan is aimed at standardizing the interests of the
state, the collective and farmers in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao made the announcement during an
inspection tour in eastern Anhui Province from April 11-13.
</P>
<P>
The reform will reduce pressure on farmers and is certain to
boost economic development and social stability in the countryside,
Wen said.
</P>
<P>
He urged local Communist Party of China committees and
governments at different levels to recognize the importance of the
reform, understand the decision of the central leadership, and
support the changes.

<P>
Though the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China have
different political views, they all recognize the one-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
"Annette Lu takes for granted that the Taiwan election can
change the reality that Taiwan is a part of China, and yet she has
ignored the fact and is pursuing a road to Taiwan independence
that leads to a dead end."
</P>
<P>
Peaceful reunification is the common wish of the people across
the straits. "To realize this goal, no one can waver from the one-
China principle," the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who shakes off the one-China principle has tampered
with the bottom line of peaceful reunification," warns the article.
</P>
<P>
It notes that Lu's fallacious remarks had the same aim as Lee
Tung-hui's "state-to-state relations" remarks, both attempting to
challenge the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
All people should yield to historical trend on the matter of
Taiwan. "We warn anyone who advocates Taiwan independence,
including Annette Lu, that Lee Tung-hui's separatist stance will
lead to a dead end," says the article.
</P>
<P>
If Annette Lu and other people who share her beliefs
underestimate the Chinese people's determination and the People's
Liberation Army's strength to resolve the Taiwan issue and put the
welfare of the 23 million Taiwan people at stake, the consequences
will be disastrous, it says.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan independence means war. "Anyone who pays no heed to this
important information from us and insists on Taiwan independence
will push Taiwan into the abyss of war and bring disaster to the
Taiwan people," the article concludes.

<HEADLINE> Contracted Overseas Investment in Guangdong Shows Sharp Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Contracted overseas investment
in South China's Guangdong province hit 2.32 billion US dollars in
the first quarter this year, 41.3 percent up in a year-on-year
comparison, a spokesman for foreign trade in the province said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas investors are robustly active and the number of new
contracts of overseas investments has been skyrocketing," Liao
Guoji said in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The province bordering Hong Kong netted a total of 3,356
overseas investment contracts in the first quarter of 2000, a jump
of 41.3 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds actually put into use in the first three months
reached 2.5 billion US dollars, down 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the new contracts, 853 were overseas direct investments (ODI)
, 43.6 percent up over last year, and ODI volume reached 1.83
billion US dollars, a 54.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in overseas investment contracts this year
was a U-turn from the past two years, when the province was deeply
affected by the Asian financial crisis, Liao said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investments in Guangdong mainly came from Hong Kong,
Macao, Taiwan, and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Buick to Lead Price Cuts for China's Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- In the lead up to China's
expected entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
Shanghai GM Automobile Co. announced today it will slash prices
for its three models of Buick sedans by an average 20,000 yuan (
about 2,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The prices for the cars, ranging from 318,000 to 369,000 yuan,
will be adjusted to between 295,000 to 350,000 yuan, the joint
venture of the U.S.-based General Motors in Shanghai said.
</P>
<P>
Due to government protection, automobiles in China have been
overpriced despite gradual price cuts in recent years, and many
anxious car-buyers are hesitating to dig into their wallets now,
fearing that car prices will plummet further after China joins the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The lower prices will trigger more competition among China's
auto manufacturers, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The GM venture began official mass production of the Buick
sedans in Shanghai a year ago.

<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow's People's Liberation
Army Daily will carry a bylined article refuting Annette Lu's pro-
Taiwan independence remarks.
</P>
<P>
The cross-straits relationship was at a turning point after
Taiwan's new leaders were elected last month, it says, adding that
at this crucial moment, Annette Lu has perversely advocated Taiwan
independence, which sends a dangerous signal and foolishly
challenges the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
"All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and
armed police are paying close attention to her remarks," it says.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with a Hong Kong cable TV, Annette Lu
openly supported independence for Taiwan, spreading the air that "
No one can deny Taiwan has independent sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that the relationship between the mainland and
Taiwan is historically one of "distant relatives," and
geographically they are nothing more than "close neighbors."
</P>
<P>
The article also points out that it is clear to everyone that
she is a traitor who has lost all feelings of loyalty and respect
for her motherland, and her actions are unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
Anyone with knowledge of Chinese history knows that Taiwan is
an inseparable part of China, and Taiwan compatriots are family
members of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan people are Chinese and the people at the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits belong to one family -- they are not merely "
relatives" or "neighbors," stresses the article.
</P>
<P>
"A part of China's ancestors moved to the island of Taiwan,
worked hard on the land and fought bravely against invaders, which
are facts commonly acknowledged by all the world," it says.

<HEADLINE> Online Venture Capital Industry Emerges in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Internet will become the tool
of choice for developing China's venture capital industry which
has been growing very fast these days, experts said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar covering issues of the newly-emerged online
venture capital industry held today, overseas investors and
representatives from domestic investment groups agreed that the
Internet will have profound influence on the traditional venture
capital industry and technology innovation in China.
</P>
<P>
The Internet has proved a very efficient medium for linking
buyers and sellers, and also can be used in the process of
obtaining start-up funding for companies.
</P>
<P>
China's venture capital industry started in 1985, and the
country's first website on venture capital opened in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Yan Zhubing, president of the Beijing City Commercial Bank (
BCCB), said at the seminar that venture capital has already
stimulated China's technology innovation, and is acknowledged by
most investors.
</P>
<P>
Seminar participants agreed that the online venture capital
industry has found a new base for expansion since the Internet is
flourishing in China.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar was co-held by the BCCB, a management college
of Canada, China's Young Entrepreneur Association and the China

NANNING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- German brewer Hans Stecker was
awarded "Golden Embroidered Ball" by the government of the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region here today for his contributions to a
local brewery.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zhuang ethnic tradition, young women used to
be given a fist-sized embroidered ball by their boyfriends as a
symbol of love, and these days it represents friendship.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old beer brewing expert came to Liuzhou City of
Guangxi last year to spread brewing techniques and offer materials
used by his family, which helped the Yufeng Beer Plant to
significantly improve product quality.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter this year, the brewery sold 800 tons of
the new beer, which has been widely praised for its flavor.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Embroidered Ball Prize was created in 1994 for
foreign experts working in Guangxi. Seventy-one have been
presented so far.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Release Hostages in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The extremist Muslim rebel group,
Abu Sayyaf, released Friday two of their 31 hostages in the
southern Philippines after receiving 100 sacks of rice delivered
by the government, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, National Security Adviser Alexander
Aguirre confirmed the release of the two young girls held by the
Muslim rebels in Basilan, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
According to Aguirre, one of two girls is 11 years old and the
other nine. He said the release of the two hostages was due to the
collective effort of a mediation team.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three people, mostly teachers and students, were seized
by the Abu Sayyaf group on March 20, after a brief encounter
between the rebel group and the government forces.
</P>
<P>
"With the sending of the mediation team, the Basilan Crisis
Management Committee (CMC) had complied with the initial demands
of the Abu Sayyaf as a show of our desire to resolve the problem
through peaceful means," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the Abu Sayyaf group has reportedly made
known their demands in exchange for the release of all the
remaining 29 hostages still in their hands.
</P>
<P>
Among their demands are the delivery of 200 sacks of rice and
release of their comrades held at the Basilan jail, media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Aguirre, the peaceful efforts of the Basilan CMC
have resulted in the release of 26 hostages, including relatives
of Abu Sayyaf head Khaddafy Janjalani. Janjalani's relatives were
held captive by another Muslim group in retaliation for the Abu
Sayyaf hostage-taking move last month.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, there are still 39 hostages remaining in the hands
of the two groups, Aguirre said.

COLOMBO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- At least three Sri Lankan
military personnel including one officer were killed and 12
soldiers wounded on Friday when a vehicle carrying them got caught
in a rebel pressure mine explosion in northern Wanni region.
</P>

The Ministry of Defense said in a statement that the troops
were returning from a search operation at Awarantalawa, some 250
kilometers north of Colombo, where they had gone to counterattack
the rebels who had attacked a home guard point there Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
It said rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
killed one home guard in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the rebels appeared to have used the
attack on the home guard point as a bait to draw the army into the
mine trap.
</P>
<P>
The injured soldiers were evacuated to a nearby Vavuniya
hospital for treatment, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense said Friday that at least 15
LTTE rebels had been killed in the latest clashes in the
northernmost Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have intensified
their offensives in recent weeks in a bid to take back their
former stronghold of Jaffna, which they lost in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Food Situation Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- As the Horn of Africa
especially Ethiopia was being hit by a severe famine, Tanzania
said its the food situation in the 1999/2000 season is stable.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives William
Kusila was quoted by local newspaper Business Times on Friday as
saying that the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) was 103,000 tons,
the highest ever record.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on earlier reports that Tanzania was facing a
shortage of at least 350,000 tons of foodstuffs, Kusial said they
only took into account the stock of maize without considering
other cereals.
</P>
<P>
"Some times food shortages is exaggerated due to giving little
consideration to other cereals !- in fact, we have plenty of other
cereals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kusila said that apart from the Central and Lake Victoria zones
being threatened by severe drought, Tanzania anticipates a good
field performance in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the farmers to use the current rains to
capitalize on drought-resistant crops like cassava, millet and
sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
He said a long-term solution to curb food shortages in the
future "can be achieved only when farmers match government efforts
in keeping enough stocks during good harvests-rather than using
precious grains to make local brews for cultural dances, etc".
</P>
<P>
In a recent report on the Food Supply Situation and Crop
Prospects in sub-Saharan Africa, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization said that nearly 16 million people need emergency
food aid in drought-stricken East Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The number of people needing assistance could increase, as
crop weather forecasts are discouraging," it said.
</P>
<P>
In drought-stricken Ethiopia, 8 million people face severe food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Kenya also has to take care of 2.7 million of its people who
are in need of food assistance.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Firm on Quitting COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has reaffirmed its
decision to quit the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), the local Guardian newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Industry and Commerce Iddi Simba told a visiting
COMESA delegation on Thursday that it was not in the best
interests of Tanzania to be simultaneously a member of the East
African Community (EAC), the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and COMESA.
</P>
<P>
"COMESA, SADC and EAC are all regional bodies with common goals
of establishing a common market and ultimately, if we can, a
common currency," Simba said in the designated new capital of
Dodoma in central Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Tanzania could not remain in all the three
regional blocs because it would have to adopt three individual
stands when negotiating with other regional organization and the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, head of the COMESA delegation and the Chairman of
COMESA Council of Ministers Nicholas Biwott said the regional
grouping had made tremendous progress in addressing problems
facing Tanzania and many other members.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is one of the founder members of COMESA, and like
many countries, it has concerns on its national interests," said
Biwott, who is also Kenya's Minister for Tourism, Trade and
Industry. "That is why COMESA is doing everything possible to
address these concerns."
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Industry Moses
Ali said that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni had agreed to
persuade Tanzania to remain a member of COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said
in Nairobi that Tanzania's decision to quit COMESA has not been
approved.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said Tanzania had reasons other than the concern that
deeper tariff cuts under COMESA's zero tariff rate program would
adversely affect its revenues and undermine local industries.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Tanzania's decision to quit the regional bloc
has raised fears that other COMESA members, who have dual
membership with SADC, may want out due to the problem of
duplication.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania announced decision to pull out of the 21-nation COMESA
in July last year because of a plan to reduce tariffs for member
countries by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
COMESA leaders agreed in May last year to cut internal tariffs
to 10 percent of prior levels, and restated their aim to phase out
tariffs among member states by October 2000.

SEOUL, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea found new cases of foot-
and-mouth disease Friday in Hongsong, South Chungchong Province, 1.
5 kilometers from where the first case of the epidemic was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
Epidemic control authorities said three of the 21 heads of

This brings the total number of such cases in the country to 57.
The disease, dubbed Livestock AIDS, causes blisters on the mouth
and hoofs of livestock.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Justice Department declined to take action Thursday
after the great-uncle of Elian Gonzalez defied a government order
and refused to surrender the 6-year-old boy, pushing the
international custody dispute into another day amid escalating
tension in Miami and mounting anger from Elian's Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday delivered the most
vigorous and sustained defense yet of the scandals that have
marred his administration, saying that he does not want or need
pardon for possible perjury charges and that he is still waiting
for journalists to report that the Whitewater investigation "was a
lie and a fraud from the beginning."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The UN Security Council Thursday approved a streamlined arms
inspection commission for Iraq, which has belittled the plan.
Russia warned that it would be watching for any inspector who
might be troublesome to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
-- Texas Governor George W. Bush met with a dozen gay
Republicans Thursday and said that he was a "better person," but
he was still opposed to gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Nasdaq dropped 92.85 points, or 2.46 percent, to 3676.78
after spending most of the day in positive territory. The Dow
Jones industrials also weakened, falling 201.58 to 10923.55.
Market volatility has been extreme, partly because of momentum
investing and Internet.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. House Republicans Thursday passed a 1.83 trillion
dollars budget largely on party lines, and the Senate is due to
quickly follow suit. The spending plan is intended to provide
ammunition for fall races, but many backfire.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Over 10,000 Firms Operating in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 5,942 companies from 67 countries and
regions had invested more than 29.4 billion U.S. dollars in Pudong,
with some 100 of the world's 500 leading multinationals among them.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, big names such as Bell, GM, Hewlett-Packard, and
Lucent, as well as a number of other corporations, added
additional investment totaling 377 million U.S. dollars to their
holdings there.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, multinationals chose large enterprises in
Shanghai as their partners, giving a boost to industrial
restructuring in the city and revitalizing a number of loss-making
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more than 5,180 firms from other parts of
China have established subsidiaries in Pudong. By the end of 1999,
their registered capital in the area had amounted to 19.4 billion
yuan (about 2.34 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Wenzhou People's Electronic Appliance Group established a
production base in Pudong with an investment of 100 million yuan,
while Chunlan, Shanshan, Hongdou, and other well-known Chinese
companies have established research and development centers in the
area.
</P>
<P>
After ten years of development, Pudong has created several
pillar industries dealing in electronic information, automobiles,
pharmaceuticals, opto-electro-mechanical integration,
petrochemicals, and consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
Pudong's gross domestic product climbed to 80 billion yuan in
1999 from six billion yuan a decade ago, and goods made in Pudong
have entered more than 130 countries and regions worldwide. Last
year, the area's exports reached 6.67 billion U.S. dollars, up 23
percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Investors say Pudong not only offers tax incentives, but now
also has a world-class investment environment.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang to Help 60,000 Disabled Out of Poverty This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The coastal province of Zhejiang in
east China will double efforts to make sure that some 60,000 poor
disabled have access to the basic necessities of life through
special projects this year, said a local welfare official today.
</P>
<P>
This goal will be realized through a special project to help
these disabled people get fund and master techniques necessary for
starting their own businesses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 local people have pledged to take part in the
project by helping 10,000 disabled people engage in planting,
processing and cottage industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Through this effort, the disabled will learn new techniques and
be able to earn their own livings, he added.
</P>
<P>
Among the two million disabled people in Zhejiang, five percent
of the province's population, more than 200,000 have now escaped
poverty and have regular jobs.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to aid from governmental departments, social groups, and
individuals from all walks of life, the number of poor disabled
people in the province has decreased from 400,000 two decades ago
to 145,000 at present.

<HEADLINE> China to Tackle Sandstorms to Protect Beijing's Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out a plan to
tackle desertification and pollution in the northern part of the
country, especially in areas around the capital, to make a clean
Beijing, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Guo Peizhang, from the State Development Planning Commission (
SDPC), said today that the duststorms and contaminated water in
regions north of Beijing are posing an enormous threat to the
capital's environment.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC initiated a plan to tackle the issue a year ago,
calling government departments in Beijing and neighboring Hebei
Province to improve the environment in periphery areas of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The plan provides concrete measures to protect the environment
such as tightening regulations and supervision over the management
of resources, return of farmland to grass and forests and
application of eco-technologies.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been bit by severe sandstorms this spring showering
the city with dust and sand.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Become Link Between China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China will make Macao a transfer
station and exchange center of economic and trade ties between
China and Portuguese-speaking countries, Assistant Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation He Xiaowei said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told participants of the Beijing-Macao International
Business Forum that Macao's position as a bridge linking the
mainland and Portuguese-speaking countries offers it a unique
advantage for developing foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's trade volume with Portuguese-speaking countries last
year was only 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, and the investment scale
remained small.
</P>
<P>
"China and Portuguese-speaking countries share broad prospects
in trade, investment, contract engineering and labor cooperation,"
he said, pointing out that Macao will undoubtedly function as a
vital link when China enhances ties with those countries.
</P>
<P>
Macao and Portuguese-speaking countries, which have ties for
many years, maintain a steady flow of information back and forth,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that Macao, as a formal member of the World Trade
Organization, has advantages in market access, finance and
insurance.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese army has reached
international levels in clearing mines, according to army sources.

<HEADLINE> China's Population to Increase by 10 Million Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's total population will
increase by more than 10 million each year in the next ten years,
reaching a peak of 1.6 billion by the middle of the 21st century,
officials with the State Family Planning Commission said here
today.
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy for China to maintain the slow growth rate of
its vast population, which now stands at 12.5 billion, because it
hit the current growth level in just 30 years, far less than the
100 years such growth would require in developed countries, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the birth control policy must continue to be
enforced to prevent the instability that could emerge because of a
massive population.
</P>
<P>
Poor economic conditions in many areas of the country are
another major obstacle facing the success of the birth control
policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe China's population will gradually shrink
after the mid-21st century.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Lily Yam, secretary for the
environment and food of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said here Friday that the SAR government has a
comprehensive package of measures to deal with air pollution
problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after delivering a speech to an
Australian Chamber of Commerce luncheon, Yam said Hong Kong's
capital spending on the environment increased from 610 million HK
dollars (78,205 U.S. dollars) in 1989 to nearly 4 billion HK
dollars (512,820 U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that the government has various measures
to deal with air pollution problems, including a plan to convert
taxis here to the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as fuel.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the smooth implementation of the LPG taxi conversion
scheme, we need to provide sufficient LPG filling facilities in
convenient locations," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel, she said Hong Kong
already has the most stringent fuel and vehicle emission standards
in Asia and the government is in support of the idea of
introducing ultra-low sulfur diesel for diesel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Also, the government actively supports other initiatives to
develop clean fuel and related technologies, including trolley
buses, natural gas and, in the longer run, fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
On the enforcement front, she said the police are stepping up
action against smoky vehicles and the Customs and Excise
Department has intensified its attack against the use of illicit
diesel.
</P>
<P>
On legislation, Yam said the government would soon move a
resolution in the Legislative Council on an increase in the fixed
penalty for smoking vehicles.

CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian banking system, excluding the Central
Bank, had total deposits of 246.832 billion Egyptian pounds (71.98
billion U.S. dollars) by January 2000 against 246.071 billion
pounds (71.76 billion dollars) in December l999.
</P>
<P>
The monthly release issued by the Central bank's General
Administration for Economic Research showed that the total
government deposits in January hit 36.021 billion pounds (10.5
billion dollars) while non-government deposits reached 210.811
billion pounds (61.48 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Algeria's grain yield this season is expected to sink
to 2.1 million tons, the same as last season, according to a report
by Al-Haiyat.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Algerian officials, the report said that severe drought
had caused the drop in grain yield as the southern parts of the
country harvested nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicated Algerian grain output in 1998 hit 3.
25 million tons, then dropped to 2.1 million tons in 1999 due to
the lack of rain.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Algerian government resorted to foreign markets
to meet the local demand, spending 600-800 million dollars on grain
imports, according to Algerian Imports Supervision Bureau.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank offered to provide to the Egyptian
government a loan of 220 million dollars to finance a number of
infrastructure and education-oriented projects over 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Khalid Ikram, World Bank representative in Egypt,
Egyptian daily Al-Ahram said the proposed funding came within the
WB role in boosting Egyptian economic policies.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Finance Minister Medhat Hassaneen said the
present policy against foreign borrowing will be dropped to allow
the government to conclude a number of packages with foreign
funding institutions.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian daily Al-Wafd quoted the minister as saying that Egypt
would get 2 billion dollars in foreign loans during the coming
period, pointing out that the government had to pay a 11.5-percent
interest rate on internal debt whereas the foreign loans cost the
country just around 3.5 percent in loan service every year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- DuPont Co. of the United States and Sabanci Holding AS
of Turkey announced to build a new tire factory in South America,
reported Turkish Daily News on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands AL Intervention to Halt U.S., British Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has informed the Arab League
(AL) of the recent bombings and airspace violations by the United
States and Britain, urging the pan-Arab forum to intervene to halt
such aggressions, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to AL Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz elaborated the bombings and
violations by U.S. and British planes on April 2-9, when the U.S.
and British jets carried out 166 armed sorties from their bases in
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Aziz condemned these aggressions, stressing that they represent
a continuation of a "hostile trend" by the U.S. and Britain against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz urged the AL chief to intervene to help stop the continued
aggressive acts against Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The AL has denounced the recent U.S. and British air raids
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on April 8, the AL said the air raids by
the U.S. and Britain against Iraq were carried out without the
authorization of the United Nations Security Council and therefore
were "unjustifiable" and "a flagrant violation" of the Iraqi
airspace.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, 14 civilians were killed and 19 others injured in
air raids by U.S. and British planes, representing one of the
heaviest casualties Iraq suffered since December 1998 when the U.S.
and Britain launched the four-night Operation Desert Fox air
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The AL said it followed with deep concern the continued U.S. and
British air strikes against Iraq and called for an end to such
acts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British aircrafts use bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
to mount their patrols and bombings of the southern no-fly zone
which was set up after the 1991 Gulf War, with the so-called aim of
protecting the region's Shiite Muslims from possible attacks by
Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
A similar zone was imposed over northern Iraq claimedly to
protect the Kurdish community there.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the no-fly zones, which are not
directly covered by any U.N. resolution and have been the sites of
almost daily skirmishes since the December 1998 air war.

<HEADLINE> No Tension Across Line of Control: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes Friday allayed worries about the movement of Pakistani
troops along the Indo-Pakistani border in the western state of
Gujarat, saying it was "more of a defensive nature on the part of
Islamabad," the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes, who was in Calcutta to launch the Indian Navy's new
warship INS Brahmaputra, attributed the buildup of Pakistani
troops to two aspects: "One is more of a defensive nature on the
part of Pakistan and the other is perhaps related to the
Atlantique case now pending before the International Court of
Justice."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani naval aircraft, Atlantique, was shot down by the
Indian Air Force when it allegedly strayed into Indian territory
last August. All 16 Pakistani Navy officers and crew aboard the
aircraft were killed, prompting Islamabad to file a 60 million U.S.
dollar compensation case at the international court.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister went on to say that there was no tension
along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, claiming: "There is
nothing to be worried about so far as the LoC is concerned, there
had not been any perceptible change in the LoC."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any possibility of further tension between
India and Pakistan in the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir
during this summer, Fernandes said he had no such reports, the PTI
reported.

<HEADLINE> Major Pak Infiltration Bid Foiled: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian security forces foiled
on Friday a major attempt by Pakistan to send 60 heavily-armed
militants to the Kashmir valley, killing one of them and arresting
two others, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The infiltrators, allegedly backed by Pakistan, tried to sneak
into Indian territory through Nowgam area of Handwara in the
Kupwara sector in West Kashmir, but were confronted by alert
security personnel guarding the northern borders, the PTI quoted
official sources in Srinagar, capital of India-controlled Jammu
and Kashmir, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The militants were equipped with sophisticated weapons and the
exchange of fire lasted several hours, during which one
infiltrator was shot dead and two others nabbed, the sources said,
adding that the rest of the infiltrators fled back to Pakistan-
controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Indian security forces have launched a massive operation in
nearby forest areas to flush out infiltrators who could have taken
shelter in the dense woods, they said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first major infiltration attempt by Pakistan-
trained militants to sneak into the valley this season, the PTI
said, adding that chances of infiltration increase in summers as
snow starts melting on the mountain peaks on the Line of Control (
LoC).
</P>
<P>
The PTI also noted that with reports that more than 3,000
militants, including foreign mercenaries, were awaiting a chance
to intrude into Jammu and Kashmir to step up militancy, security
along the borders has already been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes, however, said in
Calcutta Friday that he could see no tension along the LoC. "There
is nothing to be worried about so far as the LoC is concerned," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government forces
have captured Camp Bilal, a major stronghold of the separatist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in North Lanao Province,
Mindanao, the military confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Rafael Romero told reporters that MILF
rebels have retreated to neighboring South Lanao Province where
they have several satellite camps.
</P>
<P>
The military capture came a week after heavy fighting broke out
between government troops and MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
MILF fighters had abandoned the camp under an intense air and
ground assault by combined army and marine operations over the
past two days,Romero said.
</P>
<P>
The last three days of fighting had killed 73 MILF rebels and
19 government troops, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Camp Bilal is the biggest MILF stronghold to fall this year.
Camp Omar, the second largest MILF encampment fell in February.
</P>
<P>
Romero said the military is ready to crush any attempt by the
MILF to retake Camp Bilal.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a 15,000-strong Muslim rebel group, has long been
fighting for the establishment of an independent Islamic state in
Mindanao, which the government strongly opposes.

<HEADLINE> No Ugandan Cult Branches in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has denied the existence of branches of the Movement for the
Restoration of Ten Commandments of God, a cult which horrified
the neighboring Uganda by murdering some 1,000 innocent followers,
local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thorough investigation of all religious organizations in the
country has revealed that the cult, led by Joseph Kibwetere, did
not have any followers in Tanzania, the Minister for Home Affairs
Mohamed Seif Khatib told the Guardian newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said following the international warrant for the
arrest of Kibwetere and his conspirators issued by a Ugandan court
early this month, the Tanzanian government began investigating
whether the cult had a following in the country.
</P>
<P>
On March 17, a fire in the doomsday cult church in the
southwestern Ugandan village of Kanungu killed 530 people.
</P>
<P>
After the inferno, authorities unearthed a series of mass
graves in nearby villages, turning up about 400 corpses, many
strangled or stabbed.
</P>
<P>
The cult leaders who are said to have collected almost all the
money belonging to their believers are still at large.

LUANDA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Angola's ruling party, People's
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), has started preparation for
the general elections scheduled for next year, according to the
party's general secretary Joao Lourenco.
</P>
<P>
Although some opposition leaders have expressed dissatisfaction
with the date of the elections, they said this war-torn country do
need elections.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco called on the party members to circulate the message
of the party as well as the appeal for abandoning armed violence
in the localities recently freed by the Angolan Army.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he defended the need to explain and unmask
some foreign circles that favor the inhuman ideals of apostatizing
the Angolans, further to the incompatibility of their acts with
the human rights they claim to defend fervently.
</P>
<P>
He reminded that the magnanimity of both the MPLA and the
government lies in pursuing peace and consolidating the national
unity of all Angolans whom he urged to actively participate in the
task of rebuilding the country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Export more Tea to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will soon command a larger
share of the Egyptian tea market owing to Egypt's entry to the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) last year
and the subsequent reduction of tariffs from 33 percent to three
percent.
</P>
<P>
The tariff reduction has made Kenyan tea more competitive,
forcing the Egyptian traders who used to import tea from Sri
Lanka, Indonesia and India to increasingly shift to Kenya for the
commodity, the East African Standard newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey released recently by the Tea Board of
Kenya, the upward market forecast will most likely be achieved by
October this year, when tariffs within the COMESA trading bloc
will be zero rated.
</P>
<P>
Kenya currently accounts for 80 percent of the tea import of
Egypt, which is Kenya's third largest market after the United
Kingdom and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The board said other than quality consideration, geographical
proximity to Egypt has been a boon to Kenyan tea exporters due to
the relatively low cost of shipment of tea from the country's
Mombasa Port to Port Said, Egypt.

<HEADLINE> EU Joins Kenya, India in Opposing Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has promised
support for a return to a total ban on ivory trade proposed by
India and Kenya in the upcoming vote at the ongoing 11th
conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species held here from April 9 to 20.
</P>
<P>
Head of the EU delegation Christoph Bail told reporters on
Thursday that the EU "firmly believe the total ban on the
international trade in raw ivory should be maintained in the
interests of conserving elephants throughout Africa".
</P>
<P>
In the 10th conference of the convention in 1997, Botswana,
Zimbabwe and Namibia were allowed to export 59 tons of ivory to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and India have argued that the one-off sale of ivory to
Japan has caused increased poaching and stimulated illegal trade.
However, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa have asked
the conference to approve an annual export quota of ivory.
</P>
<P>
Bail said that it was too early to assess the impact of the
one-off sale by three southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU fully supported the CITES program on
Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants, which provides an
important mechanism for close monitoring of the elephants
population.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes Emission Reduction Promise by Japanese, S. Korean Car Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Friday welcomed commitments by Japanese and South Korean
automobile manufacturers to reduce passenger car carbon dioxide
emissions.
</P>
<P>
The commitments were made in line with recommendations adopted
by the European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, to the Japanese and South Korean automobile
manufacturing associations.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended and the two Asian countries
committed themselves that the average fuel consumption of new
passenger cars will decrease an average of 2 percent by 2009, that
is converted to a reduction of carbon dioxide emission of 4 grams
per kilometer of driving compared with the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
By 2009, all new cars sold in the European Union must meet an
emission target of 140 grams per kilometer of driving.
</P>
<P>
To meet the target, the fleet of new cars hitting EU roads will
have to consume less fuel, about 5.8 liters of petrol per 100
kilometers or 5.25 liters of diesel per 100 kilometers, a
reduction of 28 percent of fuel consumption as against the 1995
level.
</P>
<P>
Japan, South Korea and European car makers combine to represent
99.5 percent of the EU new car market.
</P>
<P>
Passenger cars contribute to about 12 percent of the EU's total
carbon dioxide emissions at the time being.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: START II Ratification Victory For Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The ratification by the State Duma
on Friday of the START II treaty with the United States, which
sharply cuts the number of long-range nuclear weapons, represents
an initial victory for Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
The approval, which was passed by a vote of 288-131 with four
abstentions in the 450-seat lower house of parliament, also paved
the way for renewed negotiations on even deeper reductions and
marked a further thaw in Moscow's ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
Under the Treaty on the Further Reduction and Limitation of
Strategic Offensive Arms (START II), signed by former Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President George Bush on January
3, 1993, the two sides will each slash their stockpile of nuclear
warheads from about 6,000 to below 3,500 by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Friday's ratification provided a boost for Putin before his May
7 inauguration and set the tone for his visit to Britain on Sunday
and a trip to the United States by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
starting April 24.
</P>
<P>
It's the third time in recent years the treaty has come to the
Duma floor for ratification. It was pulled back twice at the last
minute because of U.S. military strikes, first against Iraq and
then against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Both the Kremlin and top government ministers have long called
for the approval of the treaty, arguing that it would get rid of
some of the country's aging nuclear warheads and concentrate
limited funds on new weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We've little room to maneuver," said Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev Thursday after a closed-door hearing at the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is such that it is essential to ratify START II
and move on to START III," Sergeyev said, referring to a new stage
of the treaty that would cut each side's warheads to below 2,000
or even fewer.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Yeltsin and Clinton agreed at a summit in Helsinki
that START III would require the two countries' strategic nuclear
arsenals to be reduced to some 2,000 to 2,500 warheads. Two years
later, Russia proposed that START III require these arsenals to be
cut to some 1,000 to 1,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
Washington has yet to respond to Russia's 1999 proposal on
START III.
</P>
<P>
Russia's nuclear arsenal is already headed toward lower levels
because of dismantling and obsolescence, especially of the
submarines, airplanes and missiles that deliver the warheads. Some
estimated that at the end of the START II period in 2007, Russia
would have fewer than 1,000 warheads if current trends continue.
</P>
<P>
Friday's relatively easy passage of START II can also be
attributed to the weaker position of the Communist opposition in
the State Duma. Despite its status as the largest faction in the
house, it no longer commands the kind of majority that could
torpedo bills submitted by the ruling establishment.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also hopes that the ratification would help its standing
in dealing with U.S. attempts to change the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, which are staunchly opposed by many countries
including Russia.
</P>
<P>
There are concerns that deep cuts into Russia's nuclear arsenal
will weaken the armed forces' ability to ensure so-called "
guaranteed destruction" if the United States decides to go ahead
with deployment of a powerful anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic parity between Russia and the United States may
cease to exist if we implement START II and the United States
deploys its anti-ballistic missile defense," cautioned Ivan
Safranchuk, an expert with the Moscow-based Center for Policy
Studies.
</P>
<P>
To forestall such a scenario, the ratification bill Friday laid
down "extraordinary circumstances" under which Russia will
withdraw from the treaty "by way of exercising its state
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Putin told the deputies that if the United States undermines
the ABM treaty, Russia will pull out the entire system of
agreements with Washington on strategic nuclear forces as well as
START II and begin its own policy of nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1991 START I treaty, which is already being
implemented by the two countries, the number of warheads on
strategic missiles is to be cut to 6,000 each.
</P>
<P>
Russia currently has some 3,590 warheads on its land-based
ballistic missiles, 2,400 warheads on its sea-launch ballistic
missiles and another 552 warheads deployed on long-range missiles
that can be carried by the Air Force's strategic bombers,
Safranchuk said.
</P>
<P>
The ratification bill will now go to the Federation Council for
approval, before Putin signs it into law.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the upper house of parliament, said
the chamber may discuss the documents at its next session on April
19, the Interfax news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Duma Passes ABM-related Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma passed a
package of documents related to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (
ABM) treaty by 413-8 with one abstention Friday after ratifying
the 1993 second-phase Russian-U.S. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START-II).
</P>
<P>
The package was signed in New York in September 1997 at a
meeting of foreign ministers of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,
Ukraine and the United States with the purpose of preserving the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
It consists of two statements on the treaty, an agreement on
confidence-building measures on defense systems against non-
strategic ballistic missiles, a memorandum of understanding on ABM
and the statute of the standing consultative committee.
</P>
<P>
The statements are aimed at preventing ABM systems from
developing in the present circumstances the capability of
combating strategic ballistic missiles, i.e. preventing the
circumvention of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on confidence-building measures contains a set of
provisions guaranteeing openness in the efforts of signatory
countries to developing non-strategic ballistic missile defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum deals with questions of legal succession with
regard to the ABM treaty. After the enforcement of the memorandum,
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine as legal successors of the Soviet
Union will become parties to the treaty in addition to Russia and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, Russia shall preserve the right to
possess an area of deploying a strategic missile defense system
near its capital on the scale set by the ABM treaty, the
possibility to use an ABM test ground in Kazakhstan and radar
stations of the missile attack radar warning system which remain
in foreign territory after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The new statute on the standing consultative committee -- the
body controlling the observation of the ABM treaty -- contains the
rules of its work given the multilateral nature of the treaty.
This document does not require ratification.

<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Central
Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
(RCCK) today strongly condemned the recent "Taiwan independence"
remarks by Annette Lu, a member of the Democratic Progressive
Party of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned "Taiwan independence" advocates such as Lu
not to make absurd separatist and anti-reunification remarks which
have aroused enormous indignation among the Chinese people and
patriotic overseas Chinese around the globe.
</P>

RCCK organizations and its members all over the country have in
the last couple of days held gatherings to condemn and criticize
Lu's absurd "Taiwan independence" remarks, according to the
spokesman.
</P>

Lu has revealed her true colors before she takes office. This

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Enhance Intellectual Property Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's emphasis on intellectual
property (IP) protection has been transformed into action by the
judicial authorities and enforcement departments, a senior Chinese
judge said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The judicial work on IP cases of the people's courts has
developed with the establishment and improvement of China's legal
system on IP protection," said Cheng Yongshun, deputy chief of the
Intellectual Property Division of Beijing Higher People's Court,
at a high-profile IP symposium which ends today.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people nowadays widely accept the notion that IP
protection is important for promoting scientific and technological
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the number of cases involving IP disputes
accepted by people's courts nationwide has been increasing year by
year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from 1992 to 1997, people's courts at all
levels accepted a total of 29,353 cases involving IP at the first
instance, of which 28,294 were concluded.
</P>
<P>
Among those cases that were concluded, nearly 400 involved
foreigners or foreign enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The adjudication of these cases effectively safeguarded the
legitimate rights and interests of the IP owners, encouraged
people's initiative, and maintained normal economic order and fair
market competition," Cheng said.

<TEXT>
<P>
China began legislative work on IP about 20 years ago. In
November 1996, the Supreme People's Court set up a special
tribunal for IP cases, which not only hears major cases but also
provides guidance and expertise in cases handled by local courts.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the Criminal Law, approved by the country's
top legislature in 1997, stipulates severe punishments for
infringements of trademarks, patents, copyrights, and business
secrets.
</P>
<P>
"Since IP is an intangible property, the judicial protection
thereof is far more difficult and complex than that of tangible
property," said Cheng, who has been involved in many important IP
cases.
</P>
<P>
Several economically developed municipalities and provinces,
such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and Guangdong, Jiangsu and
Fujian provinces, have also established tribunals for
adjudicating IP cases.
</P>
<P>
"The handling of IP cases by the professional judges of special
tribunals not only contributes to the accumulation of the judges'
experience in this respect, but also helps improve quality and
efficiency of the handling of IP cases," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, because China only recently adopted the
mechanism for dealing with IP cases, judges must keep their
knowledge current, and learn from their overseas counterparts.

<P>
Trade Secretary Mar Roxas was quoted as saying in a roundtable
discussion here with business executives that this will be
realized once a new draft of the proposed changes to the Omnibus
Investments Code is approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
The bill pending in Congress would lower the minimum qualifying
amount from 1 billion U.S. dollars to 500 million dollars for
incentives such as a 12-year tax holiday and a five-year net
operating loss, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said that if the bill is approved, the Philippines will
be at least on an equal competitive footing with its neighbors
during presentations for potential investors.
</P>
<P>
The government will spare no effort in pushing ahead the
passage of the bills that are pending in Congress but in urgent
need to boost the IT industry including electronic commerce (E-
Commerce) in the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Stocks Dance With Nasdaq  by Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Dancing with the Nasdaq, the
Indian stock markets were gripped with nervousness as share prices
virtually collapsed on a fresh wave of all-round selling later
this week.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensitive Index
crashed by 254.69 points, or 4.69 percent to 5,172.13, wiping out
a whopping 424.29 billion rupees (9.87 billion U.S. dollars) off
the BSE's market capitalization, reducing it to 8,746.43 billion
rupees (203.41 billion dollars). Nearly 500 scrips, or 25 percent,
on the BSE hit the downward circuit breaker.
</P>
<P>
A depressed market also came under further pressure as
operators hammered down the Reliance Industries' scrip on account
of a buy-back offer that was much below market expectations. The
Reliance Industries decided to fix its buy-back price low at 303
rupees (7.05 dollars) per share Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the broader BSE National Index (100 scrips) lost 146
points, or 5.16 percent, to 2,820. Declines led advances by 1,289
to 563, meaning that every two out of three stocks lost ground.
</P>
<P>
With Wednesday's crash, the Nasdaq slumped by more than 750
points in the past four trading sessions, from a recent high of 4,
450 to 3,780, sending clear signals on the overvaluation of
technology and Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
Other major stock markets like London, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Singapore too retreated sharply by 1.5 to 2 percent in the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
All over the world, analysts said, markets are a common
playground. If an investor or a mutual fund loses heavily at the
tech counters, then it will definitely try to book profits from
other sectoral stocks. It would be improper to isolate the Indian
markets from those in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Some fund managers said the broad trend remains positive but
the Indian bourses were waiting for the Nasdaq to stabilize. Since
most businesses have reported impressive results so far, the
markets could rebound sharply in the short run.
</P>
<P>
As Friday is a holiday in India, one dealer said that on Monday
the market will have to adjust itself to what happened on the
Nasdaq Thursday and Friday since a lot of investors still look to
the Nasdaq for directions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Issue on Whaling Dominates Wildlife Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The heated debate on whether to
relax the ban on commercial whaling or not has taken center stage
at the 11th conference of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) being held in Kenya's capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
An environmental group has hoisted a life-size whale balloon
outside the hall of the 11-day conference opened on April 9 to
protest at a proposal to partially lift the total ban on
commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Norway are making a bid to restart commercial whaling
by saying that three species of minke whales and a kind of gray
whale are abundant to be downlisted from Appendix I, which bans
any trade, to Appendix II, which allows limited trade.
</P>
<P>
The two countries submitted a similar proposal at the previous
 convention conference in June 1997, but fell only nine votes
short of victory.
</P>
<P>
Commercial whaling has been banned by the International Whaling
 Commission (IWC) since 1986, but whaling for scientific purpose
is still allowed.
</P>
<P>
Norway and Japan argued that there is no scientific basis to
continue the ban on minke and gray whales, since their populations
have returned to healthy levels, with an estimated of around
900,000 minke whales and about 20,000 gray whales.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservationists held that opening up the legal
trade in whale products means a disaster for whales since it gives
a huge incentive to poaching for the lucrative trade. They also
argued that poachers could use the legal trade as a cover.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists told delegates to the conference that DNA
analyses on whale meat in Tokyo markets have indicated that some
of it came from severely endangered species.
</P>
<P>
They said that unlike fish species, the whales are very
difficult to recover from the decline in the population. Whales
have a long gestation period and usually give birth only every one
or two years to a single calf and it takes many years for a baby
whale to reach sexual maturity.
</P>
<P>
Many species of great whales are still on the edge of
extinction. The population of blue whales of the Antarctic has
plummeted from 220,000 to just 460 due to overhunting, while the
number of the right whale has dropped from around 100,000 to
7,000.
</P>
<P>
"We are completely opposed to a resumption of whaling. There is
no immediate risk of extinction, but if there is a resumption of
commercial whaling, it could have a dramatic impact on numbers,"
said British Environment Minister Michael Meacher.
</P>
<P>
However, since the setback of the two whaling countries more
than two years ago, they have been involved in intense lobbying.
Some conservation groups accused Japan of offering aid to African
and Caribbean nations in exchange for their votes on whaling
issue.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Iceland are highly likely to back the proposal of
partially lifting the ban. Russia has objected the IWC's
moratorium and showed a strong interest in resuming. Iceland
recently joined CITES with reservation on 14 species of whales and
dolphins, including endangered blue whale.
</P>
<P>
A secret ballot is expected to be held in the next few days.
Observers here predicted that the vote would be close and it could
go either way.

PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
asked on Friday United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to
contact Iran over the espionage case involving 13 Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Henri Hajdenberg, president of the
European Jewish Congress, as saying that Chirac has suggested that
Annan, who is attending the Group of 77 summit in Havana, talk
with the Iranian delegation at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The French president also asked the U.N. chief to tell the
Iranian delegation that the European Union is opposed to the
judicial process against the Jews, who were accused of spying for
Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Iran risks to damage its relations with Europe if the 13 Jews
are condemned for spying," Chirac was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Iran have improved after President
Mohammed Khatami became the first Iranian head of state last
October to visit France since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Supreme Public
Prosecutor's Office said Friday it is investigating 76 of the

in Thursday's general election.
</P>
<P>
Among those who are suspected of having breached the law, 35

<P>
South Korean voters elected 227 legislators of the 273-member
unicameral parliament through direct voting. The rest 46 were
elected by the proportional representation system.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into them because of earlier reports by the

The office has instructed district prosecutor's offices
nationwide to summon the suspected lawmakers-elect for questioning.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russian State Duma Ratifies START-II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, lower
house of parliament, on Friday ratified the Russian-U.S. Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty-II (START-II) by a vote of 288 against 131
with four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact signed by Russia's ex-President Boris Yeltsin
and the former U.S. counterpart George Bush in 1993 in Moscow,
Russia and the United States agreed to cut the number of their
nuclear warheads from 6,000 to no more than 3,500 on each side by
2007. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The START-II will offer Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin
some leverage in arms control talks with Washington, which wants
to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to allow it
to deploy a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Duma deputies, voting for the treaty and two additional
statements on Friday, urged Washington not to violate the ABM
treaty and linked START-II weapons destruction to it.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from the two countries said in Geneva on Thursday
that U.S. and Russian officials would hold talks next week to
assess the prospects for launching talks on START-III.
</P>
<P>
START-III was agreed in outline three years ago but the hard
work is to agree how deep the further cuts should be. Washington
is looking to cut arsenals to 2,000-2,500 warheads each, while
Russian officials say they are ready to go lower to 1,500 each,
again driven largely by economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Duma also passed several related documents,
including the September 1997 Russian-U.S. protocol prolonging the
term of the limitation of strategic offensive armaments from
January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2007.
</P>
<P>
The documents approved by the Duma shall be submitted to the
upper house of the Federal Assembly. Federation Council speaker
Yegor Stroyev said the upper house may discuss the treaty at its
next session on April 19.
</P>
<P>
The ratification bill enumerates the "extraordinary
circumstances" allowing Russia to withdraw from the treaty "by way
of exercising its state sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
These circumstances are: the violation of the treaty by the
United States capable of causing a threat to Russian national
security; the withdrawal of the United States from the 1972 ABM
treaty or the violation of the ABM treaty and related agreements;
a buildup of strategic offensive armaments by countries that are
not signatories to START-II in a way posing a threat to Russian
national security; the adoption and implementation by the U. S.,
other countries or alliances, including NATO such military
decisions that will create a threat to Russian national security,
including the deployment of nuclear arms in countries that joined
NATO after the signing of START-II; the deployment by the United
States, other countries or alliances of armaments obstructing the
operation of the Russian missile attack warning system.
</P>
<P>
The other extraordinary circumstances are emergencies,
including economic or technological emergencies, making it
impossible for Russia to implement START-II or capable of causing
a threat to Russia's environmental safety.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, in these and other extraordinary circumstances
"threatening the supreme interests" of Russia, the president "
shall take political, diplomatic and other steps to remove the
extraordinary circumstances or neutralize their consequences."
</P>
<P>
The bill says that the START-II treaty is going to be
implemented on the basis "of preserving the potential of the
Russian strategic nuclear force at a level necessary to guarantee
national security," "priority financing of the strategic nuclear
force" and "observation by the United States -- of the 1991 START-
I treaty."
</P>
<P>
In its turn the Russian government within three months of the
enforcement of the ratification law should draft and submit to the
president for approval a special federal program of limiting and
scrapping armaments and equipment of the strategic nuclear force.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Resents Tokyo Governor's Remarks: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed its strong
resentment over the "evil remarks" of Shintaro Ishihara, governor
of Tokyo, who claims that China is Japan's biggest threat, China's
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We express strong resentment over Shintaro Ishihara who once
again publicly made evil remarks against China and the Chinese
people," Sun said in response to a question concerning the Tokyo
governor's recent statement to the German media.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with the German media, Ishihara asserted that
China is Japan's biggest threat, and therefore, should be divided
into several small countries, and Japan should do its part to
promote this.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Ishihara's remarks
are in direct line with the vicious intentions of Japanese
militarists who once attempted to divide and annex China. this
once again reveals Ishihara as an element of the remnants of
militarism.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China and especially since China
began its reform and opening up drive, the country's economy has
been developing rapidly and the Chinese people's lives have been
constantly improved.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved, and will continue to prove, that no force
whatsoever can stop the development of China," Sun stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Ishihara's wild remarks are but the dream of a slow-witted man
and will never come true," Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Militant Sentenced to Death in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian Islamic radical has been
sentenced to death for leading a cell that killed three policemen,
three Coptic Christians and four other people in the past few
years, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Higher State Security Court handed down the sentence on
Thursday against Shaaban Abdel-Ghani Haridi, 30, but postponed
sentencing 13 other militants until May 10, said the pro-government
English-language paper.
</P>
<P>
The verdict will be transferred to the state mufti and chief
government cleric, Nasr Farid Wasel, for approval, which is a must
concerning a death sentence but largely a formality.
</P>
<P>
The 14 defendants were accused of belonging to an outlawed
terrorist group, believed to be al-Gama'a al-Islmiya (Islamic
Group), Egypt's most militant group, the pro-government paper said.
They were the survivors of a gang of 33, whose other 19 members
were killed by police.
</P>
<P>
They were also accused of attempting to kill four other
policemen and 14 civilians between August 1995 and April 1997 in
the southern governorates of Minya, Beni Suef and Fayoum as well as
robbing 114,000 U.S. dollars, gold and jewelry in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Islamic militants began in 1992 an armed campaign in an
attempt to topple the secular government and install a strict
Islamic rule. The insurrection has been crushed in a government
crackdown following the massacre of 58 foreign tourists by al-
Gama'a al-Islmiya in Luxor in November 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Govt Agrees to Reform Electoral Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government has
agreed to a proposal from the opposition to include reforms on the
Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC) in a constitutional amendment
bill, newspapers reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Winding up the two-week long debate on the proposed Isles
constitutional changes on Thursday, Zanzibar Minister of State in
the Chief Minister's Office Iddi Pandu Hassan said the appointment
of members of the ZEC, including its chairman, will now have to be
approved by the 75-member House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was in response to opposition legislators'
claim that they had no confidence in the commission because all
its members were appointed by the Zanzibar president.
</P>
<P>
However, Hassan made it clear that the Isles president would
continue to enjoy the prerogative in appointing ZEC chairman and
members.
</P>
<P>
The minister requested the House of Representatives to pass the
bill to allow the government to implement the Commonwealth
brokered peace accord signed in June 1999 between the ruling Chama
Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party and the opposition Civic United Front
(CUF).
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, it was agreed that for free and fair
elections, the Zanzibar Electoral Commission should be reformed
before the general elections in October this year and members of
the ZEC will be appointed after a consensus is reached between the
two main parties.
</P>
<P>
The CCM party, led by President Salmin Amour, claimed a narrow
victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but CUF questioned the
result.
</P>
<P>
Political situation has become tense on the semi-autonomous
island in the Indian Ocean off mainland Tanzania after 18
opposition activists have been put in detention since December
1997 on sedition and treason charges.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Regionalism Remains Powerful in South Korean Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Regional loyalty or antagonism,
which determined South Korea's past elections, Thursday once again
proved its unbelievable strength in the country's 16th election of
National Assembly, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP) and the main
opposition Grand National Party (GNP) failed to win a needed
majority in the election.
</P>
<P>
Voters went to polls Thursday to elect 227 lawmakers of the 273-
member parliament, excluding 46 distributed to four parties in
proportion to voters.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 46 distributed seats, 21 went to the GNP, 19 to the
ruling MDP, five to minor opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD)
and one to the Democratic People's Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
The results of the direct election released by the National
Election Commission Friday showed the GNP has won 112 seats,
retaining its leading position in the unicameral parliament, while
President Kim Dae-jung's ruling MDP came in the second place with
96.
</P>
<P>
The ULD secured 12 seats, and other parties and independents
gained seven.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 112 directly-elected GNP legislators, 65 are from
Kyongsang region consisting of South and North provinces, Pusan
and Taegu which are GNP traditional political stronghold while 23
come from the Cholla area including South and North Choll
provinces and Kwangju which are ruling MDP's political base.
</P>
<P>
The ruling MDP could not gain a single constituency in
Kyongsang region while no candidate from GNP was elected in the
Cholla area although independent candidates gained four seats from
there.
</P>
<P>
However, the MDP's performance is better than expected although
it failed to win more seats than the GNP in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the announcement on inter-Korean summit, public pro-
stability sentiment and the civic groups' boycott campaign against
what they deemed "corrupt and incompetent candidates," the MDP
secured a greater majority in politically neutral Seoul, Kyonggi
province and Cheju island.
</P>
<P>
The MDP's failure to snatch the largest party position in
parliament is expected to remain an obstacle in the process of
President Kim Dae-jung's political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Another surprising feature of the poll was a disaster for the
ULD, which lost its status as negotiating group on the floor, with
its number of seats dropping from 50 to 17 in its political hub
Chungchung zone as both MDP and GNP candidates did better than
expected there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vote demonstrated growing public discontent and
cynicism to politics because a vote turnout stood at a mere 57.2
percent out of some 34 million eligible voters, the lowest in the
history of South Korean general elections.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Stresses Importance of Financial Affairs: Magazine (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Ample financial resources and
correct fiscal policies are of vital importance to a nation's
development, prosperity and stability, President Jiang Zemin
recently told senior government officials in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks when delivering a speech on January 19
at a special symposium on finance and taxation attended by
government officials at the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
"Seeking Truth," a theoretic periodical of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), will publish the
speech in its April 17 edition.
</P>
<P>
In his talk, the president stressed the importance of financial
work in the country's overall development, saying that China needs
powerful state finance to promote the building of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, improve the living standards of the
Chinese people, and maintain social stability, economic growth,
and national security.
</P>
<P>
The basic criteria for judging whether or not a country's
financial work is well done should include: if it contributes to
the development of a socialist market economy and the
consolidation of socialist system, if it helps protect and promote
the basic interests of the people, and if it maintains the
country's unity, security, solidarity between different ethnic
groups, and social stability, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should set the general goals and
direction of financial work in accordance with the political
situation and China's economic and social development, and make it
serve the country's reform, development, and stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
Financial departments should first meet the basic needs of the
people before they go further and invest in social and economic
development, Jiang stressed. He added that it is "ridiculous and
foolish" for some officials to divert financial funds earmarked
for improvement of the people's living conditions to construction
of projects planned for "demonstrating achievements of officials".
</P>
<P>
Financial work should follow the principle of balancing
revenues and expenditures, building the country through diligence
and thrift, and launching projects according to the state's
financial capabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government should cut down redundant personnel in local and
grass-roots government departments so that state finances no
longer have to support so many people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that both the share of the state financial revenue in
the gross domestic product (GDP) and that of the central
government in the national financial revenue should be raised, as
this will enable the state to make unified plans for central and
local budgets, and allocate more financial resources to priorities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the government should improve and strengthen
tax collection methods and management, deepen the reform in this
regard, tighten supervision, severely deal with all acts of tax
evasion and tax fraud, and punish those who use violence to avoid
paying taxes.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As authorities for a way to extend the detention of two
remaining Lebanese hostages, Barak Thursday accepted the
resignation of his POWs and MIAs Coordinator Ya'acov Perry.
</P>
<P>
The resignation followed Wednesday's Supreme Court and prison
authority's order to release 13 of the 15 Lebanese hostages being
held in an Israeli prison as bargaining chips for missing Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who served five years, said he felt he could no longer
properly carry out his job now that one of the main, "if not the
only," tool for retrieving the POWs and MIAs had been given up.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The government-imposed prohibition on new construction on the
Golan Heights has been lifted, the Prime Minister's Office Thursday
informed the head of the Golan Regional Council.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Thursday that the decision was only natural "when we
see only a very narrow crack left in the door of possible renewal
of the negotiations with Syria."
</P>
<P>
Barak added that the Golan projects had been held up for a few
months because of the prospects of talks with the Syrians, but
now "it is natural for them to be given approval to move forward."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Retired Supreme Court Justice Zvi Tal Thursday presented to
Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak the
recommendations of his nine-member committee on drafting yeshiva
religious students, a controversial topic between secular and
religious Israelis.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, those students would be allowed to
defer army service until age 23, when they could take a year off
the Torah study to decide whether to declare Torah as their trade
and stay in yeshiva or be drafted.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and French Defense Minister
Alain Richard Thursday signed a defense cooperation deal in which
Israel and France will invest in military research and development.
</P>
<P>
Richard arrived in Israel on Wednesday on a two-day visit, the
first by a French defense minister in three years.
</P>
<P>
He repeated France's policy that it will contribute troops to an
international force to guarantee security for Israel and Lebanon,
but only after an agreement between Israel and Syria, the major
power broker in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is to hold talks
Saturday with his Omani counterpart Yousef Bin Alawi, who is to pay
a three-day visit to Egypt as of that day.
</P>
<P>
The talks will cover developments on the Arab and international
arena, particularly the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- A team of United States congressmen is expected in Cairo on
Monday to examine prospects for concluding an American-Egyptian
free trade agreement and examine economic and trade exchange in
general.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. legislators will also discuss the opening of U.S.
markets to Egyptian products and the steps Egypt can take in the
sectors of communication, information technology and the protection
of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- An Egyptian-German mission unearthed an important find which
affirms that ancient Egyptians had lived south of the Western
Desert about 5,000 years ago. Many instruments used by ancient men
of that time were discovered as well as utensils and human and
animal bones.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday met with
visiting Israel's Minister of National Infrastructure Eli Suissa
and discussed with him the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Remember Dark Days, Pray for Peace and Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 14 (Xinhua) -- April 13 is a day to be forever
commemorated in Lebanon's history. This day 25 years ago, a
devastating civil war broke out in this Mediterranean Middle East
country, to last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, 1975, Christian militiamen ambushed a bus crowded
with Palestinians, kindling the 15-year sectarian war during which
150,000 were killed, 17,000 went missing and millions were turned
to refugees sheltering in other lands.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, 2000, thousands of Lebanese gathered in Martyr
Square in the Lebanese capital to commemorate the 15-year
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
Beirut, once dubbed "oriental Switzerland" and "mini Paris," was
turned into a showcase and proving ground of various weapons and a
paradise for snipers in the war.
</P>
<P>
Most of the buildings around Martyr Square are big banks
reconstructed after the civil war, standing in dazzling contrast
with a three-storey concrete frame with bullet holes in the facade.
A big hollow left by shell explosion stares the passers-by like a
dark eye, in mute testimony to what once occurred.
</P>
<P>
In the front of the parade were dozens of old women who were
holding pictures of their missing relatives in the war. A banner
preceded them that read "We have the right to know their fate."
</P>
<P>
The sixty-eight-year-old Zeinab Jabr was quivering and sobbing
as she held the picture of her eldest son Ibrahim Jabr who was
kidnapped on April 12, 1984.
</P>
<P>
"Tell me where is my son," she cried out, waving the picture.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping was then a regular practice by belligerent militias
who were demanding the exchange of their captive colleagues or
simply asking for ransom. More than 500 people are still missing so
far, 10 years after the war ended.
</P>
<P>
Zeinab made her 13 other children emigrate after she lost her
Ibrahim. But she remained in Beirut herself, hoping against hope
that her son might come back one day.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students followed in the parade, waving the national
cedar flags and calling "solidarity, peace, Lebanon the first."
</P>
<P>
Not having been in the battle-field themselves, these youngsters
are victims of the war as well. High unemployment that accompanied
the traumatized economy and spiraling inflation after the war have
forced many young Lebanese to find jobs in the oil-rich Gulf states
and other Arabic countries.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters and children are also easily falling victims to the
weapons that scattered in the community during the civil war. On
Wednesday, a college student who was playing a grenade in the
classroom was killed when the grenade exploded, also injuring his
six classmates.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of eruption of a fresh civil war,
Yagub Yasin, a taxi driver and a veteran of the civil war, replied
with dozens of "No."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanese have paid so much that none of us will forget those
dark days. We will not make any risk of igniting a civil war and
will not allow the occuring of a civil war," he said resolutely.
</P>
<P>
As the parade went on, more and more passers-by joined in,
sharing blue ribbons of the symbol of peace around their necks and
white flowers in hands.
</P>
<P>
With dusk fall, the minaret of the mosque near the square was
proclaiming the call for hierurgy as the bells of a rebuilt
Catholic church nearby tolled the hour, ringing for peace and
tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gives Green Light for Gas Deal Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government has given
the green light for energy firms to negotiate the sale of natural
gas to Israel, after it blocked such talks for years amid tension
over the Middle East peace process, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum during a
visit by Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Eli Suissa
came after Israel discovered its own gas fields.
</P>
<P>
The two sides "agreed to encourage gas companies in the two
countries to enter trade negotiations," said a statement issued
after a meeting on Thursday between Sameh Fahmi, Egypt's minister
of petroleum, and Suissa.
</P>
<P>
The statement released by the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum has
cleared the way for natural gas suppliers working in Egypt's Nile
Delta, such as Amoco of the United States and Agip of Italy, to
sell gas to the Israel Electric Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"If such a deal is clinched, the two governments will work to
handle any matters pending between the two countries in order to
reach a full implementation" of the contract, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Suissa reportedly said in March that Israel would break off
contacts with Egypt over a possible deal to supply natural gas
following the discovery of gas fields off Israel's Mediterranean
coast. But he said here on Wednesday that the Jewish state was
still interested in diversifying its sources of natural gas despite
the recent discovery.
</P>
<P>
Israel had previously accused Egypt of foot-dragging on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
When tension increased with Israel while hardline Benjamin
Netanyahu was prime minister from 1996-1999, Egypt's former
minister of petroleum, Hamdi al-Banbi, pledged to the parliament
not to allow export of Egyptian gas to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Suissa wrapped up a three-day visit to Egypt on Thursday, during
which he also met with Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy
Ali el-Saeedi to discuss the option of future cooperation between
Israel and Egypt in the field of electricity.
</P>
<P>
El-Saeedi said after the talks that cooperation in the field of
electricity depends on the progress of the Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations, which are now in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of Israel's energy consumption currently comes
from oil, most of the rest from coal and 4 percent from solar
energy.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Telstra Slashes Satellite Internet Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia's leading
telecommunications company Telstra Friday slashed the connection
cost for its satellite Internet service, dramatically reducing
barriers to high-speed Internet access to people in regional and
rural Australia.
</P>
<P>
The satellite service offers high-speed Internet access to
people unable to access Telstra's broad-band cable, which is only
available in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
Until now the cost of the satellite service has been extremely
prohibitive, with the purchase and installation of the equipment
costing between 1,320 Australian dollars (818 U.S. dollars) and 2,
500 Australian dollars (1550 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Telstra Chief Executive Ziggy Switkowski said connection costs
would now be cut up to 80 percent, with purchase and installation
now priced at between 398 Australian dollars (247 U.S. dollars)
and 494 Australian dollars (306 U.S. dollars) for most parts of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Switkowski told a farmer conference on Friday that the biggest
savings would be in regional and remote Australia.
</P>
<P>
"For families with home computers, I want to make high-speed
Internet as affordable as a video or microwave oven," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For children in regional Australia I want to make it easier to
learn the skills needed to succeed in today's high-tech world,"
Switkowski said.
</P>
<P>
"For families in regional Australia I want to make it easier to
stay in touch with each other, the rest of the country and the
rest of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The National Farmers' Federation applauded the announcement,
which it said would now make services city people took for granted
available to those in rural and regional areas.

<HEADLINE> hke041436--Malaysia to Buy Armored Personnel Carriers from Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will buy 211
armored personnel carriers (APCs) from Turkey for its army,
Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government is in the final stage of negotiations
with the supplier, FMC Nurol of Turkey, he told reporters after
officiating the closing of the four-day Defense Services Asia 2000
exhibition and conference (DSA 2000) here.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the cost of the deal which was expected to
be
finalized in the near future, Najib said the first few units would
be built in Turkey with the rest locally by Malaysia's DRB-Hicom
Defense Technologies (Deftech).
</P>
<P>
He said any outside purchase of military hardware must benefit
Malaysia in terms of transfer of technology, use of local
materials and joint production.
</P>
<P>
The DSA 2000 attracted some 420 companies from 39 countries and
regions to showcase their state-of-the-art technologies and
military hardware.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks Harsher Law vs. Overloaded Ship Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Following Wednesday night's
sinking of an overloaded vessel that killed at least 88 passengers,
Philippine authorities will push for a harsher law that makes
overloading a heinous crime, a senior official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Vicente Rivera of the Department of Transportation
and Communications said in a radio speech that this should compel
ship owners to toe the line and handcuff them from jeopardizing
passenger safety for the sake of profit.
</P>
<P>
"We must strengthen the law against overloading. We will push
to make it a heinous crime. Instead of mere reckless imprudence,
it should have a stiffer penalty. They are playing with human
lives here," Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
According to Friday's reports, the death toll has risen to 88
in the sea tragedy that happened Wednesday night when an
overloaded ferry sailing for Malaysia capsized off Jolo of the
southwestern island of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"I am disgusted over what happened. This is a peak season for
overcrowding as students are on vacation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our ship owners are undisciplined. That's the problem
with us," he said, adding that he has ordered the department's
legal bodies to draw up a draft measure.
</P>
<P>
As an effective effort to prevent vessels from overloading, the
secretary said his office would ask Congress to pass the proposed
measure immediately.

<HEADLINE> Japan Welcomes DPRK's Bid to Join ASEAN Regional Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono on Friday welcomed a reported bid by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to join the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
"It is a major progress and we can call it a good situation. It
is a remarkable point," Kono told the Committee on Foreign Affairs
at the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun has told his Thai
counterpart Surin Pitsuwan that the DPRK is "very keen" to join
the ARF, the Thai foreign minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is the core
of the regional security forum, which has 22 participants, the 10
ASEAN members plus Australia, Canada, China, the European Union,
India, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Citing the DPRK's recent establishment of diplomatic relations
with Italy and agreement on the first-ever inter-Korean summit
slated for June,Kono said a major change is taking place
concerning Pyongyang's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
On the recent resumption of diplomatic normalization talks
between the DPRK and Japan, Kono said Pyongyang has shown a
sincere attitude and is eager for the realization of normalization.
</P>
<P>
"I feel a different atmosphere and I hope to have enough
discussion and achieve the goal in the negotiations through
perseverance," Kono said.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the DPRK began senior-level negotiations last
Wednesday in Pyongyang on establishing diplomatic ties, resuming
talks that collapsed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed last Friday to hold the second round
of senior-level negotiations in late May in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Bans Turkish Fans from Leeds after deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's ruling body UEFA,
said on Friday it had decided to ban Turkish fans from the return
leg of the UEFA Cup semi-final between Leeds United and
Galatasaray in Leeds on April 20.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said British police had been unable to guarantee the
safety of visiting supporters travelling independently to the
match. Two Leeds fans were murdered in Istanbul on the eve of the
first leg nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
Eighty complimentary tickets will be issued to the Turkish
champions for people who Galatasaray believe "will behave in a
dignified and restrained manner".
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said the UEFA decision was a
relief but it was called "unacceptable" by a senior Galatasaray
official.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Will Not Play again This Year, Doctors Say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Inter Milan and Brazil star Ronaldo
will not play football again this year, doctors at the Pitie
Salpetriere hospital here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The doctors issued a statement after operating on Ronaldo's
right knee on Thursday night. The operation had been a complete
success.
</P>
<P>
The hospital statement said that Ronaldo had undergone surgery
for two hours and that the doctors were satisfied that he should
be able to play again "in seven or eight months".
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo will remain in hospital for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo tore the tendon in his right knee in Wednesday night's
Italian Cup
final first leg with Lazio, after barely seven minutes of his
return to soccer following surgery on the same tendon here on
November 30.
</P>
<P>
The same surgeon, who had given the Brazilian star the all-
clear to play again last week, carried out both operations.
</P>
<P>
An Inter statement said: "The operation, which was a perfect
success, lasted two hours and consisted in the repair of the tear.
A programme of seven to eight months is expected for
rehabilitation and the return to sporting activity.
</P>
<P>
"The return to competition is therefore not scheduled before
the end of the current year," the club added.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo, twice voted FIFA's World Player of the Year and
considered one of the treasures of the sport, should therefore be
back in action for the Serie A club midway through next season.
</P>
<P>
The player's parents and brother arrived later, although his
wife Milene Domingues could not be with her husband as she herself
is recovering from giving birth last week to Ronaldo's first child,
a boy called Ronald.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo first underwent an operation on his right knee back in
1996, when he played in Holland for PSV Eindhoven. He has been
plagued by injury and tendon trouble ever since the 1998 World Cup
finals in France.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Signals Cut in Military Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's armed forces is currently
involved in contact with the foreign ministry to find ways in which
a reduction could be made in the country's military spending.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake on August 17 last year dealt a serious blow to
the country's economy, prompting the army to more rationally use
resources while maintaining its strength.
</P>
<P>
About 15 days ago, the Turkish general staff sent an official
letter to the foreign ministry, in which it requested that a study
be made of the declining military spending among Turkey's allies in
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is the only country in NATO increasing its military
expenditure. So we have to look to the possibilities of making some
cuts," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
It also requested a deeper evaluation of Turkey's immediate
neighbors, the number of which rose from eight to 10 after former
Soviet republics declared independence.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that despite the fact that Turkey's geopolitical
situation differs from many of its allies, dictating that Turkey
has higher military spending, there still exists the possibility of
seeking confidence-building measures with some of its neighbors,
which are inclined to be responsive to such an attempt.
</P>
<P>
Those neighbors that Turkey sees as having the potential to
improve ties are quoted as, to a certain extent, Syria in the south
and NATO ally Greece in the west.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has already been negotiating confidence-building measures
with the littoral states of the Black Sea such as Georgia,
Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Bulgaria, which have already put mutual-confidence
measures in force in the 1990s, are negotiating to further this
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
It was reported, however, that Iran and Iraq in the southeast
and Armenia in the northeast are not at the moment perceived as
having the potential to improve ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A relative amelioration in the security environment in Turkey's
immediate periphery in the past year has raised cautious hopes in
the new century for Ankara to spend more energy on economic
recovery rather than busying itself with security issues.
</P>
<P>
This outlook, as some analysts argue, will lessen pressure on
the Turkish armed forces' efforts to meet its major arms
procurement and modernization programs.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense has continued to grab one of the major
sections of the pie in the 2000 fiscal year budget, despite a
slight drop in dollar terms compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense budget for 2000 is fixed at 7.6 billion
U.S. dollars, down from 7.8 billion dollars in 1999. But the
proportion of the defense budget to gross national product (GNP)
rose slightly to 3.3 percent from 3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the Turkish military expenditure has two causes.
Firstly, the demise of the Soviet Union brought Turkey to the
forefront of the world's most troubled regions, the Balkans, the
Caucasus and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This strategic condition prompted the armed forces to increase
military spending as it has also assumed increased role in
multinational peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The second reason for Turkey's slow process in establishing a
small but more mobile army with less money was fighting the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been since 1984
struggling for an independent Kurdish state in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Since joining NATO in 1952, Turkey has maintained the largest
standing army among European members of the alliance despite it was
poorly equipped.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important reasons cited for the military's
positive thinking toward finding ways of reducing military spending
was Turkey's acceptance by the European Union as a candidate member
during the EU summit in Helsinki in late December last year.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the Turkish general staff established EU
working groups to study the affects of the Helsinki decisions on
the Turkish military.
</P>
<P>
In its last two reports concerning the terms of Turkey's EU
membership, EU Commission has said that there has been a strong
military role within the Turkish political system.
</P>
<P>
The EU argues that this role of the military is one of the
obstacles in the face of Turkey securing full EU membership.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, Aril 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's external debt jumped
from 9.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1980 to 32.23 billion dollars in
1998, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Friday,
quoting figures released by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The country's long-term debt shot up from 8.5 billion dollars
in 1980 to 28.66 billion dollars in 1998. Public and publicly
guaranteed debt rose from 8.5 billion dollars in 1980 to 26.06
billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
World Bank and IDA (International Development Association)
loans and credits in 1980 stood at 1.15 billion dollars compared
with 6.93 billion dollars in 1998. Private non-guaranteed external
debt in 1980 was only 18 million dollars but in 1998 it had soared
to 2.6 billion dollars. In 1980, Pakistan's use of IMF (
International Monetary Fund) credit was 674 million dollars in
1980, and it rose to 1.36 billion dollars 18 years later.

CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The defense force ensign has

announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ensign was created in 1969 to identify military formations.

<P>
Its use has grown since then, but until now it has not been
recognized as an official flag of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard said in a statement that the ensigns of the Royal
Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force will continue in
use and represent their respective services.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the Australian Army as protector of the Australian
national flag continues unchanged," he said.

"The proclamation does not alter the pre-eminent status of the

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Kills 15 Rebels in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 Tamil Tiger rebels
had been killed in the latest clashes in their separatist war
against Sri Lanka's government troops, a military spokesman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Col. R.P. Witana said troops on Thursday sniped and
killed eight rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at
Veddhakadu East in the northernmost Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna peninsula has seen bloody battles for three weeks as
LTTE rebels are trying to retake their former stronghold, which
they lost in 1996. Hundreds of rebels and soldiers have been
killed or wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Troops attacked a rebel bunker with rocket propelled grenades
and machine guns at Kattiaratan in Jaffna, killing four rebels,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said troops confronted a group of rebels at Thanankilappu in
Jaffna, killing three LTTE rebels and injuring three others.
</P>
<P>
However, rebels continued to fire mortars at troops manning
defenses at Veddhakadu, Ayanankai, Kattiaratan and Nagar Kovil.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said one soldier was killed and 33 were injured
due to rebel mortars.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for a separate homeland
for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have
vowed to take back Jaffna, which might help the LTTE negotiate
from a position of strength if and when peace talks with the
government begin.

<HEADLINE> Australian Govt Asks Kosovar Refugees to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard and Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock Friday met a
representative of the Kosovar refugees in a last ditch attempt to
encourage those still in Australia to return home voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
About 30 of the remaining Kosovar refugees are refusing to
leave Australia now that the safe haven program has ended.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 Albanian Kosovars were brought to Australia at
the height of the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Howard and Ruddock held talks with Albanian Kosovar
representative Eric Lloga to try to end the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock told reporters that the prime minister pointed out that
any change in policy now could set a precedent for other groups in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said 90 of the remaining Kosovars had signed an
undertaking to leave Australia.
</P>
<P>
But those who refused to leave voluntarily by Sunday would be
considered to be in Australia illegally.
</P>
<P>
Lloga thanked Howard for listening to his plea but said the
government would not move.
</P>
<P>
"I appealed to the prime minister and the minister ... to allow
a moratorium for the Kosovars for a period of three months, during
which time any unexamined cases ... could be looked at," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After a lengthy discussion, which again the prime minister
kindly let us have, he felt he could not alter the position,"
Lloga added.
</P>
<P>
He said the process had now been exhausted and the refugees had
until Sunday to leave voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> 4 Great Lakes Nations to Meet for Goods Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among the four countries
to meet next month to discuss the outcome of a study on
improvement of the transportation of goods in the Great Lakes
countries, Times of Zambia reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study on alternative transportation options for the Great
Lakes countries involving Zambia, Uganda, Angola and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo is an initiative of Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted COMESA director of infrastructure and
development Jerome Ntibarekerwa as saying in an interview in
Lusaka on Thursday that since the four countries depend on
transport routes to sea ports for their trade, there was need to
seriously look at the problems affecting the transportation
industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting would consider the study which will later
be submitted to donors for funding.
</P>
<P>
The study which had been finalized touched on the problems
hindering the effective transportation of goods between South
Africa and the Great Lakes region and proposes introducing railway
transport as the solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ntibarekerwa said: "Although road haulage of goods still takes
place, the deterioration of roads in most of the southern African
countries, makes the heavy haulage of goods by road almost an
impossibility."
</P>
<P>
He noted that since there was no major expenditure on
rehabilitation of road infrastructure, the deterioration will
continue, with tarmac roads changing into pot holed gravel roads.
</P>
<P>
The transportation of goods by sea from the ports in South
Africa and elsewhere to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Mombasa in
Kenya, used to be the preferred mode of transport in the past
because of the unreliable road and rail transport.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ports of Dar es Salaam and Mombasa have
however become unreliable because of congestion which has led to
massive delays of goods in the ports as well as pilferage and
damage.
</P>
<P>
He said plans were underway to privatize some of the activities
in the ports which would improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are well-developed rail corridors running from
South Africa towards the Great Lakes region, there are some major
barriers which affect the effective transportation of goods," he
said.

of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association,
urged the government to come up with a concrete program that shows
its commitment to resettlement.
</P>
<P>
"If we withdraw from the farms, how long will it take the
government to implement orderly resettlement?" he raised the issue
on Thursday, adding that if there is no program showing
government's seriousness, then the black war veterans will stay on
the farms.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,000
white-owned commercial farms since February to protest against
slow land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
The government on Thursday urged the war veterans to end farm
invasion since the parliament had approved a bill allowing the
government to seize white-owned farmland without compensation.
</P>
<P>
President of the Commercial Farmers' Union Tim Henwood
applauded the government's statement, saying, "This is a happy day
for our country."
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Farmers' Union Silas Hungwe said,
"Indeed the war veterans must move out of the farms so that we
have orderly resettlement. Resettlement must be done in a proper
manner and not haphazardly."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Foreign Exchange Reserves Total $500 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's gross foreign exchange
reserves currently stand at 500 million U.S. dollars, covering
three-month import costs, according to a report from the newly
released weekly Business.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Leonard Tsumba
dismissed market speculation that the country's foreign currency
reserves had fallen to dangerous levels of one day import cover.
</P>
<P>
However, he described the current foreign currency levels as
"undesirable". A country is said to have healthy foreign currency
reserves if the levels are more than three months import cover.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign currency reserves are expected to improve
when the tobacco-selling season opens towards the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Tsumba said poor export performance had adversely affected the
supply of foreign exchange in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In this environment, financing critical external payment, such
as debt service, fuel, electricity and raw material imports, has
resulted in reduction of foreign exchange reserves to the present
undesirable low levels," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian State Duma to Ratify START-2 Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, lower house
of parliament, will vote to ratify the 1993 Russian-U.S. Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty-2 (START-II) and adopt two resolutions on
national defense and security at a closed session Friday, the
Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
spent Thursday briefing deputies in the 450-seat chamber and
appeared to have won more converts to a cause already backed by a
comfortable majority in the broadly pro-government Duma, seven
years after Washington and Moscow first agreed on the deal, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
At about 10 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) on Friday, deputies are
scheduled to meet for voting on the START-2, which would cut U.S.
and Russian nuclear warheads from 6,000 to no more than 3,500 on
each side by 2007. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the pact passed, Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin
will boost his plan to improve Russian-West ties during his visit
to London on Sunday, also his first trip to the West as Russian
president.
</P>
<P>
The significance of that will not be lost on British and other
firms contemplating a safe return to greater investment in Russia.
It could also give a boost to arms control talks.
</P>
<P>
One of the resolutions, drafted by the Duma Committees for
International Affairs and Defense and to be approved Friday, sets
forth the lower house's position on cuts in strategic armaments
and on measures the Russian authorities should take in this area.
</P>
<P>
The draft urges Putin, in handling the issue of putting the
treaty into effect (the exchange of ratification instruments) "to
take into account the United States' plans and moves to create and
deploy a national missile defense system and the possibility of
that country's withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (
ABM) Treaty."
</P>
<P>
The Duma will call on the U.S. Congress and president "not to
initiate a new arms race, to reverse the plans to deploy a
national missile defense system and save the ABM Treaty." It has
voiced its support for the earliest possible beginning of talks on
START III.
</P>
<P>
The second draft deals with "ways of maintaining the combat
readiness of the Russian strategic nuclear forces and their
development."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma will urge Putin to ensure the unconditional
implementation of the federal law "on financing the state defense
order for the strategic nuclear forces," to draft measures on the
guaranteed supply of the Russian defense enterprises with energy
resources and to control and optimize prices on energy resources,
raw materials and components produced by monopoly-enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Japanese Imburses Chinese Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Katsuma Yasuko, an elderly
Japanese woman brought up in China by Chinese people during the
World War II, is now an enthusiastic supporter of China's Hope
Project.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year old Japanese woman came once again recently to
Weixian County, north China's Hebei Province, to see the 23
primary students under her financial help in the past five years
and donated 18,000 yuan (2,169 US dollars) and stationery worth 3,
500 yuan (422 US dollars) to them.
</P>
<P>
Yasuko began her support in 1995 by donating 10,000 yuan (about
1,205 U.S.dollars) to the Hope Project aiming at helping school
dropouts in poverty-stricken areas through social donation.
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has financially aided more than 40 poor
students in Yunnan, Shaanxi and Hebei Provinces.
</P>
<P>
Yasuko, with Chinese name Liu Jingzhen, separated from her
family during the Japanese invasion in China. She was brought up
by Chinese people and worked as an engineer in the China Film Data
Center until she returned to Japan to reunite with her family in
1979. She became a high-school Chinese teacher in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people's kindness and great care gave her unforgettable
impression, she said, making her decide to return the love by
offering financial support to Chinese children of poor rural
families.
</P>
<P>
Yasuko said that everyone in Japan should know what really
happened during the Japanese invasion in China during the World
War II. She told her students what she saw at that time. And she
started bringing some of her students to visit the Nanjing
Memorial Hall to the Massacre Victims since the year 1989.
</P>
<P>
Under her influence, many of her Japanese students have made
friends with Chinese students.

<HEADLINE> Part-time Jobs Earn More Than Regular Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Some two out of every 100 income
earners in urban areas of China earn more from their part-time
jobs than from their regular sources of income, official figures
show.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a nation-wide survey released by
the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recently, part-time
workers account for 2.2 percent of the urban residents who have
regular sources of income. These people earn a monthly average of
661 yuan from part-time jobs, compared to 251 yuan from regular
sources of income.
</P>
<P>
One-third earn an average of over 500 yuan from part-time jobs
every month. Another half of them earn 200-500 yuan every month.
Only 2.5 percent of them earn a monthly income of more than 2,000
yuan from part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly income of redundant workers in state-owned
enterprises is merely 74 yuan, which mainly comes from government
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers account for 39.2 percent of those who have
part-time jobs, while retirees account for 20.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adopted a new employment policy in 1998
to encourage free flow of labor to ease unemployment pressure.
</P>
<P>
The government policy has prompted the workforce to change
their views on employment and helped more and more laid-off
workers to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China's urban unemployment rate
was 3.1 percent in 1999. The Chinese government predicts that the
figure will rise to 3.5 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Interest Tax Stimulates Consumption And Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since China began to levy income tax on interest earnings from
personal savings deposits on November 1, 1999, the revenue from
this tax has been growing for the past five months.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Finance told Xinhua that
imposing the tax has not caused slumps in the amount of personal
savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
The country has reported steady growth in bank savings
deposits over the past two quarters except in December. In January,
the total amount of savings deposits jumped by 11 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance, in terms of proportions
in the total amount, time deposits are decreasing while current
deposits are increasing. People have already diverted part of
their savings to investment in securities and consumption.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Chinese have greatly lowered expectations
on returns of savings deposits after the government repeatedly cut
interest rates and imposed tax on interest on bank accounts. They
are using a greater part of the surplus of income to invest in
stocks, bonds and consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry official said that the results of
collecting the tax on interest earnings from bank savings deposits
were in conformity with the government goals. He predicts that the
tax revenue will continue to grow in the next nine months and meet
the government-set target by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shixian, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, predicts that the government will collect about 20
billion yuan through the tax this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tax will "help the poor" because 20 percent of
the Chinese population own 80 percent of the total savings
deposits.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has announced to use the interest tax
revenue to raise allowance to laid off workers, pensioners and the
indigent people.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China is making a new plan to
protect its water resources by strengthening regulation, the
Ministry of Water Resources said.
</P>
<P>
The new plan will divide rivers and lakes into different
categories and setting targets for the protection of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
China will strive to improve the quality of water by curbing
contamination and ceasing overuse of underground water, according
to the plan.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the ministry implemented rules for water
resources protection. However, mounting pressures brought about by
water shortage and pollution in the wake of rapid economic growth
has prompted the government to implement new rules.

</P>
<P>
-- General Huseyin Kivrikohlu, Chief of Staff of Turkish Armed
Forces, sent a message to Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit about the
presidential election, saying that "the military do not intervene
into this matter."
</P>

Turkey's largest city Istanbul would be broken in more than one
point, thus dropping tension on the fault.

In this situation, an expected earthquake in the city will be at
6.0-6.5 magnitude, less than early foreseen 7.5-8.0 if the fault is
broken in one point.
</P>
<P>
The comments provided relief for the Istanbul residents, who are
worrying about a potential devastating earthquake which experts
claim will take place in the coming years.

Britain in revenge, saying that Turkish people felt regret over the
killing of two Britons during the Leeds-Galatasaray match in
Istanbul.

<HEADLINE> 4 Million Kenyan Kids Involved in Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Over four million Kenyan children
aged between six and 16 might be involved in child labor,
Permanent Secretary of Kenya's Human Resource Development Ministry
Kang'ethe Gitu has said.
</P>
<P>
Gitu made the revelation in a written speech read at the
opening of a child labor workshop here on Thursday, saying the
rise of child labor in the country is attributed to inadequate
legislation, poverty, HIV/AIDS and a breakdown of family
structures.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper on Friday quoted Gitu as
saying the child labors, accounting for 41 percent of the
country's children population, are working in environment that are
dangerous to their development and physical well-being.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to
put more emphasis on non-formal education for the sake of
disadvantaged children, adding the education system should be made
more relevant and affordable in order to check the high dropout
rate.
</P>
<P>
Jane Ong'olo, national coordinator of an international program
on elimination of child labor, told the meeting that "250 million
children around the world suffer such exploitation, and we know
that 120 million of them work full time."

<HEADLINE> IBF Asks Indonesia to Include Mia Audina on Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) said that the International Badminton Federation
(IBF) requested Indonesia include Mia Audina, now world ranked 11,
in its Olympic contingent.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Mia, former Indonesian badminton star, left for
the Netherlands in July last year to reside with her Dutch-
Surinamese husband.
</P>
<P>
PBSI secretary-general Leo Chandra Wiranata said the IBF's
letter asked Indonesia to include Mia on the national team if the
International Olympic Committee turned down the request of the
Badminton Association of the Netherlands to allow her to represent
the country in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by the federation's official in charge of
international championships and tournament open badminton rankings
Vanessa Freeman.
</P>
<P>
"I have to consult with PBSI chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo about
this matter. The decision is in his hands. I will give him some
aspects to consider. The most important thing is we must have a
personal letter from Mia assuring us that she will play for
Indonesia," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want something bad to happen during or after the
Olympics. We can't directly answer 'yes' or 'no' to the request,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Wiranata said PBSI would announce the decision by next week.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for Olympic badminton qualification is April 30.
The IBF is scheduled to announce the list of shuttlers for the
Games on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Wiranata said the IBF sent a letter last month asking PBSI to
support the Dutch bid to include Mia on its team for the Olympics
in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't give any response to the call. In principal, we
leave the matter to the IBF rule saying that a player can
represent a new country in a multisports event if he or she has
resided in the country for one year.

Hunan Province the right to operate international container

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chris Dlamini, the first
Ambassador of South Africa to China, has expressed his full
confidence in the prospects of Sino-South African relations.

should be underpinned by strong economic and trade relations. He

encourage their businesses to have more collaboration in the years
ahead.

burning more coal and oil, released a huge amount of poisonous
waste and left hundreds and thousands of people in poverty.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope for strengthening mutual understanding

<HEADLINE> Australia to Study Gulf War Veterans' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The health of Australia's Gulf
War veterans will be studied to help the defence force treat the
health of personnel sent overseas in the future, a senior
government official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study will compare the health of the veterans with that of
defence personnel who did not take part in the conflict, Veterans
Affairs Minister Bruce Scott said.
</P>
<P>
Almost 2,000 personnel involved in the conflict will be listed
on a nominal roll as the first stage of the study, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The nominal roll will form the basis of a study to compare the
health of Gulf War veterans with that of Australian Defense Force
personnel who did not participate in those operations," Scott said.
</P>
<P>
A tender process to select a research team to conduct the study
is being finalized and data collection is expected to take about
six months.
</P>
<P>
Scott said he expected to receive the report early in 2001.

<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals in the
Philippines declined by 0.6 percent in January this year to 188,
752 from 189,798 in the same period last year, the government said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Records from the Department of Tourism showed that the drop was
due largely to a decline in arrivals from top tourist markets,
particularly the United States, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
While previously posting an upgrowth, the records showed a
turnaround as the number of incoming American guests dropped 5.3
percent to 38,260 from 40,414 last year.
</P>
<P>
From the previous No.3 spot, Taiwanese fell to fifth place with
a total of 8,292 travelers, 47 percent less than last year's 15,
806, due mainly to the Philippine-Taiwan airline dispute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong registered a total of 10,362 travelers for
the period, 14 percent lower than the 12,058 recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea continued to boost visitor arrivals by
posting growth in the first month of the year.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the second largest travel market, posted a visitor
arrival of 37,592 while South Korea remained a flourishing tourist
market as the number of visitors from that country hit 17,914 for
January.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Gets $100 Million Loan From World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has mobilized 100 million U.S. dollars
from the World Bank to be given out as development loans to member
states, according to COMESA Clearing House consultant Mahmood
Mansour.
</P>
<P>
And plans to establish an investment agency are underway,
Mansour said in an interview in Lusaka on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Mansour as saying
that another 100 million dollars would come from the Africa
Development Bank, the European Union and the European Investment
Bank for the same purpose.

COMESA was in the process of creating an African Trade
Insurance Agency (ATIA) to guarantee security of investments
flowing into the continent.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley-Based Sun Microsystems Reports Profit up 49 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Sun Microsystems, networking
computer products maker in Silicon Valley, Thursday reported 49
percent growth in profits for the fiscal third-quarter as its
revenue, earnings, and bookings growth hit record levels.
</P>
<P>
Sun, which has been increasing its market share in a rivalry
with Hewlett Packard Co., said it enjoyed its highest quarterly
profit margins, on an operating basis, in 15 years, according to
reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
Sun reported a third-quarter profit of 436.2 million U.S.
dollars, excluding one-time items, up 49 percent from last year's
291.9 million dollars. With gains from the sale of equity
investments and other one-time items, net income for the latest
quarter totaled 508.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sun's revenue rose to 4.005 billion dollars, a 35-percent
increase from the third quarter of 1999. Order bookings rose by a
record 41 percent over last year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say Sun is best known for its enterprise
servers that use the Solaris operating environment, workstations,
storage products, UltraSparc microprocessors, and the Java and
Jini platforms.
</P>
<P>
Java is a programming language often used to provide animation,
calculators, and other functions on Web pages. Jini technology is
designed to connect a variety of devices to a network and enable
them to work together.
</P>
<P>
The analysts say that Sun has benefited strongly from the
growth of the Internet, since its servers, microprocessors, and
programming languages are commonly used by companies to build and
run their Web sites.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Reports Better-Than-Expected Profits, Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp., the
world's largest automaker, posted first-quarter results Thursday
that easily beat earnings estimates, according to reports from the
company.
</P>
<P>
The company reported a net income of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars,
or 2.80 dollars a share, in the quarter. Analysts surveyed by
earnings tracker First Call had forecast the company would earn 2.
66 dollars per share in the quarter. A year earlier, GM reported
then-record earnings of 1.8 billion dollars, or 2.68 dollars a
diluted share.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 10 percent to 46.9 billion dollars in the latest
quarter from 42.4 billion dollars a year earlier. Revenue from
vehicle sales rose to 40.4 billion dollars from 36.6 million
dollars, while its financing operations saw revenue rise to 4.1
billion dollars from 3.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
GM reported that 11 of 13 vehicle categories had sales gains in
the quarter, and overall North American vehicle sales rose 11
percent. Sales in the profitable truck segment rose 20 percent to
a company record, and company officials said the mix of vehicles
sold improved to more profitable models.
</P>
<P>
Despite those gains, industry analysts believe that the pricing
pressure meant North American operating profit slipped to 1.3
billion dollars from a record 1.4 billion dollars a year earlier.
But the company posted improved operating results everywhere else
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"Record market demand in North America and Europe was
accompanied by unrelenting competitive pressures, while economic
conditions continued to affect markets in the Latin America and
Asia-Pacific regions," Chairman and CEO Jack Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"We're particularly pleased that GM Europe improved its
profitability during the period, and that both GM Latin America/
Africa/Middle East and GM Asia Pacific were profitable, a
significant improvement over the first quarter last year." Smith
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Find Protein in Yeast Regulating Cell Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of scientists at
Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have found that
humans and yeast share a protein that appears to play a key role
in regulating cell growth.
</P>
<P>
The world-renowned research institute said Thursday that the
protein, called Rrn3, may play a pivotal role in the chain of
events that determines how fast cells grow.
</P>
<P>
"For a protein to be fundamentally conserved from yeast all the
way up to humans implies there must be a reason that it has been
preserved from an evolutionary standpoint," the institute quoted
Ronald Reeder, head of the group, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We know that if you don't have this protein, you don't grow.
Even if there are other mechanisms that human cells use to
regulate cell growth, the fact that this one is so well conserved
in humans means it's an important piece of the puzzle in our
understanding of growth control," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the researchers are primarily excited about this
fundamental new understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
trigger cell growth, the institute said, the discovery that Rrn3
functions in humans as well as yeast may have several long-range
benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, this regulatory molecule may be a
unique drug target, since disabling it might halt the growth of
cancer cells. The protein also might be used as a biomarker to
develop highly sensitive cancer-screening methods, as the activity
of Rrn3 is expected to mirror the rate of cell growth throughout
the body.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe the protein appears to be a key player
in an as-of-yet unidentified cell-signaling pathway that results
in cell growth. Rrn3 may act as the "on" switch that instructs
ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase I, the enzyme responsible for
reading the genetic code, to pump out lots of ribosomal RNA, which
is part of the cellular workbench that makes the proteins
necessary for cell growth. The more ribosomal RNA produced, the
faster the cell grows.
</P>
<P>
Understanding how this pathway works in the growth of yeast
will be crucial to unlocking the mystery of the process in humans,
the institute said.

<P>
Agassi was leading 2-0 when he felt a tightness in the right
hamstring but suffered the pull in the ninth game as he served at
4-4, 15-40. Agassi ran down a lob by Vanek and returned it with a
shot between his legs.
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he felt a sharp pain as he chased down the

WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Seventh Seed Russian Anna
Kournikova overpowered Australian Nicole Pratt 6-0, 7-5 in a rain-
delayed third round match of a WTA Tour tennis tournament in
Amelia Island, Florida on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The victory sends Kournikova into the quarter-finals against
Paola Suarez, who followed up her previous upset of second-seeded
Serena Williams by defeating Canadian Sonya Jeyaseelan 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the only other match played Thursday, sixth-seeded Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario of Spain rallied from a 4-1 deficit in the second
set to beat South Africa's Amanda Coetzer 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The only Top 10 player still in Kournikova's half of the draw
is American Monica Seles, whose match was rained out. Seles would
have to win two matches Friday to reach the semi-finals and a
potential showdown with Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
Because rain forced postponement of five third-round matches,
top-seeded Mary Pierce and fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez also
need to win two matches in one day to get to the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Rural Communities Set Up to Cut Poverty:  CP Executive  by Yang Qingchuan, Huang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- By developing several rural
communities in the poor regions of Thailand during the recent 20
years, Charoen Pokpand Group Corporation (CP Group), one of
Thailand's top companies, has helped hundreds of landless farmers
shake off poverty, a senior executive of the company declared
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Abhaichon
Vacharasinthu, the assistant vice president of CP Group, explained
how the company managed to effectively set up certain rural
communities to relieve poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said,"We devised the village community plan 20 years ago and
set five basic objectives."
</P>
<P>
"First, raise year-round income for the farmers on a continuing
basis. Second, improve the farmers' quality of life. Third, create
job and vocations in the rural areas. Fourth, ease the problems
arising from migrating labor into urban areas. Fifth, strengthen
the community and the family institution," Abhaichon said.
</P>
<P>
The first rural community which CP chose to conduct its poverty-
relieving plan is Nuang Hua village in the poverty-stricken areas
of Cha Choeng Sao Province, about 100 kilometers east of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Abhaichon said, it is a rural community created by 50
destitute landless farmers with financial, technological and
commercial support from CP Group .
</P>
<P>
"In collaboration with the public sector and financial
institutions, CP undertook the support activities for Nuang Hua
village in a full-integrated manner," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Abhaichon said that with CP Group as their financial guarantee
and loans from banks, each of the 50 farmers of Nuang Hua village
bought a piece of land of 25 rais (4 hectares), with 20 rais (3.6
hectares) of which used for production, while the rest for housing.
</P>
<P>
"Under CP Group's development plan, the 20 rais' land for
production are divided into different vocational sections as rice
farming, rice milling, vegetable farming, fruits and flowers
planting, livestock raising and fishing. Thus the farmer can have
diversified income sources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abhaichon noted that as a business giant covering many
industrial and technological sectors, CP Group does have the "
special ability" to help those farmers. He said, "our support
came in the forms of investment, seeds, animals, fertilizer,
pesticides, vaccine, academic and technology know-how as well as
purchase of produce, price guarantee and marketing services."
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, the incomes per capita in Nuang Hua
have grown continuously, now at 30,000 bahts (780 US dollars)
monthly, nearly four times of the average income standard of the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
"However, having more money does not mean real improvement,"
Abhaichon said, "we realized that the farmers should have modern
community life and social abilities."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in 1987, for expanding rural community plan,
CP Group and many public and private sectors of Thailand jointly
set up the Rural Lives Development Foundation, which focuses on
human resource development of the rural communities in those
impoverished regions.
</P>
<P>
As Abhaichon introduced, the foundation now offers five courses
on "leadership development" a year with 25 young farmers a year to
a course, totaling 125 trainees per year. The trainees are chosen
from three "pilot village community" from 96 villages in the
backward northeastern region of the country.
</P>
<P>
When asked about how extensive the community plan would be,
Abhaichon said: "critics have said that the number of communities
was so limited and may seem unhelpful to the vast poor areas
around the country. However, we should be patient."
</P>
<P>
He said,"if those areas proved to be a good model, and we will
introduce them to other places."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the motive of the company to carry out rural plan,
Abhaichon said," not every big firm is willing to help poor people.
"
</P>
<P>
Abhaichon said, "so if we decided to do this, we should first
have the sincerity, and secondly, we need cooperators. Finally, we
should make government and the poor understand our plan. Helping
poor people make money is good, but the more important thing is to
teach them how to use and to reserve money."
</P>
<P>
As for the question about the company's profit in the community
plan," he said, "successful rural communities are the potential
business partners in the future, and will set a model for
relieving the country's vast, poor regions."

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Zimbabwe Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday welcomed a
Zimbabwean High Court ruling that police must take action to clear
the illegal occupation of white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement that the
ruling was in Zimbabwe's own interests that land reforms are
carried out in an orderly and transparent way.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's High Court Thursday dismissed a police application
to overturn an earlier eviction order on thousands of veterans of
the country's 1970s liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
That means the supporters of President Robert Mugabe, who
seized white-owned farms, would be cleared out from the farms.
Zimbabwe police had argued earlier that order was impossible to
enforce without risking civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome that decision. It is in Zimbabwe's own interests
that land reform is carried out in an orderly and transparent way,
which does not ride roughshod over the rights of individuals,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the police will now begin to carry out this order
and that calm will return to the farms of Zimbabwe," the foreign
secretary added.

<HEADLINE> Urban Development for China's Western Region (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urban development will greatly help the reallocation of surplus
rural labor caused by these policies, and urbanization is also the
best way to relieve the pressure on natural resources while the
massive campaign to develop the west is carried out.
</P>
<P>
The western regions' current under-population and backward
infrastructure is unfavorable to industrial development, but
urbanization can optimize the configuration of resources and the
labor force.
</P>
<P>
China's western regions should accelerate the construction of
small- and middle-sized towns and combine small cities, as far as
possible, into groups of medium sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The populations in unlivable areas should be encouraged to move
to towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
The western region must devote itself to developing modern and
comprehensive cities instead of specialized ones.
</P>
<P>
Also, the guidelines for traffic systems should give prominence
to key urban projects.
</P>
<P>
Attention also should be given to the improvement of the cities
' electricity and gas and water supply systems, as well as
communications, traffic facility construction, and all kinds of
service enterprises to improve the cities' investment environments.

<HEADLINE> Urban Development for China's Western Region (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The key to China's western
development strategy is to develop a group of modern cities in the
region, according to a signed article on the China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
The article on the Beijing-based newspaper notes that in 1998,
44 percent of China's gross domestic product (GDP) was produced by
the country's 231 above-county-level cities, which shows the
importance of cities in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
However, all the country's five most important economic centers,
Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Tianjin, each with GDP
exceeding 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars), are located in
the east. And among 45 cities, each with GDP over 20 billion yuan
(2.41 billion US dollars), only seven are located in the western
region.
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years, China's eastern region has developed a
group of small- and middle-sized new cities around major cities to
form a regional economic network.
</P>
<P>
The early 1980s' reforms of the rural economic system, and the
1990s' campaign to boost border trade with Russia, western Asia
and southeast Asia, gave priority to the west.
</P>
<P>
However, the western region has not taken full advantage of
these policies to form a series of central cities that could bring
along the entire region's economic development.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 2000, Chinese government adopted two new
policies for stopping cutting trees, and turning farmland back to
forests, lakes and grasslands in order to protect the ecology
environment in the western regions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Capital Free of Leaded Gasoline Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We are committed Jakarta will be free of unleaded gasoline in
2001 and hopefully it will be followed up in other regions across
the country," the minister was quoted by the Antara News Agency
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the "Blue Sky" environmental program would be applied
across Java island in 2002 and across the country in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Keraf said he was optimistic that the program in Jakarta would
be successful because the state-owned oil company Pertamina's
refinery plant in Balongan, West Java, had the capacity to supply
the unleaded gasoline for the city.
</P>
<P>
To supply other regions, the minister said, Pertamina would
still need large investment for establishing refinery plants.
</P>
<P>
Lead is used to increase the octane number of gasoline to lower
its burning point and make it easier to burn. Lead poisoning may
cause upper respiratory tract infections, increase blood pressure,
cause heart attacks and damage kidneys.
</P>
<P>
While many countries had successfully ended the use of lead in
gasoline, Indonesia was still home to a large amount of the
hazardous substance.
</P>
<P>
Despite the many campaigns of nongovernmental organizations to
end the use of leaded gasoline, the Indonesian government has
delayed its own deadline for Pertamina to stop producing leaded
gasoline from last December to 2003.

Consumers, buoyant at the economic revival, have reversed their

<HEADLINE> Four European States Uncover International Drug-Smuggling Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The police in Hungary, Britain,
Germany and Austria have collaborated to expose and capture two
individuals reportedly members of an international drug-smuggling
ring.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Hungarian anti-organized crime group told
a news conference Thursday that Hungarian police arrested two
Bulgarian men in a hotel in Szolnok State. The authorities say
they also confiscated two billion forint (7.55 million U.S.
dollars), and 30 kilograms of heroin, about 80 percent pure.
</P>
<P>
After joint investigations by the four European countries, the
two drug-traffickers are believed to be members of an
international drug-smuggling group. They were reportedly in
charge of trafficking drugs from Turkey to London via central and
eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the criminal group is believed to be in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Drug-smuggling is becoming increasingly rapacious throughout
the world. Hungary, situated in central Europe, has become a main
drug-trafficking channel. Last year, Hungary seized 153 kilograms
of heroin. The country has confiscated an equal amount of heroin
in the first quarter of this year, exceeding the entire total of
heroin confiscated last year.

BRASILIA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Motorola Company, a global

its investment for Brazil this year in view of the rapid growth of
the country's cellular telephone market.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gowney, the multinational firms' operations director
said Thursday that Motorola will invest 60 million U.S. dollars
this year to expand the production of cell telephones in its
Jaguiariuna plant in the state of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
The volume of investments for Brazil could increase even more,
depending on the business evolution, added Gowney, who is in Rio
de Janeiro attending a meeting of the company council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company invested 150 million dollars in Brazil during
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Motorola wants to conquer, according to Gowney, a bigger slice
of the contracts for infrastructure supply to meet the demand of
cell telephones for the C band, for which bidding will be opened
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Motorola sales in Brazil reached 950 million dollars in 1999,
and its target for this year is 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion dollars.

"Many times we have no other option but to give up something which

higher than those of ministers in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez also discussed discrepancies between the World Health
Organization and the Inter-American Development Bank, which is
reluctant to fund developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"That, of course, causes extraordinary distortions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are the challenges we have to face," added Fernandez,
who opposes the general practice of "accepting help as if it were

TOKYO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Legislators of Japan's opposition

for derogatory remarks made about foreigners over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
During a session of the House of Councilors' Committee on
Foreign Affairs and Defense, Michio Sato of the Niin Club-
Jiyurengo bloc urged Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono to
demand that Ishihara apologize for his remarks and retract them.
</P>
<P>
"I will think about it," Kono replied, adding, "They are
inappropriate remarks, and I feel the are quite regrettable."
</P>
<P>
Hideo Den of the Social Democratic Party said the government

between the Self-Defense Forces and the Tokyo metropolitan
government.
</P>
<P>
At a session of the House of Representatives Security Committee,
Ishihara was also blasted.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ishihara told a ceremony of the Ground Self-Defense
Force, "Atrocious crimes have been committed again and again by
sangokujin and other foreigners who have illegally entered Japan.
We can expect them to riot in the event of a disastrous earthquake.
"
</P>
<P>
"Sangokujin" is a Japanese term that literally means "people
from third countries." Referring to people from former Japanese
colonies in Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula, as well as their
descendants, the term gained currency after World War II. It is
now widely regarded as a derogatory term.

Richardson announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three pairs of chromosomes, numbered 5, 16 and 19,

The genetic information on the three chromosomes may give clues
to some cancers, diabetics and other diseases, Richardson said.

And these information will be available to private and public

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Team Counting on Hendrawan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Badminton
Association (PBSI) appears to suspect that Taufik Hidayat may be
under psychological pressure in the team's build up to the Thomas
Cup championship in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, next month.
</P>
<P>
"The worry stems from the fact that young Taufik, the team's
number one player, will be playing first," PBSI official M.F.
Siregar was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said that the team has taken an anticipatory move by
turning to Hendrawan, a more senior player, for hope. He added
that, despite being the second player, the association seems to be
counting on him yet again in the competition.
</P>
<P>
"Again, Hendrawan looks set to be the one most counted on,"
Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
The last time the two-yearly world men's team badminton event
took place in Hong Kong two years ago, Hendrawan played a pivotal
part in Indonesia's defeat of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan salvaged Indonesia's hopes by beating Yong Hock Kin
after Heryanto Arbi, who was expected to overcome Ong Ewe Hock in
the first single's match, was beaten instead.
</P>
<P>
At the recent Tokyo Open, Hendrawan proved he was a player to
be reckoned with when he edged out giant-killer Roslin Hasyim in
the semi-finals before losing to a Chinese player in the final.
</P>
<P>
"He will be our hope playing in the second singles (in Kuala
Lumpur)," Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
The team will be trying-out in Bogor, about 60 kilometers south
of Jakarta, on April 29, three days after the association is
expected to announce the team.

<HEADLINE> NATO Use of Banned Ammunition Incurs Radiation Contamination in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government Thursday
accused the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of violating
international war and humanitarian norms by using depleted uranium
ammunition during its final airstrikes on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It cited a survey report as saying that the Western military
bloc had employed the internationally banned ammunition during its
March-June operation in Kosovo in a quantity 10 times more than
used elsewhere, which has created severe environmental problems in
the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on tests on a variety of samples collected,
was conducted by Yugoslav researchers. They pointed out that the
radiation contamination in "some samples was 1,000 times above the
level that jeopardizes the population and the environment."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government said it has taken every possible step
it could to reduce the radiation impact on the environment, while
providing physical examination services and medical treatments to
those Kosovo residents exposed to the radiation.
</P>
<P>
A German news agency, DPA, reported Wednesday that NATO
admitted using armor-piercing uranium depleted ammunition against
Yugoslav tanks in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe President Denounces Interventionist Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
speaking before the South Summit here Thursday, faced up to "neo-
colonialist powers" and denounced the "intervention and unilateral
application of sanctions against countries that do not abide by
their desires."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned as a typical example the threat now pending over
Zimbabwe for effecting an agrarian reform that puts in the hands
of the peasants of Zimbabwe some 5 million hectares of fertile
farmland now in the possession of former British white settlers.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the colonialists appealed to the European Union
and the Bretton Woods institutions to force Zimbabwe to give up
its policy and have threatened to apply economic sanctions against
it, thus "taking us down the road of confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Britain and Zimbabwe have been at loggerheads since Zimbabwe
backed veterans of the country's 1970s liberation struggle. The
veterans seized white-owned farms and urged Britain, the colonial
power, to pay the white settlers for their seized land. Britain
has refused Zimbabwe's demands.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said unilateral sanctions applied by international
powers and international financial institutions are in flagrant
violation of the United Nations Charter and the sovereign rights
of the states.
</P>
<P>
These imperialist and colonialist trends must be stopped, said
the Zimbabwe president, adding that "bilateral questions cannot be
resolved with gangster-like methods."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe condemned these interventions by military powers and has
called on the Group of 77 member countries to support the
declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement approved in the recent
ministerial meeting of Cartagena, Colombia, in favor of the
national sovereignty and self-determination of the people.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Expels Italian Mafia Kingpin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An Italian mafia kingpin has
been detained in Mexico and expelled to Italy, the Federal
Attorney Office (PGR) said Thursday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Montanti, a Sicilian mafia head and leader of the "
Stidda" (Star) criminal ring which operates mainly in Italy's
Agrigento and Sicilia, is considered one of the most dangerous
Mafiosi in the world.
</P>
<P>
Montanti, 44, was arrested by Mexican Federal Judicial Police (
PJF) agents on Wednesday in the Mexican tourist city of Acapulco,
where he had been living illegally for more than six years, said
the PGR.
</P>
<P>
He was put under the custody of the Mexican National Migration
Institute, since he violated the Mexican General Law of Population,
and he was expelled to Italy.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was the culmination of several months of
investigation by the PJF in collaboration with agents from Germany
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Montanti had destroyed all his identity documents to escape
prosecution, but the Interpol in Rome obtained his fingerprints
and photographs.
</P>
<P>
A PGR spokesman confirmed that Montanti escaped from Italy in
1994. He was charged with killing Italian judge Rosario Livantino
in 1990 and other crimes. The Italian police has issued five
arrest warrants, four of them for the killings of policemen.

<HEADLINE> No Party Wins Majority in S. Korean Parliamentary Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Both ruling Millennium Democratic
Party (MDP) and opposition Grand National Party (GNP) failed to
claim a needed majority in Thursday's South Korean parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
The results of the elections released by the National Election
Commission showed that the GNP has won 133 of the 273 seats in the
National Assembly, while President Kim Dae-jung's MDP came in the
second place with 115 seats.
</P>
<P>
United Liberal Democrats (ULD) won 17 seats and the Democratic
People's Party (DPP) one, New Korea Party of Hope one, and other
parties and independents eight.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's election clearly outlined a virtual two-party system
with the MDP lagging 18 seats behind the GNP which remains the
largest party in the unicameral parliament and ULD will be out of
the parliamentary picture as it is unable to get 20 seats legally
required to form a floor negotiation group.
</P>
<P>
The election features growing public discontent and cynicism
toward politics as voter turnout reached a mere 57.2 percent,
below 60 percent for the first time in the country's general
election history, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Support rate for GNP stood at 39 percent, followed by MDP with
35.9 percent, ULD 9.8 percent, and DPP 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The result also proved deeply-rooted regional antagonism in the
nation. GNP swept its stronghold of North Kyongsang and South
Kyongsang provinces while MDP won all seats in its political base
North Cholla and South Cholla provinces.
</P>
<P>
The MDP's strong showing was a result of its dominance in Seoul,
along with better-than-expected results in Cheju Island, Kangwon
and Chungchong provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, its failure to snatch the largest party position in
parliament is expected to remain a heavy political obstacle in the
process of President Kim's political and economic reform.

<HEADLINE> Used-car Market Gets Guidance From New Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Used-car buyers can feel a little
bit more secure about their purchases, thanks to a recent Chinese
Government action.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor and Social Security recently released a
set of plans demanding appraisers of second-hand vehicles to earn
professional certification.
</P>
<P>
The circular, to be implemented July 1, is expected to improve
appraisers' techniques and regulate the used-car market, today's
China Daily quoted the ministry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
It also provides legal documentation to put in place a new
labor system that demands workers have professional certificates,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to ministry statistics, used vehicles have an annual
trading volume of 18 billion yuan (2.17 U.S. dollars). The
expanding market now sees 800,000 second-hand vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
"It requires professional staff and scientific means to make
proper evaluations of used vehicles," said Li Boguang, who works
with the National Automobile Renewal Office.
</P>
<P>
Since last fall, the ministry and the State Administration of
Internal Trade have organized training programs and exams for
appraisers working on used cars.
</P>
<P>
Training has proven effective in regulating the market,
cracking down on illegal trade and preventing smuggled and
rejected automobiles from being sold again, Li said.
</P>
<P>
As for appraisers working in auctioning, pawn brokerage,
insurance and other industries, the two governmental departments
will provide training programs beginning in April.
</P>
<P>
Those working without professional certificates will be
investigated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Republican Budget for Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Republicans pushed a final
budget of 1.83 trillion U.S. dollars for next year through U.S.
Congress Thursday that calls for tax cuts, debt reduction and more
money for the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
On a pair of near party-line votes, the House voted 220-208 to
approve the Republican-written budget for fiscal 2001 which starts
on October 1, 2000, and the Senate followed suit by 50-48.
</P>
<P>
The measure approved Thursday was a House-Senate compromise of
similar budgets each chamber had passed earlier.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton needs not to sign the measure, but an
election-year veto battle looms over 13 annual spending bills and
any tax legislation lawmakers send him translating their budget's
plans into reality.
</P>
<P>
The package leaves the Republicans and Democrats poised for a
campaign season touting starkly different views of how to use
surpluses from the non-Social Security side of the budget.
Republicans would use much of it for tax cuts, Democrats prefer
more domestic spending and debt reduction, and each accuses the
other of jeopardizing Social Security surpluses they have pledged
to leave alone.
</P>
<P>
Both sides would use the 1 trillion dollars in expected Social
Security surpluses over the next five years to reduce the 3.6-
trillion-dollar publicly held debt, with the goal of eliminating
it by 2013. The rest of the 5.7-trillion-dollar national debt is
money the government owes Social Security and other federal trust
funds.
</P>
<P>
Most economists say such a dramatic reduction of the publicly
held debt would press interest rates downward and fuel the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the two parties are divided over how to use the surplus
projected from the rest of the budget.
</P>
<P>
Republicans would use much of it for a tax cut of at least 150
billion dollars and perhaps more than 200 billion dollars,
depending on lawmakers' decisions and how much economic growth
occurs over the next few months. Democrats want a smaller tax
reduction, with more money set aside for domestic programs and
debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
The Republican budget would set aside up to 40 billion dollars
over five years for any new prescription drug benefits that
lawmakers add to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Both parties say they want to enact a prescription program this
year. Clinton wants it to cover all elderly Americans, while
Republicans want to limit it to lower-income people or those with
extremely high drug bills.
</P>
<P>
The budget also calls for 311 billion dollars for defense next
year, 5 billion dollars more than Clinton wants. And it would
spend 289 billion dollars for domestic programs, about 30 billion
dollars less than Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two-thirds of the budget covers interest payments
on the debt, plus benefits like Social Security and Medicare.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Demands Safety Review after Zonta Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Formula one driver Michael
Schumacher has demanded urgent safety improvements to Silverstone
after seeing a fellow driver sent flying at the spot of his own
horror smash.
</P>
<P>
The German wants changes before next week's British Grand Prix
at the Northamptonshire circuit after Ricardo Zonta was launched
over a safety fence by a tyre barrier.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian was sent rolling along the gravel at Stowe Corner,
where Schumacher broke his leg last year, after the right-front
wheel of his British American Racing car ripped off at 300kmph
along Hangar Straight.
</P>
<P>
Zonta hit the tip of the tyre barrier, went airborne over an
eight-foot high fence and wall before landing upside-down in a
grassed no-go area.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old amazingly was able to walk away from the crash
with just a cut finger, though BAR called off testing while they
carried out an urgent review of why the front push-rod on the car'
s suspension failed.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, who began testing at the track for the first time
since breaking his leg after crashing his Ferrari into a tyre
barrier, was one of the first drivers at the scene.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old also watched videos of the incident and
immediately revealed the Grand Prix Drivers' Association will be
contacting the sport's safety officer, Charlie Whiting, to call
for improvements.
</P>
<P>
"We can be very, very lucky that Ricardo is almost unhurt which
shows how good car safety is right now," said Schumacher, who
missed seven races after his accident last year.

<HEADLINE> Rugby League Legend Edwards Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- British rugby league legend Shaun
Edwards has announced his retirement after a glorious 17-year
career.
</P>
<P>
He was the most decorated player in the game's history but has
had to retire due to injury.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old former Wigan and Great Britain half-back said a
succession of knee and head injuries had led him to hang up his
boots.
</P>
<P>
Edwards played in the first four games of the season with his
latest club, London Broncos, before being sidelined with a
hamstring strain and has decided to take a complete break from the
game.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Rugby league has given me so much and I would like to
thank everyone who has helped me throughout my career,
particularly the tremendously loyal fans who have provided me with
so many fond memories."
</P>
<P>
Edwards' announcement comes on the eve of the Broncos' Super
League match against Wigan, the club with whom he enjoyed so much
success.
</P>
<P>
He made 467 appearances, scoring 274 tries, in 14 trophy-filled
seasons for Wigan from 1983-97 and played in 11 Challenge Cup
finals at Wembley, most recently with London 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
London's former Wigan coach John Monie said: "I don't think
British rugby league will ever again see a player who has achieved
what Shaun has. His career has been a feat of remarkable endurance
and his contribution to the game has been immeasurable."
</P>
<P>
"He has battled with injury of late and I think this is the
right decision. I wish him well and I'm sure he will be of great
service in the area of coaching some day if that is what he
chooses to do," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea and Wise Fined by FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea have been fined 50,000
pounds for failing to control their players during a clash with
Wimbledon in February.
</P>
<P>
Captain Dennis Wise was fined 7,500 after pleading guilty to
insulting behavior in preference to a charge of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The Blues were censured and slapped with the fine plus costs at
a Football Association disciplinary hearing in London on Thursday,
despite a plea of not guilty to misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon right-back Kenny Cunningham and Dons coach Mick
Harford were also at the hearing, which was adjourned until a
later date.
</P>
<P>
It could be a number of weeks before a decision is reached in
the case of the Wimbledon players charged.
</P>
<P>
The charges relate to a fracas in the tunnel after the London
derby on 12 February. The FA said there had been a prolonged
confrontation between players and club officials outside the
Chelsea changing room that lasted about three minutes.
</P>
<P>
It began when Wise and Cunningham became involved in a row in
front of referee Peter Jones moments before the final whistle, and
had to be separated by officials.
</P>
<P>
The referee is understood to have witnessed the incident from
start to finish.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson said the club had
received a fair hearing, but added that he was aggrieved by the
level of the fine. Nonetheless, he suggested that an appeal was
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Last month the FA fined Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur a
record 150,000 pounds each for a mass player brawl during a match
on the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
The FA said it had considered deducting points from both teams
for failing to control their players in their Premiership match at
Elland Road.

CAIRO -- The Egyptian government has given the green light for
energy firms to negotiate the sale of natural gas to Israel, after
it blocked such talks for years amid tension over the Middle East
peace process, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum during a
visit by Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Eli Suissa
came after Israel discovered its own gas fields.
</P>

The two sides "agreed to encourage gas companies in the two
countries to enter trade negotiations," said a statement issued

<HEADLINE> Israel to Recognize Palestinian State by May: Israeli TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will recognize
Palestinian independence after the two sides reach a framework
agreement for final-status issues by the end of May, Israel Channel
One television reported Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Citing a senior source familiar with the negotiations, the
report said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had inclined to
agree to "the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
No Israeli official could be reached for comment on the report
as most Israelis are observing the Jewish Sabbath during Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the television report, the border between Israel
and the future independent Palestinian state, however, will not be
decided finally in the framework peace agreement expected to be
drafted by the May deadline.
</P>
<P>
The borderline is reportedly expected to be demarcated between
them by September 13, when the two sides are due to seal a final
peace treaty under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum they signed last
September.
</P>
<P>
Barak threw all his energy into the Israeli-Palestinian peace
track after he realized recently that chances to advance in the
peace talks with Syria, his favorite endeavor during his first 10
months in office, are really slim.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, he sent negotiators to meet with their
Palestinian counterparts in two rounds of talks at Bolling Air
Force in southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
He also went to Washington in person to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton earlier this week. It was believed that during the summit
Barak put forward the proposal to recognize a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The proposed recognition is also a good-will gesture to satisfy
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who toughened stance on declaring
Palestinian statehood on September 13, the seventh anniversary of
the birth of Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to travel to Washington and meet with
Clinton next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, which were launched
last September, are aimed at resolving the most thorny issues
between the two sides, such as the status of Jerusalem, the return
of Palestinian refugees, water sharing, security arrangement and
the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke down in February due to differences over a long-
overdue transfer of another 6.1 percent land of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which forced the two sides to miss the February 13
deadline for a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
After intensive mediation by senior U.S. officials, Barak and
Arafat reached a compromise plan in March to delay the deadline for
a framework accord to mid-May.
</P>
<P>
It appears that after the temporary break, the two sides showed
most sincerity for peace in talks at the Bolling Air Base.
</P>
<P>
However, it is reported that Israel will not make any
concessions on the future of Jerusalem, the city which Israel
claimed as its "eternal and indivisible capital" and the
Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
According to the television report, Barak will not concede to
Palestinian demands on the question of the return of the 3.5
million Palestinian refugees either.

South countries have not been able to share in the benefits of
globalization on an equal footing with the developed countries and
have been essentially excluded from this process, said the final
document approve by 133 member countries in Cuba's capital city of
Havana in the first ever summit of the group in its history.
</P>
<P>
Asymmetries and imbalances have intensified in international
economic relations, particularly with regard to international
cooperation, widening even further the gap between the developing
countries and the industrialized countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
They are also concerned that within the widening North-South
gap, the social and economic conditions of the Least Developed
Counties (LDCs) have been deterioration. The income gap within
countries remain wide, social exclusion and inequalities are
widespread and the number of people living in poverty has
increased, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The Summit called to take urgent measures in order to address
the needs of the large majorities of the population, many of whom
live in villages, dependent on substance farming, otherwise,
golobalization will provide no solutions to the essential problems
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the South also are concerned by the serious
financial problems faced by many of their countries.
</P>
<P>
The volatility of short-term financial flows and the absence of
an appropriate international regulatory framework, particularly in
light of the current volatility of financial markets are affecting
the developing countries, said the leaders in the document.

LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government Friday
defended its record on race relations after coming under fire from
a prominent trade unionist.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was completely mystified by
the claims made by Transport and General Workers Union leader Bill
Morris that its recent policies discriminated against ethnic

The union leader also attacked the government's actions towards

Morris warned that for the first time in his experience, race

"The whole climate has changed on the basis of some of the

Morris, who has been a lifelong Labor supporter, wrote in The

They insist on the need for the developed countries to fulfill

strengthening of the system of trade preferences, considering
their problems of vulnerability and the risk of marginalization in

</P>

They also complained that the liberalization of international

He said the initial explosion, whose cause was not immediately
known, occurred at 11:30 a.m., and a subsequent series of
explosions that lasted for an hour and a half could be felt 20

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Asks Turnover of Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said that the
government filed a brief this morning with the 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta, which had issued the temporary injunction
at the relatives' request on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government told the court that Elian's great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez, who has temporary custody, came to the court with "
unclean hands" and in violation of an order to surrender the boy,
Florman said.
</P>
<P>
The government said Lazaro should not get any help from the
court until he obeys the federal order, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, agreed to stay in the
United States with the boy for that long if he has custody,
according to a letter from his attorney that was attached to the
government brief, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a stage when Lazaro Gonzalez has failed to comply
with an INS order so we have now moved to implement an enforcement
action plan," said Maria Cardona, an INS spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was the most appalling child manipulation and child
exploitation," Cardona said. "I thought it was shameful. If we
needed another reason to immediately move to reunite Elian with
his father, this was certainly it," she added.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Thursday issued a temporary
stay that keeps the Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian in the United
States after the boy's Miami relatives defied a government
deadline to turn over the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and
other 11 people died when their boat capsized in the Atlantic off
Florida. His relatives in Miami then took custody of him,
insisting that the boy should remain in the United States even
after the boy's father came to the U.S. to pick up his son.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department ruled earlier this year that the
boy belongs to his father and should be returned to Cuba.

They expressed concern over the persistence of the external

<P>
They are alarmed at the fact that debt servicing has grown at a

<HEADLINE> Havana Summit Calls for South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the final declaration to be approved later today after three-
day summit of the 133-member group, they ask their fellow members
to observe the South-South cooperation in order to exploit their
potential to promote development though the mobilization and
sharing of existing resources and expertise among them.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation is imperative in the current context of
globalization and it is also essential to pursue it with the
necessary political will, said the document.
</P>
<P>
They also promised to promote sustainable economic growth and
development and constitute a vital element in achieving economic
self-support and in bolstering new South-South relations by
broadening and intensifying economic cooperation among developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
G-77 was founded on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries
in Geneva. Although its current membership has increased to 133
countries, the original name was retained because of its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United nations and
the largest grouping in the South, the organization provides means
for the developing world to articulate and promote its collective
economic interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on
all major international economic issues in the United Nations
system.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit, being held from April 12 to 14 in Havana, is

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of 77 (G-77)
member countries on Friday expressed their rejection to the
unilateral sanctions to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In the final documents -- Declaration of the South Summit
approved Friday after three-day meeting here in Cuban capital city
of Havana, they said they firmly reject the imposition of laws and
regulations with extraterritorial impact and all other forms of
coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions against
developing countries, urging the elimination of them.
</P>
<P>
Such actions not only undermine the principles of the Charter of
the United Nations and International Law, but also severely
threaten the freedom of trade and investment, said the document.
</P>
<P>
They call on the international community to neither recognize
these measures nor apply them.
</P>
<P>
They express grave concern over the impact of economic
sanctions on the civilian population and development capacity in
targeted countries and urge the international community to exhaust
all peaceful methods before resorting to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Libya has now fulfilled all its obligations in
terms of the pertinent Security Council Resolutions, so they urge
the Security Council to adopt a resolution completely lifting the
sanctions against Libya.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Director Concerned by Elian's Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) executive director Carol Bellamy Friday said that a
solution should be found as soon as possible to the case of Cuban
boy Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy told the press Friday at the Panamanian Foreign
Ministry that the case of the Cuban boy must be solved in favor of
the best interests of the child and that the way the case has been
handled so far directly affects Elian's rights.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF director arrived Thursday in this capital, at the
invitation of the Panamanian government for an official visit
related to the Tenth Iberoamerica Summit to be held November 17
and 18, of which the main theme will be childhood and youth.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy revealed that at the request of the United States and
the Cuban governments, "We are going to maintain our neutrality in
this case."
</P>
<P>
However, she said, at the request of the U.S. and the Cuban
governments, the UNICEF office in Havana, Cuba, has been serving
as a neutral territory for the dialogue in the case of the Cuban
boy.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban boy has been in the United States since he was
rescued on the sea in November of last year after a trip from Cuba
in which his mother drowned with other 10 Cubans.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the boy must be delivered to his
father, who now is in Washington, waiting to take his son back
with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the relatives of the Cuban boy in the United States,
supported by U.S. politicians, ignored the U.S. government order
that the boy should be delivered to his father Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Leaders Call for Alleviation Debt Burdens  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Third World leaders called for the
alleviation, or even cancellation of foreign debts of the poorest
countries when they were speaking at the South Summit, the largest
gathering of heads of state or government of the Group of 77 since
its founding in 1964.
</P>
<P>
G-77 Chairman Olusegun Obasanjo, who is also the Nigerian
president, described the heavy debt burden as an obstacle to
economic and social development in developing countries, the
poorest ones in particular.
</P>
<P>
"This burden also discourages new foreign investments, so South
countries should be allowed to start looking for their socio-
economic progress over again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rich countries must think on the possibility of immediately
eliminating the burden that foreign debt represents for the
poorest countries, taking into account the spirit of shared
responsibility in solving the vexing debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki, also chairman of the Non-
Aligned Movement (NAM), said that "the growing economic efforts of
our nations require a constructive and fruitful relation with the
North, focus on alleviating the burden that affects the South."
</P>
<P>
Mebki said that NAM defends common positions for the developing
world in favor of the long-dreamed permanent eradication of
poverty and improving the living standards of peoples in the
developing South.
</P>
<P>
What is in store for the South is the challenge of supporting
democratization of international institutions, including the
United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions, namely the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cuban President Fidel Castro said, "Underdeveloped
countries' foreign debt is astonishing for its huge sum and
scandalous mechanism of exploitation and submission."
</P>
<P>
In fact, "the debt has already been paid, if we consider the
terms under which it was conceived, the rapid growth of dollar
interest rates and the decrease of prices in primary products," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The debt of poor people is a political, and not an economic
problem, which demands a political solution," he said. "We cannot
continue ignoring this problem should be mainly solved by those
who have the power and the means: the rich nations."
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader reiterated that this phenomenon is one of the
greatest obstacles for development and a bomb ready to explode
under the world economy in any economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"As we has previously said, the Third World foreign debt is
unpayable and uncollectible," Castro said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was also concerned over
the crushing debt burden, echoed the statement from South leaders,
and called on developed countries to allow the Third World
products a greater access to their markets, cancel the debts and
encouraged them to be more generous in helping development.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to prevent developing nations from
continuing to face a great quantity of obstacles to their
participation in the global economy when they are confronted with
conflicts and epidemics, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debt was among topics under debates during the three-
day South Summit, which came as an opportunity to reflect on the
major problems facing developing countries and map out strategy
for social and economic development in the South.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Exchange Papers of Each Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
delegations have exchanged papers outlining each sides' views for
a framework agreement, the U.S. State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that the
two delegations nearing the end of their talks at the Bolling Air
Force Base, southeast of Washington, had engaged in intensive,
serious and substantive discussions through the week.
</P>
<P>
"During the course of these discussions, the two sides
exchanged papers on this subject of how to create a skeleton for a
framework agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will wind up this weekend and negotiators on both
sides will return home for consultation with their leaders. Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the papers contained "all the core elements needed
for a framework agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there are tough issues and gaps that remain, but
obviously we want to continue working with the parties to overcome
those gaps," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hasan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington,
said it was an exchange of informal papers. "We presented the
Israelis with our understandings, and they presented us with
theirs," he said
</P>
<P>
"There is no progress on substance. There is a wide gap between
the two sides," Rahman added.
</P>
<P>
Mark Regev, the Israeli Embassy spokesman, said there had been
no expectation the current round of talks would produce historic
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping for an energized process with the Palestinians,
and it can move if both sides show a seriousness and a level of
conciliation and a willingness to compromise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that Washington agreed to "play a more intensive
role in the discussions and have greater involvement in the
discussions."

These five "entities" includes one DPRK's corporation and four

two years all new U.S. government contracts or export licenses to
those entities.

<HEADLINE> American Vintners Association Supports China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) The American Vintners
Association (AVA), the national trade association representing 600
winery members in 43 states, urged Congress on Friday to approve
Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China before it gains
full membership in the World Trade Organization (WT0).
</P>
<P>
"China is recognized as a huge potential for American wineries,
but what is most interesting is the chance to enter this
tremendous market with a relatively level playing," AVA President
Simon Siegl said.
</P>
<P>
The American wine industry has the opportunity to benefit
greatly from the U.S.-China trade agreement signed last November,
under which tariffs on wine would be reduced from 65% to 20%
within three years of enactment and private companies would be
allowed to set up their own distribution system to secure much
greater market access.
</P>
<P>
AVA winery members are encouraged to make it clear to their
federal delegations that the passage of China PNTR is vitally
important to the development of new market, and a failure to do so
would hand the opportunity to their global competitors, the
Europeans in particular.
</P>
<P>
"In most third-market countries, American wineries are
constantly attempting to overcome the domination of major
producers of the European Union. This agreement with China places
everyone at the same starting position," Siegl said.
</P>
<P>
AVA is a member of the Agricultural Coalition for U.S.-China
Trade, which includes 75 associations representing agricultural
interests in Washington DC. The Coalition is an effective vehicle
in channeling the American farmers' message for PNTR to the
Capitol Hill, where the vote will be cast on the issue in the week
of May 22.

<HEADLINE> Roundup--Common Wishes and Fair Demands by the South  (by Xue Hong, Sun Guangying) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wishes and claims by South countries consist in establishing a
new international economic order, intensifying South-South
cooperation, deepening dialogue and relations with the North,
building a true free trade system, and access to advanced
technology.
</P>
<P>
It is meaningful that South countries could have built a
consensus on the path to follow, a prevision looking into the
future, a wide strategy and common goals in the future.
</P>
<P>
This constitutes a concrete collective actions platform with
the purpose of defending developing countries interests, in the
face of the fact that many of these are in the margins of
globalization, with a widening North-South gap.
</P>
<P>
Amidst intensified globalization, the definition of economic
and trade rules at a world level has a special meaning, since they
have been set up by countries of the North, and are for their own
benefit.
</P>
<P>
South countries believe that they have to be aware with
globalization, development, in the center of economic and
technical world revolution, to the articulation of their concerns
and opinions, to the elaboration of the rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
Southern countries wish to participate in the benefits of
globalization in equal conditions with countries of the North, and
the declaration makes a call to carry out a common action of the
South in the face of world globalization, an integral position
before a reform of the international monetary and financial system,
to influence in the development of economic policies and in search
of effective and fast solutions for the problems affecting the
South.
</P>
<P>
In these documents approved by the heads of state and the
representatives of the 122 participating countries, South
countries claim to safeguard sovereignty, equality of national
interests in the face of globalization's opportunities and
challenges. Representatives of the South countries coincide in
considering that it is important to avoid becoming appendixes of
the North.
</P>
<P>
The growing weight of foreign investments and the role of
transnationals, generally from the North, in the economies of the
countries from the South threaten their sovereignty and
independence, because their governments are loosing their power to
undertake a macroeconomic adjust in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Capitals are freely flowing, generally from North countries, as
financial or productive system investments, generally in the South,
they have to do with the
financial and economic system of these countries.
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy thing for the South countries to receive
help from the nations of the North, for this help is always
conditioned with "improving human rights, driving democracy, and
applying austerity and reform policies."
</P>
<P>
The austerity conditions of the assistance, considered by
important characters from the South as "many thunders, and little
water," do not precisely make benefits to stay.
</P>
<P>
South is demanding to erase the incredible inequality between
countries of the South and the North, foreign debt condonation,
access to markets and to advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
The gap between North and South is widening. About 86 percent
of the world's gross domestic product is controlled by a reduced
part of the countries of the North. Productive factors of utmost
importance are dominated and controlled by the North. Resources
and income go easily to North countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there exist alarming problems in the South, such as
intense richness concentration, extreme inequality, burdensome
foreign debt, famines, diseases and illiteracy, among others,
beyond any achievement done.
</P>
<P>
The Summit considers important to drive North-South dialogue,
because the South cannot handle its matters without the North in a
world in which interdependency is growing, and the gap between
both sectors of the world is widening.
</P>
<P>
In the Summit, the South countries demand the universalization
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the elimination of
unbalances between rights and obligations, the removal of trade
barriers and other unfair trade practices, as well as many other
protectionism forms, in spite South countries are not against
liberalization of world trade, but against those measures.
</P>
<P>
Poor countries make up a great market, which covers three
quarters of the planet, but only control 10 percent of world trade,
because the most part of trade is carried out among rich nations.
</P>
<P>
Due to globalization and the fast development of science and
technology, traditional products, mainly from the South, give up
more space to manufactured, modern technology, mainly from the
North.
</P>
<P>
Besides non-tariff barriers, such as sanitary, technical and
subsidiary, imposed by countries of the North, prevent the
establishment of a real free trade between North and South,
affecting basically underdeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
South countries made a call for the establishment of a common
South strategy in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to negotiate.
They wish the interests of developing countries be taken into
account when a new round of negotiations takes place.
</P>
<P>
They claim to abstain of establishing excessive or onerous
exigencies to developing countries, in considering that the
creation of a free trade must include everyone.
</P>
<P>
South countries are aware of their unity to become a true
multinational force. That is their main challenge.
</P>
<P>
The integration of South countries is still the best way of
cooperation in their search for development and growth, inputting
courage and strength to face current challenges.
</P>
<P>
Thus South countries seek to promote the formation of a debtors
club, constituting a banking institution of the South, to create a
telecommunications company and to create an electronic network of
commerce chambers of the South, among others.
</P>
<P>
Besides, South countries are decided to improve the G-77, for
they consider it a political, economic and commercial alliance
with great influence in developing member countries, a mechanism
of negotiation in a unified position to raise its negotiating
capability.

<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Friday that he would raise the issue of human rights
in Chechnya when he meets Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin
next week.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly message on the Internet, Blair said he would"
clearly and frankly" talk with Putin about his concern of human
rights in Chechenya.
</P>
<P>
Putin is scheduled to arrive in London on Sunday evening for
his first visit to Western countries as Russian leader. Putin
clearly wants to patch up differences with Britain over Chechnya,
drum up foreign investment and find ways to avoid an anti-missile
arms race.
</P>
<P>
"Russia should allow full access to international
organizations which have a role to play in Chechnya and I hope
that Russia will act on the clear lesson from similar such
conflicts around the world: that there are no purely military
solutions," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"Political dialogue is essential," the prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> AIDS, Another Burden for the Third World: G-77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Third World must bear,
together with the inequalities in the commercial exchange and the
foreign debt burden, the highest figure of cases of Acquired
Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), an epidemic that decimates in
the first place all the inhabitants and resources of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of the pandemics among the developing countries,
especially in Africa, emerged Friday in the interventions of the
delegates to the Southern Summit in the Cuban capital, where many
have expressed the social pressure into which that disease
translates itself.
</P>
<P>
Justin Malewezi, Malawi Republic (Africa) Vice President, was
one of the leaders in the Southern Summit who insisted the most on
the theme on Friday, by remembering that some 23 million of the 36
million of carriers of the Human Immuno-defficiency Virus (HIV)
live in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He made a very concrete proposal by saying that the millions of
money the debtor countries direct to the service of their foreign
commitments, should be channeled to the fight against the terrible
disease.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bush's Fund-raising Breaks New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presumptive
presidential nominee George W. Bush has raised more than 81
million dollars in his campaign, setting a new record in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
The campaign raised around 7 million dollars between March 1
and April 6, three-quarters of the goal of 10 million dollars by
the end of April, campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the campaign also raised 1.6 million dollars
online by March 31 after it stepped up online fund raising.
</P>
<P>
Since the presidential primary season started in January, the
Texas Governor spent 63.3 million dollars of the record 71 million
dollars raised, leaving about 7.5 million dollars in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The de facto Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Al
Gore, had around 10 million dollars to spend as of the end of
February.
</P>
<P>
Both Bush and Gore are expected to report their fund-raising
figures to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gore can spend no more than 40.5 million dollars as he is
receiving federal funds during the primary period while Bush does
not have such a limit.
</P>
<P>
Both Bush and Gore will collect 67.6 million dollars each in
federal money after their presidential nominations are confirmed
at their parties' national conventions this summer.

<HEADLINE> G-77 Concerned over Assistance Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We exhort developed countries to comply with their compromise
of destining 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product for this
kind of assistance," said the Summit's Declaration approved on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 South Summit took place from April 12 to 14 with the
participation of heads of state from member countries at Havana,
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The block demanded the reduction or cancellation of foreign
debts not be carried out at the expense of official assistance for
development.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 called for convening of an International Conference on
Development Financing to define a new strategical frame of
cooperation and a new global association to provide resources for
growth.
</P>
<P>
The vicious circle between debt and underdevelopment has
worsened, said the document.
</P>
<P>
"We are alarmed because the debt service has grown at a higher
rate than the debt itself," that is, it is worse in those South
countries with low or medium income, says the document.
</P>
<P>
The block said that the debt service has worsened in many South
countries, including those with medium and low income.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 showed its particular concern for Africa, where it
said the debt growth, official assistance for development, and the
fall of its product's prices worsen economic and social conditions
in the countries of the region.

<HEADLINE> South Leaders Slam Negative Impact of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi Friday called for more
logic, balanced and equal ties in the World, something the
countries in the South could achieve by implementing the
appropriate mechanisms after the Summit, which opened here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to explain, he said, the sad irony of World history
in the last three centuries, during which a group of countries
from the North have plundered those in the South, depriving them
of self-determination, and keeping them subject to economic
backwardness.
</P>
<P>
James Michel, vice president of the Republic of Seychelles said
that the foreign debt continues to be the main factor that stunts
economic growth among developing countries, fed by the steady
decline in prices of basic products.
</P>
<P>
In that regard, he proposed that the Summit approve a package
of measures to relief the debt burden, also providing for the
frame to release the necessary resources that would help finance
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
But sustainable development needs a peaceful environment to
take place, said vice president of Malawi in a separate speech,
adding that poverty, illiteracy and communicable diseases continue
to be untackled problems for the Third World.
</P>
<P>
Frank Watson, vice prime minister of Bahamas, who spoke on
behalf of those many small island nations that are twice as
vulnerable to the current trends of economic liberalization, also
demanded that their voice to be heard at the decision-taking
circles in the North.
</P>
<P>
For the vice primer Minister of Uganda, Eriya Kategaya, the
fast path of globalization has brought no prosperity at all, but
turned instead into a two-edged knife that yielded higher
standards of living for a few, while leaving the majority in the
shadows of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Summit came as many developing countries are being
marginalized in the tide of globalization due to the present
injust and unfair international political and economic system.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges 617 Points on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks plunged
Friday in fears of inflation after a report on an unexpectedly
strong rise in consumer prices in March.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 617.78 or 5.6
percent at 10,305.77, extending its loss of 201.58 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators also fell sharply. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 355.49 or 9.7 percent at 3,
321.29 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 83.95 or 5.8
percent at 1,356.56.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index has dropped 1,727 points or 34 percent from
its record closing high of 5,048.62 points set on March 10,
falling deeply into bear-market territory. A drop of 20 percent or
more was defined as bear market.
</P>
<P>
The market tumbled as the Labor Department reported that
consumer inflation rose 0.7 percent in March, worse than 0.5
percent analysts have expected. The report added to new fears in
inflation, which were triggered Thursday by another report on a
wholesale prices increase in the same month.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times as a
pre-emptive move to keep inflation under control and the plunge in
technology stock recently dose not seem to change the Federal
Reserve's plan for more rise in rates. The Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan indicated at a congressional hearing
Thursday that the recent plummet in the technology stocks would do
little to deter his plan to raise rates again.

Exchange index fell 57.26 at 857.97. The Russell 2000 index of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Leaders Call for Fair Play in Globalization (by Gu Zhenqiu)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the historic event, which kicked off on Wednesday,
leaders from Algeria, Malaysia, Barbados, Pakistan and Palestine
criticized the negative effects of globalization on economic and
social development, trade, and access to sophisticated science and
technology in the South.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflik, currently chairman of
the Organization of African Unity, said that the South's non-
participation in decision-making in international economic
relations has created inequality in globalization.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are being marginalized in the tide of
globalization, which resulted from the advancement of science and
technology, including information technology.
</P>
<P>
An example of such marginalization is the amount of foreign
investments considered derisive, especially in African countries,
due to the heavy debt burden in the South, he said. "The vicious
circle must be broken."
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the marginalization on unfair trade in the
world,where raw materials from the South are constantly devalued
in the world markets controlled by the North.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
that globalization should contribute to a more fair and equitable
world economic order.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the process today turned out to be a synonym
for inequality, he said. "Globalization threatens to become a
religion that doesn't permit heresy."
</P>
<P>
The South Summit, which is to end here on Friday night, came
in the largest gathering of heads of state and government of the
Group of 77 (G-77) since its founding in 1964.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pakistan encouraged G-77 members to support
the nation's call to an international conference on globalization
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani chief executive, Pervez Musharraf, held that the
resources used to buy weapons for regional wars and conflicts
should be dedicated to health and education program in those
countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he underlined the importance of the South-South
cooperation, saying that South countries should cooperate in this
unfair world.
</P>
<P>
Representing the Caribbean, Owen Arthur, prime minister of
Barbados, stressed the need for more participation in
international
financial decision-making by the South.
</P>
<P>
Palestine leader Yasser Arafat agreed that globalization is a
powerful and dynamic force to empower cooperation and accelerate
development that presents opportunities and risks at the same time.
</P>
<P>
In their separate speeches, many South leaders sang in one
voice,calling for the establishment of a fair, rational new
international political and economic order to safeguard the
collective interests of developing countries.
