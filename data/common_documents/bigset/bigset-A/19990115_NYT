 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The day after Michael Jordan left basketball, saying he feared
losing interest in chasing championships in midseason, another
member of the Class of '84 with NBA championship rings could not
relate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon said he was surprised by Jordan's
decision. But despite the experiences they and few others share,
Olajuwon said they do not share the problem that led to Jordan's
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a concept (that) it's a sport,'' Olajuwon
said Thursday. ``Look at sport. Sport is relaxation. When you're
out in the real world, things are so intense. You come to the
court, you feel free to express yourself. This is where you relax.
If you take it as intense, as war, you're stressing out on the
court. This is where you express your skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement is very therapeutic. You shoot a jumper, you see
it flow, the rotation. It goes in. You make a move, you change
direction, you lose a guy, if it works, you're expressing yourself.
You're painting a picture on the floor. You've done so much work
outside. Now you see the result on the court. You're running.
You're not getting tired. You're moving. You see some guys are
getting tired. That's the motivation. If you apply that concept to
the court, it's therapeutic. You build a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In appreciating the beauty in his sport, Olajuwon similarly has
not lost interest in winning a championship. And though the
Rockets, with only three healthy players under contract after
Rodrick Rhodes tore a pectoral tendon Thursday, are a work in
progress, Olajuwon said he considers his team a contender.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he always considers his team a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a season I went in believing we couldn't win a
championship,'' he said. ``I can't imagine being on a team going
into the season believing you can't win a championship. What is the
motivation?''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon's improved health and strength would seem a reason to
feel more optimistic about the season to come. He played only some
light one-on-one Thursday, but he said it was enough to test the
leg strength from his offseason regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing one-on-one, I was just playing, playing to win,
without any restrictions,'' Olajuwon said. ``That's the way you
like to feel. I like to feel I can just focus on making the basket,
rather than thinking about, `Can I go to this side or that side and
jump?' I feel free out there. I was winded. That's conditioning.
But I was not restricted in any movements. That's the weights. That
gives me strength. I feel confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his good health, there is precedence for Olajuwon to
believe a third NBA championship is on the way. The last time
Jordan retired, the Rockets won the next two titles.
</P>
<P>
   Like those championships, considered by some less of an
accomplishment because the Rockets did not beat the Bulls, Olajuwon
believes this season's title will be criticized because it will
come after a 50-game season.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Rockets of 1994 and 1995, Olajuwon said this
season's champion would not care what is said about the validity of
its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, anybody that wins the championship this year
will not be credited as such,'' Olajuwon said. ``Any team that wins
a championship this year will be a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players really want to win and dedicate themselves and work
hard in the offseason. If you put in the effort, (a championship)
will be worth the effort regardless of what somebody says from the
outside. You know you worked hard to see the result. If somebody
wants to discredit that, that doesn't matter to you. They see
what's on the court. They don't know what goes into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said it was what goes into it that led to his retirement.
Olajuwon said anyone with Jordan's passion to compete couldn't
suddenly lose it. But he said he could understand why Jordan would
choose to leave on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has lost his desire,'' Olajuwon said. ``The
desire is almost a passion for basketball. Somebody so competitive,
someone at that level, so skillful, you can't lose the desire. It's
just natural. It's something that comes instinctively. I don't know
(if) his idea was `I'd like to retire on a championship note.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just say he left on a winning note, on the highest
level.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting exit, Olajuwon said. But for Olajuwon, it's the
leaving part that for now he could not share.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BASICALLY, the Astros traded Astros catcher Brad Ausmus for Astros
catcher Mitch Meluskey and some cash.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever C.J. Nitkowski and five Detroit Tigers prospects also
were involved in the deal that was announced Thursday. But like
Orbit, the Dome Patrol and hot peanuts, if any of those players
culled from the foam atop Detroit's organization adds to your
enjoyment of the 1999 Astros season, it will be only more fun for
your buck.
</P>
<P>
   This was not about the Astros making an earth-shaking move
toward a World Series title. General manager Gerry Hunsicker said
as much, answering, ``Not necessarily,'' when asked.
</P>
<P>
   This was about Ausmus and Meluskey. It was about keeping the
Astros strong and keeping the future bright. And it was about the
man who was left out hanging on a limb a few weeks ago but was not
afraid to inch even further out on it Thursday: Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   It was about letting go of probably the best defensive catcher
the Astros ever had, trading a popular clubhouse asset who handled
a once-tenuous pitching staff superbly. It was about saying goodbye
to a local heartthrob, a solid player and a solid person who counts
the cornerstone franchise players, Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell,
among his friends.
</P>
<P>
   It was about taking a chance on an unproven catcher in Meluskey
who potentially carries a stick like no regular Astros catcher
before and has made great strides handling minor-league pitching
staffs. But the key words are ``unproven,'' ``potentially'' and
``minor-league.''
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey, 25, could become a cornerstone of the franchise, but
will the Astros be a World Series contender when he becomes that
player? Hunsicker is rolling the dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take the easy way is to never give the young players a
chance,'' Hunsicker said. ``You end up having a team that grows old
together. I have every confidence that it was a risk worth
taking.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once Thursday _ on at least four occasions by my count
_ Meluskey was mentioned in the same breath as legendary catchers
Johnny Bench and Ted Simmons. No pressure, kid.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: This was no minor deal _ not for Meluskey and
certainly not for Hunsicker. This was a deal that will affect the
1999 Astros significantly, one way or another. And more than
anything, it could affect the relationship between Hunsicker and
club owner Drayton McLane Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker is a baseball man. McLane is a businessman. They know
their stuff. They have worked well together on numerous occasions,
but sometimes they have pulled in different directions _ never more
than in this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   This was a deal the baseball man thought he had to make and the
owner thought was not important enough to drop his other business
obligations in order to show up at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   This was Hunsicker's deal.
</P>
<P>
   We can question the merits of taking such a gamble with a team
that seems on the brink of a World Series run. We can wonder about
a proven player being replaced by a potential player.
</P>
<P>
   We can watch how this deal unfolds closely, but no one figures
to watch more closely than McLane.
</P>
<P>
   McLane guards gate receipts and the bottom line carefully, but
he guards the standings more.
</P>
<P>
   McLane sees a payroll that he would like to keep at around $50
million, but when a marquee winner such as Randy Johnson is a free
agent, a player who can make the turnstiles spin and opponents
quiver, he personally flies to Arizona and offers a satchel filled
with $33 million. Budget be damned.
</P>
<P>
   When a Cy Young-collecting hometown hero like Roger Clemens is
available, McLane takes over the reins of the general manager's
role and tries to swing the trade even as Hunsicker is calling a
news conference shooting it down.
</P>
<P>
   What is the message we should retrieve from McLane throwing the
budget out the window one week, contradicting his general manager,
causing a major stir, then OK'ing a deal that might save $2 million
but raises questions?
</P>
<P>
   It tells us all about Hunsicker. He is not afraid to take a
chance on baseball, even after seeing his career tremble in the
wake of the Clemens escapade. He is not afraid of the $2 million
question raised with Thursday's deal.
</P>
<P>
   The names Dean Crow, Mark Persails, Brian Powell, Paul Bako and
Carlos Villalobos probably do nothing for you. They are decent
players and decent prospects, but the season-ticket phone lines
will not ring off the wall today and none of those players figures
to contribute to a World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker sees potential in Meluskey. McLane will watch the
standings. No pressure, Gerry.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Two years ago, the Astros and Detroit Tigers raised eyebrows with a
nine-player trade that brought to Houston the catcher whom the
organization had been looking for seemingly forever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two seasons and two division championships later, that catcher
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise seven-player trade Thursday, the Astros dealt
starting catcher Brad Ausmus and lefthanded reliever C.J. Nitkowski
_ two of the five players the Astros received in the December 1996
deal with the Tigers _ back to Detroit for five players.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros obtained pitchers Dean Crow, Mark Persails and Brian
Powell, catcher Paul Bako and infielder Carlos Villalobos, all of
whom spent parts of last season in the minor leagues and two of
whom have no major-league experience.
</P>
<P>
   By unloading Ausmus, a defensive-minded catcher who played a
major role in consecutive National League Central Division titles
for the Astros the past two seasons, it paves the way for
minor-league prospect Mitch Meluskey, 25, to compete for the No. 1
catching duties along with Tony Eusebio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is a risk in this trade because we have given up a
key player in a key spot,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
``Quite frankly, the talent on this club is strong enough to
withstand whatever risk we might have taken with this particular
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest deal with Detroit accomplishes three objectives for
the Astros:
</P>
<P>
   It replenishes a farm system thinned by several trades during
the past year, including three-for-one deals for outfielder Moises
Alou and lefthander Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It allows the club to make room for Meluskey, a power-hitting
switch hitter who batted .353 with 41 doubles, 17 home runs and 71
RBIs at Class AAA New Orleans last year, to compete with Eusebio
for the starting job when spring training begins next month.
Eusebio, who has spent most of his five seasons with the Astros as
a backup, signed a one-year, $800,000 contract Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most probable scenario would be we start next season with
both catchers splitting time and see where we go,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   It permits the Astros to continue managing their payroll. The
club has approximately $42 million committed to 13 players, with
six players still eligible for arbitration. Ausmus had two years
left on his contract, which pays him $2.5 million in '99 and $3.5
million in 2000. Meluskey will make the league minimum of $175,000
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our payroll has increased rather dramatically in the last
couple of years, and it's something we'll always have to be
conscious of and try and balance the talent we have with the monies
we have to spend,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus, who hit .269 with 45 RBIs last season, was traded to the
Astros on Dec. 10, 1996, along with pitchers Jose Lima, Trever
Miller, Nitkowski and outfielder Daryle Ward for pitchers Doug
Brocail and Todd Jones, center fielder Brian Hunter, shortstop
Orlando Miller and an undisclosed amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the trade, Hunsicker hailed Ausmus as the
front-line catcher to solve the Astros' problems at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a business, and trades are a part of this
business,'' said Ausmus, 29. ``I'm not going to say I was angry,
but I was disappointed. This is a good group of guys, and it's very
rare that you get such a good group of guys and a good crop of
talent that mixes so smoothly. The thing I'm going to miss the most
are the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski, 25, was 3-3 with a 3.77 ERA and three saves in 43
appearances with the Astros last season. He didn't figure in the
club's plans late in the season and was sent to the minors in early
August before being called up for the final month of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new Astros, Hunsicker believes Crow and Powell are the
most likely to compete for spots on the 25-man major-league roster
this spring. Crow, 26, a righthanded reliever, pitched 45 innings
over 29 games last year while splitting time between the majors and
Class AAA Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, a righthander expected to compete for a spot in the
starting rotation, began last season at Class AA before making 16
starts in his first season. He finished 3-8 with a 6.35 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   With Nitkowski and free agent Mike Magnante gone, the Astros
have only two lefties in the bullpen _ Miller and closer Billy
Wagner _ after having four at one point in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really depend on lefthander-vs.-lefthander,
righthander-vs.-righthander matchups that much,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``One of the things I try to do is limit the number
of appearances that relief pitchers make during the course of the
year so we have a strong bullpen at the end of the year. Sometimes,
that means we have a righthander face a lefthander and vice versa.
I don't care which hand they throw with as long as they get people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bako served as Detroit's primary catcher after an April 29
recall, starting 83 of 139 games. His .272 batting average for the
season was seven points higher than his career minor-league mark.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the five players obtained by the Astros have a total
of 128 games of major-league experience. The Astros filled out
their 40-man roster by adding Crow, Powell, Bako and Villalobos.
</P>
<P>
   Trade inquiries began with Detroit general manager Randy Smith,
the son of Astros president Tal Smith, last fall and began to gain
momentum within the past few weeks, Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Does this end the offseason trading for the Astros? Hunsicker
did not rule out the possibility of more, although it seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly looking at what we have to spend and how to
maximize those dollars,'' he said. ``I wouldn't rule out another
trade, but at this point I don't think (this trade) has any bearing
on any further trades.''

TRIAL DOESN'T FLY WITH AIR TRAVELERS

<P>
   On Thursday, the beginning of President Clinton's impeachment
trial, the crowd at Sky Harbor Airport is more worried about
answering Southwest Airlines trivia questions, sipping
complimentary gourmet coffee and munching on cake to celebrate a
new non-stop flight to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Warner, who is waiting to fly to the Emerald City, swings
her long black hair away from her face, grips the microphone at the
gate and belts out the company jingle. She's on a roll, having
already answered two questions correctly. The crowd laughs and
claps wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Darbie Shelman, a Southwest Airlines employee behind the counter
explains, ``We're celebrating our inaugural flight. People here
aren't worried about President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sky Harbor Airport's Terminal 4, there's no sign that a
historic moment is unraveling in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When asked about the second presidential impeachment trial in
U.S. history, these travelers don't want to discuss perjury or
obstruction of justice. They don't want to debate the ethics of
Clinton's sexual escapades. They're too busy for that. They've
heard enough about his lies on and off the stand.
</P>
<P>
   What this crowd wants to know is, What's taking so long?
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be rid of him by now,'' says Mike Zinser, who is
waiting for a flight to Nashville and typing away on his laptop.
``This should have been over a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the talk of Clinton's trial agitates a woman sitting a few
seats away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired of it all. There are just so many more important
things to worry about,'' says Sharon Murphy, a retiree who makes
Phoenix her home in the winter. ``Why don't they just leave him
alone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this trial going to last forever?'' some of the travelers
ask me.
</P>
<P>
   That is the question &UR; these Americans want answered on the day
President Clinton's trial begins.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them talk about how President Clinton's affair was
disclosed nearly a year ago and how they want the case to end.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sherrie Andersen says she skips the front-page news entirely
when she buys a newspaper and instead goes right to the features
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't we wasted enough time with this?'' asks Jim Blathmer,
as he pores over spreadsheets for an upcoming meeting with a
partner from his accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Zinser declares to everyone within earshot that he plans to
boycott the entire proceeding. With his laptop open, he sits by a
window, far away from the &UR; television and says, ``I can't believe a
year later this ordeal is still going on. What's wrong with this
country?''
</P>
<P>
   His incredulity is lost, however, on the crowd. The Southwest
Airlines fun bunch is doling out prizes again _ inflatable airplane
hats, plastic sunglasses and &UR; multicolored mousepads &UR; bearing the
company's logo.
</P>
<P>
   Zinser shakes his head, throws his hands up and leaves to help
himself to a piece of butterscotch cake. &QL; 
As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie Amparano
will be taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

L.A.'S QUAKE-RAVAGED GHOST TOWN AREAS BEING RESURRECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In just 30 seconds, the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake transformed the neighborhoods around Francisco Chara's
and Steve Watenmaker's homes into literal ghost towns, empty of
people and magnets for crime.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 17 quake nears,
the ghost town around Alabama Avenue and Saticoy Street by Chara's
house is now fully rebuilt, and the suburban Canoga Park
neighborhood is alive with people in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty good now,'' Chara said. ``We got brand-new
buildings right over there. Since the quake, they've fixed things
up a lot better -- and the neighborhood's a lot nicer, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast, the view from Watenmaker's house has not
changed much: The condominiums next door in the Victory
Boulevard-Tampa Avenue ghost town in nearby Reseda remain in
shambles -- a Hollywood favorite for filming apocalyptic movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an eyesore -- a constant reminder of what happened on
Jan. 17,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the latter area has become a relative rarity in the five
years since the quake. The vast majority of these blighted blocks
have been rebuilt in the five years since America's most costly
natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles city housing report released Thursday stated that
vacancies in the recovering neighborhoods are now lower than before
the quake. Only 134 of the 65,000 seriously damaged housing units
remain unrepaired.
</P>
<P>
   Where the quake emptied entire blocks of apartment complexes in
17 neighborhoods across Los Angeles, ``Now Renting'' signs and new
landscaping have replaced ``No Trespassing'' signs and barbed-wire
fences. Young mothers wheel their babies past renovated buildings
that had been little more than shattered cover for squatters, drug
dealers and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ghost towns are pretty much gone,'' said Councilman Hal
Bernson, who led the city's earthquake recovery committee. ``I
think virtually all of them have been renovated or rebuilt. A lot
of places that were in disrepair before the earthquake were
replaced with nice, new housing. I think we're pretty much ahead of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long road: The 6.7-magnitude earthquake caused
roughly $2.2 billion in structural damage to more than 65,000
apartments and single-family houses, city housing officials said.
Roughly 11,000 homes were vacated. All but two of the 17 ghost
towns are either completely restored or just wrapping up
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The isolated trouble spots are two boarded-up fourplexes on
Corning Street in central Los Angeles. And there are 131 partially
renovated condominiums in the Victory-Tampa ghost town, but work
cannot continue until a series of lawsuits are settled.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and the developer said they are sympathetic to
the plight of ghost town neighbors like Watenmaker, but that's
little consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the view we've had pretty much since the earthquake,''
Watenmaker said, gesturing toward the stripped lumber walls of the
Tampa Manor Condominiums, also known as the Victory-Tampa ghost
town.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's unfair that he has to pay full taxes when the
recovery is far from complete in his neighborhood and when a
massive eyesore clearly lowers the value of his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable. I can't get a straight answer from
anyone about what's going on,'' Watenmaker said, poking his toe at
a weathered sign that proudly proclaims the project is being funded
with city and federal disaster loans. ``This just increases my
desire to see the Valley secede from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I share his frustration,'' said Councilwoman Laura Chick,
whose district includes the Victory-Tampa ghost town.
``Unfortunately, sometimes there are problems with contractors and
people suing each other that government can't do anything about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly working on it. It's too bad it's not done, but
when it is completed it will be a lot nicer than what was there
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruined complex is proof that the final winners and losers of
the Northridge Quake still remain to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Reseda developer Bill Miller may be a winner. He scored with the
purchase of a sturdy but damaged commercial building that was
foreclosed upon after the quake.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his partners took advantage of quake financing deals
to renovate the building, which now stands out as one of the best
looking buildings in what was the Plummer Street-Reseda Boulevard
ghost town. The building is half-full, and renovations on the last
damaged suites are wrapping up, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased,'' he added. ``It's probably one of the best
buildings in the San Fernando Valley. It's been through two
quakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canoga Park, apartment owners Leo and Marian Wenzel are
bracing for a delayed financial aftershock from the Northridge
Quake.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miller, the Wenzels took advantage of federal disaster
assistance to rebuild their six-unit apartment building in the
Roscoe Boulevard-Schoenborn Street ghost town, but five years later
their story is not so happy.
</P>
<P>
   The combined mortgage and city disaster assistance loan on their
building is more than $316,000. The building is valued at only
$200,000, which means that even if the Wenzels could sell it, they
would still be in debt to the bank or the city.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some property owners who abandoned their buildings -- and
mortgages -- Leo Wenzel did not do so, a decision he said he may
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not give it to the bank,'' he said, ``but now I don't
know what's going to happen when the payment to the city comes up
in November. I just don't have the money. There's not that kind of
income from the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite isolated cases, city officials say the rebuilding
effort was mostly a success thanks to more than $361 million in
federal disaster assistance loans coupled with tax credits -- money
crucial to the quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the recovery gets good marks from residents of the
former ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're starting to get it together,'' said Lance Thomas, who
was relocated to the Alabama-Saticoy ghost town when his suburban
Northridge apartment was red-tagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many places left around here that are
earthquake-damaged,'' Thomas said. ``For five years down the road,
it's not too bad, I guess. It's getting better.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
For most of his career, the scouting report on Mitch Meluskey, one
of the Astros' top minor-league prospects, was all about offense.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That all changed in a hurry. During a visit to the
organization's Class AAA affiliate in New Orleans in 1997, Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker delivered a message to Meluskey:
Defense will get you to the major leagues quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really helped me in feeling this kid was ready
was the attitude adjustment he's made over the last year and a
half,'' Hunsicker said. ``This is a kid that came up as an
offensive player, and that's all he really focused on. I told him,
`If you want to get to the big leagues any time soon, this decision
hinges on your defense. You have to make a commitment to getting
better defensively.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has the glove to go with the bat _ and a possible
full-time job with one of the top teams in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Just months after getting his first taste of the major leagues,
Meluskey could become a fixture around the Astrodome _ and the
Ballpark at Union Station, for that matter _ after the Astros sent
No. 1 catcher Brad Ausmus to Detroit in a seven-player trade
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The job is Meluskey's to win. A 25-year-old behind the plate for
a two-time division champion? Pressure, what pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel like it's any pressure,'' Meluskey said by
phone from his offseason home in Yakima, Wash. ``This is what I've
been working on. Pressure is when you're in Class A and Double-A
and you go 0-for-8 trying to get to the big leagues. That's where I
felt it every day. If you screw up down in the minors, you might
get down on yourself. Now, knowing I have a chance to play (in the
majors), I just want to go out, play and let things take care of
themselves. I don't want to put any pressure on myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to play on a team that is one of the
leaders in all of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   To help smooth the transition, backup Tony Eusebio is expected
to platoon with Meluskey until one assumes the every-day duties.
Eusebio, 31, who started 46 games in 1998 and handled the catching
duties for 19-game-winning righthander Shane Reynolds, was in his
native Dominican Republic on Thursday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey said if the Astros decide to implement a platoon
situation, it wouldn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``However it works,'' Meluskey said. ``By no means would I say
this is my job now. I figure it's going to be a platoon situation,
and that's fine with me. I just want to be there and help the club
win another title.''
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey, a switch hitter, brings impressive offensive
credentials: He batted .353 with 41 doubles, 17 home runs and 71
RBIs in 121 games at New Orleans. In eight regular-season games
with the Astros, he was 2-for-8 (.250) with no homers and no RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll invariably take our lumps during the learning curve,''
Hunsicker said. ``This is one of those risks you have to take or
otherwise a guy like Mitch Meluskey never gets a chance to play. To
me, this kid is as good a hitter as we have in our minor-league
system and probably one of the better hitters in all of
minor-league baseball. For a kid that switch-hits, he has power
from both sides, has excellent eyes, and his on-base percentage is
well above average, which is rather unusual for a young hitter. He
has a chance to be a run producer, which adds to an already
explosive lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's his commitment to working on his defensive skills that
has the Astros predicting a bright future for Meluskey. Another
factor working in the Astros' favor is that Meluskey's former Class
AAA manager, John Tamargo, will serve as the club's bullpen coach
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at guys around the league, you have to play
defense and have an idea what you're doing out there,'' said
Meluskey, a 12th-round draft pick by Cleveland in 1992 before being
traded to the Astros three years ago. ``I want to be a complete
player. From day one, once you get up there you want to win that
Gold Glove. They all want to win that Gold Glove.''
</P>
<P>
   During Meluskey's brief stay in the majors last season, manager
Larry Dierker said he noticed a willingness to learn in the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing helps more than experience,'' Dierker said.
``Sometimes, the lessons are rather difficult because you might
have to lose a game or give up some runs to learn a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where a veteran such as Eusebio comes into the picture.
Hunsicker and Dierker agreed one of the things that held back
Eusebio in the past was a lack of playing time. As for his health _
mainly his knees and criticism of his weight _ the Astros said
there are no concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tony will be better if he plays more because I think
that will help him with his weight,'' Dierker said. ``We're going
to need Tony because that's an awful lot of pressure to put on a
25-year-old guy to ask him to start on a team that has won two
(division) championships.''

ASU COMES UP BIT SHORT  
 NO. 7 UA AVOIDS UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Terry didn't draw the initial defensive assignment on
Eddie House. But just as certain that Arizona and Arizona State are
destined to wage a death match every year when they play in Tempe,
it was a given Terry would be guarding House at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when House, ASU's brilliant junior guard went up for the
last shot Thursday with the Sun Devils trailing by one, here was
Terry, Arizona's brilliant senior guard, right there to contest it.
Terry had help from A.J. Bramlett, 6 feet 10, and House
double-clutched. The shot clanked off the rim and the No. 7
Wildcats held on to beat the Sun Devils, 74-73, in front of a
rollicking 13,404 at Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett, the senior center, made 11 of 13 shots and had 24
points. Freshman forward Michael Wright was 8 of 11 for 18 points
as Arizona, which outrebounded ASU by 11, thoroughly dominated the
Sun Devils in the paint. House had 22 points but needed to take 23
shots, making nine. Senior forward Bobby Lazor added 21 for the Sun
Devils, only five after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Mike Batiste, the other component of the Sun Devils' Big
Three, was held to 10 points, nearly nine below his average, by a
combination of foul trouble and Wright's physical play.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, it was Bramlett who hit the winning shot, posting up
Lazor inside with 10 seconds left. That came after House made a
three-pointer with 42 seconds to go to give ASU a 73-72 lead.
</P>
<P>
   During the morning, ASU guard Alton Mason was told his father
had died. According to Evans, who revealed the news after the game
and after Mason had left, Mason's father died of cancer. Mason, a
sophomore who transferred from Barton County (Neb.) Community
College, played anyway and played well. He had 13 points, making 6
of 9 shots, with five assists and three steals.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (10-7) fell to 2-3 in the Pac-10, with each of the defeats
ending with the Sun Devils wondering what-if? ASU lost to Southern
California by two and to UCLA by three in overtime, both on the
road, before this.
</P>
<P>
   The closeness of the game wasn't anything new for these squads.
Arizona (12-1, 4-1) had won four of the past seven games in Tempe.
The average winning margin by both teams was 3.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Lute Olson was as charged by the intensity as the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone was here as a spectator who didn't care about the
outcome, he'd have to go away feeling really good about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But ASU Coach Rob Evans cared, and wasn't feeling particularly
good about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to learn how to close out ballgames,'' Evans said
after his first confrontation with the Cats and Olson. ``You've got
to box out, you've got to take care of the basketball at the right
time, and those are things these guys are learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard way.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils not only led for most of the game, they were in
control. Ahead, 40-35, at halftime behind Lazor's 16 points, ASU
extended its edge to 49-40 with 16:27 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wildcats, shooting 61.5 percent in the second half,
crept back. They finally went ahead, 61-60, with 9:21 to go.
</P>
<P>
   House, who came in averaging 19.7 points a game, right behind
Terry's conference-leading 21.3, had been fairly quiet until early
in the second half. Guarded alternately by freshmen Ruben Douglas
and Traves Wilson, he made 2 of 10 shots in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But then, inevitably, House began to blaze, sticking four
straight jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   House had defended Terry throughout and did a solid job. But
Olson had kept Terry off House to prevent fatigue and foul trouble
_ until he had no choice. Terry switched to guard House.
</P>
<P>
   Which was fine with House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two of the Pac-10's leading scorers going at it, and
not wanting the other one to outscore him,'' House said. ``When he
jumped on me, I kind of took it as a personal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   House would make only two baskets in the final 13:30, one of
them a three-pointer inside of a minute for ASU's last lead.
</P>
<P>
   An 83.6 percent free-throw shooter coming in and 37 of his past
41 from the line, House missed four of five free throws in the
final 6:55.
</P>
<P>
   But he still had a chance to win the game when ASU inbounded
with 10 seconds left after Bramlett's basket. Kenny Crandall threw
it in to Batiste, who gave it to House in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play was designed for me,'' House said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to double-clutch, and that's where I made the mistake.
It was a situation I wanted to have. I wanted the ball in my
hands.'' &QL;

ROLL  OF THE 'DYESS  
 SUNS MAY LOSE BET THEY COULD KEEP STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the start of training camp looming early next week, the
Suns and many of the NBA's other 28 teams can do nothing but wait
patiently while Phoenix free agent star Antonio McDyess makes up
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that McDyess will decide between the Suns and his old
club, the Denver Nuggets. The Nuggets might have the edge, even
though the Suns can pay more.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Rockets still are interested but apparently are
zeroing in on Chicago Bulls free agent Scottie Pippen. Orlando
apparently has tried to enter the McDyess sweepstakes, and Chicago
Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause is making a strong drive for
him.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, Pippen and Minnesota free agent Tom Gugliotta are the
most attractive players on the market, and until their decisions
are made, very little else can fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have not given McDyess any kind of deadline, said one
of McDyess' agents, James Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone wants to know what's going on as soon as
possible,'' Bryant said. ``But there haven't been any demands. We
don't know when Antonio is going to make a decision. We feel like
it's all starting to crystallize. I'd expect one pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA deal is expected to be finalized Monday or Tuesday,
which will bring a wave of free agent signings.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns would like an answer as quickly as possible, Bryant
said, to determine where they go next if McDyess leaves. And those
options may be drying up.
</P>
<P>
   League sources said Thursday that Gugliotta has come to terms
with the Timberwolves. Minnesota still could sign him and make a
trade, but either way, the Suns apparently are out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   So where do they go if Gugliotta is off the board and McDyess is
holding a news conference in Denver?
</P>
<P>
   Because of the new collective bargaining rules, few options
remain. League sources said that Chicago center Luc Longley is
ready to make a deal with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns probably would make an offer to their own free agent
forward, Clifford Robinson, who has had an offer from the Detroit
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Suns still could go after another, less expensive free
agent such as Miami's Brent Barry, whom the club wanted to draft in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sign-and-trade scenarios are possible, but most teams probably
would want the Suns' first-round draft pick obtained from Dallas
last summer in the trade that sent Steve Nash to the Mavericks. The
Suns might be better off holding on to that chip.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns gambled in October 1997 when they traded guard Wesley
Person, forward Tony Dumas and four draft picks _ two first- and
two second-round selections _ in a three-team deal with Cleveland
and Denver, to get the 6-foot-10, 220-pound McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   The risk was that the club might not be able to re-sign McDyess
when he became a free agent at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Why would McDyess consider the Nuggets, a team that won 11 games
last season?
</P>
<P>
   First, the Nuggets fired General Manager Allan Bristow, who
traded McDyess and said he wasn't worth a $100 million contract.
McDyess said last season that he would not consider playing in
Denver again if Bristow were there. He was replaced by Dan Issel,
whom McDyess likes.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Nuggets traded for Nick Van Exel. McDyess and Van
Exel have become friends, and there is speculation that he will
agree to go to Denver if the Nuggets give Van Exel a new deal next
summer when his contract is up. By the way, they have the same
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Third, McDyess is a small-town guy who still feels connected
with some of his friends in Denver and would feel comfortable with
Van Exel around. His two closest friends with the Suns were Nash,
who was traded, and John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, who won't be
re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's possible McDyess never wanted to leave the Nuggets
in the first place. He fired his last agent, Arn Tellem, and hired
Bryant and Tony Dutt, reportedly because Tellem forced a trade from
Denver by demanding a $100 million contract from the Nuggets.
Tellem apparently didn't tell McDyess what the Nuggets had on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said McDyess likes the Phoenix organization, Coach Danny
Ainge and his teammates with the Suns, who apparently have been
letting him know they want him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a different situation with these new rules,'' Bryant
said. ``It's almost like choosing a college now. The money is about
the same wherever he goes. You have to consider a lot more factors,
like the style of play, the makeup of the team, how you fit into
the plan, how competitive the team has a chance to be. There is a
lot to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess could not be reached for comment. A friend who is
screening calls made to McDyess' home and cellular numbers said
McDyess will not speak with reporters until he has made his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns renounce the rights to McDyess, they will be about
$10.7 million below the salary cap if they keep their five contract
players and do not renounce Robinson, Rex Chapman and Marko Milic.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson reportedly has been offered a contract by the Detroit
Pistons, but if McDyess leaves, the Suns likely would offer him
some of their available cap space to keep him in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McDyess would be a huge loss.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess was arguably the Suns' best player over the last month
of the 1997-98 season and during a first-round playoff loss to the
San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   During April, in which the Suns were 8-1, he averaged 19.3
points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.1 blocked shots and 1.89 steals, and shot
62.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, he averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds and
joined Alvan Adams and Garfield Heard as the only Suns to have at
least 100 blocked shots and 100 steals in a season. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson and the stock market have had a lot in
common this week. Their values took a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on speculation, or Tyson's infamous share of Evander
Holyfield's ears, or the declining price of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Tyson's purse for his comeback bout
Saturday night against Frans Botha at the MGM Grand is a state
budget or two less than had been widely reported by him and the
media.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, it was $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   The number slipped to between $20 million and $25 million two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Try again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tyson said this week he will get $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was talking about rubles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the contract filed with the Nevada State Athletic
Commission before Thursday's weigh-in, Tyson will get a check for
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   On any wage scale, that's pretty good work, if you can get it.
At three minutes a round, Tyson will collect $333,333 and change
per minute, if the 10-round bout goes the distance.
</P>
<P>
   It's not expected to. Then again, who knows? A lot of funny
numbers have been flying around ever since the Tyson-Botha bout was
announced six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Within just a couple of months, estimates of Tyson's purse have
bounced around like a junk bond. Twenty-five million dollars
managed to disappear faster than a loan to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons? The answers are as elusive as Tyson is volatile. But
one thing seems certain: Tyson's value, at least for this fight,
has been overstated.
</P>
<P>
   He is still due an undisclosed percentage of pay-per-view
television receipts. His promotional team, America Presents and the
Showtime network, is hoping for 1 million sales, which would
translate into nearly $50 million. At midweek, however, sales were
reported to be slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trending relatively low in comparison to other Tyson
fights,'' said Bruce Smith of media relations for Cox
Communications, the primary cable provider in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cautioned that there could be a sudden upturn. At the box
office and in pay-per-view television, boxing is notoriously hard
to predict. It always has attracted ``a walk-up crowd'' of late
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, midweek signs are that Tyson-Botha is a tough
sell. The MGM Grand Arena has a capacity for nearly 17,000 seats.
It has been scaled back to 14,000. A crowd of about 12,000 is
expected by MGM officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are lucky, it will hit 12,000,'' said MGM senior vice
president Don Welsh, who has been besieged by speculation that the
hotel/casino will paper the house by giving away tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Tyson a tough sell? Among the reasons being floated:
</P>
<P>
   The widely held perception that Tyson is simply being fed a soft
opponent _ a sure victory _ in Botha, a relatively obscure
heavyweight contender from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that promoters will not let Tyson, an
acknowledged moneymaker, lose his first bout in 19 months.
Tyson-Botha is just the first step to real riches.
</P>
<P>
   Fans might be practicing some caution or perhaps expressing a
backlash at Tyson's infamous biting of Holyfield's ears in June
1997. There's also the sense that only one Tyson fight matters: a
second rematch with Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the bout. Cable operators are charging $49.95.
There are complaints that it is worth only half that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail price is not set by us,'' said Jay Larkin, senior
vice president of Showtime. ``It's set by whoever the satellite
company is.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a prevailing suggestion that Tyson's dark side would be
a powerful attraction. A circus crowd always loves a freak show.
Tyson is the designated madman in this one. Will he do it all over
again? Will he bite Botha's ears?
</P>
<P>
   ``As to the value of the show, at the end of the day, it is
compelling entertainment,'' Larkin said. ``People want to see Mike
Tyson and want to see whether he'll blow someone out of the ring.
</P>

   ``Just when you think he's gone as far as he can go, something
else happens. It's an astounding saga, and I think the public is
fascinated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe _ just maybe _ the public is tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Tyson the madman has been evident almost every day
during the past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He's been caught spewing profanity in one interview or another.
It's begining to sound an awful lot like a rerun in a wired age,
when new sells _ and an old Tyson might not. &QL;

STANFORD ROUTS USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The coach was questioning the officiating _ again.
The best player was questioning his teammates' desire _ for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing USC wasn't questioning Thursday night was whether
they had lost to the best team in the Pacific-10 Conference, after
fourth-ranked Stanford breezed to a 72-55 victory before a
season-high 5,627 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't even as close as the final score indicated, and the
Cardinal's victory demonstrated just how far the Trojans still have
to go before pulling off an upset against a top 10 team. Three of
USC's four losses have come against top 10 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're the smartest, most well-organized team we've
faced,'' USC guard Adam Spanich said. ``They were very physical.
They took us out of everything we wanted to do and dominated us. It
shows us how we need to play.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't exactly the lesson learned by everyone. USC coach
Henry Bibby was unhappy after the game that the Trojans' top scorer
and rebounder, Brian Scalabrine, fouled out after just 16 minutes
of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way he can get fouled out in 16 minutes of play,''
Bibby said. ``He's our leading scorer and you think they would let
him play out there and it just doesn't happen. We can't have Brian
Scalabrine getting four fouls and those guys getting none and stay
in the ball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because Stanford is able to be physical and
we're not able to be physical. I can't lose people during the
course of the game and expect to win. They let (Cardinal forward
Mark Madsen) play physical the whole time. They let Stanford
play.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds familiar, Bibby gave an identical post-game speech
following the Trojans' last home game, an 87-78 loss to Arizona on
Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine was a little more diplomatic, saying, ``I'm not sure
why I got all of the fouls. I think three were (legitimate).''
</P>
<P>
   But Scalabrine didn't seem as upset about the fouls as a
perceived lack of effort by some of the Trojans. He took most of
his teammates to task afterward, something that hasn't happened
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one guy (guard Elias Ayuso) who played with heart and I
don't think everybody matched that intensity. One guy was pressing
when we were down by 20 points, and I think everybody else was more
interested in looking good out there,'' Scalabrine said. ``I think
our two seniors (Ayuso, Spanich) are going to talk about that
(today). It's all up to us when we get on the court to work hard. I
think it should be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have just looked like the Trojans (10-4, 2-3) waved the
white flag a little early, considering the way Stanford (14-2, 4-0)
dominated the second half. After building a 34-24 halftime
advantage, the Cardinal used a 12-1 run to break the game open and
led 53-31 with 13:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Scalabrine watched the key spurt from the bench
after picking up his fourth foul less than two minutes into the
second half. He fouled out with 11:06 left.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the Cardinal was able to roam free inside with
Madsen (17 points, 10 rebounds), forward Jarron Collins of
Harvard-Westlake (career-highs of 13 points, 12 rebounds) and
center Tim Young (nine points, six rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinal was equally impressive with its defense,
holding the Trojans to a season-low 30 percent from the field. The
Trojans' starting backcourt of Brandon Granville and Quincy Wilder
were a combined 1 for 12 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't score,'' Bibby said. ``We missed some easy layups.
Some open jump shots. We weren't as sharp as we needed to be to
beat the No.4 team in the country. They manhandled us. They're the
best team we played this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was also the Trojans' second in three home conference
games, a stat that will have to improve quickly if they want to
make the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 1-2 at home and everybody says not to lose home games in
the Pac-10,'' Scalabrine said. ``For us, I think it's a rude
awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Trojans fell to 3-16 against ranked teams since
December, 1996.... Stanford has won 18 straight games over
California schools.

   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ The representatives who addressed
the Senate Thursday were not just seeking to convict President
Clinton. They were trying to defend themselves and the whole House
impeachment process. News analysis. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-OBSTRUCT (Washington) _ The crime of obstruction of
justice with which Clinton is charged is one of those grab-bag
charges for prosecutors like conspiracy and fraud. In fact, the
House managers have thrown together a series of accusations to make
a case of obstruction that some have criticized as ``bundling'' _
constructing a case out of smaller actions none of which would be
criminal. By Neil Lewis.

<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-CUBA-REBELS (Guatemala City) _ When terrorist bombs
began to explode in 1997 amid the tight security of Fidel Castro's
Cuba, speculation about the bombers' identities was rampant:
coup-minded military officers, some Cuban exiles insisted, or
perhaps right-wing infiltrators from Miami. But the story of the
accused saboteurs suggests that their operations were less
cloak-and-dagger than cut-rate and lucky. By Tim Golden.

   DOVER-FERRIES (Aboard The Pride of Dover, in the English
Channel) _ The white cliffs of Dover looked particularly fine as
the ferry sped toward France, but the tourists, swarming through
the duty-free shops on board like locusts on parole, were not
interested in the view. They had only 75 minutes. They had to shop

   WISCONSIN-WELFARE (Undated) _ The first detailed study of
Wisconsin's welfare program, billed as the most successful in the
nation, shows that Wisconsin has had more success than other states
in finding jobs for former welfare recipients, but struggles with
housing, child care and other issues. By Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   NUDE-OLYMPICS (Princeton, N.J.) _ At least since the days of
disco, the keen-minded undergraduates of Princeton University have
considered it a right _ a solemn duty even _ for members of the
sophomore class to gather at midnight following the winter's first
substantial snowfall and run naked through Holder Courtyard, a wide
quadrangle surrounded by Gothic dormitory buildings. They call it
the ``nude olympics.'' Not surprisingly, the students who
participate in this quarter-century-old tradition are often
emboldened by alcohol. But the drinking and frigid frolicking can
be a bad mix. After this year's nude olympics on Friday night, five
students were hospitalized with alcohol poisoning and four more
were treated at the school's health center, prompting the
university's president, Harold Shapiro, to suggest that the
tradition should end. By David M. Herszenhorn.

   KING-PROFILE (New York) _ There was a time when Martin Luther
King III, the son of the man whose life we celebrate on Monday,
might have been called the reluctant namesake: hunkering down in
his seat at college when his father's name came up, calling himself
Marty as ``a way to hide'' because the comparisons were too
painful, the pressure too great. Last year, King, who is 41,
stepped in as the fourth president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, the civil rights organization his father
founded the year his son was born. Still, it would be wrong to
assume his identity crisis was over. By Joyce Wadler.

   OREGON-POLITICS (Portland, Ore.) _ It is hardly unusual to find
Sen. Ron Wyden conducting town hall-style meetings in Oregon, nor
is it unusual to find the state's other senator, Gordon Smith,
doing the same thing. But in these days of partisan rancor in
Washington, it is unusual to find the two men, who faced off in a
bitter election just three years ago, at the same meetings all
across the state. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

single-malt drinkers fall squarely into the second category. With
the sensitivity of a parfumeur and the tenacity of a celebrity

fermented barley. Price is no object. These days, the single-malt
fanatics are a happy bunch. By William Grimes.

MCGINNIS HAPPY WITH 1ST BEARS INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis described his
initial interview for the job of head coach of the Chicago Bears as
``a good dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis, 47, who has been with the Cardinals for three seasons,
was interviewed in the Valley on Wednesday night and Thursday
morning by Mark Hatley, Bears vice president for player personnel
and a longtime friend. They once coached together at Texas
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was very organized, very thorough,'' McGinnis said. ``It
was a good dialogue. He had questions and I had questions about the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to separate our friendship for business, and that was
not difficult or awkward to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis said he received no indication of where he stands in
the process or whether he might be invited for an interview with
Bears Chairman Ed McCaskey.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis was an assistant coach with the Bears for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hatley flew to Atlanta on Thursday to interview Dick Jauron,
defensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Others reportedly being considered are Kansas City Chiefs
defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham, former UCLA Coach Terry
Donahue, Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Jim Haslett,
Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis, Buffalo Bills
defensive coordinator Joe Pendrey and Chiefs offensive coordinator
Jimmy Raye.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears fired Dave Wannstedt on Dec. 28 after a 4-12
campaign. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Glued to the tube &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals enjoyed an unprecedented run on local television
this season, particularly the final three games that included a
dramatic, last-second field goal in the regular-season finale that
put them into the playoffs, their opening-round trouncing of the
Dallas Cowboys, and their second-round loss Sunday at Minnesota.
Those games produced the largest viewing audiences in the history
of Channels 5, 15 and 10, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 27 finale with San Diego, telecast by CBS, pulled a
28.8 rating and 58 share in the Phoenix market for Channel 5, which
translates into 386,784 households with 1,005,638 viewers,
according to NFL sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 2 playoff win at Dallas, on ABC, earned Channel 15 a
35.7 rating and 64 share (479,451 households, 1,246,572 viewers).
</P>
<P>
   The 41-21 loss to the Vikings on FOX brought Channel 10 a 42.5
rating and 70 share (570,775 households, 1,484,015 viewers).
</P>
<P>
   Ratings were strong throughout the regular season. Of the 12
Cardinals games telecast live in the Valley, nine were the
highest-rated programs that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings of the Cardinals' late-season and playoff games
are unprecedented in the Phoenix television market,'' said Dennis
Lewin, NFL senior vice president for broadcasting. ``These ratings
exhibit what we've seen in many markets across the country, where
the NFL delivers some of the strongest ratings in television.'' &QL;

ALI STEALS THE SHOW AT WEIGH-IN RITUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _  &UR; Mike Tyson and  &UR; Frans Botha stepped on a scale
Thursday as
 &UR; Muhammad Ali stepped on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Ali won the weigh-in by acclaim as a crowd at the MGM Grand
Theater broke into the familiar chant of his last name.
</P>
<P>
   Ali's appearance was the biggest surprise at an otherwise
uneventful &QL; 
weigh-in. He held a lithograph of Tyson. Ali, one of history's
greatest heavyweight champions, also exchanged a few words with
Tyson as he left the theater with his loudest cheerleader,
Crocodile, shouting, ``Guerrilla warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali spoke in behalf of Tyson at a hearing of the Nevada State
Athletic Commission several months ago, when he applied for
reinstatement of his license, which had been revoked after he
bit &UR; Evander Holyfield's ears. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The weights &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was at a career-high 223 pounds, perhaps a little more
than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The guess was that he would be about 215, a lighter weight at
which he might be more able to employ the movement emphasized
during his Valley training camp.
</P>
<P>
   His previous career high was 222 pounds on Nov. 9, 1996, when he
lost to Holyfield the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Botha was 233 pounds, his lightest since June 21, 1997, when he
was 229 pounds for a victory over somebody named  &UR; Lee Gilbert.
Botha was 236 and 238 for two bouts last year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly . . . &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tyson trainer &UR; Tommy Brooks said there is no truth to rumors that
the former heavyweight champ is suffering from an injury to his
left hand. Brooks confirmed that Tyson felt some pain in the hand a
couple of weeks ago while sparring at Phoenix's Madison Square
Garden. But a physician said Tyson's hand is fine, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, on Botha's chances: ``Slim and none.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Panama Lewis, Botha's trainer, was once a candidate to work
with Tyson, who brought him into his camp before a victory over
Razor Ruddock in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee, if I had Tyson, he would be a much better fighter
today than he is,'' said Lewis, who is banned from working the
corner because of a 1983 conviction for altering a fighter's
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitionists? Tyson and Botha stripped down to bikini briefs
for the weigh-in. How come? Unlike the lighter division,
heavyweights don't have to make a weight limit.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is wearing the slogan ``Be Real'' on caps, T-shirts and
even the waistband of his briefs. He's hawking his own line of
clothing that includes everything but earmuffs. &QL;

YEP, HE'S GOT GAME  
 AUSTIN AINGE SHARES DAD'S COMPETITIVE SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Nothing like a little family bonding on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Ainge hands the ball to his father and calls him old.
Danny Ainge, who used to play against a guy named Michael Jordan,
backs up his son, scores and calls Austin weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go back at it, but it's pretty fun,'' Austin said. ``He
plays his game. He doesn't hold back at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny, coach of the Suns, has always hated to lose. He has
handed down his competitive spirit to his oldest son, a point guard
for Gilbert Highland High School, who refuses to give anybody an
inch on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He'll take charges. He'll dive for loose balls. He'll plead his
case to referees. And, oh, yeah, like dad, he loves to shoot from
way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin plays hard,'' Highland Coach Dave Yates said. ``He's
aggressive. And he wants the ball. I know that about Austin. I'm
sure that's the way his dad was.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the 6-foot-1 junior, who is averaging 15.6 points and
4.8 assists, had a career-high 35 points against Mesa Dobson,
pouring in shots from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a gritty 37-33 victory over third-ranked Gilbert,
Austin was held to seven points but had a couple of steals and late
in the game he pulled down a key offensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Dad usually is there for support and constructive criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he still has a lot of room to improve,'' Danny said.
``He still turns the ball over too much and misses too many shots,
as we all do as juniors in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Late bloomers run in the family, Danny said. Austin, who didn't
start on his eighth grade team, is ahead of the game, his father
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does things that I only dreamed of doing when I was his
age,'' Danny said. ``He's by far a better ballhandler. He's much
smarter than I was at his age. I was a little more athletic and
taller. We're probably the same shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, and the facial expressions and the dark blond
hair, there is no resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   Austin and his brother Tanner, who plays on Highland's freshman
team, benefited from the NBA lockout, having their father home to
not only watch them play but to critique, coach and play against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Danny helped mostly with Highland's freshman team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was depressing with things going on with the NBA lockout,''
Danny said. ``But one of the bright spots was watching my two
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin said that his dad has lost his quickness and endurance,
but still ``can shoot the lights out,'' which marked his dad's
career at Brigham Young and in the NBA with the Boston Celtics,
Portland Trail Blazers and Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me a lot over the summer,'' Austin said. ``I shot a
lot, a lot of shots. I shot the ball as much as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin has toyed with baseball, but in the past two years
basketball has been his passion. He said not playing much in the
eighth grade drove him to work that much harder on his game.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, Austin will watch game film of his dad in
college and in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   He said he appreciates seeing how competitive his dad was and
said there have been many positives to being the son of an NBA
player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   There are also minuses, Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was not seeing his father much during basketball
season.
</P>
<P>
   The other, he said, is going to school and ``some people giving
you flak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat you differently, but they get over it after a
while,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin said he has not felt any jealousy from teammates at
Highland, where he started as a sophomore and was elected one of
the captains this year for a team that is ranked sixth in Class 5A
and is 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really think of him that much as the son of Danny
Ainge,'' guard Scott Fleming said. ``He's a teammate, a good
basketball player, a leader.'' &QL;

BRAMLETT MAKES UP FOR TERRY'S MISSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Arizona started making its usual come-from-behind charge on
Arizona State, it began with finding center A.J. Bramlett on the
post for two straight buckets that made him 9 of 11 for the night.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 14 minutes Thursday night, the Wildcats seemed to
forget where their sure shot was. It was supposed to be Pac-10
free-throw accuracy leader Jason Terry, but he capped an offensive
night to be forgotten by missing two with Arizona trailing, 73-72,
and 27.5 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   But with the same deficit, Terry sped the ball upcourt to
force-feed Bramlett for a game-winning banker from the post with
10.7 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got his back, and he's got mine,'' said Bramlett, who
missed two free throws in Arizona's overtime win at Brigham Young
that would have won the game in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   This time, No. 7 Arizona (12-1, 4-1 Pac-10) ran the last-second
play by design rather than winning ugly as it did Saturday, when
Richard Jefferson's air ball rebound follow beat Washington at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet for the Wildcats, they overcame more than the usual
first-half woes of late. They shook off Terry's 4-for-15,
five-turnover game with interior dominance and cool freshman play
under hot rivalry pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett and freshman forward Michael Wright outmuscled ASU in
the paint to team up for 19-of-24 shooting and 23 rebounds,
including eight offensive. Bramlett rediscovered the touch he had
been missing in Pac-10 play and charged Arizona to score all but
three of its 30 field goals in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just more focused,'' Bramlett said. ``My average is
going to go up because I've been missing shots I should make. I
wanted to play up to my potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The big men and freshman Ruben Douglas' best offensive game
(nine points, seven assists) offset Terry's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Lute Olson went with Douglas and freshman Traves
Wilson on ASU's Eddie House to keep Terry fresh and out of foul
trouble for another 40-minute night. Olson milked the combo until
House scored eight straight ASU points, including six on three
straight trips, to put ASU ahead, 55-48, with 13:32 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Terry switched to House and held him scoreless for eight minutes
and then forced House's awkward game-winning attempt at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't in my rhythm all game, but defense is my specialty,''
Terry said. ``I told Coach to put me on him the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 87 percent free-throw shooter was aghast at himself
for two clankers that would have given UA the lead with 27.5
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had lost the game,'' said Terry, who scored nine
after 27- and 30-point nights last week. ``Those were the biggest
free throws I've had yet, and I didn't come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's story lines have yet to include strong roles by all
its players, but they continue to like the endings.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett said he gets excited thinking about how dangerous the
Wildcats will be when they put a whole game together. Terry wonders
when their three-freshman starting lineup will come out with a
killer instinct rather than a rally cap. &QL;

`MISSING PIECE' ARRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Defensemen J.J. Daigneault will make his debut
tonight for the Phoenix Coyotes, his ninth National Hockey League
team in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   This brings an immediate question to mind: What, can't this guy
keep a job?
</P>
<P>
   The right answer could be: No, he's been too sought-after as the
missing piece.
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault, 33, a veteran of 14 NHL seasons with 810 games, 52
goals and 184 assists in his career, could be the missing
ingredient _ the solid sixth defenseman _ the Coyotes have been
looking for to solidify their defensive corps for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   He's a defenseman who wears a Stanley Cup ring, an excellent
skater who can jump into the rush, a good passer and a player who
knows and understands the game and his responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, due to need, there's no question he is the
answer. The Coyotes' blue-line corps is thin, with defenseman
Gerald Diduck on the injured list for a month with a damaged knee.
The injury has led to extended ice time for Teppo Numminen, Jyrki
Lumme, Oleg Tverdovsky and Keith Carney because of the
inconsistency behind them.
</P>
<P>
   So Daigneault isn't a bit surprised that Coyotes General Manager
Bobby Smith traded future considerations to the expansion Nashville
Predators, tonight's opponent, to obtain him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I've gotten used to it,'' said Daigneault, a former
teammate of Smith's and Lumme's. ``I'm very happy to be joining a
contender, but it's been the same situation the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, Pittsburgh picked me up from St. Louis before
the playoffs and we went to the semifinals and everything went
well,'' he said. ``Two years ago, Anaheim got me from Pittsburgh
during the stretch drive, and we played Phoenix and Detroit in the
playoffs. And last year, the (Islanders) thought they had a chance
to make the playoffs and got me from Anaheim.''
</P>
<P>
   His major sin with the Predators was being a veteran who stood
in the way of a youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got exactly what we expected from J.J.,'' Predators GM
David Poile told the`` Nashville Tennessean'' about Daigneault, who
was Nashville's assistant captain. ``He was a good guy to have on
the team and he had a calming effect on our younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in my thinking, two or three years down the road, and
specifically with our defensemen, I didn't think he'd be a part of
it. It was inevitable, whether it happened today, before the
trading deadline or next year. It's time to give opportunity to the
six healthy defensemen we have, especially our younger ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault, who won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens in 1993,
said he had figured the Predators would soon opt for a youth
movement from the first day of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault was a genuine pain in the neck for the Coyotes two
years ago with Anaheim. It was a series that created an animosity
that hasn't subsided between the franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it well, because I had a lot of responsibility,''
he said. ``When I was at Anaheim I was playing a lot of hockey
because we were playing four or five defensemen a lot. That's a lot
of responsibility on a player, and I was able to meet the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   '`The playoffs were a great part of the season. I hope it
continues, but the Coyotes have gotten better each year since that
series.''
</P>
<P>
   When Diduck is healthy, Daigneault likes what he sees in the
Coyotes blue-line corps.

ASU'S NEW LINEUP GETS EARLY TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Packard Stadium still rubbing its eyes from a brief
off-season slumber, the Arizona State baseball team will open its
1999 season tonight against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the earliest debut ever by a Pac-10 team, forcing the
Sun Devils to address some key questions on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest hit, more than anything, is that we lost a lot of
heart, a lot of experience,'' Coach Pat Murphy said. ``I'm really
happy with the players we have, but we're still trying to figure
some things out.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 team that advanced to the College World Series had a
never-say-die mentality. Ninth-inning comebacks and dramatic
defensive plays defined the group. Murphy's biggest unknowns for
this season are pitching and personality.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils lost their top three starters: Ryan Mills, Phill
Lowery and Richy Leon. Only three pitchers from that staff return,
and they combined for just seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wide open right now,'' first-year pitching coach John
Pawlowski said. ``It's going to take some time to define roles.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chad Penning &QL; 
ton's performance &QL; 
as a freshman last season is an indication, ASU could have an ace
in the making. The right-hander, who will start tonight, finished
7-2 with a 4.20 ERA. But he has been nursing an elbow injury and
may not be 100 per &QL; 
cent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are eager to see how senior &QL; 
Chuck &QL; 
Crumpton &QL; 
handles a starting &QL; 
role after doing most of his work as a reliever last season. He had
a 3.00 ERA and led the team with five saves. Several newcomers also
will get a look, including left-hander Will Waldrip of Flagstaff,
who transferred from Brigham Young, and lefty Ian Perio, a transfer
from Hawaii's Laney College.
</P>
<P>
   Returnees include the top three RBI producers: third baseman
Andrew Beinbrink, shortstop Willie Bloomquist and catcher Casey
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Beinbrink's decision to delay the start of his professional
career for a season, and Bloomquist's generosity in giving his
scholarship to Beinbrink, could prove to be the difference in the
program's success.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the infield is less experienced, with Chip
Gosewich or Mark Ernester manning second and Jeff Phelps or Mitch
Jones handling first.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a freshman All-America pick last season, will handle most
of the responsibility behind the plate and should be a key
contributor with his bat. He finished the season with a .386
average, 58 RBIs and a .609 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The outfield is less experienced. Projected starters Jay Sitzman
(left field), Dustin Delucchi (center) and Jeff Duncan (right) have
a combined 28 starts out of 64 games last season. Duncan, a
sophomore, is a transfer from Iowa State. &QL;

TENNESSEE'S FULMER GETS ROBINSON AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer accepted the Eddie Robinson
Coach of the Year award Thursday night at the Arizona Biltmore, he
couldn't help but think back to one of his toughest years in
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1994, and the Volunteers had lost three of their first
four football games. Fulmer, in his second full season as head
coach, walked into the office of Athletic Director Doug Dickey and
lamented, ``Coach, if I don't win any more games, will you still
love me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phillip, we're still going to love you,'' came the reply from
Dickey, ``but we're sure going to miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, you would be hard-pressed to find anyone in
Tennessee who doesn't love Fulmer. This season, he guided the
Volunteers to a perfect record (13-0), a Fiesta Bowl victory and
the school's first national championship since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Tennessee is running around with its chest stuck
out pretty good right now,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer was chosen for the Coach of the Year honor in a vote by
the Football Writers Association of America. The award also is
sponsored by the Fiesta Bowl and America West Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the former Grambling coach who won more football games
than any other collegiate coach, said Fulmer exemplifies the values
he always tried to teach his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You respect the man who stands for those things football
advocates: You learn to win without bragging and lose without
excuses,`` Robinson said. Under Fulmer, No. 1-ranked Tennessee won
its second straight Southeastern Conference Championship and
defeated No. 2 Florida State, 23-16, in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In seven seasons as Tennessee's head coach, Fulmer's teams have
won nearly 86 percent of their games, the highest percentage among
active coaches. His Volunteers have lost only five games in the
past four seasons. The national championship this season was the
pinnacle of a relatively young head-coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very humbled and honored,'' Fulmer said. ``I hope
sometime in every person's career, they can feel the elation, the
total perfection of the moment when that last second ticked off the
clock.''
</P>
<P>
   The only things that compared to that moment, said Fulmer, ever
the politician, were his wedding and the births of his three
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   That drew a little heckling from one of the tables up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' said his wife, Vicky, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, whose teams won 408 games in his 55 seasons as
Grambling, was also humbled by the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great honor,'' he said of the award being presented in
his name. ``This event comes at a time in my life where I never
though it would happen. All I ever wanted to do was coach. In the
second or third grade, I knew I wanted to be a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson sees his job as much more than just coaching football.
He is an educator who is concerned that his players are prepared
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to help them have the good sense in making
decisions,'' he said. &QL;

NOT HERE YET, BUT DEVILS' DAY IS SURELY ON ITS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is more rerun than rivalry, the outcome a broken compass, the
confrontation nothing but a running gag from ``Groundhog Day''.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook is changing, apparent in the relief beaming from
Lute Olson, evident from the smoke billowing out of Rob Evans'
ears.
</P>
<P>
   And the day is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about the past,'' Evans huffed. ``But I
can tell you this series will be a competitive series. I don't know
any other way to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven straight times, Arizona has prevailed in this mad clash of
civic egos, and the formula is always the same. Blowout in Tucson,
nail-biter in Tempe. In the end, victory for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Ahlon Lewis missing at the buzzer. This time,
it was Eddie House, panicking a bit, misfiring badly, ending a
night that belonged to the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Same script as always, with one key difference: This was not an
underdog playing for a one-time upset. This was a spirited team
fighting to reverse a long-standing mind-set, a team that lit up a
stagnant building on Thursday, stirring up a preview of passion
that's sure to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great basketball situation,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is still a big difference between programs. The
Wildcats are ranked seventh in the nation, a month away from
peaking. They are again loaded, and just last month, prized
recruits Richard Jefferson and Ruben Douglas were suspended for
conduct unbecoming to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty of running down a hallway at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas,
banging on hotel doors late at night, caught by surveillance
cameras. The perfect metaphor for the youthful Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   They are also powerful inside, and on ultimately, this was the
difference. The veteran, A.J. Bramlett, scoring at will. A freshman
from Chicago, Michael Wright, built in the mold of Anthony Mason. A
team that simply towered over the scrappy Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   But really, it was ASU's game. Until House missed 4 of 5 free
throws down the stretch. Until Alton Mason, whose father died
Thursday morning, a sophomore who was simply sensational on both
ends of the floor, missed the front end of a one-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   Until the buzzer sounded, and one fan shouted at the top of his
lungs, ``I'm so sick of this!''
</P>
<P>
   What was once consolation is now a shade of nausea. What was
once morale victory is now a waste of 40 minutes. The first real
steps toward change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it just wasn't meant to be,'' House said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime today, Evans leaves on a recruiting trip to Los
Angeles, and a victory over Olson would've been powerful
ammunition. It would've also bolstered hopes for an NCAA berth,
still a remote possibility _ if they can win nine of their final 13
games.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Sun Devils haven't beaten a top 10 team here since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But change is coming, and everyone knows it. Bill Frieder was
happy to be Olson's comic relief, the guy who willing played the
goofball in television commercials. Don Newman was completely
overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is up for the challenge, and to his credit, is careful not
to place too much emphasis on this rivalry. After all, the goal
isn't beating the Wildcats. It's winning a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Far fetched? Not if you believe. Not if you can turn around
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Olson is 64, and still has the touch, the ability to target his
needs and fill them with the perfect recruits. But he won't be at
this forever, and time is not his ally. Once Evans stacks a few
recruiting classes together, once he gets his type of players, the
pendulum will start to swing.
</P>

   On Thursday, it appeared that the Sun Devils had already started
to teethe, to grow fangs, to close the gap. Except you haven't seen
anything yet.

   ``It's difficult to meet my standards defensively, to be very
honest with you,'' Evans said. ``It's typical right now because
we're changing habits and we don't have a deep bench. As time goes
on and we get more soldiers, they'll meet my standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they will. And the day is coming. &QL;

DON'T LET LITTLE GUYS DISAPPEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The workplace for a lot of people isn't a corporate tower or
branch office or career ladder to climb. For many, the workplace is
a smaller, more familial place. Sometimes it is family.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these small, independent businesses are like the Shop
Around the Corner, the children's bookstore owned and operated by
Meg Ryan's character in the movie ``You've Got Mail.'' The shop is
nurtured and loved by her three employees and loyal customers _
until a Fox books megastore opens around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   I apologize for outlining the plot if you haven't seen the
movie. Suffice it to say that you might want to pledge to patronize
a small business, any small business, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial spirit is a wondrous thing. It sends people
pioneering across continents, bares them to great financial and
emotional risk, and often provides the research and development
seeds from which progress grows. It also provides jobs, more than
all the Fortune 500 types combined.
</P>
<P>
   Mergermania among the big guys, blocklong discount stores and
far-flung chain operations have their place. I like them a lot, for
some reasons _ mostly financial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I can't wriggle out of a guilty hair shirt. Too often, I
don't drive a bit farther or spend a bit more to patronize the
little guy, the one who provided an item or a service for years
before the megamerchants' demographic studies pinpointed the
neighborhood as a hospitable place.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't let the winsomeness of stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks
and the happy-ever-after ending erase the real-life outcomes of
comparable tales. Going-out-of-business sales and quiet
disappearances from the economic landscape happen every day when
small independents can't compete.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day I saw ``You've Got Mail'' I saw a store-closing
notice for the cozy Zoom toy store at 119th and Roe. ``You're
wondering if it's because of the Zany Brainy?'' responded Zoom
owner John Middelkamp, referring to the bigger chain store that
opened this fall nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Zoom's lease was up, and Middelkamp didn't dare commit
to the three-year renewal, even though Zoom's 1998 sales were the
best ever _ until November and December, that is. When Zany Brainy
opened, ``we did feel an effect.'' It was, Middelkamp said, too
soon to know whether Zoom could compete in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Fear that it couldn't prevailed, though. A clearance sale is
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-nosed business types will say that's the way it goes. The
fittest survive. The ones who don't adapt, who don't fill a needed
niche, will fail. Maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   So I itch under the hair shirt worn for not patronizing
independents. It is, perhaps, penance for the future. Every time a
small business fails, I sense a backward stumble to the days of
Henry Ford, who didn't care what color car his customers wanted, as
long as it was black.
</P>
<P>
   With every merger, every chain store opening that supplants an
independent, some element of choice is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Most failed independents don't end up in the arms of the
megastore millionaire. And no matter how likable the Goliath, the
loss of another David rips a tiny hole in a rich economic tapestry.
</P>

NO SURPRISE FROM HEIRS OF STALIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The astounding nerve of it! The obscene maliciousness
of it! But, oh, how perfectly true to form.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov blames the Jews for
plunging Russia into economic ruin, impoverishing the country and
threatening the extinction of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   As conditions have worsened in the bankrupt Russian republic,
the justice ministry in Moscow has attempted to put a halt to
increasingly poisonous anti-Semitic incitements by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The party's response is this catalog of hateful accusations by
Zyuganov, runner-up in the country's last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed _ but not the heirs to Stalin, Brezhnev and
the rest of that sorry gang. From the first days of the Soviet era
to the final collapse of an empire built on conquest and sustained
by terror, the Russian Communists have made a career of blaming
others for their failures.
</P>
<P>
   Exhumation of the long-hidden past shows plainly what sort of
thugs they were.
</P>
<P>
   They squandered resources on hare-brained industrial schemes.
They constructed an economic order that punished enterprise and
rewarded fecklessness. They stole from the treasury to support
their own excesses. Every aspect of life they touched _
agriculture, law, medicine, even the military _ became a cartoon of
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   They persecuted the faithful, but could not extinguish faith.
They demonized the West, but depended for modernity on ideas and
technology they could steal. Along the way, they murdered millions
_ no, tens of millions _ of their own people.
</P>
<P>
   And when vassal nations and their own abused citizenry finally
rose up to defy them and bring them down, they disclaimed any fault
in this record of shame.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov's screed would almost be comical, were it not for the
evil resonances his charges evoke.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are a people who have little experience with
freedom, much experience with brutal tyranny. Theirs is a rich
culture. But their history, for all its past grandeur, is
disfigured by the shame of pogroms.
</P>
<P>
   When things have gone wrong, Russia's leaders have directed
blame at the others, the outsiders, whether foreigners or
minorities in their midst. There, as elsewhere, Jews have been a
target.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the Russian Jews who came to America, bringing
the gift of their talents to the building of this country, came as
refugees, fleeing persecution and thievery by the ethnic majority
in a land that they, the Jews, had for generations considered their
home.
</P>
<P>
   The horror of those periodic eruptions, in which Russians cast
about for someone to savage as punishment for their own woes,
scarcely can be exaggerated. And it is to that most despicable
tendency that Zyuganov and his Communist cohorts appeal with their
nastiness.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the Russian republic are lamentable: the ruble
worthless, the government paralyzed, workers unpaid, food and fuel
in short supply, industries idled, foreign debt unserviceable,
crime epidemic and criminal gangs prospering.
</P>
<P>
   All ordinary Russians are suffering in some measure. But for
Jews and other vulnerable minorities, such times are especially
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the coming of relative political freedom that's to
blame for the catastrophe. It was the disfigured society and
already-broken economy left behind by the party that ruled Russia
for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The new Communists, under Zyuganov, descend directly from the
authors of those failures. And like their predecessors, it appears,
they lack any capacity for shame.

UCLA DEFEATS CAL; STANFORD NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA started running a crucial four-game gauntlet
in a successful but appropriate fashion _ repelling Cal 72-61 in a
physical, foul-plagued game Thursday night at Pauley Pavilion and
clearing the way for Saturday's showdown against mighty Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   After a pregame pep talk by former Dodgers manager Tommy
Lasorda, the go-go Bruins (12-3, 4-1) abandoned their preferred
style _ fast and finesse _ and beat Cal and its own, grinding
half-court game.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA guards Baron Davis and Earl Watson combined for 36 points
and outplayed their Cal counterparts, Geno Carlisle and Thomas
Kilgore, who spent much of the night misfiring and mishandling the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also made the decisive baskets, scoring on back-to-back
drives to extend the Bruins' lead from six to 10 points with under
four minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was a critical game for both teams, especially given two
developments earlier in the evening: Stanford's impressive victory
at USC and Arizona's last-second win at Arizona State. Although the
conference season is less than one-third complete, the Cardinal and
Wildcats are slowly separating themselves from the pack. To keep
pace, the Bruins must protect their homecourt _ especially against
the toughest travel partners in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bears) are really good,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``Their 1-2 conference record (before Thursday) is misleading. You
look at it and think, `Boy, they're really struggling.' But if you
look closer, they beat North Carolina and they had a close game at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always struggled against Cal. In Pauley, they've
dominated us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears had won four of the previous six meetings in Pauley,
often with talent equaling or surpassing UCLA's. Jason Kidd, Jelani
Gardner, Tremaine Fowlkes and Shareef Abdur-Rahim beat the Bruins
at their own high-octane game. But these Bears prefer a slower
tempo, a grinding, physical half-court style that has irritated
UCLA for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tempo is real important to them,'' Lavin said. ``They'll run
when the opportunity presents itself, but they really execute well
in the half-court. If there's not something in transition, they
execute their sets and get the shots they want.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, the Bears usually execute their sets. In the first
half Thursday, they struggled with the rudiments of half-court
offense. They could not dribble, they could not pass, and they
definitely could not shoot (38 percent). After jumping to a 6-0
lead, Cal lapsed into a turnover-plagued, 17-minute rut, and the
Bruins took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Cal trailed 18-15 after Dennis Gates' 3-pointer from the left
corner, but the Bruins closed the half with a 13-4 surge. Watson,
playing with patience and poise, hit Davis for a layup and buried a
3-pointer from the left corner to give the Bruins a 28-17 lead with
four minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Cal's major adjustment in the second half _ aside from better
ballhandling _ was to get Carlisle, its leading scorer, involved in
the offense. Carlisle took just three shots in the first half, but
he was a vortex in the second. UCLA couldn't guard him and resorted
to fouling rather than allow open jumpers. He scored six
consecutive points early in the half as Cal closed to 40-34.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Reed and Davis preserved UCLA's double-digit lead with
interior baskets, but the momentum clearly had shifted to Cal. With
nine minutes left, the Bruins entered a sloppy stretch, mishandling
the ball, taking bad shots and scoring once in seven possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears had an easier time, deftly working the ball inside and
out and forcing the Bruins to play defense longer than they
preferred. Sean Lampley's basket with 6:15 left cut UCLA's lead to
56-51.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Sophomore guard Rico Hines had surgery Thursday to repair
a broken bone in his right foot. During the 15-minute operation at
UCLA Medical Center, Dr. Matt Shapiro inserted a pin to stabilize
the fractured fifth metatarsal bone. Hines is expected to miss four
to six weeks.

KINGS GRIND OUT 3-0 WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Theo Fleury said it hours before the game.
Thursday night, the Kings and Fleury's Calgary Flames went out and
lived it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed our system,'' Fleury said, ``to a really boring
style.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this snoozer, the Kings stayed awake just long enough to
record a 3-0 victory before an announced crowd of 10,334 at the
Forum. Luc Robitaille scored two goals, Jozef Stumpel scored one
and Jamie Storr made 21 saves, few of them difficult, to record his
third shutout this season and fifth of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the goals, the loudest crowd noise of the night was
generated by the game's four fights, two involving Sean O'Donnell
and two involving Matt Johnson. O'Donnell departed briefly in the
third period after receiving a four-stitch cut on his right cheek
during a scrap with Todd Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved the Kings (16-22-4) to 8-2-1 in their last
11 games and moved them into a tie with the idle San Jose Sharks
for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames (14-26-3) fell to 2-10 in their last 12 games, and it
was easy to see why they are struggling to score. Even when
trailing, the Flames played passively on offense, preferring to
protect goalie Fred Braithwaite and wait for one or two scoring
chances that would result in a tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   This is their style, not necessarily a productive one. The
Flames have scored only eight goals in their last eight games, and
entered play Thursday on an 0 for 32 drought on the power play.
Fourteen of their 26 losses have come by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Kings, the Flames managed no shots in the first 13
minutes, only four in the first period and only six in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have been pretty inoffensive themselves in recent
games. They entered the game hoping to snap out of a recent funk
that began with two sloppy victories and a lackluster tie and
culminated in a dismal 4-0 loss Monday night at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings regained the services of defenseman Doug Bodger, who
had missed six games with a cervical strain and bruised shoulder,
but lost winger Craig Johnson to a first-period rib injury. Johnson
underwent precautionary X-rays, results of which were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings began the night with only one goal in their previous
two games, and that had come from Rob Blake with a two-man
advantage in Saturday's 1-1 tie with Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it took a two-man advantage for the Kings to get on
the scoreboard Thursday. Robitaille scored the 501st goal of his
career 3:24 into the game, shooting into a wide-open net off a
cross-ice feed from Donald Audette.
</P>
<P>
   But until late in the game, the Kings were unable to accomplish
much else against the cautious Flames.
</P>
<P>
   As for Storr, he had little to do in the first two periods, but
four minutes into the third, he was tested by Fleury from close
range.
</P>
<P>
   And as the third period progressed and it dawned on the Flames
that they needed to score at least one goal, Calgary finally began
to press offensively, though rarely dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't translate into a lot of shots, and one of the most
ominous moments for the Kings came with less than eight minutes to
play, when Calgary entered the Kings' zone on a 3-on-1 rush. But
Blake hurried back to break up the play, and the Flames didn't even
manage a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:33 left, Robitaille finally put the game away with his
24th goal this season, scoring on a 2 on 1 off another pass from
Audette. Robitaille is second in NHL goal scoring, trailing only
Philadelphia's John LeClair, who has 26.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel completed the scoring with 4:07 to play, with a
one-timer from the left faceoff circle off a pass from Vladimir
Tsyplakov.

HUSKIES BEAT BEAVERS FOR FIRST PAC-10 WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Somewhere in this oddball season, the Washington
Huskies had lost it: Lost the defensive edge, lost the knack of the
well-timed screen in their motion offense, lost the mentality that
stood them so well last March in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   They retrieved all that Thursday night, to the relief of 6,858
fans at Edmundson Pavilion, where the Huskies beat on Oregon State
70-50 for their first victory of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in all of our minds,'' said Michael Johnson, the
sophomore guard, referring to an 0-3 start in the Pac-10, ``even
though we didn't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out they didn't talk about much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more talking,'' said forward Thalo Green. ``We made a
decision we needed to start playing as a team and that's what we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen quite as easily as the score might suggest. The
Beavers (8-6, 2-2) swept the L.A. schools last weekend and, despite
being picked for ninth or 10th in the league, will battle.
</P>
<P>
   And they did, throwing up a first-half zone defense that
bothered the Huskies. OSU trailed only 23-20 after an early 17-8
Washington lead, and it looked like the Huskies (8-6, 1-3) might be
headed for one of the frenetic finishes visiting Pac-10 games this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington, ahead 32-25, broke quickly after the half,
doubling the lead as sophomore Greg Clark dropped in two quick
3-pointers. Without much offensive firepower save for point guard
Deaundra Tanner, the Beavers never were closer than nine the rest
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something we've emphasized in the last 24 hours,'' said UW
coach Bob Bender, ``is how important everybody on the team is and
what they do with those minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Team doesn't sell a lot of papers, but if it wins games, the
Huskies will embrace it. Indeed, they got several solid
contributions:
</P>
<P>
   --Todd MacCulloch, who had struggled in two of the three Pac-10
games, had a big second half after being shackled inside OSU's
first-half zone, and finished with his seventh double-double of the
season _ 20 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd's consistently rebounded the ball really well,'' said
Bender. ``He didn't force anything offensively and he moved his
feet well on defense and didn't let anybody draw him into a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   --Johnson, the Ballard product, had a productive 20 minutes with
12 points and some stout defense against OSU's sophomore from
Sumner, Josh Steinthal, who had a 3-for-10, eight-point night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play too much defense at Ballard,'' said Johnson.
``But yeah, I love playing defense.''
</P>
<P>
   --Donald Watts, whose orchestrating skills are going to be
needed with the loss of point guard Dan Dickau to a broken foot,
had eight assists on a night when his shot wasn't falling. He was 2
of 9 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought `Q' (replacement point guard Senque Carey) might
have a tough time,'' Bender said, referring to Carey's matchup
against the resourceful Tanner. ``Eight assists means we were
getting production in other places. He was making people better.''
</P>
<P>
   Deon Luton, who has been up and down this year, nailed his first
two treys of the night, and the second gave Washington a lead it
never lost, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies defended well most of the game and held OSU to .404
shooting while hitting 51 percent themselves. Once they drew to an
appreciable lead, the Huskies protected it as the guard-oriented
Beavers had too little offense inside to make it close.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner's trey with 13:37 left made it 42-33, Washington, and was
OSU's last real gasp. MacCulloch scored inside and Tanner _ who had
played every minute to that point _ tossed up an errant scoop shot.
The Huskies fed Johnson in the right corner and he buried it, and
the Beavers too.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of a six-games-in-eight stretch at home for
Washington, which was playing only its fourth game at Hec Ed since
the season began Nov. 16. The Huskies now host Oregon, winner at
Pullman in triple overtime Thursday night, Saturday at 3 p.m.

PRESIDENT'S MOTIVES CENTRAL TO TRIAL OUTCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
WASHINGTON _ The underlying facts were hardly in dispute as opening
arguments began in what one senator described as the most important
trial ``in the history of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental disagreement is about why the president misled
his friends, family, the courts, and indeed the entire nation about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Did he, as White House lawyers insist, try to conceal his
relationship merely to ``protect his family and himself from hurt
and public embarrassment?'' Or was he, in the words uttered on the
Senate floor Thursday by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., engaging
in an ``extensive scheme to prevent (Paula) Jones from obtaining
the evidence she thought she needed to prove her civil rights
claims?''
</P>
<P>
   The former may be forgivable. The latter is almost certainly
impeachable. And how the 100 senators who watched with rapt
attention answer that question will probably determine whether they
conclude that Clinton's behavior is merely shameful, or whether it
warrants his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans spent much of their opening statements Thursday
trying to establish that what the White House portrays as an
understandable effort to conceal an embarrassing extramarital
affair was actually a ``conspiracy'' and a ``serial pattern of
perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone lies about an affair and tries to hide the facts,
they violate the trust their spouse and family put in them,''
Sensenbrenner said. ``But when they lie about it during a legal
proceeding and obstruct the parties from obtaining evidence, they
prevent the courts from administering justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prove that Clinton was acting to subvert justice
rather than spare himself embarrassment may be impossible. But
House prosecutors went to great lengths to dispel the widely held
idea that the subject of Clinton's alleged lies somehow trivializes
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lewinsky probably hid their affair initially to
protect themselves from ``an embarrassing personal relationship,''
said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican from Arkansas. ``But after
they were subpoenaed and began to work to deny it in court, it
became more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his legal and constitutional responsibilities, the
president made the decision to continue the pattern of lying. The
action that followed is the obstruction to the administration of
justice,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors repeatedly cited the rights of Jones, the
Arkansas state employee who sued Clinton for allegedly making a
crude sexual advance when he was governor. Clinton's crimes stem
not from his relationship with Lewinsky, they said, but from his
repeated attempts to conceal the matter from Jones and her
attorneys, even after a federal judge had ruled that it was
material to the case.
</P>
<P>
   To shrug off all lies about sex, they asserted, would make it
impossible to enforce sexual harassment, and even some domestic
violence laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If defendants in these types of suits are allowed to lie about
sex, justice cannot be done, and many victims, mostly women, will
be denied justice,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said that the White House claim that Clinton was
merely trying to save himself embarrassment cannot be made for his
August 17 grand jury appearance. At that point, Clinton had already
confessed his relationship to his family, and would shortly do so
to the nation. He had no motive to continue his lie, they said,
except to try to wiggle out of legal jeopardy _ behavior
particularly reprehensible from the nation's chief law enforcement
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet during that deposition, they said Clinton lied repeatedly
about the nature of his relationship and his previous attempts to
conceal it. Using circumstantial evidence pieced together from
extensive grand jury testimony of many witnesses, they said that
Clinton ``piled perjury upon perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   They cited a conversation Clinton had with his personal
secretary, Betty Currie, on a Sunday afternoon last January, a day
after he had testified that he and Lewinsky had not had ``sexual
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, according to Currie's testimony, said, ``You were
always there when she was there, right? We were never really
alone?''
</P>
<P>
   The president testified that he was just trying to refresh his
memory. But after Clinton admitted an intimate relationship with
Lewinsky, House prosecutors suggested that his explanation was
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not refresh your memory by telling that person what he
or she remembers,'' Hutchinson said. ``This was not an attempt to
refresh his memory, this was witness tampering, pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors appealed to common sense on another sensitive
point: the precise nature of the physical relationship between the
president and the young intern.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has maintained that Clinton did not technically
engage in ``sexual relations'' under a definition provided by Paula
Jones' attorneys because it was her, not him, who did the intimate
touching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does the president's claim strain all boundaries of
common sense, it is directly in conflict with Monica Lewinsky's
detailed and corroborated accounts of their relationship,'' said
Rep. James Rogan, R-Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is asking everyone to believe that between the
years 1995 and 1997, while Monica Lewinsky was engaged in a pattern
of explicit availability for him, as she described in her
testimony, the president carefully avoided having any intimate
contact,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   The only direct evidence presented Thursday was a video clip of
the president listening to his attorney, Bob Bennett, insist during
the January Paula Jones deposition that Clinton and Lewinsky had
``no sex of any form.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have charged Clinton with obstructing justice by
sitting silently as his attorney misspoke, and with perjury for
denying that he was paying any attention at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Twice they showed the portion of the deposition where Bennett
makes the claim, as Clinton apparently is intently looking on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same president who is renowned for his
intelligence and his ability to compartmentalize, to concentrate,
to focus on whatever matter is at hand. And now he comes before
this Senate, to each one of you in his answer, by and through his
attorneys, and pleads that he simply wasn't paying attention at
this very important part _ during his own deposition,'' said Rep.
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tennessee, we have a saying for situations like that. It's
`that dog won't hunt.'''
</P>
<P>
   The White House will have its chances to respond next week. They
are sure to attack the Republicans for overreaching when they
accuse Lewinsky of being a ``co-conspirator'' because she agreed
with her lover not to reveal details of an illicit relationship. Or
when Republicans accuse the president of lying because he said he
had ``occasional'' meetings with Lewinsky, when actually there were
more than 20 over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, and Clinton himself, continue to portray this
as nothing more than a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president acknowledges ... he sought to avoid disclosing
his personal wrongdoing to protect his family and himself from hurt
and public embarrassment,'' White House attorneys argued in a brief
submitted this week. ``The president denies that he had any corrupt
purpose or any intent to influence the grand jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the president's future may ride on whether enough
senators concur with that statement.

REPUBLICANS LAY OUT THEIR CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ As the entire Senate sat in strange, solemn silence,
House impeachment managers began laying out their perjury and
obstruction-of-justice case against President Clinton Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist opened the extraordinary trial,
a gathering never witnessed in modern times, just after 1 o'clock
as a cold, gray sleet began sheathing the Capitol dome in ice.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, House prosecutors spent six hours in a cold, hard
recitation of evidence, laying out their case that Clinton lied
under oath and obstructed justice in an effort to thwart Paula
Jones' sexual harassment suit against him.
</P>
<P>
   The five prosecutors who spoke Thursday, all Republican members
of the House Judiciary Committee, broke no new ground, drawing from
the voluminous evidence and grand jury testimony assembled by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr surrounding Clinton's admitted
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But they did for the first time construct a coherent picture in
attempting to prove that Clinton ``piled perjury upon perjury'' in
a premeditated effort to cover up his alleged perjury in the Jones
suit, and that he spurned myriad opportunities to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde opened the prosecution
with a nod to senators from both parties who have complained that
the unruly House has plopped an ugly political and constitutional
mess in its dignified lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to know how much we respect you and this
institution and how grateful we are for your guidance and
cooperation,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde then forcefully pressed his contention that if the Senate
fails to remove Clinton from office, it will permanently damage the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do over the next few weeks will forever affect the
meaning of those two words, `I do,''' Hyde said, referring to the
oath all witnesses at a trial must take. ``You are now stewards of
that oath, and our cherished system of justice will never be the
same after this. Depending on what you decide, it will either be
strengthened in its power to achieve justice, or it will ... become
a mere convention, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has since the Senate trial formally opened last week,
Clinton spent the day studiously ignoring the historic proceeding
on Capitol Hill, visiting a police station in Virginia to promote
his $6 billion proposal to hire more police across the country.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy watched some of the trial from
the Senate gallery, reading at the end of the day a brief statement
saying the House managers ``have begun to lay out a case that is
both unsubstantiated and circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden by their own impeachment rules from talking or moving
about during the trial, senators accustomed to grandstanding and
plotting were forced to sit and listen. Some, like Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., furiously scribbled
notes. John Chaffee, R-R.I., read through reams of evidence piled
on his desk. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., listened intently. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., sat stone-faced and grim.
</P>
<P>
   The two legal teams, one from the White House and the other from
the House, sat in the well of the Senate at two curved tables built
for the occasion by the Senate carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., opened the prosecution with a
sweeping summary of why Clinton's alleged behavior is grounds for
his removal. ``We are here today because President William
Jefferson Clinton decided to put himself above the law, not once,
not twice, but repeatedly,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fitness for office is not in question because he had
an affair, Sensenbrenner said, but because ``he has not owned up to
the false testimony, the stonewalling and legal hairsplitting, and
obstructing the courts from finding the truth. In doing so, he has
turned his affair into a public wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, who served as a manager in the removal of a
federal judge for grand jury perjury in 1989, argued that the
``entire legal system depends upon the courts being able to find
the truth,'' noting that the Constitution specifically names
bribery as an impeachable ``high crime and misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury is the twin brother of bribery,'' Sensenbrenner
argued, carrying the same federal penalty because both ``prevent
the courts from administering justice. That is an offense against
the public, made even worse when a poor and powerless person seeks
the protections of our civil rights from the rich or powerful,'' he
added, referring to Jones, who claimed that Clinton made unwanted
sexual advances when he was governor of Arkansas and she was a
low-level state employee.
</P>
<P>
   After summarizing their case, the House managers turned to
detailed arguments, presented powerfully by two experienced
prosecutors, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and James Rogan of
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber turned visibly more alert and engaged as Hutchinson
turned a confused quilt-work of testimony into a cogent time-line,
attempting to prove that Clinton's activities between his
deposition in the Jones case and his testimony to the Starr grand
jury were part of a deliberate pattern of obstructing justice,
centering on his alleged efforts to get Lewinsky to sign a false
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, a 41-year-old former California state judge who grew up
in San Francisco's Mission District, combed through Clinton's grand
jury testimony, frequently playing video clips, to present the
allegations of Clinton's perjury.
</P>
<P>
   These included Clinton's insistence that his involvement with
Lewinsky did not fall under the definition of ``sexual relations,''
that he had been truthful in his Jones deposition, that he did not
try to influence his secretary, Betty Currie, to aid his effort to
cover up the affair, and that he told the truth to his staff about
his relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors repeatedly pressed for calling witnesses,
saying that the sharp differences between the White House lawyers
and the House prosecutors in interpreting the evidence requires the
Senate to hear direct testimony from such key players as Lewinsky,
Currie and Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan called the assembled evidence ``overwhelming'' and said
Clinton continues to deny ``all allegations set forth in these
articles. Who is telling the truth? There is only one way to find
out. On behalf of the House of Representatives, we urge this body
to bring forth the witnesses and place them all under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde suggested to some senators that Clinton himself should be
called, a proposal quickly shot down by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to call witnesses is a pivotal question that will
determine the course of the trial _ whether it wraps up quickly
within a couple of weeks or continues considerably longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate chose to delay that decision until after the White
House finishes presenting its case next week. First a vote will be
taken on whether to end the trial at that point, but if the motion
fails to get 51 votes, the Senate will begin voting on whether to
call each witness.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the totality of the House presentation
appeared to have made some impression on the Senate, even though it
remains extremely unlikely that the Senate will muster the 67 votes
needed to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., one of the Senate's staunchest
Democrats, said the House prosecutors made ``an effective
presentation.'' But Kennedy added that they have not yet proven to
him the ``central test _ even if all these allegations are true:
Does it rise to the level of impeachable offenses?''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats, including Boxer, blasted a meeting by three GOP
senators with the House prosecutors to discuss criteria for calling
witnesses, saying it reeked of partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats later conceded that a dozen of their own had met
with Democratic lawyers from the House Judiciary Committee to
discuss trial strategy.

JOHNSON TO CUT BACK, BUT STAY ON IN MIAMI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a wild 12-hour span, Jimmy Johnson went
from being a fully committed coach, to a retired coach, to an
unprecedented ``half-coach'' of the Miami Dolphins. And in changing
his mind he maybe changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My determination and my commitment is not one bit less than it
was before,'' Johnson said at a news conference in Davie, Fla.,
yesterday that was originally set up to facilitate his resignation
announcement. ``But I will spend a few more hours with my family.
... You have me for at least one more year.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the third-year Miami coach/general manager who recently
signed a one-year contract extension, is having it both ways in
rescinding his Wednesday-night intention to quit.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the former Cowboys coach, architect of two
Super Bowl champions in Dallas, maintains control of the Dolphins'
organization. At the same time, he has hired longtime protege Dave
Wannstedt, just fired as the Chicago Bears boss, to essentially
play an unprecedented role as Dolphins ``co-head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will work with all three areas, offense, defense, special
teams, just as I do,'' Johnson said. ``There will be times I won't
be here 16 hours a day. At those times, Dave will be working as the
head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   What transpired during that 12-hour period that prompted Johnson
to change his mind?
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Dan Marino, despite his history of conflict with
Johnson, was waiting outside Johnson's office upon the coach's
arrival at the club headquarters to tell Johnson he'd prefer not to
start over with another coach. Team owner Wayne Huizenga, upon
hearing Johnson's suggestion that Wannstedt simply replace him,
said he'd prefer to employ both Johnson and Wannstedt, the latter
to ``fill your shoes on days when you're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 55, said his decision to alter his role with the
Dolphins comes in part as a result of the Dec. 20 death of his
mother, Allene. His father, C.W., is battling cancer and will soon
move from Port Arthur to Miami to be closer to Jimmy. Johnson also
said his devotion to ``16-hour days, eight months a year, for the
last 34 years'' caused him to ``lose a marriage'' and ``to miss the
springtime'' with his two now-grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Johnson joked about ``putting his wife on
waivers,'' engaged in private disputes with assistants wanting to
carve out time for their families, scoffed at the sentimentality
surrounding birthdays and holidays, and during his 1994-95 break
from coaching, used his Fox network microphone to assail Cowboys
successor Barry Switzer for putting family above football.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Johnson said, ``There's a time you pull back and say,
`Be with people you care about. Give a little something back to
them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's off-field plans include marrying girlfriend Rhonda
Rookmaaker. His football plan for the Dolphins has been altered
drastically for the third time in three years: First, in 1995, as
he observed Don Shula's Dolphins from the outside, he said they
should win the Super Bowl. Then, upon taking over for Shula in
1996, he immediately announced a ``three-year plan'' that would
qualify the Dolphins for the upcoming Super Bowl, to be played in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But in Johnson's three seasons in Miami, he finished 8-8, 9-7
and 10-6 (27-21) with two playoff appearances and one victory. In
Shula's preceding three seasons, the Dolphins finished 9-7, 10-6
and 9-7 (28-20) with two playoff appearances and one victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Johnson removes himself from a recent who's-who list of
high-profile sports retirees that includes NBA star Michael Jordan,
Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson and Kansas City Chiefs
coach Marty Schottenheimer, he said he believes his team is ``a
couple of playmakers away from getting that championship.''

NEW RANGER CHOMPING AT THE BIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers general manager Doug Melvin
recognizes the unlikelihood of duplicating his 1997 exacta.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin acquired right-handers Rick Helling and Aaron Sele
through separate trades during a span of 86 days, and those two
later served as the foundation for the Rangers' 1998 rotation en
route to 39 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mark Clark, a two-time 14-game winner, arrived at
The Ballpark in Arlington yesterday and expressed similar
expectations for himself as the newest member of the Rangers'
strength-through-depth rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win without a legitimate No. 1 starter like a Greg
Maddux or Roger Clemens because of this defense, and you know that
this offense is going to score runs,'' said Clark, whom the Rangers
signed as a free agent Dec. 8 to a two-year contract worth $9.3
million with an option for 2001. ``You don't need a big-time No. 1
starter when you have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who this past season went 9-14 with a 4.84 earned-run
average during 33 starts for the Chicago Cubs, observed the 1998
success of Helling and Sele from afar.
</P>
<P>
   Helling joined right-handers Roger Clemens and David Cone and
left-hander Tom Glavine as the major leagues' only 20-game winners
despite a 4.41 ERA that ranked 26th among American League
qualifiers. Sele's 4.23 ERA ranked 20th, but his 19 victories
matched that of right-hander Pedro Martinez for the league's
fourth-highest total.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, Cone, Glavine and Martinez produced a collective ERA of
2.87, and that illustrates Clark's contention that success as a
productive member of the Rangers' rotation does not require the
phrase ``former Cy Young Award recipient'' displayed prominently on
his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Victories, Clark said, will accumulate ``if I pitch like I did
last year and they do what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin views Clark's 1998 performance deceiving and ``goes to
show you that wins and losses are affected by the rest of the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider these factors:
</P>
<P>
   Clark departed five starts in line for victory before the Cubs'
bullpen surrendered the lead.
</P>
<P>
   That bullpen also allowed 19 of the 30 runners it inherited from
Clark to score. That represented the most runs charged to any
National League pitcher after departing a game.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also received the least run support (4.3 runs per nine
innings) among members of the Cubs' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Clark relies on his sinking, two-seam fastball to produce ground
balls, yet the Cubs' infield converted the major leagues' fewest
ground-ball double plays (77).
</P>
<P>
   Opposing baserunners recorded 28 stolen bases in 36 attempts
with Clark on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually went a hell of a lot better than my wins and
losses show,'' Clark said of 1998. ``I pitched into some tough
luck. I pitched a lot of ballgames into the seventh and eighth
inning and came out with nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin predicts Clark will benefit from the Rangers' bullpen,
potent lineup, infield defense and catcher Ivan Rodriguez, a
seven-time Gold Glove Award recipient behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dissected his game-by-game performances and felt that he
gives you a shot to win games,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark expects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense and offense are going to be there to do their job.
The main thing is going to be me pitching six or seven innings and
keeping us in the game,'' said Clark, who this past season pitched
at least six innings during 25 of his 33 starts. ``If I do that,
it's going to be fun.''

TOTAL CONTROL WORKS FOR SOME COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Omnipotent, autocratic, dictator-like total
control.
</P>
<P>
   Is that so much for an NFL coach to ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to cook the food, I want to shop for the
groceries,'' says the NFL's consummate total controller, New York
Jets coach/general/manager/czar Bill Parcells, explaining why he
wants to be in charge of determining more than just what goes on
between the end zones.
</P>
<P>
   The next trend in the NFL is here: Total control for coaches.
Total control for coaches who want the power to determine their own
rosters, their own staffs, their own fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Parcells wants to control everything,'' says Jets
linebacker Bryan Cox. ``He wants to be God.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL doesn't offer quite that authority. But those
get-rich-quick TV commercials that scream invitingly, ``You can be
your own boss'' have nothing on the way some NFL coaches are
grabbing up self-determining job authority. And getting paid big
money for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are examples of guys who are coach/general managers who
have success because they have a system,'' says Mike Holmgren, who
departed Green Bay last week for total control with Seattle and
received an eight-year, $32 million deal to create his own
monarchy. ``Dan Reeves, Mike Shanahan, Jimmy Johnson, they all have
the authority in their organizations, and they are all successful,
because they have their systems and they believe in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Total control is in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Look at this NFL postseason: Of the final eight teams, six of
them _ Denver with Shanahan, Miami with Johnson, the Jets with
Parcells, Jacksonville with Tom Coughlin, Minnesota with Dennis
Green and Atlanta with Reeves _ are run by coaches in charge of
virtually everything. This weekend's AFC and NFC championship
games, featuring the Jets at Denver and Atlanta at Minnesota, make
the final four a clean sweep for the do-it-yourself concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Parcells says, ``I don't mind if anybody thinks,
`That's guy's a jerk.' Because I do know that they also think,
`Hey, he's doing everything he can to help us win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Total control doesn't always work. This season, in addition to
the aforementioned six success stories, there were, counting Dave
Wannstedt in Chicago (whose power diminished with the hiring of
personnel boss Mark Hatley), six other total-control coaches: Dick
Vermeil at St. Louis, Mike Ditka at New Orleans, Dom Capers at
Carolina, Dennis Erickson at Seattle and Bobby Ross at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The six success stories' combined record is 87-20. But the six
failures combined in 1998 for a 27-53 record _ and three firings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the format simply doesn't allow for employees who don't
pull in the same direction as the boss. And that is the major
upside to total control: In the event of failure, it leaves no room
for buck-passing. Also, there is a major downside to total control:
Even in the event of success, the egomania inherent in the makeup
of the men who desire it can eventually be their undoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cure-all,'' says Dolphins executive Bob Ackles, a
Johnson cohort in Dallas and Miami who also labored in a failed
system in Philadelphia. ``It depends on who the hire is, what the
organization is. But at least you know who's in charge, who's
answerable.'' PARCELLS THE EPITOME The optimal model of the perfect
total controller, blemishes and all, is Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, arguably ``the'' reason his Jets are in the AFC
Championship Game, is a gypsy, not exactly denying rumors he might
retire this year if the Jets win it all. He is a guy always on the
lookout for greener grass. He is a bully, not above questioning the
manhood of one of his own injured players by publicly calling him
``a girl.'' He is a rebel, scoffing at league rules ordering him to
facilitate better communication with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he might be as good a coach as ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom of some total-control designations seems dubious;
George Seifert's claim to fame is using his professorial skills to
continue San Francisco predecessor Bill Walsh's tradition through
the 1990s. Yet here he is this month receiving $2.5 million a year
to coach and, for the first time in his life, to be general
manager, in Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson, given total authority in Miami, this week seemed
about to crumble under the pressure before yesterday deciding to
rescind his resignation while changing his job to allow for more
personal time.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers might get lucky with Seifert. The odds seem better
with Holmgren in Seattle. And Johnson could conceivably be more
effective in avoiding being overworked. But the only sure thing
seems to be Parcells, now the first coach to ever take three
different teams to conference title games _ and he's done it all in
the span of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells worked with general manager George Young to build the
Giants into a Super Bowl champion in 1986. Then, after a short
cycle of mediocrity, he did it again with another Giants' Super
Bowl title in 1990. Then the nomadic Parcells, who had earlier
tried to escape his New York contract for the Atlanta job, left,
eventually landing with New England.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' Patriots won 11 games in 1996 and went to the Super
Bowl, but all season, he was embroiled in a struggle for power with
his front office. Parcells again escaped, this time to the Jets,
who had finished 1-15 in the year before his arrival in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, with the same developing young talent Parcells
acquired, New England's Pete Carroll has finished with 10 and then
nine wins. Meanwhile, Parcells took over the entire operation of
the NFL-worst Jets, built them to 9-7 last year, then to 12-4 this
regular season, now to Sunday's AFC Championship Game in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up: Since Parcells jumped ship, already-good New England
is 19-13. Once-horrible New York is 21-11, and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' says Curtis Martin, Parcells'
featured back in both New England and New York, ``coach Parcells is
the best coach to ever coach anything.'' ONE MAN'S AURA Holmgren's
agent, Bob LaMonte, says, ``To me, it's clear-cut. You have a model
here: you have an owner, you have a president and you have the
person who runs the football operation.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something intangible to most of these men, something
God-given. A knack. An aura.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike Parcells' history is Reeves' background. He was hired
in Denver and four years later he's a Super Bowl contender. He
moves to the Giants and immediately they're a championship
contender. He moves to Atlanta, and after starting 0-7 in 1997, the
sad-sack Falcons are 60 minutes away from a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference here has been Dan, no question about it,'' says
Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler. ``He just came in and
immediately commanded everybody's respect. There's a
professionalism there you don't see with many coaches, and this
team took on his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   So add aura to intelligence. And add the total controller's
desire to be married to his job, to winning. Reeves, as an example,
underwent quadruple bypass surgery late in the season. Yet his
team's 20-18 playoff victory against San Francisco featured him on
the sidelines, just 17 days after his release from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I want to do, and my health has never crossed my
mind and still doesn't cross my mind when it comes to the ability
to do my job,'' Reeves says. ``I'm not looking to retire. I enjoy
it too much. It's too much a part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Look closely, and you'll see that among the keys to most of the
total controllers' success is their ability to delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Reeves' health problems, the Falcons didn't falter,
because his defensive coordinator, ex-Rams head coach Rich Brooks,
was equipped to run the club in his absence. Parcells' history is
as a defensive expert, but his top assistant is Bill Belichick, and
he runs the Jets' defense. Johnson gets the headlines in Miami, but
one of his greatest accomplishments is surrounding himself with
capable worker ants like Ackles, and now, assistant head coach Dave
Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   Denver general manager John Beake offers an interesting case.
The Broncos are Shanahan's organization _ his media nickname is
``Mastermind.'' But Beake, in his 14th year as the Broncos GM,
preceded him in Denver. Beake has worked on the business side of
the sport, as a personnel director, and as a coach on the NFL,
college and high-school levels. That's a resume strong enough to
open doors for Beake if he ever wanted to become a recognizable
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us in Denver are dedicated to that,'' Beake says.
``There are all different sorts of ways to do it, but here, with
\Rowner Pat\S Bowlen and Shanahan, we all contribute, we all go in
the same direction. The other stuff doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said for most of the total controllers. The
egos of Johnson and Parcells manifest themselves in bluster. The
egos of Ross and Coughlin result in Pattonesque military
approaches. And human beings, even the relatively modest ones, like
having the red carpet rolled out. When Holmgren arrived in Seattle
for his interview, he flew in on an airplane that arrived at owner
Paul Allen's private hangar, then rode in a limousine that whisked
away him and his entire family, then retired to Seattle's elegant
Four Seasons Olympic Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When another lesser candidate for the job, Jim Haslett, arrived
in Seattle, he flew commercial. Carrying his own bags.
</P>
<P>
   Even the apparently quiet types, like the defending Super Bowl
champion Broncos' Shanahan, seem to need outlets to prove their
abilities to control not just contracts and salaries and free
agency and the draft, but to also control life-and-death matters.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan recently bought a Harley-Davidson motorcycle,
participates in bungee-jumping in Cancun, cliff-diving in the
Caribbean and auto racing on the NASCAR track in Las Vegas, driving
at 160 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Would one call that symptomatic of the total controller?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' corrects Shanahan's wife, Peggy, the rarity in the NFL
as a person who can control the total controller. ``I'd call that
stupid.''

 &HT;    Georgia man's battle to regain his eyesight provides inspiration
for big-screen romance
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shirl Jennings doesn't look people in the eye when he
talks to them, which is disconcerting. But he isn't being rude or
shy.
</P>
<P>
   He can see, all right. He just hasn't gotten used to making eye
contact during a conversation. He forgets to look down, too, for
curbs and chairs and other obstacles below eye level.
</P>
<P>
   When he was blind, as he was for most of his 58 years, he never
had to worry about such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to looking straight ahead,'' the Conyers (Ga.)
resident said good-humoredly. ``Being blind was more easy
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is among the 20 or so people ever known to have
regained their eyesight after lifelong blindness. A professional
masseur, he was blind for more than 40 years until two operations
in 1991 restored his sight.
</P>
<P>
   His extraordinary metamorphosis made headlines at the time and
was the subject of a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, ``To
See or Not See,'' by neurologist Oliver Sacks. His experiences also
inspired the movie romance ``At First Sight,'' starring Val Kilmer
and Mira Sorvino, which opens Friday in Atlanta theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the movie to tell Jennings' life story _ key
elements have been altered, Hollywood-style. The film is set in New
York instead of metro Atlanta, and the main characters are much
younger than Jennings and his wife, Barbara, who is 51.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Jenningses say the movie is surprisingly accurate on
what is to them the most crucial point: For those who have learned
to live without it, the gift of eyesight can be a tremendous,
overwhelming burden.
</P>
<P>
   When Jennings regained his eyesight, his doctors discovered he
had lost virtually all visual memory. His eyes were functioning,
yet the visual cues he was receiving seemed at odds with the
sounds, smells and textures that for decades had been his means of
observing the world.
</P>
<P>
   Faces were meaningless blurs; airplanes flying at 30,000 feet
seemed to skim inches over his head. He could not recognize a whole
tree, let alone a forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew the top and bottom separately, the trunk, the
leaves,'' Mrs. Jennings said. ``It took him 6 months to put a tree
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He faced other adjustments no one had anticipated. As a masseur
for 25 years at the DeKalb YMCA (Ga.), Jennings had felt secure in
his familiarity with skin and hair, muscle and bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home to me one day and growled, `I can see the bodies
I'm working on, and I don't like it!' '' Barbara laughed.
</P>
<P>
   There were laughs, but far more frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1940 in Bedford County, Va., Shirley Jennings was a
lively toddler until age 3, when he became dangerously ill with
three illnesses at once: meningitis, polio and cat scratch fever.
</P>
<P>
   His sickness plunged him into a coma, from which he emerged
after two weeks with paralyzed legs and damaged eyesight. Jennings'
determined 17-year-old mother got his cousins to help him relearn
how to crawl and walk, a process that took two or three years and
ultimately succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   But his eyesight continued to deteriorate. When he was 7 or 8,
Jennings was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive,
untreatable disease of the retina that causes blindness. By the
time he was 10, he could distinguish only light from dark.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Jennings learned to live sightless. He attended
the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in Staunton, Va., and
later the YMCA School of Swedish Massage.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to recognize people by their footfalls, by the feel
of their skin. Fellow blind masseurs passed along clients' more
unusual characteristics, such as a hairy foot, and when Jennings
encountered these people on his massage table, he astonished them
by identifying them by name.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, he became resigned to his blindness, as
consistency at work and at home taught him contentment. That began
to change in the late 1980s when he heard that an old girlfriend,
Barbara, whom he had dated two decades earlier, had divorced her
husband and returned to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called,'' Jennings said. ``She had a beautiful, distinctive
voice. After 20 years, we were right back where we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wouldn't let me get away this time,'' Mrs. Jennings
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, soon after they started dating again, she urged
Jennings to visit her family ophthalmologist in Dunwoody (Ga.), Dr.
Trevor Woodhams. Jennings hadn't been to an eye doctor in 10 years,
thinking it futile. But she was adamant that he seek a fresh
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had already reconciled himself to the fact that he would
never see again,'' Woodhams recalled. ``He was humoring Barbara,
that was how it appeared to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Woodhams was interested. Jennings had extremely
dense cataracts, so opaque it was impossible to determine the
condition of his retinas, supposedly degraded beyond repair by
retinitis pigmentosa.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, tests of the optic nerves showed they were still
viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the capacity of some vision,'' Woodhams said. ``How
much was anybody's guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodhams speculated that removing the cataracts might restore
Jennings' eyesight. Jennings was hesitant, saying it was too much
trouble and expense for such a small chance of return.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Barbara's attitude was, if there's any chance at all,
let's go for it,'' Woodhams said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jennings' intensely bright blue eyes don't so much as
twinkle as she downplays her role in her husband's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stay out of it,'' she insisted. ``He had to live with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth a gamble,'' Jennings said with a nod.
</P>
<P>
   Woodhams spends most Monday mornings in surgical scrubs,
performing cataract removal operations at the surgical center
adjoining his Dunwoody clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has not changed drastically in the seven years
since he used it to restore Jennings' eyesight. One difference is
that Woodhams now uses a local anesthetic that allows the patient
to see as soon as a few hours after surgery. In Jennings' case, he
used a shot that temporarily paralyzed the optic nerve, which kept
them from learning the outcome until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Woodhams in surgery is marvelous. His hands, small and
finely shaped, are all that moves when he operates; the rest of his
body remains absolutely still, his torso upright and his eyes
locked onto the microscope that magnifies the patient's eye to
roughly 20 times actual size.
</P>
<P>
   Using an ultrasound tool he describes as a tiny jackhammer,
Woodhams scrapes away the existing lens. Through the microscope,
one can see the instrument plowing minuscule furrows in the lens,
gradually revealing the clear pupil beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Woodhams inserts a minute tube within the thin membrane covering
the eye and deftly implants the new artificial lens. Then he gently
nudges the iris back into shape around the lens. No stitches are
required.
</P>
<P>
   The entire operation takes no more than half an hour. Woodhams
shrugs out of his sterile gown, stuffs his surgical cap in the
pocket of his scrubs and recalls how Jennings' first operation in
September 1991, to remove the cataract in the right eye, was
nothing heroic.

   ATLANTA_The day after surgery, Woodhams removed the eye patch.
Instead of reacting with joy, Jennings was dazed. Undoubtedly he
could see, but he obviously was experiencing a tremendous sensory
overload.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to figure out what everything was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what to do,'' Barbara Jennings said. ``People
expected him to be fully sighted immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sensory difficulties worsened, despite a second operation
several weeks later that removed the cataract from the left eye. At
20/80 or 20/100, Jennings' eyesight wasn't perfect. This didn't
account, however, for his inability to visually recognize even
familiar things, such as his cat, unless he touched them. Woodhams
began to realize the problem was rooted in Jennings' brain, not his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jennings' father called Sacks, whose work in neurology was
well-known through his book ``Awakenings,'' about catatonic
patients who were temporarily reanimated by drug treatments.
Intrigued, Sacks and an ophthalmologist friend, Dr. Robert
Wasserman, came to Atlanta to examine Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman and Woodhams concluded Jennings had been incorrectly
diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and speculated his initial
blindness may have been caused by congenital retinal problems as
well as nerve damage from his childhood bout with meningitis. The
cataracts had developed later.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jennings' problems incorporating sight into his other
senses, the doctors decided he would simply have to learn
everything from the beginning, as infants do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyes and ears in themselves work automatically. But that's
not enough,'' Sacks explained. ``What the ears and eyes provide is
only the beginning of a long process of images that has to be
digested and processed and incorporated and remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' learning process ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   It had been an eventful, stressful year for Shirl and Barbara
Jennings. Between his two eye operations, they were married in a
big church wedding, just a few months after their reunion. He
eyesight was overwhelming him, and he often reverted to his blind
habits and relied on touch.
</P>
<P>
   Then a series of devastating blows struck. In February 1992,
Jennings was rushed to the hospital with pneumonia, which led to
respiratory failure that starved his brain of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite supplemental oxygen, he periodically lost consciousness,
and his sight virtually vanished. It returned to some degree as he
recovered, but never near the acuity immediately following the
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' illness left him disabled and he lost his cherished
job at the YMCA. Shortly afterward, the Jenningses also lost their
home: As an employee, he had been living with his wife in a
YMCA-owned house near the facility. After a frantic house search,
they moved to Conyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that first year was a little rugged,'' Mrs. Jennings said.
``There was a lot of depression there. He never expected that at
all. He just thought he would see.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Jennings' illness had robbed him of sight. He could still
identify colors, detect movement and distinguish bright lights, but
he was essentially, if not blind, seriously visually handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting and sad,'' remarked Woodhams. ``But at the
same time you felt relieved he was losing his sight.'' The
pressures of entering the sighted world had been too much.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, despite his failing sight, Jennings began taking
painting lessons. One of his paintings, an abstract work dominated
by his favorite color, blue, is featured in ``At First Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings doesn't use a cane, but he does brush his fingertips
against the wall when he walks, slowly, down the hallway of his
cluttered home. He may walk hesitantly, but when he massages, he is
confident and at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me I have hands like a surgeon,'' he said. They
are incredibly strong, yet gentle hands, and he wields them
skillfully. They know where to find tension knots, how to relax
tight muscles, how to soothe.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believe Jennings' sight is irretrievable. The removal of
the cataracts that had shrouded his retinas for so long actually
may have contributed to further damage, by allowing ultraviolet
rays to penetrate the pupil. His extended respiratory illness,
which lowered the oxygen levels in his blood, probably also was a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chaos of that first year, the Jenningses'
relationship remains solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to develop monstrous quantities of patience,'' Mrs.
Jennings said, and this time her eyes do twinkle. ``I am still a
24-hour sighted guide, and I always will be. Unless he gets a
(seeing-eye) dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They move too quickly for me,'' Jennings quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The couple plan to launch a Web site soon to advertise their
artwork _ his paintings and her egg art. She has painted eggs,
including enormous ostrich eggs, for 20 years and last year created
the Georgia entry for the White House Easter Egg Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have enjoyed the hoopla created by the movie,
especially meeting and mingling with stars Sorvino and Kilmer. They
flew to California for the movie's premiere Tuesday in Los Angeles,
followed by a party at Spago.
</P>
<P>
   And Jennings has no regrets about having his cataracts removed,
despite the upheaval in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate all the sight I got now,'' he said, smiling. ``I
can see the world, instead of just imagining it.''

 &HT;    MEXICO ANTICIPATES CRITICAL MESSAGE FROM POPE ON INDIANS, HUMAN
RIGHTS
 &HT;    With CUBA-POPE-$ADV17; McKay Photos in the International folder

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In this fervently Catholic country, they build
shrines by the thousands and crawl on their knees to honor the
Virgin Mary at her own special basilica.
</P>
<P>
   But when Pope John Paul II arrives in Mexico later this week,
the aging pontiff will also address a country where foreign priests
have been expelled for involvement in politics and the Catholic
Church has been blamed for fomenting an armed revolution among
Mexican Indians.
</P>
<P>
   This undercurrent of tension between the Mexican government and
the Catholic Church -- particularly in Mexico's southern Chiapas
state -- is creating an unusual level of anticipation before the
pope's visit to Mexico City five-day visit beginning this
Friday(Jan. 22).
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are bracing for the popular religious leader's remarks,
and speculating on whether he will offer criticism, albeit
indirect, of Mexico's human rights record, the unresolved Indian
rebellion in Chiapas or free-market economic policies some blame
for worsening poverty here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's trip could be used by the political opposition here
to its advantage,'' said Bernardo Barranco, president of the Center
for the Study of Religions in Mexico here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope will talk about Indians, corruption, economic
policies, and drug trafficking, but he won't refer to a specific
reality,'' Barranco added. ``He'll talk about these problems in
terms of the whole continent.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Vatican has been mum on the specifics of the pope's
speeches in Mexico, the Mexican government was concerned enough
about the Vatican's views on Chiapas, that last December it sent
its Chiapas peace negotiator to Rome in December to offer the pope
its own perspective on that crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the pope's trip to Mexico is to address
challenges to the Catholic Church in the Americas, the most
Catholic region in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has contributed millions of immigrants to the United
States, bolstering the U.S. Catholic population. And Mexico is home
to the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the second-most visited
Catholic sanctuary in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing the Catholic Church is most concerned about in the
Americas is that they are losing members rapidly, not just to
Protestantism but to secularism, too,'' said Latin American
religion specialist Virginia Burnett of the University of Texas in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 78-year-old pontiff is frail, some Vatican watchers
speculate that this could be one of his last trips to the Americas,
if not the final.
</P>
<P>
   After Mexico City, the pope heads to St. Louis, Mo., where on
Jan. 26 and 27 he will meet with Catholic youths and embattled
American President Bill Clinton -- a day after an anticipated vote
in the Senate to dismiss impeachment charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   This is the pope's fourth trip to Mexico, whose Catholic
population is second only to Brazil in number. It is his first
journey here since a devastating 1995 peso devaluation that cut
Mexican families' buying power nearly in half, and a 1994 uprising
staged by Indians in Chiapas protesting desperate poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Since the uprising, Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de las
Casas, Chiapas, has become a lightening rod for church-state
disputes. Ruiz has vigorously condemned the government's handling
of the Chiapas crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas Eve, Ruiz issued a scathing pastoral letter
forwarded to the pope that attacks ``the madness of an economic
model that devours a nation's wealth and concentrates it in few
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new power of narcotics trafficking has shown that it is
more effective than the state,'' the document adds.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also accuses government officials of offering
``amnesty'' to paramilitary groups in Chiapas that have killed
Indian rebel sympathizers. In December 1997, a paramilitary group
murdered more than 40 people, mostly women and children, who were
praying in a church in the village of Acteal, which sympathized
with rebel goals.
</P>
<P>
   A French priest who ministered in Acteal was subsequently
deported by the Mexican government after he accused local officials
of complicity in the massacre. Other priests have also been
deported.
</P>
<P>
   From Rome, the pope publicly lamented the Acteal massacre.
Mexican clergy say he has kept abreast of the Chiapas crisis since
its inception.
</P>
<P>
   A government official close to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
told the Cox News Service that ``the pope is not coming to resolve
local problems,'' although opposition politicians and Mexican
clergy may try to interpret his remarks and apply them to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he has to talk about poverty,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He wouldn't be the pope if
he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Luis Morales Reyes, who is president of the Mexican
Episcopal Council -- a Catholic bishops group -- said ``only the
pope knows'' if he will refer directly to Chiapas while in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will probably invite us to respect indigenous rights and
urge us to find a way to integrate Indians into society while
respecting their cultures,'' Morales said. ``These comments could
easily be applied to Chiapas.''
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Toussaint, vicar of the San Cristobal de las Casas
Diocese, said priests from Chiapas are also concerned about a
``lack of religious freedom'' developing in their troubled state.
</P>
<P>
   Toussaint blamed the government for failing to insure access to
a number of Catholic churches in Chiapas that have been blocked by
anti-Catholic residents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the armed Indian rebellion, Chiapas has also been
rocked in recent years by disputes between Catholics and a growing
number of Indians who have been converted to Protestant sects -- a
trend that has the Catholic Church worried.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope may lament violence in Chiapas, he doesn't
necessarily endorse the activities of Ruiz and other liberal clergy
who are active in that state, according to Burnett and other
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, for example, is identified by some conservative clergy as
a bishop who is too close to ``liberation theology,'' a philosophy
that became popular in the 1970s and 1980s and sought to defend the
poor and politically oppressed in Latin America. In Central America
-- just over the border from Chiapas state -- some priests
influenced by liberation theology even supported guerrilla armies
of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Pope's point of view, there's a lot of mopping up to
do from liberation theology. He didn't really like it,'' Burnett
said.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, Burnett added, the Catholic Church has
had a troubled relationship with the Mexican state, in spite of
Mexicans' strong Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1910 Mexican Revolution, the church was perceived as
aligned with rich landowners. The post-revolutionary government
forbade it from owning property and exercising other rights.
</P>
<P>
   The right to own property was restored by Mexico's ruling
Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) only during the 1990s and
priests were once again given the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope finds himself in a tricky situation,'' Burnett said.
``He doesn't want to hack off the PRI, which enacted these reforms,
yet he has to stand up for indigenous rights.''
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, the pope will meet with President Zedillo on
Saturday(Jan. 23) and celebrate Mass at the Basilica of the Virgin
of Guadalupe. The church sits on the site where in 1531 a
brown-skinned Virgin Mary is said to have appeared before an Indian
peasant and left an imprint of her image on his cloak.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will also appear at Mexico City's Aztec Stadium on
Monday(Jan. 25).
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he will travel to St. Louis where he will meet
with President Clinton and speak before a group of young Catholics.
On Jan. 27, he will celebrate Mass in St. Louis before returning to
Rome.

<P>
   LONDON _ When Prince Edward's engagement to Sophie Rhys-Jones
was heralded across this imperial island last week, it seemed only
reasonable to expect news clips of Queen Elizabeth passing out
celebratory cigars to the editors of the nation's tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, it was a dream come true: A sequel in the great
national saga with a fresh star and at least a fair shot at a happy
ending -- even if it involves what Americans may regard as minor
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, the queen's youngest and least famous son, prefers to be
called Edward Windsor when he is away from the palace and is making
his mark in the world of producing television documentaries. He's
the producer formerly known as prince.
</P>
<P>
   But for a royal household eager for a little good news, the
announcement of engagement to his girlfriend of five years produced
near giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   Royal weddings long have seemed little more than hors d'oeuvre
for the richer and tastier courses of Royal Indiscretions, Royal
Divorces, followed by an even saucier serving of Royal Revelations.
This unhappy, if entertaining cycle has become all too familiar.
And, since the death of Princess Diana in 1997, woefully short of
charming protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   The royal story was growing cold. The tabloids, which were slow
to free Diana from their front pages even a year after her death,
were watching their readers slipping away. With the exception of
the brief joyful spectacle provided them by the Bill Clinton-Monica
Lewinsky affair, the pages lacked star quality.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement captured the front of virtually every tabloid
plus the first seven-to-eight pages inside, which were splayed
gleefully with more Rhys-Jones photos and stories fleshing out
their new star.
</P>
<P>
   In an exquisite twist, this 33-year-old public relations
professional was far from flaky -- already a break from tradition
-- and she was widely proclaimed as relatively ``normal'' -- a word
not often used on the royal beat.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Sensation,'' the tabloid Mirror declared. ``They're happy,
madly in love, and it might just last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail produced a 12-page ``special souvenir pull-out''
with stories and 49 photos in addition to the four pages in the
main news section. ``Even in this cynical age, few events are more
capable of brightening the gloom of a British winter than the
prospect of a royal wedding,'' the tabloid gushed. ``After years of
turmoil and personal tragedy, perhaps the palace can at last look
forward to a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evening news -- as the most powerful man in the world was
facing impeachment and removal from office -- the usually
restrained BBC devoted the first 10 minutes of the Six O' Clock
News to the happy couple.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all of England is so enthralled. The Guardian
newspaper, never a great fan of the royals, stuck the story on page
4, and pleaded for a low-key ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Elton John fall silent. May the Muse desert the Poet
Laureate,'' the newspaper wrote. ``Spare us the sentimentality this
time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Buckingham Palace displayed a rare level of
emotion, describing the queen's reaction to the first royal wedding
since 1992 as ``delighted'' and ``thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   And for good cause: Rhys-Jones could prove the tonic the royals
need to turn the tide of anguish caused by a string of royal
divorces -- each of the queen's other children, Anne, Andrew and
Charles, has endured a much-publicized marriage break-up -- and the
disquieting death of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Di and the less popular Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of
York, Rhys-Jones does not come from an aristocratic background.
Indeed, far from a fairy tale starlet, Rhys-Jones was raised in a
farmhouse in Kent and never went to a university. Her father is a
former car salesman who later worked for a tire company. She was
described by her friends as somebody who likes to have a few at the
pub and let down her hair.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she has lived in the real, beer-drinking,
dinner-cooking, bill-paying world.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones is tall and pretty with a full head of blonde hair,
enough to cause a passerby to get an initial sense of deja vu at
seeing her photo on the front of the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at 33 and with five years experience at being the Royal
Girlfriend, she offers a far different persona than the shy and
dreamy-eyed 20-year-old girl Diana was when she married Prince
Charles in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious reminders of the late princess, it is
unlikely that Rhys-Jones could fill the void in the hearts of the
Diana faithful. Una-Mary Parker, a royal writer and expert, told
the BBC that no one could replace Diana, no matter how much the
press yearned for another royal star.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rhys-Jones) does emulate Diana in many ways with her clothes
and her hair, but it is not going to work,'' Parker said. ``The
public won't buy another Diana. There was only one.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Rhys-Jones has made it clear she intends to be
anything but Princess Di II, even suggesting in some reports that
she will not seek the title of princess.
</P>
<P>
   And her debut as fiancee couldn't have been more different than
Diana's shy, even frightened performance a decade ago. As
Rhys-Jones parked her burgundy sedan outside her public relations
firm in central London the morning after the news broke, she found
the sidewalk filled with reporters and cameras. She smiled and
appeared relaxed as she stepped out of her car with a police
escort.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced at public relations, she was careful not to ignore
the press or dismiss them with responses of ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   No, she had no intention of giving up her business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have set this company up and I have commitments to clients
and staff, and I want to carry that on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What would it be like being part of a royal marriage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will see about that when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she looking forward to the media microscope?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Harkin, her business partner, predicted she'll remain
cool under the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows the media inside out, so I think that is going to
help her with some of the pressures she is obviously going to be
under in the next couple of months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones met Edward at the Queen's Tennis Club in London in
1993 and they began dating soon afterward. She has spent weekends
and holidays with him at the queen's homes at Balmoral in Scotland
and Sandringham in eastern England, and from time to time has lived
in his royal apartments at Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   At a photo session at St. James's Palace after the announcement,
she frequently threw back her head in laughter and seemed warm and
confident with Edward, who presented her an engagement ring
featuring a 2-carat diamond flanked by two smaller heart-shaped
ones.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted that she found the prospect of joining the royal
family ``slightly nerve-wracking'' but gave every impression of
being able to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Getting married is a very personal thing,'' she told reporters.
``Naturally, there is going to be more interest in us than in other
people, but it is a personal matter and a family occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple hope to marry in St. George's Chapel at Windsor in
late spring or early summer. A date has yet not been set. They'll
live in Bagshot Park, a sprawling estate in Surrey built by Queen
Victoria for her favorite son, Prince Arthur. Edward leased the
estate in 1997 to house his business, Ardent Productions.
</P>
<P>
   In the family tradition, Edward had entered the military after
graduating from Cambridge, but in a show of independence he quit
the commando course of the Royal Marines in 1987, resigned his
commission and returned to civilian life to pursue a career in the
theater. He started as a production assistant for Andrew Lloyd
Webber's Really Useful Company, doing backstage jobs at the
musicals ``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``Phantom of the
Opera'' in the West End theater district. In 1992, he and friends
set up a theater production company, which collapsed a year later,
$1 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   His company's biggest successes have been with royal subjects,
one the story of his great-uncle Edward VIII called ``Edward on
Edward;'' another a series called ``Crown and Country,'' which was
shown on PBS in the United States in September and will reappear in
a sequel in February; and ``Windsor Restored,'' the documentary on
the $61 million project to resurrect Windsor Castle after the 1992
fire.
</P>
<P>
   After years of incessant questioning about his intentions with
Rhys-Jones, Edward proposed before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed to take her completely by surprise,'' he said. ``She
had no idea it was coming, which was what I really wanted to do.
The trouble is everybody always speculating always made it very
difficult. Every time there was another round of speculation I had
to go very quiet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones said she was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I suddenly realized I should actually answer the
question,'' she said. ``So then I said, 'Yes, yes, please.' ``

<P>
   LONDON _ When Prince Edward's engagement to Sophie Rhys-Jones
was heralded across this imperial island last week, it seemed only
reasonable to expect news clips of Queen Elizabeth passing out
celebratory cigars to the editors of the nation's tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, it was a dream come true: A sequel in the great
national saga with a fresh star and at least a fair shot at a happy
ending -- even if it involves what Americans may regard as minor
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, the queen's youngest and least famous son, prefers to be
called Edward Windsor when he is away from the palace and is making
his mark in the world of producing television documentaries. He's
the producer formerly known as prince.
</P>
<P>
   But for a royal household eager for a little good news, the
announcement of engagement to his girlfriend of five years produced
near giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   Royal weddings long have seemed little more than hors d'oeuvre
for the richer and tastier courses of Royal Indiscretions, Royal
Divorces, followed by an even saucier serving of Royal Revelations.
This unhappy, if entertaining cycle has become all too familiar.
And, since the death of Princess Diana in 1997, woefully short of
charming protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   The royal story was growing cold. The tabloids, which were slow
to free Diana from their front pages even a year after her death,
were watching their readers slipping away. With the exception of
the brief joyful spectacle provided them by the Bill Clinton-Monica
Lewinsky affair, the pages lacked star quality.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement captured the front of virtually every tabloid
plus the first seven-to-eight pages inside, which were splayed
gleefully with more Rhys-Jones photos and stories fleshing out
their new star.
</P>
<P>
   In an exquisite twist, this 33-year-old public relations
professional was far from flaky -- already a break from tradition
-- and she was widely proclaimed as relatively ``normal'' -- a word
not often used on the royal beat.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Sensation,'' the tabloid Mirror declared. ``They're happy,
madly in love, and it might just last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail produced a 12-page ``special souvenir pull-out''
with stories and 49 photos in addition to the four pages in the
main news section. ``Even in this cynical age, few events are more
capable of brightening the gloom of a British winter than the
prospect of a royal wedding,'' the tabloid gushed. ``After years of
turmoil and personal tragedy, perhaps the palace can at last look
forward to a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evening news -- as the most powerful man in the world was
facing impeachment and removal from office -- the usually
restrained BBC devoted the first 10 minutes of the Six O' Clock

</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all of England is so enthralled. The Guardian

</P>
<P>
   ``Let Elton John fall silent. May the Muse desert the Poet
Laureate,'' the newspaper wrote. ``Spare us the sentimentality this
time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Buckingham Palace displayed a rare level of
emotion, describing the queen's reaction to the first royal wedding
since 1992 as ``delighted'' and ``thrilled.''

   MONSTER-TRUCKS (Houston) _ They're big, bad and extremely
popular. With a price tage of at least $100,000, you can bet
monster trucks have never hauled a load of dirt, much less kids and
dogs on a country drive. The testosterone-fueled machines carry
names like Liquidator, Eradicator, Cyborg and Grave Digger,
crushing cars and entertaining as they hog sports arenas. By
IHOSVANI RODRIGUEZ.

<P>
   BARS-SMOKING (San Francisco) _ Nearly one year after the
California legislature banned smoking in every bar in the state,
San Francisco cops are warning 2,400 bars and restaurants in the

law by lighting up anyway. The cost of a smoking ticket: $76. By

   MEN-SKINCARE (San Antonio) _ Face it _ men may know a thing or

importance of skin care. By RENE A. GUZMAN.

<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ One question PC buyers frequently
ask is whether they really need all the power that can be found in
high-end machines. For folks who are doing the basics, the answer
is, happily, no. But there is one category that just screams for
power, and that's gaming. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader wants to know about
three-button and four-button mice and what advantages it holds over
two-button mice. Q&AMP;A. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ Success, while wonderful, can breed
its own kind of problems. When a company is growing rapidly,
sometimes not everyone grows along with it. Many employees embrace
change and look for new challenges, but some employees may lag
behind, unable to keep up. It can be tough to break out of that
mold. By L.M. SIXEL

   KLOOSTER-OBIT (San Francisco) _ Gerald Klooster, an Alzheimer's
patient who became the focus of a custody battle after his wife was
accused by their son of arranging a suicide with Dr. Jack
Kevorkian's help, has died of natural causes, sources said. He was
72. By MARSHA GINSBURG.

   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REIVEW-MONSTERS (Undated) _ ``Gods and Monsters'' is
filmmaking's equivalent of a small gothic storm _ gothic not in its
terror, which is minimal, but in its bone-cracking embrace of human
frailty. The film is a fictionalized drama based on a few weeks in
the later years of director James Whale, whose own gothic
masterpieces included ``Frankenstein'' and ``The Invisible Man.''
By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-DREAMS (Undated) _ Neil Jordan has had a few
missteps in his directorial career, but the creator of ``The Crying
Game'' and ``The Butcher Boy'' has never stumbled as badly as he
does with ``In Dreams.'' The movie is a glossy but nonsensical
horror flick that likely would have gone straight to video were it
not for Jordan and his star cast _ Annette Bening, Robert Downey
Jr., Stephen Rea and Aidan Quinn. By STEVE BARNES.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-THIN (Undated) _ As beautiful ``The Thin Red Line''
is, Terence Malick's dreamy discourse on the inhumanity of war
rings strangely false. In another year it might have been art. But
this year, released six months following ``Saving Private Ryan,''
``The Thin Red Line'' seems exquisitely contrived. By AMY
BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-RED-PROFILE (Undated) _ Moviegoers seeing ``The Thin Red
Line'' when it opens this weekend will know they've seen something
impressive and harrowing. They may also end up scratching their
heads, wondering just what it was all about. ``The Thin Red Line''
sometimes seems to need, if not an interpreter, at least a tour
guide. ``It's nonlinear,'' said Jim Caviezel, who plays one of the
U.S. Marines who hit the beaches of Guadalcanal. By LOUIS PARKS
</P>
<P>
   TV-REVIEW-JESSE (Undated) _ ``Dear Jesse,'' which makes its
television debut Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. EST on Cinemax, is a
documentary that asks a question: How can two men, Sen. Jesse Helms
and filmmaker Tim Kirkman have so much in common, yet disagree on
so much, especially about homosexuality? By MARK McGUIRE. (For
release Sunday, Jan. 17.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-DREAMS (Undated) _ ``In Dreams'' is a high-gloss,
low-yield supernatural horror film starring Annette Bening as
Claire Cooper and directed by Neil Jordan, of ``Interview With the
Vampire,'' ``The Crying Game'' and last year's ``The Butcher Boy.''
By DAVID ARMSTRONG.
</P>
<P>
   TV-NBC-FUTURE (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Scott Sassa may just be a
temporary Band-Aid as NBC tinkers with its programming, but right
out of the gate he's making some interesting suggestions for the
network. Like less sex. And more family. Perhaps the first question
to Sassa, NBC's new entertainment president, should have been
whether he'd fallen down, hit his head and woke up thinking he was
programming CBS. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   TV-MYSTERY-REVIEW (Undated) _ After a decade of growing cult
status, critical praise and impact on popular culture, the
Satellite of Love may be sinking in its orbit. But its network says
it's not. ``Mystery Science Theater 3000,'' in which a man and two
robots stranded in space comically mock bad movies, is returning
for a 10th season and its third year on the Sci-Fi Channel. By
BRUCE WESTBROOK
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-KID-ROCK (HOUSTON) _ Kid Rock, a hybrid of ``Lynyrd
Skynyrd and Run DMC in a blender,'' kicks off a string of U.S. tour
dates beginning this weekend. By JOEY GUERRA

   The Senate at least has brought some decorum and orderliness to
the profligate drive to throw Bill Clinton out of the presidency.
Whether those qualities can endure will remain an open question
until the final gavel, but for these early days of the trial, the
bipartisan compromise on procedures and the unanimous vote for it
stand as moments of political elegance in a time that has seen few
of those.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Senate in the long run is the unholy mess
that the hellbent House has sent over as a supposed impeachment
case. If this were a real trial, with real jurors in a real court
with a real judge, the House's articles would be thrown out faster
than a gutter drunk at the Ritz bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening exchange of briefs, the president's lawyers
easily had the better of their argument with the House's
impeachment managers. Just as the White House complains, the two
articles of impeachment are cast in generalities, not specifics.
That lets the managers keep moving the target; the president's
alleged perjuries and obstructions of justice are only what the
managers say they are at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   This matter has reached its most sober moment, but the
get-Clinton gang continues to act as it has all along, simply
shifting the issue when one of its charges fails to pan out.
Remember last year when it was said the president's fate hung on
the ``talking points''? When it turned out Monica Lewinsky had
written them herself, the president's fate, like an old coat, was
just moved to another peg.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, although the House pointedly rejected an impeachment
article based on Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones case, the
House prosecutors are trying to bootleg that testimony back into
play under cover of the obstruction article.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the House's representatives hesitant to improvise
entirely new games. The House Judiciary Committee Republicans
called no witnesses, relying entirely for their case on the
obviously slanted reading by prosecutor Kenneth Starr of testimony
and other evidence that the defense had had no chance to test
through cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Now the managers insist they must call the witnesses cited in
Starr's referral for Senate testimony _ win or lose then, the
process would be dragged out, to the president's further and
gratuitous embarrassment. More, some have indicated they want to
add new issues and new witnesses, maybe _ or maybe not, others now
say _ concerning Kathleen Willey's muddled claim that Clinton tried
to fondle her.
</P>
<P>
   (If so, they have been, as ever, monumentally aided by Starr,
who has charged the witness who cast doubt on Willey's account with
perjury. It'll be months before that is settled, but meantime
Clinton has been denied a rebuttal witness. Starr says that's
coincidence. You are free to think so if you wish.)
</P>
<P>
   The House's impeachment managers are, in effect, simply making
up their prosecution as they go along and daring the president to
keep up. The poor Senate is hearing a case that would be more at
home in the courtroom of the Red Queen in Alice's Wonderland.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Prosecuting the prosecutors
 &HT;    (EDS: This is the column that normally would move on Monday,
moving today because of the MLK holiday.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps we have Ken Starr's obsessions and excesses to thank,
but for whatever reason there is a boomlet of attention these days
to over-the-top prosecutions _ welcome if it leads to reforms.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the process is still in its Holy Cow! discovery phase,
recently advanced by a chilling Chicago Tribune investigative
series.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are all the more spooky for the severe limits the
report set for itself. It looked only at homicide convictions
thrown out because prosecutors either suppressed evidence favorable
to defendants or knowingly used false evidence. It did not examine
similar missteps in prosecuting other serious crimes or other
prosecutorial misbehaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Even within those narrow straits, going back nationally 36 years
to the seminal Supreme Court ruling outlawing such abuses, the
reporters found 381 homicide convictions thrown out because
prosecutors cheated defendants out of fair trials. And it's a good
guess, approaching a dead cinch, many more railroadings went
unproved or undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven defendants were sentenced to death and at least one
was executed before the prosecutorial misconduct was discovered.
The convicted have served as long as 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   In one case prosecutors depicted paint _ and in another, hog's
blood _ as human blood. Prosecutors have overcome self-defense
arguments by hiding weapons the slain were carrying. One convicted
a woman by hiding evidence her husband committed suicide. Another
prosecuted parents by hiding evidence wild dogs killed their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   And the Tribune series is far from the whole story. PBS's
``Frontline'' did a rip recently on the increasing use of dubious
snitches, typically convicts angling for reduced sentences, to send
marginal drug offenders _ even innocent bystanders _ to prison for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   It was unease with such deals that led a three-judge federal
appellate panel in Denver last year to order a new trial for a
woman convicted of drug charges on the word of a man who has been
promised leniency for his testimony. The judges said the practice,
though common, violated bribery statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The full appellate court has reversed that ruling, but the
exercise will have been helpful if it draws more skeptical scrutiny
to the practice; defense attorneys may start forcing that.
</P>
<P>
   Overwrought prosecution would be cooled, too, if Congress and
the states scaled back the absurdly long sentences they enacted for
drug offenses in political hysteria years ago. The pointless
severity incites unjust bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the courts must begin holding outlaw prosecutors to
serious account. Three in Illinois are on trial for framing a man
who served 10 years in prison _ potentially the first ever to face
felony sentences for such misconduct. Indeed, the Tribune found no
prosecutor has ever been publicly punished by professional
discipline agencies, much less convicted, for withholding evidence
or presenting false evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Overzealous prosecution is due a dose of properly zealous
prosecution.

 &HT;    Even in times of strife, Clinton comes out on top
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Prevailing winds indicate that President Clinton's
public approval will reach 100 percent by the time prosecutors
finish presenting the details of the president's perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a Clinton friend or former business partner gets
indicted or sent to prison, Clinton's approval ratings get a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Clinton is caught in a lie or accused of some new
contemptible behavior, his approval ratings inch upward.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approval ratings went up immediately after he was
impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make any difference if witnesses testify that Clinton
lied under oath or conspired to obstruct justice. Clinton's
approval ratings will only go up.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Americans already think Clinton is untrustworthy and
that he lies whether he is under oath or not. But when it comes to
public approval, that doesn't make any difference. If other
Americans go to prison for doing the exact same thing, it doesn't
make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's principal accuser, squeaky-clean special prosecutor
Ken Starr, suffers with a public approval rating somewhere between
the anti-Christ and the press.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to convince Americans that Clinton is unfit to hold
office, Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich lost his office.
Then Republican Speaker-elect Bob Livingston resigned from the
speakership and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton's Senate trial is over, no one should be
surprised if Clinton is named ``Man of the Year'' by the Christian
Coalition and that Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is
led away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this blind loyalty to a liar and a cheat is a reaction
to even greater disgust with Clinton's Republican accusers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party's public support has slipped to one of the
lowest levels in history.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for the public to be disgusted with the
Republican leaders who have been directing the Clinton attack.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's behavior was so outrageous that he was hauled into
the well of the House and censured for being ethically challenged.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Republicans were accusing Clinton of
misbehavior with Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey and
Monica Lewinsky, the public felt the Republican Party was acting on
behalf of radical-right Christian fundamentalists intent on doing
to America what Ayatollah Khomeini did to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   That's a frightening thought to Americans who hold different
views.
</P>
<P>
   This could explain why Democrats enjoyed the outing of
Republicans who, like Clinton, have committed adultery. It's always
fun to pop holier-than-thou balloons of moral purists.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Speaker-elect Livingston, House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde was outed for a long-ago and far-away
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Point man for outing Republicans has been porn king Larry Flynt,
who also accused Republican Rep. Bob Barr of once being accused of
adultery during a divorce proceeding, which is puny outing.
</P>
<P>
   More substantially, Clinton supporters revealed recently that
Republicans Lott and Barr have given important keynote speeches at
meetings of the pro-white Council of Conservative Citizens, which
appears to be a slightly disguised version of the racist Citizens
Councils described as the white-collar Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders' excuses for their associations with the
CCC sound just as weak as some of Clinton's excuses.
</P>
<P>
   It's all extremely disgusting. A pox on both their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Americans deserve better from their president and from the
president's accusers.

 &HT;    Lighten up, light-footed Clydesdales
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ GRUMP, my new political action group, has taken
off like a scalded dog.
</P>
<P>
   I never dreamed the movement would be so well received. Since
Monday, so many people have picked up their free membership cards
to join Good Riddance to Unrelentingly Morose People that we are
almost out of cards. And there were 300 to start with. So I'm
ordering more cards to meet the overwhelming demand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is much work to be done. GRUMP's goal is to
eliminate humorless behavior around the globe by the year 2000.
And, as you'll see from this next case, we ain't there yet.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Jill Mayfield, who works for the City of Austin's
green building program, called to say she was chapped by the name
``Clydesdale division,'' a category for large runners in
Schlotzsky's Deli Bun Run race. The five-kilometer run will be held
March 20, starting in Zilker Park.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Clydesdale division'' in the Bun Run is for women over 140
pounds and guys over 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jill didn't like the idea of the gravity-challenged being
referred to as Clydesdales, those big, lumbering horses you see in
the Budweiser beer ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought of myself as a quarter horse, well-built but
not thin,'' said Jill, 5-foot-3 and 140 pounds. ``I never thought
of myself as a Clydesdale. I don't know, I think it's kind of
silly. I hate anyone to categorize me because of my weight. I think
that's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   I called Manor Downs, the quarter horse track out in Manor, to
see if Jill, who thinks of herself as a quarter horse, qualifies as
one. She's about the right height.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Hartsfield, the track's office manager, says the average
quarter horse is about 15 hands plus two inches tall. A hand is
four inches. So that means the average quarter horse is about
5-foot-2. Of course, Jill would have to eat quite a few
Schlotzsky's sandwiches to weigh enough to run in the third race at
Manor Downs.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-11 and 215 pounds, being called a Clydesdale doesn't
bother me. The division name for large runners could be a lot
worse.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been me, I would have called it the Hippo Division,
the Front End Loaders or the Jogging Sweathogs.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you don't like the name, don't blame Schlotzsky's.
The name Clydesdales, used in many foot races, was concocted by
large runners so they could level the playing field for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the Clydesdale division is to give large runners
a better shot at winning a trophy, says Paul Carrozza, owner of
Run-Tex, a jogging supply store and one of the Bun Run's sponsors.
It's tough for a big runner to compete with some pencil-necked geek
in the same division.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the distance running world, it makes it harder for them to
run than for somebody's who's lighter,'' Paul said. Besides,
running in the Clydesdale division is optional. They don't put you
on a set of scales before the race starts and say something like,
``Oh my gawd. It's Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of GRUMP, I've got one question, though. How come
there's no special running division for gnomes, those runners with
tiny legs?
</P>
<P>
   There should be. For every 10 steps your 6-foot jogger takes,
your average gnome has to pump out about 147 just to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   I think you gnomes ought to call Schlotzsky's and complain about
the fact that the Bun Run has no gnome division. Stand on each
others' backs and use a pay phone.

 &HT;    Bill Lee's 42 years in Legislature were a blessing for all
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Sooner or later somebody will get around
to making a list of great and influential Georgians of the 20th
century. William J. Lee, of Clayton County, belongs on that list.
</P>
<P>
   For 42 consecutive years, longer than anyone else, Bill Lee sat
in the House of Representatives in the Capitol in Atlanta. In ways
great and small, he made a difference not only in districts he
represented on the south side of town, but also throughout the
state. Governors came and departed. Bill Lee stayed around.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, a legislative body doesn't function exactly as
described in civics class. Georgia's General Assembly has 180
members in the House and 56 in the Senate. But laws are not really
made and passed by the 236 equally. Legislatures, like railroads
and everything else, are run by a few leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lee, from Clayton County, has been one of those leaders.
For 42 years, a good chunk of the state's lifetime, he has been a
power in Georgia's House of Representatives. He has steadied the
course for four speakers and eight governors. His reach extended
far beyond the boundaries of his legislative district, or the
Southside. Hard work, a sense of humor, and a willingness to listen
to constituents go a long way. Those are Bill Lee's hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   It is reasonable to say that in his 42 consecutive years in
office he has had more influence on public policy in this state
than any legislator who ever sat in the General Assembly. It is our
loss that he no longer sits there. ``A great, great, great loss,''
says Terrell Starr, the other half of the Clayton County team that
made up the most powerful one-two punch in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it,'' Bill said over lunch at Butch's in Jonesboro.
``That bug will bite you. It was a big part of my life. But it was
time for me to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking a time to go is a hard thing to do. Bill Lee is only 72,
and vigorous. Maybe he should have stayed to finish out the
century, and maybe not. It's better to leave too soon than to stay
too long. It's like Col. Ed Danforth, my first boss at the
newspaper, told me a long time ago: ``When you go to a party,'' he
said, ``don't be the last one out the door. Pick a time when
everyone is laughing. Then get your hat and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill will be playing a lot more golf, spending quality time with
grandchildren, helping Mary count the waves lapping on the sand at
St. Simons and, if he feels like it, doing a little consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Between the vegetable plate and coffee at Butch's, he was kind
enough to answer a few questions.
</P>
<P>
   If you had only one sentence to say about each of the eight
governors you've served under, what would you say?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd begin by saying I considered each and every one of them my
friend, and that I enjoyed my service with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Vandiver: ``A true Southern gentleman, he stands tall in
addressing the serious challenges facing our state during his
tenure, such as school integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Griffin: ``A great stump speaker who could charm a crowd
with the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sanders: ``Most progressive during that period in our
state's history, and who governed with class and style.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Maddox: ``Thank you, Governor Maddox, for understanding
that the General Assembly needed its independence from the
executive branch, which was gained from your term in office, and
was good for Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter: ``A keen mind with a strong will to succeed who
made reorganization of state government his cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   George Busbee: ``His slogan, `a workhorse, not a show horse,'
describes him well as a hands-on, everyday, detailed individual who
ran the state extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Frank Harris: ``Dedicated religious gentleman who governed
under the Golden Rule of `Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you,' and who genuinely cared for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Zell Miller: ``He's set a pattern tough to follow, with many
accomplishments that make a real difference for all Georgians; he
scores extremely high in my judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   What would you say about Georgia's new governor?
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy Barnes has a head full of sense. He is a fast learner. He
will be an outstanding chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Would you say that Georgia is fortunate to have had unusually
good governors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly agree. I'd also point out that one reason
this is true is that so many of them became governor after service
in the General Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   You are saying that legislative experience molds good public
servants?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. And it's interesting to note that every Democrat elected
to statewide office in last November's elections has experience in
the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   You were a confidant of the Speaker and one of his closest
allies. What is your capsule view of Tom Murphy?
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong leader, a complex individual, a dear friend who loves
this state _ always helping those less fortunate and/or in need _
for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration. Tough in the
trenches, often misunderstood and always with his heart in the
right place.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the biggest change in the General Assembly and in state
government in your time in office?
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislative independence from the executive branch; reducing
the House from 205 members to 180; representation based on one
person, one vote; better tools to do the job; rapidly increasing
budget requirements to meet needs and constant struggle to maintain
a fair tax base under growing circumstances and more complex issues
facing the state each year.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you consider your greatest accomplishments in 42 years
in office?
</P>
<P>
   ``Establishing credibility with my constituents and within the
General Assembly and in state government. Striving to work in
harmony with all factions and gaining tenure that enabled me to
fill positions of leadership that put me in a position to meet
established goals of effective and responsible representation.''
</P>
<P>
   What was you biggest disappointment?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being unable to spend more time with constituents. A lot of
time is consumed by legislative responsibilities, and legislators
have to work to provide for families. I am especially grateful for
the generosity of Norfolk Southern in allowing me a lot of time to
devote to legislative affairs and to constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   What is your advice to freshmen members of the General Assembly
sworn in this month?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay in touch with constituents. Be a good listener. Quickly
learn rules and procedures. Use careful judgment in actions and in
words.''
</P>
<P>
   What is your advice to Georgia Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultivate better communication with new people moving here, be
willing to make needed change, stick to issues uppermost on
peoples' minds, and continue to build on the phenomenal record
established over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   What is your advice to Georgia Republicans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exercise less partisan posturing for purely political purposes
and get on board with agenda items that are good for all Georgians
and do not have a partisan flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   What is your advice to voters?
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep informed on issues and express views and opinions to
elected representatives, so that the representatives will be in a
position to reflect their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   What will be the biggest challenge in the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
   ``Insuring continued prosperity with balanced growth and job
opportunities throughout the state. Encouraging qualified people to
offer for public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything else you'd like to say?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good ride. I'm going to miss the Legislature, and
I'm grateful for the opportunity afforded me to participate in
Georgia's programs and history over these past 42 years.''

   ATLANTA _ People often say they'd love to work wood but they
just don't have any talent. I tell them they don't need talent. All
they need, in addition to a real commitment, is patience and sharp
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Patience simply means that you have to do it right; you can't
get in a hurry and start doing things the quick way instead of the
right way.
</P>
<P>
   The part about sharp tools can be a bigger problem. For those
who like to divide the world's population into two parts, one
criterion can be those who can sharpen anything and those who don't
even know what sharp is.
</P>
<P>
   When I began woodworking, I was among the latter. I would
sharpen a plane iron until my fingers were stiff, and it still
wouldn't cut. It would seem fine to me; it would take little
shavings off the back of a fingernail, but it wouldn't take a
shaving off a walnut board.
</P>
<P>
   I can vaguely recall trotting down to Highland Hardware _ I live
but a mile and a half from this woodworker's emporium _ thrusting a
plane iron at Zach Etheridge and demanding to know why it wouldn't
raise a shaving.
</P>
<P>
   Zach, who falls into that half of the population which can
sharpen a butter knife in six strokes, said ``Because it's dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Having this certification, appeasing my suspicion that the iron
was a practical joke made of a metal guaranteed to remain
perpetually blunt, I went home and started over.
</P>
<P>
   I was using artificial Japanese waterstones. I still use them.
I'm sure diamond stones have a lot of adherents now, but they had
not appeared then and since I have a good set of waterstones,
there's no point in changing. Besides, diamond sharpening blocks
big enough to handle a large plane iron tend to be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   So the stones weren't the problem. I was using them properly,
keeping them good and wet.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, obviously, was the angle at which I was holding the
tool to the stone. It takes a certain inherent knack, or an awful
lot of practice, to learn how to keep a tool at just the right
angle freehand. I suspect the bevel on my tools was more of a
semicircle than an angle.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came during a seminar given by the noted
woodworker-author Mark Duginske. When he reached a point where his
chisel needed to be sharpened, he reached into his tool box and
pulled out a sharpening jig, which he proceeded to use right there
in front of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   I somehow had it in my head that using one of these jigs was
like belching at the dinner table; a sure sign of bad character and
poor upbringing. But here was this big-time woodworker doing it,
without any excuse and without even seeming embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a Veritas sharpening jig, and I've had no problems
getting a good edge ever since then. I really admire those folks
who can sharpen a blade without a jig, but I've come to realize
that it's the result that counts, not how you achieve it.

 &HT;    Poll-sitting not the prime ingredient for good leader
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Bill Clinton is our first truly ``poll-ar''
president.
</P>
<P>
   I've no doubt that earlier presidents from George Bush to even
Harry Truman (who had good reason to doubt the ``scientific''
sample) paid strong attention to polls, but no one pores over them
like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His entire presidency has been one of floating trial balloons,
checking the polls, then making his move. You would be hard-pressed
to find many of those moves that went against the polls.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not really surprising that he has used his approval
rating and the polls showing that the public is against his removal
as one of his primary reasons why he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't want it, so don't do it,'' has essentially
been the message.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is balderdash.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I doubt the accuracy of the polls. I believe they
reflect _ within a small margin of error _ exactly what the
American people think. I'm confident of Clinton's high approval
rating and sure that Americans _ by a wide margin _ do not want him
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, I'd tell you that I could be counted in that group.
Clinton's behavior sickens me, but lying about sex, under oath or
otherwise, is no reason to remove a duly-elected president.
</P>
<P>
   But the art of governing, of true statesmanship, is not about
just doing what the people want.
</P>
<P>
   Polls may be scientific, but they reflect nothing more than
popular opinion at the moment at which they were taken. Pollsters
are trained to do these surveys quickly, within a matter of
minutes. Those questioned cannot say, ``Hmmm, let me think about
that question and get back to you tomorrow.'' The pollster wants
his answer now.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by polls amounts to mob rule in the electronic age. The
mob doesn't think much about what it is doing, but moves on emotion
and whim. Just because the mob wants to do something, it doesn't
mean that is the right thing to do, even if the feeling is
unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   This came through to me clearly over the holiday when I was
looking at some old issues of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. I was
looking at some papers in the early '60s when I ran across a story
about the National Guard being called out to help black students
enter some university in the South.
</P>
<P>
   What caught my eye was in the third paragraph of the story. A
national polling firm had contacted residents of their state to
find out what the people thought about blacks going to the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Of those responding, 61 percent opposed allowing blacks to
enter. Only about 20 percent approved of the move and the rest were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent. That is not much different from the
president's approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, convinced that they were doing right (and they were)
federal elected and appointed officials kept right at it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure, being human, they had to worry about those polls every
now and then, but they did what had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The majority isn't always right, it is just the biggest group.
It takes real leaders to stand up against a majority which is
clearly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I just wish I could believe that those now bedeviling Bill
Clinton are doing so because they they are fighting for right
instead of fighting for their right to political revenge.

 &HT;    Cedar fever has Central Texas noses on the run
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; CHART information at end of file
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's sniff that time of sniff year again.
Sniffle.
</P>
<P>
   Your co-workers and friends are red-eyed and bleary, Kleenex is
flying off the shelves at the H-E-B, Cliff Morris announces the
pollen count in a tone usually reserved for natural disasters, and
miserable people crowd Tex-Mex restaurants slurping tortilla soup
in the faint hope that it will clear their sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things we love about Central Texas is its mostly
temperate climate. But that makes this practically the only place
in the United States where mountain cedar, Juniperus ashei, can
pollinate all winter long. That's why we're all sneezing and
congested from cedar fever, an allergy to cedar pollen, which
strikes widely and severely this time of year, peaking around Dec.
31 and not tapering off until February or early March. If your eyes
are red and itchy and your nose won't stop running, you're likely a
cedar victim.
</P>
<P>
   There's a little silver lining to this pollen-filled cloud. If
you're allergic to mold spores, they're low right now (as opposed
to during August). It's only the cedar that's making you miserable.
It's a good thing that Christmas is over, too, because live
Christmas trees made a bad thing worse, giving off an irritant that
can further aggravate your eyes and nose.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar ``can disturb your work, pleasure, sleep, everything,''
says Narendra
</P>
<P>
   Punjabi, allergist with the Austin Allergy &AMP; Asthma Center. ``It
can disturb your life.'' He and Dennis Dyer, with Austin Allergy
Associates, gave us information for this guide. They recommend
seeing a physician before your symptoms worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Once you see an allergist, one of the first things he or she
will probably do is test you to see what you're allergic to, and
how severe your allergy is. They may do a skin test, where you are
given tiny pinpricks, or a blood test.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more common Central Texas allergies, in addition to
cedar fever and molds, are to elm, ragweed, grass and dust mites.
</P>
<P>
   A physician will recommend a treatment based on your test
results. Many insurance companies cover allergy treatments,
including testing, shots and prescription medications, although
some require a referral from a primary-care physician. If you don't
have coverage, there will be fees for the office visit, for the
tests and for the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   If your allergy is not too severe, an allergist might recommend
Claritin or another prescription antihistamine, which many people
find helpful. If you have an extremely severe allergy, they might
suggest allergy shots, which may eventually eliminate your
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A guide to Austin allergies
</P>
<P>
   _ Symptoms: Itchy, red eyes; runny or clogged nose; fatigue,
difficulty sleeping and occasionally asthma.
</P>
<P>
   _ Over the counter medications: Dimetapp, Benadryl, Tavist D,
although these frequently make people sleepy. Doctors recommend you
take them at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prescription medications: Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec and
others, which reportedly do not make most people drowsy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prescription nasal steroids: Flonase or Nasonex.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cortisone: An injection can offer quick relief for many
allergy sufferers. Ask your physician about side effects, although
they will probably be minimal if you only have one shot. The shots
run about $35; many insurance companies will cover it. You can get
a shot at your allergist's office.
</P>
<P>
   _ Immunotherapy: Regular allergy shots _ once or twice a week
for three to five years _ can initiate ``blocking antibodies'' that
may eventually eliminate your symptoms and cure your allergy.

<P>
   Tips for fighting cedar fever
</P>
<P>
   _ Pollen is the worst in the early morning. Try to limit your
time outside between 5 and 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dry, windy days are worst; rainy and windless days best. Take
advantage of drizzly, damp days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your house as pollen-free as possible. Shut windows and
doors. Run the air conditioner or heater to bring in filtered air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exercise indoors if your allergies can't be treated with
medication.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your car windows rolled up and the air conditioner on,
even on nice days.
</P>
<P>
   How do you tell it's an allergy and not a cold or the flu?
</P>
<P>
   _ You won't have fever. Despite its name, cedar fever _ and
other allergies _ never cause fever, Punjabi says. Also, allergies
last longer than 10 days. And eye irritation is more likely to be
caused by allergies than colds or flu.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colds and the flu sometimes cause fever and are frequently
accompanied by muscular aches. They last seven to 10 days, then go
away by themselves.

 &HT;    RELIGIOUS REVIVAL DEEPENS IN CUBA ONE YEAR AFTER POPE'S HISTORIC
VISIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ At an Assembly of God church here, hundreds of
impassioned Pentecostals sing hymns, shout ``Amens,'' and praise
the Lord with such fervor even the most ardent atheist could be
sold on the joy of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   With broad smiles on their faces and their arms stretched toward
heaven -- or in this case a pale-green ceiling that's peeling paint
-- this crowd of raucous Cubans appears to need their religion the
way they need sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The religious revival at the church is so great pastors now hold
worship services four days a week to accommodate new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I preach on the streets to homosexuals and prostitutes, or
anyone who'll listen,'' exclaimed Janne Prado(CQ), 27, one of the
church's 600 members. ``God is a presence that has transformed me,
and I want to share that with others.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Marxist country that didn't even allow Christians to join
the Communist Party until 1991, such talk might seem anathema.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years -- and especially since Pope John Paul II
made his historic visit here last January -- the government of
President Fidel Castro has eased its hard-line political stance and
allowed churches to enjoy more freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there is good communication between the state and all
religious denominations,'' said Roberto de Armas, a government
spokesman. ``More than that, religious groups are consulted about
matters of national importance.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said church leaders were consulted in December
before the Cuban government announced the reinstatement of
Christmas as an official holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba watchers say a rapprochement between the church and the
government has been developing since 1984, when the Rev. Jesse
Jackson visited Cuba and convinced Castro to attend a church
service with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's visit drew the world's attention to Cuba, and
improved the relationship even more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on this island of 12 million people, there's been no
sweeping, systemic change, no crack in the one-party system that
for decades has closely controlled religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has made small, steady concession to the
Catholic Church and other groups, particularly over the past year.
Some concessions more distinguishable than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a slow widening of the parameters for the
practice of religion,'' said Wayne Smith, who headed the U.S.
Interests Section here during the Carter administration. ``Human
rights activists say they feel less pressure than they did in
previous years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many religious and human rights activists now have phone lines
-- even fax lines -- and are able to make international calls
without interruptions from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Those activists say the number of political prisoners held in
Cuban prisons has fallen from more than 1,000 two years ago to only
300 or 400 today.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the government has approved entry visas for 40
foreign nuns and priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of priests in Cuba is constantly growing and now
totals more than 300 for the first time in 39 years,'' said Orlando
Marquez, a Catholic Church spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are also easily discernible.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through this old capitol city of new hotels and ancient
plazas one sees far fewer prostitutes on the streets than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   After the pope's visit, the police shooed most of them away.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Malone, an expert on Cuba at Georgetown University in
Washington, said he's seen a rise in religious newsletters and
magazines since the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One change I see is that there are now more than 20 Catholic
publications in Cuba, some of which publish fairly controversial
articles that analyze social issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most vital for the people themselves is that Cubans are
no longer afraid to wear crosses around their necks, and they are
no longer afraid of being questioned about their religious beliefs
when applying for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the changes since the pope's visit are not visible on
the outside, but are internal feelings that people have, feelings
of not having fear,'' said the Rev. Hector Mendez, pastor at the
First Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   He said a huge first-of-its-kind Protestant rally is being
planned this summer in a baseball stadium here.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite several concessions, there's still no sign of
inherent change here.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cuba experts say that in recent months, the communist
government has even made new efforts to snuff out attempts by
dissidents to voice opposition to Castro's regime.
</P>
<P>
   They point to an incident in December when authorities cracked
down on dissidents planning to hold a pro-human rights meeting in a
Havana park on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   They sealed off the venue with police barriers and overshadowed
the event by staging a pro-government rally nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no talk about fundamental change, and any changes
that have occurred are merely cosmetic,'' said Mariela Ferreti, a
spokeswoman for the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami,
the most powerful anti-Castro exile group.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, some experts say Castro -- not the Cuban people --
came out the big winner as a result of the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   During his five-day visit, the first pope to set foot on Cuban
soil urged the world to open up to Cuba -- and open it has.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Cuban leader's dark-suit diplomacy this past
year has drawn all sorts of important visitors to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, for example, Castro is hosting Colombian President
Andres Pastrana and Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Spain's King Juan Carlos is scheduled to visit.
</P>
<P>
   In general, while a new atmosphere of openness and reform has
developed in some cases since the pope's visit, the government's
tight rein on religion hasn't been loosened completely.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when pastors at the Assembly of God church were
asked to comment about religion in Cuba, the answer was a fast,
definite ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's told us not to speak with the press,''
explained one pastor matter-of-factly, with a shrug. ``So if the
government tells us not to do it, we don't.''

 &HT;    CHINESE LEADERS EXPECTING AN UNUSUALLY DANGEROUS YEAR
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (k) Commentary
categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Jan. 17 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ ``Study, study, and study again,'' Chinese President
Jiang Zemin admonished his high-ranking listeners behind the gates
of the Central Committee Party School.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, China's ruling elite sat at the head of
glorified classrooms on the northern fringe of Beijing and lectured
senior Communist Party officials from across China. The party
``could lose the support of the Chinese people'' if it doesn't
perform better, Jiang said in his final summation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Committee's Party School, near the old imperial
Summer Palace, is a main drivewheel of the Communist Party's
ideological transmission belt to the heartland. In coming weeks,
audiences from the top-level retreat can be expected to drum out
the same jarring warnings to thousands of lower-ranking cadres at
the network of regional party schools scattered nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weeks, Jiang's message, both in public and
private, has been that 1999 looms as an unusually dangerous year
for the internal stability of China and its 53 million-member
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its
head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud,'' as Jiang put it in
a chilling televised warning to his countrymen on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jiang never said so out loud, China's leaders are clearly
nervous as they face a calendar jammed with politically sensitive
anniversaries in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tibetan dissidents will lament the 40th anniversary of
the abortive uprising that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama. On
June 4, pro-democracy advocates now in exile, and perhaps some
inside China, will bemoan the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square massacre. Then on October 1, China will glorify 50 years
under communist rule, an occasion that may require soul-searching
by party leaders about whether to de-mythologize their brutal and
erratic founding father, the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper source of worry is that after 20 years, China's rocket
burst of economic growth is finally showing signs of flaming out.
As growth slows, there are likely to be fewer and fewer new jobs to
satisfy tens of millions of laid-off urban workers and able-bodied
villagers no longer needed on the farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Weighed down by the Asian economic crisis, its own dinosaur
state industries and its barely solvent banking system, China has
seen its growth rates gradually dip from spectacular double-digits
in the early 1990s to 9.6 percent in 1996, 8.8 percent in 1997, and
no more than 7.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even optimists are expecting growth to slide further
-- with unpleasant consequences. ``At present, our economy hasn't
reached the trough,'' said Beijing University professor Zhang Xue
Bin in an interview with the Cox News Service. ``It is possible
that our economic growth rate will become even lower this year.
Therefore, it is possible that more people will be laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's recently-published book, whose title in English is ``The
Danger Time of the Reform,'' warns that China faces a ``battle of
decisive significance.'' Four critical dangers that have not been
well-addressed, he wrote, are ``social chaos'' arising from poverty
in the countryside, ``very serious'' official corruption, a drop in
the economic growth rate and growing critiques by communist
hard-liners opposed to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, China unleashed an emergency three-year, $1.2
trillion package of highway, dam and other government construction
projects in an effort reminiscent of the American New Deal
pump-priming to head off a full-scale economic slump. But even the
government's loyal academic experts like Zhang wonder whether China
can spend enough to head off restiveness among more than 20 million
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China's economic stimulus plan has placed extra
financial pressures on the nation's already thinly capitalized
state banks, notes Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have purchased higher growth in the short run at the
price of a larger problem of bank recapitalization in the future,''
Lardy said in an e-mail interview with Cox News Service. ``And
postponing dealing with the underlying problems in the financial
sector increases the risk that there will be a financial meltdown.
The risk is probably still low but the key thing is that it is
rising.''
</P>
<P>
   As has often happened in the last half-century when Beijing's
leaders felt threatened by economic or other internal difficulties,
they reacted last month by ordering a crackdown on the latest
sproutings of political dissent within the intellectual elite.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief target was the China Democracy Party, a would-be
opposition political party with a few hundred armchair activists.
Though it had achieved some notice among Westerners by trying to
register as an approved political party, it posed no perceptible
threat to the communist party's grip on power. It had attracted
virtually no attention among ordinary Chinese, largely because the
official media never covered it.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless or not, on December 21, a Chinese court imposed an
11-year prison sentence on Wang Youcai, the 32-year-old activist
who last summer petitioned authorities to register the China
Democracy Party as an official entity. Wang, who had also
participated as an obscure student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square uprising, was convicted in a blare of publicity of
``attempting to overthrow state power.''
</P>
<P>
   At least five other organizers were quickly imprisoned, and five
others were placed under house arrest or in police custody. Two
identifiable leaders -- Xu Wenli, 55, and Qin Yongmin, 45, both
veterans of the abortive Democracy Wall protests of the late 1970s
-- were given sentences of 13 and 12 years after hasty, heavily
publicized trials.
</P>
<P>
   By Chinese standards, perhaps the most curious aspect of the
crackdown was that the authorities went out of their way to call
attention to the dissidents through heavy publicity about their
punishments. It was as if the communist hierarchy wanted to signal
other potential troublemakers that this is a year when even the
mildest forms of protest will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that the government was not terribly
worried about a few dissidents saying things to each other,'' said
Boston University's China watcher Joseph Fewsmith, who was in
Beijing for meetings with Chinese academic colleagues. ``What they
(the government) are terribly worried about is the prospect of a
few dissidents trying to organize laid-off workers. That is the
sort of thing they really want to nip in the bud.''

<P>
   LONDON _ In a modern mid-rise a short walk from Big Ben, Reed
Elsevier's management team is bracing for Year Two of perhaps the
most turbulent period in the venture's five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Year One -- 1998 -- finally is over.
</P>
<P>
   During the year, Reed Elsevier's run of extraordinary success
ended as the company was buffeted by a variety of challenges as
diverse as the Asian economic crisis and the increased
competitiveness in the U.S. electronic publishing business.
Meanwhile, the company tampered with its corporate strategy -- a
move that required divestiture and huge reinvestment -- while
discarding and replacing the two-headed management structure that
had led to its success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finding a single chief executive is regarded by many as the
key to navigating the company out of last year's turbulent economic
and market waters.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, that turbulence claimed its price: The
company reported that it expected a hefty 6 percent decrease in
pre-tax profits in 1998 compared to 1997. While analysts knew that
Reed Elsevier was encountering some problems, most were surprised
by the extent of the company's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew profits would be down,'' Louise Barton, an analyst
with Henderson Crosthwaite, said when the report came out. ``It's
the scale of the downturn that's the surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of Europe's most predictable media players was
showing signs of erratic behavior for the first time in its
five-year run. The company, which employs 27,000 people worldwide,
was formed in 1993 in a joint venture of the well-established firms
of Reed International, of London. and Elsevier, headquartered in
Amsterdam. The company has a huge portfolio of business, science
and trade publications such as ``Variety,'' ``Publishers Weekly''
and ``The Lancet.'' The Dayton, Ohio-based company also owns
Lexis-Nexis, the powerhouse electronic service that provides legal
and business information to more than 1.25 million U.S.
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio had performed well, jumping from $1.14 billion in
1995 pre-tax profits to $1.35 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then came 1998. ``Certainly 1998 was a year of transition,''
Mark Armour, the company's chief financial officer, told the Cox
News Service. ``There were a number of significant issues that
affected the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, chief among these ``issues'' was:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A declining global economy -- particularly in Asia -- softened
demand for the company's business and travel publications;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lexis-Nexis struggled against its chief competitor Thomson
Corp. and its Westlaw online legal services causing
lower-than-expected sales;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reed Elsevier's decision to pull out of the consumer
publishing business -- a move that led to its selling IPC
Magazines, the leading publisher in Britain with 69 titles
including Marie Clare and TV Times, for $1.4 billion;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And at the same time, the company began pouring money into
electronic publishing, boosting its investment by 20 percent to
about $170 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   All this added up to a sluggish performance for investors and
expressions of concern on the street. The British half of the
Anglo-Dutch partnership, Reed International, was the sixth worst
performer on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100. Elsevier, the
Dutch half, performed slightly worse on the Dutch exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Armour believes a brief downturn is an acceptable price to pay.
``We have continued to make the investments in products and in our
operating infrastructure in order to position the company well for
a future in which electronic publishing will be an increasingly
important component,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company would have looked better on paper if it had reduced
its investment in electronic publishing, but Armour said that such
a move would not have been in the company's long-term interests.
``It would be very easy to turn the taps off on investments,'' he
said. ``But it's important that we make investments now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the investments was the acquisition of legal publisher
Matthew Bender &AMP; Co., which is expected to boost Lexis-Nexis and
stem the loss of market share to the more aggressive Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of tough competition from the Internet, Reed
Elsevier also intends to stabilize declining sales in its travel
publications division -- which include hotel and airline guides --
by spending more on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much of the company's fate rests with the
yet-to-be hired chief executive officer, analysts say. In a
generally applauded move, the company in August said it was ending
its double-headed management structure topped by co-chairmen Nigel
Stapleton of Reed and Herman Bruggink of Elsevier in favor of a
more conventional single CEO structure. Both men immediately
withdrew from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been secretive about the search. ``Don't worry,
when it's time to push the white smoke out, we will let everyone
know,'' Armour said.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts expect the new CEO to be named before summer,
perhaps before the scheduled March 11 update on the company's 1998
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Because media conglomerates such as Reed Elsevier are entering
new frontiers with electronic publishing, it is acutely important
that the company's leader is capable of performing as a pioneer,
said Meg Geldens, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much change in the industry, mainly technological
change,'' she said. ``You need someone with a good understanding of
how to compete, to deal with the rapid change in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a difficult job to fill. In addition to the
challenges of operating a global business on the cutting edge, the
company still is governed largely by separate boards in Amsterdam
and London, even though the parent company has a board of its own.
Seeking harmony from three boards of directors will require someone
of considerable political skill and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   The company is thought to be looking for someone with strong
marketing skills to develop the business primarily by improving
sales of its existing brands rather than primarily through
acquisition. ``It's likely to be somebody who has not just
traditional publishing experience,'' Geldens said. ``I wouldn't be
surprised if it's somebody from the Internet or electronic
publishing field. And then again, they could bring somebody from
outside the industry altogether -- a brilliant visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to preserve the sometimes tense Anglo-Dutch
balance in the company, it also is widely speculated that the
company may go with an American chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Richards, an analyst at West LB Panmure, said Reed
Elsevier's best-case scenario would have the new CEO arriving with
a blaze of innovation and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``it is much more likely that a new manager
will take six or nine months settling in, there will be drift and
increasingly people will question the investment in electronic
products.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects that a new CEO can cause an overnight
turnaround, a smart acquisition or two could improve things
greatly, analysts say. The company suffered a substantial loss of
confidence in the investor community last year when its planned
merger with the Dutch legal publisher Wolters Kluwer foundered on
regulatory grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that deal is truly dead -- and Reed Elsevier says it is
-- the company still sees a number of possible acquisition targets
and has plenty of balance-sheet capacity to pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still an acquisitive company,'' Armour said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Reed Elsevier itself will be gobbled up by
another company, despite rumors in the fall that Microsoft Corp.
was looking at spending nearly $12 billion to purchase it.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a natural fit: Microsoft supplies Reed Elsevier some
systems support in exchange for some of Reed's information
services.
</P>
<P>
   While Reed Elsevier refuses to comment on what it describes as
``market rumors,'' Microsoft has denied it intended to buy the
company. Analysts generally doubted the deal was for real. ``People
just mention Microsoft because it is one of the few companies big
enough to even discuss buying Reed Elsevier,'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems unlikely that Reed Elsevier will sell more of its
core businesses, particularly Lexis-Nexis. ``Even though that's one
of the units that is facing some competitive challenges, I think,
at least for the time being, it's part of the family --
particularly with the investment in Matthew Bender.'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very balanced portfolio of strong brands,'' said
Armour, who refused to speculate on whether any of the divisions is
likely to be sold any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Armour believes that many of the negative factors from
1998 were one-time events, there is no reason to expect a dramatic
change in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weakening economic conditions will continue to have effects on
our business,'' Armour predicted, adding however, that Reed
Elsevier ``will continue to invest in our businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And analysts also are looking toward the new millennium for
signs of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the costly period of investment in electronic publishing
have the desired impact in terms of accelerated revenue growth?''
asked Richard Dale of Salomon Smith Barney. ``The answer, I think,
is it will, but it won't manifest itself until the year 2000.''

   LONDON _ In a modern mid-rise a short walk from Big Ben, Reed
Elsevier's management team is bracing for Year Two of perhaps the
most turbulent period in the venture's five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Year One -- 1998 -- finally is over.
</P>
<P>
   During the year, Reed Elsevier's run of extraordinary success
ended as the company was buffeted by a variety of challenges as
diverse as the Asian economic crisis and the increased
competitiveness in the U.S. electronic publishing business.
Meanwhile, the company tampered with its corporate strategy -- a

</P>

   Now, finding a single chief executive is regarded by many as the

</P>
<P>
   In early December, that turbulence claimed its price: The
company reported that it expected a hefty 6 percent decrease in
pre-tax profits in 1998 compared to 1997. While analysts knew that
Reed Elsevier was encountering some problems, most were surprised
by the extent of the company's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew profits would be down,'' Louise Barton, an analyst

the scale of the downturn that's the surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of Europe's most predictable media players was
showing signs of erratic behavior for the first time in its
five-year run. The company, which employs 27,000 people worldwide,
was formed in 1993 in a joint venture of the well-established firms

and ``The Lancet.'' The Dayton, Ohio-based company also owns
Lexis-Nexis, the powerhouse electronic service that provides legal

</P>
<P>
   The portfolio had performed well, jumping from $1.14 billion in
1995 pre-tax profits to $1.35 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then came 1998. ``Certainly 1998 was a year of transition,''
Mark Armour, the company's chief financial officer, told the Cox
News Service. ``There were a number of significant issues that
affected the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, chief among these ``issues'' was:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A declining global economy -- particularly in Asia -- softened
demand for the company's business and travel publications;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lexis-Nexis struggled against its chief competitor Thomson

lower-than-expected sales;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reed Elsevier's decision to pull out of the consumer
publishing business -- a move that led to its selling IPC
Magazines, the leading publisher in Britain with 69 titles
including Marie Clare and TV Times, for $1.4 billion;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And at the same time, the company began pouring money into
electronic publishing, boosting its investment by 20 percent to
about $170 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   All this added up to a sluggish performance for investors and
expressions of concern on the street. The British half of the
Anglo-Dutch partnership, Reed International, was the sixth worst
performer on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100. Elsevier, the
Dutch half, performed slightly worse on the Dutch exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Armour believes a brief downturn is an acceptable price to pay.
``We have continued to make the investments in products and in our
operating infrastructure in order to position the company well for
a future in which electronic publishing will be an increasingly
important component,'' he said.
</P>

a move would not have been in the company's long-term interests.
``It would be very easy to turn the taps off on investments,'' he
said. ``But it's important that we make investments now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the investments was the acquisition of legal publisher
Matthew Bender &AMP; Co., which is expected to boost Lexis-Nexis and
stem the loss of market share to the more aggressive Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of tough competition from the Internet, Reed
Elsevier also intends to stabilize declining sales in its travel
publications division -- which include hotel and airline guides --
by spending more on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much of the company's fate rests with the

   While Reed Elsevier refuses to comment on what it describes as
``market rumors,'' Microsoft has denied it intended to buy the
company. Analysts generally doubted the deal was for real. ``People
just mention Microsoft because it is one of the few companies big
enough to even discuss buying Reed Elsevier,'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems unlikely that Reed Elsevier will sell more of its
core businesses, particularly Lexis-Nexis. ``Even though that's one
of the units that is facing some competitive challenges, I think,
at least for the time being, it's part of the family --
particularly with the investment in Matthew Bender.'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very balanced portfolio of strong brands,'' said
Armour, who refused to speculate on whether any of the divisions is
likely to be sold any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Armour believes that many of the negative factors from
1998 were one-time events, there is no reason to expect a dramatic
change in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weakening economic conditions will continue to have effects on
our business,'' Armour predicted, adding however, that Reed
Elsevier ``will continue to invest in our businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And analysts also are looking toward the new millennium for
signs of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the costly period of investment in electronic publishing
have the desired impact in terms of accelerated revenue growth?''
asked Richard Dale of Salomon Smith Barney. ``The answer, I think,
is it will, but it won't manifest itself until the year 2000.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ ``Study, study, and study again,'' Chinese President
Jiang Zemin admonished his high-ranking listeners behind the gates
of the Central Committee Party School.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, China's ruling elite sat at the head of
glorified classrooms on the northern fringe of Beijing and lectured
senior Communist Party officials from across China. The party
``could lose the support of the Chinese people'' if it doesn't
perform better, Jiang said in his final summation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Committee's Party School, near the old imperial
Summer Palace, is a main drivewheel of the Communist Party's
ideological transmission belt to the heartland. In coming weeks,
audiences from the top-level retreat can be expected to drum out
the same jarring warnings to thousands of lower-ranking cadres at
the network of regional party schools scattered nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weeks, Jiang's message, both in public and
private, has been that 1999 looms as an unusually dangerous year
for the internal stability of China and its 53 million-member
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its
head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud,'' as Jiang put it in
a chilling televised warning to his countrymen on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jiang never said so out loud, China's leaders are clearly
nervous as they face a calendar jammed with politically sensitive
anniversaries in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tibetan dissidents will lament the 40th anniversary of
the abortive uprising that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama. On
June 4, pro-democracy advocates now in exile, and perhaps some
inside China, will bemoan the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square massacre. Then on October 1, China will glorify 50 years
under communist rule, an occasion that may require soul-searching
by party leaders about whether to de-mythologize their brutal and
erratic founding father, the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper source of worry is that after 20 years, China's rocket
burst of economic growth is finally showing signs of flaming out.
As growth slows, there are likely to be fewer and fewer new jobs to
satisfy tens of millions of laid-off urban workers and able-bodied
villagers no longer needed on the farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Weighed down by the Asian economic crisis, its own dinosaur
state industries and its barely solvent banking system, China has
seen its growth rates gradually dip from spectacular double-digits
in the early 1990s to 9.6 percent in 1996, 8.8 percent in 1997, and
no more than 7.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even optimists are expecting growth to slide further
-- with unpleasant consequences. ``At present, our economy hasn't
reached the trough,'' said Beijing University professor Zhang Xue
Bin in an interview with the Cox News Service. ``It is possible
that our economic growth rate will become even lower this year.
Therefore, it is possible that more people will be laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's recently-published book, whose title in English is ``The
Danger Time of the Reform,'' warns that China faces a ``battle of
decisive significance.'' Four critical dangers that have not been
well-addressed, he wrote, are ``social chaos'' arising from poverty
in the countryside, ``very serious'' official corruption, a drop in
the economic growth rate and growing critiques by communist
hard-liners opposed to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, China unleashed an emergency three-year, $1.2
trillion package of highway, dam and other government construction
projects in an effort reminiscent of the American New Deal
pump-priming to head off a full-scale economic slump. But even the
government's loyal academic experts like Zhang wonder whether China
can spend enough to head off restiveness among more than 20 million
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China's economic stimulus plan has placed extra
financial pressures on the nation's already thinly capitalized
state banks, notes Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have purchased higher growth in the short run at the
price of a larger problem of bank recapitalization in the future,''
Lardy said in an e-mail interview with Cox News Service. ``And
postponing dealing with the underlying problems in the financial
sector increases the risk that there will be a financial meltdown.
The risk is probably still low but the key thing is that it is
rising.''
</P>
<P>
   As has often happened in the last half-century when Beijing's
leaders felt threatened by economic or other internal difficulties,
they reacted last month by ordering a crackdown on the latest
sproutings of political dissent within the intellectual elite.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief target was the China Democracy Party, a would-be
opposition political party with a few hundred armchair activists.
Though it had achieved some notice among Westerners by trying to
register as an approved political party, it posed no perceptible
threat to the communist party's grip on power. It had attracted
virtually no attention among ordinary Chinese, largely because the
official media never covered it.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless or not, on December 21, a Chinese court imposed an
11-year prison sentence on Wang Youcai, the 32-year-old activist
who last summer petitioned authorities to register the China
Democracy Party as an official entity. Wang, who had also
participated as an obscure student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square uprising, was convicted in a blare of publicity of
``attempting to overthrow state power.''
</P>
<P>
   At least five other organizers were quickly imprisoned, and five
others were placed under house arrest or in police custody. Two
identifiable leaders -- Xu Wenli, 55, and Qin Yongmin, 45, both
veterans of the abortive Democracy Wall protests of the late 1970s
-- were given sentences of 13 and 12 years after hasty, heavily
publicized trials.
</P>
<P>
   By Chinese standards, perhaps the most curious aspect of the
crackdown was that the authorities went out of their way to call
attention to the dissidents through heavy publicity about their
punishments. It was as if the communist hierarchy wanted to signal
other potential troublemakers that this is a year when even the
mildest forms of protest will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that the government was not terribly
worried about a few dissidents saying things to each other,'' said
Boston University's China watcher Joseph Fewsmith, who was in
Beijing for meetings with Chinese academic colleagues. ``What they
(the government) are terribly worried about is the prospect of a
few dissidents trying to organize laid-off workers. That is the
sort of thing they really want to nip in the bud.''

But when a cold he caught from his daughter kept him in bed, he
knew something was wrong. His feet and ankles began to swell, and
he couldn't get air. He spent an entire night bolt upright (since
he could no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing. Doctors
determined that Miguel was suffering from Chagas' disease, named
after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist to expose the secret life
of Trypanosoma cruzi, a single-celled protozoan that can burrow

   The Achuar Indians of Ecuador have, by one count, the highest
murder rate on Earth. In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50
percent of their immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun
blasts. (The traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you
living?'') To anthropologists, that makes their society a good
place to understand the violence within us all. Mary Roach, a
contributing editor to Discover magazine, reports.

   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ the feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced. The first attacks were brief.
But when a cold he caught from his daughter kept him in bed, he
knew something was wrong. His feet and ankles began to swell, and
he couldn't get air. He spent an entire night bolt upright (since
he could no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing. Doctors
determined that Miguel was suffering from Chagas' disease, named
after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist to expose the secret life
of Trypanosoma cruzi, a single-celled protozoan that can burrow
into heart muscle. Claire Panosian, a professor of medicine in the
division of infectious diseases and director of travel and tropical
medicine at UCLA Medical Center, reports on treating Miguel.

 By SHANTI MENON  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (D istributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The railway linking Lahore to Multan in Pakistan is 4,600 years
old. In truth, the rails were laid down in the middle of the 19th
century, but to build the railway bed, British engineers smashed
bricks from crumbling buildings and rubble heaps in a town called
Harappa, halfway between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1856, Alexander Cunningham, director of the newly formed
Archaeological Survey of India, thought the brick ruins were all
related to nearby seventh-century Buddhist temples. Local legend
told a different story: The brick mounds were the remnants of an
ancient city, destroyed when its king committed incest with his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cunningham nor the locals were entirely correct. In
small, desultory excavations a few years later, Cunningham found no
temples or traces of kings, incestuous or otherwise. Instead he
reported the recovery of some pottery, carved shells and a badly
damaged seal depicting a one-horned animal, bearing an inscription
in an unfamiliar writing. That seal was a mark of one of the
world's great ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vedas, the oldest texts of the subcontinent, dating from
some 3,500 years ago, made no mention of it, nor did the Bible. No
pyramids or burial mounds marked the area as the site of an ancient
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 4,600 years ago, great cities arose along the floodplains of
the ancient Indus and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan and
northwest India.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the Indus Valley were a highly organized and
stupendously successful civilization. They built some of the
world's first planned cities, created one of the world's first
written languages, and thrived in an area twice the size of Egypt
and Mesopotamia for 700 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding at Harappa for the first time is how the
first cities started,'' says Mark Kenoyer, an archaeologist at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Kenoyer, who was born in India
to missionary parents, has been excavating at Harappa for the past
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenoyer's archaeological evidence suggests that the city got its
start as a farming village around 3300 B.C. Situated near the Ravi
River, Harappa lay on a fertile floodplain. But the key to
urbanization was its location at the crossroads of several major
trading routes. Traders from the highlands of Baluchistan and
northern Afghanistan to the west brought in copper, tin and lapis
lazuli; clam and conch shells were brought in from the southern
seacoast, timber from the Himalayas, semiprecious stones from
Gujarat, silver and gold from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of goods allowed Harappans to become traders and
artisans as well as farmers. And specialists from across the land
arrived to set up shop in the new metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   By 2200 B.C., Harappa covered about 370 acres and may have held
80,000 people, making it roughly as populous as the ancient city of
Ur in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the haphazard arrangement of Mesopotamian cities, Indus
Valley settlements all followed the same basic plan. Streets and
houses were laid out on a north-south, east-west grid, and houses
and walls were built of standard-size bricks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also devoted to sanitation. Nearly every Harappan home
had a bathing platform and a latrine, says Kenoyer, and some Indus
Valley cities reached heights of 40 feet. Each neighborhood had its
own well, and elaborate covered drainage systems carried dirty
water outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   The towering brick cities, surrounded by sturdy walls with
imposing gateways, reminded early researchers of the medieval forts
in Delhi and Lahore. But Kenoyer thinks the walls were created to
control the flow of goods in and out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into the city, you had to pay a tax,'' Kenoyer
explains. ``If you produced things, you had to pay a tax to take
goods out of the city. This is how a city gets revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the tax collectors and those they served remains
a mystery. Indus Valley rulers did not immortalize themselves with
mummies or monuments. They did, however, leave behind elaborately
carved stone seals, used to impress tokens or clay tabs on goods
bound for market. The seals bore images of animals, the most common
being the unicorn, a symbol that originated in the Indus Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, though, those seals carry inscriptions that no
one has been able to decipher. Early Mesopotamian cuneiform was
thought to be the world's first written language, says Kenoyer, but
the Indus Valley script emerged independently around the same time
_ at least by around 3300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the language remains a mystery, so too will the
identities of the Indus Valley elites. Kenoyer thinks each of the
large cities may have functioned as an independent city-state,
controlled by a small group of merchants, landowners and religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They controlled taxation, access to the city and communication
with the gods,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While the balance of power may have shifted between these
groups, they seem to have ruled without a standing army.
Sculptures, paintings and texts from Egypt and Mesopotamia clearly
illustrate battles between cities. But in the Indus Valley, not a
single depiction of a military act, of taking prisoners, of a human
killing another human has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Excavators have turned up some hints of the wealth an individual
could accumulate. Two decades ago, in the rural settlement of
Allahdino, near modern Karachi in Pakistan, archaeologists stumbled
upon a buried pot filled with jewelry, the secret hoard of a rich
landowner. Among the goods was a belt or necklace made of 36
elongated carnelian beads interspersed with bronze beads. It was
most likely made by a group of artisans over a period of two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Such intensive devotion to craftsmanship and trade, Kenoyer
argues, is what allowed Indus Valley culture to spread over a
region twice the size of Mesopotamia without a trace of military
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, between 1900 and 1700 B.C., the extensive trading
networks and productive farms supporting this cultural integration
collapsed, Kenoyer says, and distinct local cultures emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that the Indus River shifted, flooding many
settlements and disrupting agriculture. It is likely that when
these smaller settlements were abandoned, trade routes were
affected.
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (D istributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The railway linking Lahore to Multan in Pakistan is 4,600 years
old. In truth, the rails were laid down in the middle of the 19th
century, but to build the railway bed, British engineers smashed
bricks from crumbling buildings and rubble heaps in a town called
Harappa, halfway between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1856, Alexander Cunningham, director of the newly formed
Archaeological Survey of India, thought the brick ruins were all
related to nearby seventh-century Buddhist temples. Local legend
told a different story: The brick mounds were the remnants of an
ancient city, destroyed when its king committed incest with his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cunningham nor the locals were entirely correct. In
small, desultory excavations a few years later, Cunningham found no
temples or traces of kings, incestuous or otherwise. Instead he
reported the recovery of some pottery, carved shells and a badly
damaged seal depicting a one-horned animal, bearing an inscription
in an unfamiliar writing. That seal was a mark of one of the
world's great ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vedas, the oldest texts of the subcontinent, dating from
some 3,500 years ago, made no mention of it, nor did the Bible. No
pyramids or burial mounds marked the area as the site of an ancient
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 4,600 years ago, great cities arose along the floodplains of
the ancient Indus and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan and
northwest India.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the Indus Valley were a highly organized and
stupendously successful civilization. They built some of the
world's first planned cities, created one of the world's first
written languages, and thrived in an area twice the size of Egypt
and Mesopotamia for 700 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding at Harappa for the first time is how the
first cities started,'' says Mark Kenoyer, an archaeologist at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Kenoyer, who was born in India
to missionary parents, has been excavating at Harappa for the past
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenoyer's archaeological evidence suggests that the city got its
start as a farming village around 3300 B.C. Situated near the Ravi
River, Harappa lay on a fertile floodplain. But the key to
urbanization was its location at the crossroads of several major
trading routes. Traders from the highlands of Baluchistan and
northern Afghanistan to the west brought in copper, tin and lapis
lazuli; clam and conch shells were brought in from the southern
seacoast, timber from the Himalayas, semiprecious stones from
Gujarat, silver and gold from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of goods allowed Harappans to become traders and
artisans as well as farmers. And specialists from across the land
arrived to set up shop in the new metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   By 2200 B.C., Harappa covered about 370 acres and may have held
80,000 people, making it roughly as populous as the ancient city of
Ur in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the haphazard arrangement of Mesopotamian cities, Indus
Valley settlements all followed the same basic plan. Streets and
houses were laid out on a north-south, east-west grid, and houses
and walls were built of standard-size bricks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also devoted to sanitation. Nearly every Harappan home
had a bathing platform and a latrine, says Kenoyer, and some Indus
Valley cities reached heights of 40 feet. Each neighborhood had its
own well, and elaborate covered drainage systems carried dirty
water outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   The towering brick cities, surrounded by sturdy walls with
imposing gateways, reminded early researchers of the medieval forts
in Delhi and Lahore. But Kenoyer thinks the walls were created to
control the flow of goods in and out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into the city, you had to pay a tax,'' Kenoyer
explains. ``If you produced things, you had to pay a tax to take
goods out of the city. This is how a city gets revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the tax collectors and those they served remains
a mystery. Indus Valley rulers did not immortalize themselves with
mummies or monuments. They did, however, leave behind elaborately
carved stone seals, used to impress tokens or clay tabs on goods
bound for market. The seals bore images of animals, the most common
being the unicorn, a symbol that originated in the Indus Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, though, those seals carry inscriptions that no
one has been able to decipher. Early Mesopotamian cuneiform was
thought to be the world's first written language, says Kenoyer, but
the Indus Valley script emerged independently around the same time
_ at least by around 3300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the language remains a mystery, so too will the
identities of the Indus Valley elites. Kenoyer thinks each of the
large cities may have functioned as an independent city-state,
controlled by a small group of merchants, landowners and religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They controlled taxation, access to the city and communication
with the gods,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While the balance of power may have shifted between these
groups, they seem to have ruled without a standing army.
Sculptures, paintings and texts from Egypt and Mesopotamia clearly
illustrate battles between cities. But in the Indus Valley, not a
single depiction of a military act, of taking prisoners, of a human
killing another human has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Excavators have turned up some hints of the wealth an individual
could accumulate. Two decades ago, in the rural settlement of
Allahdino, near modern Karachi in Pakistan, archaeologists stumbled
upon a buried pot filled with jewelry, the secret hoard of a rich
landowner. Among the goods was a belt or necklace made of 36
elongated carnelian beads interspersed with bronze beads. It was
most likely made by a group of artisans over a period of two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Such intensive devotion to craftsmanship and trade, Kenoyer
argues, is what allowed Indus Valley culture to spread over a
region twice the size of Mesopotamia without a trace of military
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, between 1900 and 1700 B.C., the extensive trading
networks and productive farms supporting this cultural integration
collapsed, Kenoyer says, and distinct local cultures emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that the Indus River shifted, flooding many
settlements and disrupting agriculture. It is likely that when
these smaller settlements were abandoned, trade routes were
affected.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy of the ancient Indus cities and their
craftspeople remains. In the crowded marketplaces of Delhi and
Lahore, as gold and jewels are weighed in bronze balances, it's
hard to imagine that a 4,000-year-old Harappan bazaar could have
been terribly different.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   There are many reasons to be nervous in the village of Conambo
in the Ecuadoran Amazon. The Achuar people of Conambo are nervous
about the Achuar. The Achuar hold the dubious distinction of having
had, in recent generations, one of the highest murder rates on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50 percent of their
immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun blasts. (The
traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you living?'')
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Patton, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
and the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, studies the roots of war and killing.
He takes a biological approach to human behavior, which is to say
he expects Darwinian theory to explain it. And from that
evolutionary perspective, war is something of a problem, because it
appears to be an altruistic act: You are risking your life for the
good of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altruism is the conundrum of Darwinian theory,'' Patton is
saying. ``When people use the term altruism, what they usually mean
is behaviors that appear to be altruistic but are really some form
of enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has theorized that warriors fight and kill in exchange
for a boost in status _ and that boost in status sets them up for
certain evolutionary perks.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's method is straightforward: He asks each Achuar man to
rank his fellow men, first by status in the community, then by
warriorship. Patton's only tools are a stack of Polaroids, a pencil
and a waterproof field notebook.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Ushpa lives on the riverbank. From his backpack,
Patton extracts his deck of Polaroids. Patton explains that he
wants Ushpa to arrange the Polaroids according to who is the most
``juunt'' _ an Achuar word that translates loosely as ``big.'' He
arrived at the term by talking to villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to them, 'Some people, when they talk, people don't
pay attention. But others, when they talk, people always listen. Is
there a name for someone like that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ushpa has the Polaroids laid out on the floor, a
photographic hopscotch of intense, unsmiling faces. After noting
the order of the photographs, Patton gathers them up for round two:
warriorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``?Quien es mas achima?'' ``Achima'' is the Achuar word for
``warrior.'' ``If a war was to break out and there was a battle,
who would prove himself to be the best?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has been asking the Achuar this question since 1992, and
his results are striking. When he lines up the rankings Achuar men
give for both qualities, warriorship accounts for as much as 78
percent of the variation in men's status. The better a warrior you
are, the more status you apparently earn.
</P>
<P>
   To Patton, this is the first step toward understanding how war
persists in human societies _ tracing the effect of being a good
warrior on your success in society, and ultimately in passing on
your genes.
</P>
<P>
   The Achuar concept of warriorship encompasses not only strategy
and skill but also valor, willingness and lack of hesitation.
Wisdom also plays a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to people about this, one of the things that kept
coming up was that a good warrior was `mas pensativo-' _ he's more
thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   A Polaroid of an older man invariably places higher on the
warriorship ranking than those of the town's youngest men,
regardless of the size of their biceps or the fierceness of their
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a society where in the past half the men got killed, you
assume that a man who reaches old age must be doing something
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in our society, where status is tied to income and address,
wartime exploits will carry a man a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this slide that I use in lectures that was the cover of
the National Enquirer,'' Patton comments. ``It says `Stormin'
Norman Schwarzkopf, Sexiest Man in America.' We still have this
tribal psychology about our warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ushpa is finishing up the warriorship task, but Patton has a new
line of questions for him: ``If a conflict arose here in Conambo,
who would side with whom?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton is aware that the town's social alliances can skew the
men's rankings of one another. In addition, the men of Conambo have
a keen sense of whom they can and can't trust in the event of
conflict. Patton would argue that this is an evolved trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong selective pressure to be able to make good
who-to-trust decisions: You're wrong, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, according to Patton, are the forces that were behind the
origin of human social structures. You want to be part of a group
that's big enough to beat the other guys, or at least be a threat
to them, yet not so big that you can't keep everyone fed.
Friendships are forged according to who can offer whom what, as a
sort of insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the natural state,'' Patton says.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Patton sees a strong parallel between Amazonian
tribes and inner-city gangs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a gang, just as here, there's no question that you choose
your friends in terms of who you think is going to back you up and
who might be an important person to have on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phrase,'' Patton says. ```An armed society is a
polite society.' When you don't have institutions like police and
any conflict can escalate to something serious, you have to be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, he's not making the case that the Achuar are
violent by nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a gene for violence here. We're
talking about the evolution of the strategic use of violence:
knowing when to push it and when not to. The biggest mistake people
make about the kind of anthropology I do is that they assume that
what we're talking about is these simple, knee-jerk instincts. When
in fact these instincts are complex, evolved strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives violence is: When do the costs and benefits favor
it, and when do they favor peace? I have no problem saying warfare
is a product of our biology. I also say that doesn't mean it's a
biological inevitability.''

<P>
   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ those feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The first attacks were brief. Then, over time, they lasted
longer, until one day a friend at work saw the sweat on his face
and the fear in his eyes. He thought Miguel was having some kind of
dizzy spell and made him lie down.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Miguel's wife took him to the emergency room at L.A.
County Hospital. That's when they did an electrocardiogram _ his
first ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extra heartbeats,'' the nurse said, ``but no sign of
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The intern on duty added, ``You're 38 years old, your blood
pressure's great, you don't even smoke. You've got a lot of miles
left on that heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So Miguel decided it was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The following winter Miguel caught a cold from his daughter. The
sore throat and aching muscles kept him in bed. Soon his feet and
ankles began to swell, and he couldn't get air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he spent an entire night bolt upright (since he could
no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing.
</P>
<P>
   And he worried ... something was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As an infectious-diseases specialist in Los Angeles, I first met
Miguel while doing rounds in our hospital's Coronary Observation
Unit. I guess Miguel was only a slow-motion disaster. Over a period
of months, he had gone from clinic to clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Miguel received a heart catheterization. Dye was
squirted through a tube placed in the heart to reveal its structure
and function. The results showed no coronary blockage.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Miguel carried the diagnosis of congestive
cardiormyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, idiopathic.
Basically, that meant he had a flabby balloon of a heart beating
dangerously out of control, and no one knew why.
</P>
<P>
   His heart and circulatory system were functioning so poorly that
fluids were building up. He had come to us for a possible heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Before I visited him, I scanned Miguel's chart. Since his first
attack of waterlogged lungs, he had taken digitalis and diuretics.
The digitalis helped his heart pump more efficiently, and the
diuretics helped flush out the fluid that was building up from the
failing pump.
</P>
<P>
   On his current chest X-ray, his heart was a large baggy mass in
the middle of his chest. But at least his lungs were clear. Thanks
to more potent diuretics, in the last few days they were free of
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I am a parasite sleuth. Today my quarry was Trypanosoma cruzi, a
single-celled protozoan that can burrow into heart muscle and lead
to Chagas' disease, named after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist
to expose the secret life of T. cruzi.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient, sickle-shaped organism indigenous to Central and
South America, T. cruzi remains in the 1990s one of the leading
causes of cardiac death in young and middle-aged people south of
the border. Right now, the invader inhabits 16 to 18 million humans
in Latin America and more than 300,000 U.S. immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But most victims are unaware of their infection as are their
doctors. Hence, even in southern California T. cruzi infections are
missed more often than they are diagnosed. I didn't want to miss
the diagnosis in Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a small farm with goats and pigs and chickens in
Jalisco,'' Miguel said. ``Our house? Oh, adobe _ very poor. And
yes, there are bugs in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the clues were adding up: farm, animals, insects. The
natural reservoir of T. cruzi is warmblooded animals.
House-dwelling insects, specifically known as conenose, or
``kissing,'' bugs (entomologists call them reduviids) transfer T.
cruzi from animals to man.
</P>
<P>
   The final clue was poverty. That's because reduviids often nest
in the nooks and crannies of the poorest rural dwellings. The bugs
emerge at night to binge on humans and purge: They first suck
blood, then dump parasite-laden feces next to the skin punctures
they've just created.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was ready to examine Miguel. I bent over his chest with
my stethoscope and heard the soft syncopation of a failing heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to Miguel's abdomen. First I felt for his liver.
It was slightly enlarged, confirming a blood buildup from an ailing
heart. As my fingertips continued to search, they also sensed
fullness of the colon. Did he have constipation? No, he said, not
usually.
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved. In my mental cinema, I had imagined
single-celled squatters, this time ensconced in the nerve clusters
that lace around the digestive tract. Parasite nests and
inflammation located here produce ``mega syndrome.'' in 6 to 10
percent of those infected, the gut enlarges because the nerves that
control the rhythmic squeezing of peristalsis die. Such nerve
damage can afflict other hollow organs too. Miguel had been spared
the indignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senora, if you are right, could I give this infection to my
family?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I said. Except for occasional cases of maternal-fetal
transmission, intrafamilial spread of T. cruzi does not occur,
except by the feces of reduviids.
</P>
<P>
   But did he, in fact, have Chagas' disease? Our best bet: the
antibody test for T. cruzi performed at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One week after drawing his blood, I heard from a technician in
Atlanta. Miguel's serum was unequivocally positive.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the real question facing Miguel was heart
transplantation. If Miguel had a transplant, he would need to take
drugs to rein in his immune response and prevent rejection of his
new heart.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell him that patients with endstage Chagas' disease had
gotten new hearts. But early results of transplantation had been
dismal. Most patients died within a year from new colonies of T.
cruzi sprouting not only in their new heart but in their skin,
brain and other organs. The drugs used to prevent organ rejection
created an open playing field for parasite growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Miguel made his own decision. He declined to be
placed on the transplant list, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, I heard he had died. He was one of more than
40,000 who lost their lives that year to a hidden intruder in the
heart.

 By SHANTI MENON  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (D istributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The railway linking Lahore to Multan in Pakistan is 4,600 years
old. In truth, the rails were laid down in the middle of the 19th
century, but to build the railway bed, British engineers smashed
bricks from crumbling buildings and rubble heaps in a town called
Harappa, halfway between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1856, Alexander Cunningham, director of the newly formed
Archaeological Survey of India, thought the brick ruins were all
related to nearby seventh-century Buddhist temples. Local legend
told a different story: The brick mounds were the remnants of an
ancient city, destroyed when its king committed incest with his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cunningham nor the locals were entirely correct. In
small, desultory excavations a few years later, Cunningham found no
temples or traces of kings, incestuous or otherwise. Instead he
reported the recovery of some pottery, carved shells and a badly
damaged seal depicting a one-horned animal, bearing an inscription
in an unfamiliar writing. That seal was a mark of one of the
world's great ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vedas, the oldest texts of the subcontinent, dating from
some 3,500 years ago, made no mention of it, nor did the Bible. No
pyramids or burial mounds marked the area as the site of an ancient
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 4,600 years ago, great cities arose along the floodplains of
the ancient Indus and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan and
northwest India.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the Indus Valley were a highly organized and
stupendously successful civilization. They built some of the
world's first planned cities, created one of the world's first
written languages, and thrived in an area twice the size of Egypt
and Mesopotamia for 700 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding at Harappa for the first time is how the
first cities started,'' says Mark Kenoyer, an archaeologist at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Kenoyer, who was born in India
to missionary parents, has been excavating at Harappa for the past
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenoyer's archaeological evidence suggests that the city got its
start as a farming village around 3300 B.C. Situated near the Ravi
River, Harappa lay on a fertile floodplain. But the key to
urbanization was its location at the crossroads of several major
trading routes. Traders from the highlands of Baluchistan and
northern Afghanistan to the west brought in copper, tin and lapis
lazuli; clam and conch shells were brought in from the southern
seacoast, timber from the Himalayas, semiprecious stones from
Gujarat, silver and gold from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of goods allowed Harappans to become traders and
artisans as well as farmers. And specialists from across the land
arrived to set up shop in the new metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   By 2200 B.C., Harappa covered about 370 acres and may have held
80,000 people, making it roughly as populous as the ancient city of
Ur in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the haphazard arrangement of Mesopotamian cities, Indus
Valley settlements all followed the same basic plan. Streets and
houses were laid out on a north-south, east-west grid, and houses
and walls were built of standard-size bricks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also devoted to sanitation. Nearly every Harappan home
had a bathing platform and a latrine, says Kenoyer, and some Indus
Valley cities reached heights of 40 feet. Each neighborhood had its
own well, and elaborate covered drainage systems carried dirty
water outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   The towering brick cities, surrounded by sturdy walls with
imposing gateways, reminded early researchers of the medieval forts
in Delhi and Lahore. But Kenoyer thinks the walls were created to
control the flow of goods in and out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into the city, you had to pay a tax,'' Kenoyer
explains. ``If you produced things, you had to pay a tax to take
goods out of the city. This is how a city gets revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the tax collectors and those they served remains
a mystery. Indus Valley rulers did not immortalize themselves with
mummies or monuments. They did, however, leave behind elaborately
carved stone seals, used to impress tokens or clay tabs on goods
bound for market. The seals bore images of animals, the most common
being the unicorn, a symbol that originated in the Indus Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, though, those seals carry inscriptions that no
one has been able to decipher. Early Mesopotamian cuneiform was
thought to be the world's first written language, says Kenoyer, but
the Indus Valley script emerged independently around the same time
_ at least by around 3300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the language remains a mystery, so too will the
identities of the Indus Valley elites. Kenoyer thinks each of the
large cities may have functioned as an independent city-state,
controlled by a small group of merchants, landowners and religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They controlled taxation, access to the city and communication
with the gods,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While the balance of power may have shifted between these
groups, they seem to have ruled without a standing army.
Sculptures, paintings and texts from Egypt and Mesopotamia clearly
illustrate battles between cities. But in the Indus Valley, not a
single depiction of a military act, of taking prisoners, of a human
killing another human has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Excavators have turned up some hints of the wealth an individual
could accumulate. Two decades ago, in the rural settlement of
Allahdino, near modern Karachi in Pakistan, archaeologists stumbled
upon a buried pot filled with jewelry, the secret hoard of a rich
landowner. Among the goods was a belt or necklace made of 36
elongated carnelian beads interspersed with bronze beads. It was
most likely made by a group of artisans over a period of two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Such intensive devotion to craftsmanship and trade, Kenoyer
argues, is what allowed Indus Valley culture to spread over a
region twice the size of Mesopotamia without a trace of military
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, between 1900 and 1700 B.C., the extensive trading
networks and productive farms supporting this cultural integration
collapsed, Kenoyer says, and distinct local cultures emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that the Indus River shifted, flooding many
settlements and disrupting agriculture. It is likely that when
these smaller settlements were abandoned, trade routes were
affected.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy of the ancient Indus cities and their
craftspeople remains. In the crowded marketplaces of Delhi and
Lahore, as gold and jewels are weighed in bronze balances, it's
hard to imagine that a 4,000-year-old Harappan bazaar could have
been terribly different.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (D istributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The railway linking Lahore to Multan in Pakistan is 4,600 years
old. In truth, the rails were laid down in the middle of the 19th
century, but to build the railway bed, British engineers smashed
bricks from crumbling buildings and rubble heaps in a town called
Harappa, halfway between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1856, Alexander Cunningham, director of the newly formed
Archaeological Survey of India, thought the brick ruins were all
related to nearby seventh-century Buddhist temples. Local legend
told a different story: The brick mounds were the remnants of an
ancient city, destroyed when its king committed incest with his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cunningham nor the locals were entirely correct. In
small, desultory excavations a few years later, Cunningham found no
temples or traces of kings, incestuous or otherwise. Instead he
reported the recovery of some pottery, carved shells and a badly
damaged seal depicting a one-horned animal, bearing an inscription
in an unfamiliar writing. That seal was a mark of one of the
world's great ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vedas, the oldest texts of the subcontinent, dating from
some 3,500 years ago, made no mention of it, nor did the Bible. No
pyramids or burial mounds marked the area as the site of an ancient
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 4,600 years ago, great cities arose along the floodplains of
the ancient Indus and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan and
northwest India.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the Indus Valley were a highly organized and
stupendously successful civilization. They built some of the
world's first planned cities, created one of the world's first
written languages, and thrived in an area twice the size of Egypt
and Mesopotamia for 700 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding at Harappa for the first time is how the
first cities started,'' says Mark Kenoyer, an archaeologist at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Kenoyer, who was born in India
to missionary parents, has been excavating at Harappa for the past
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenoyer's archaeological evidence suggests that the city got its
start as a farming village around 3300 B.C. Situated near the Ravi
River, Harappa lay on a fertile floodplain. But the key to
urbanization was its location at the crossroads of several major
trading routes. Traders from the highlands of Baluchistan and
northern Afghanistan to the west brought in copper, tin and lapis
lazuli; clam and conch shells were brought in from the southern
seacoast, timber from the Himalayas, semiprecious stones from
Gujarat, silver and gold from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of goods allowed Harappans to become traders and
artisans as well as farmers. And specialists from across the land
arrived to set up shop in the new metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   By 2200 B.C., Harappa covered about 370 acres and may have held
80,000 people, making it roughly as populous as the ancient city of
Ur in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the haphazard arrangement of Mesopotamian cities, Indus
Valley settlements all followed the same basic plan. Streets and
houses were laid out on a north-south, east-west grid, and houses
and walls were built of standard-size bricks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also devoted to sanitation. Nearly every Harappan home
had a bathing platform and a latrine, says Kenoyer, and some Indus
Valley cities reached heights of 40 feet. Each neighborhood had its
own well, and elaborate covered drainage systems carried dirty
water outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   The towering brick cities, surrounded by sturdy walls with
imposing gateways, reminded early researchers of the medieval forts
in Delhi and Lahore. But Kenoyer thinks the walls were created to
control the flow of goods in and out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into the city, you had to pay a tax,'' Kenoyer
explains. ``If you produced things, you had to pay a tax to take
goods out of the city. This is how a city gets revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the tax collectors and those they served remains
a mystery. Indus Valley rulers did not immortalize themselves with
mummies or monuments. They did, however, leave behind elaborately
carved stone seals, used to impress tokens or clay tabs on goods
bound for market. The seals bore images of animals, the most common
being the unicorn, a symbol that originated in the Indus Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, though, those seals carry inscriptions that no
one has been able to decipher. Early Mesopotamian cuneiform was
thought to be the world's first written language, says Kenoyer, but
the Indus Valley script emerged independently around the same time
_ at least by around 3300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the language remains a mystery, so too will the
identities of the Indus Valley elites. Kenoyer thinks each of the
large cities may have functioned as an independent city-state,
controlled by a small group of merchants, landowners and religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They controlled taxation, access to the city and communication
with the gods,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While the balance of power may have shifted between these
groups, they seem to have ruled without a standing army.
Sculptures, paintings and texts from Egypt and Mesopotamia clearly
illustrate battles between cities. But in the Indus Valley, not a
single depiction of a military act, of taking prisoners, of a human
killing another human has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Excavators have turned up some hints of the wealth an individual
could accumulate. Two decades ago, in the rural settlement of
Allahdino, near modern Karachi in Pakistan, archaeologists stumbled
upon a buried pot filled with jewelry, the secret hoard of a rich
landowner. Among the goods was a belt or necklace made of 36
elongated carnelian beads interspersed with bronze beads. It was
most likely made by a group of artisans over a period of two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Such intensive devotion to craftsmanship and trade, Kenoyer
argues, is what allowed Indus Valley culture to spread over a
region twice the size of Mesopotamia without a trace of military
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, between 1900 and 1700 B.C., the extensive trading
networks and productive farms supporting this cultural integration
collapsed, Kenoyer says, and distinct local cultures emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that the Indus River shifted, flooding many
settlements and disrupting agriculture. It is likely that when
these smaller settlements were abandoned, trade routes were
affected.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy of the ancient Indus cities and their
craftspeople remains. In the crowded marketplaces of Delhi and
Lahore, as gold and jewels are weighed in bronze balances, it's
hard to imagine that a 4,000-year-old Harappan bazaar could have
been terribly different.

<P>
   There are many reasons to be nervous in the village of Conambo
in the Ecuadoran Amazon. The Achuar people of Conambo are nervous
about the Achuar. The Achuar hold the dubious distinction of having
had, in recent generations, one of the highest murder rates on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50 percent of their
immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun blasts. (The
traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you living?'')
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Patton, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
and the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, studies the roots of war and killing.
He takes a biological approach to human behavior, which is to say
he expects Darwinian theory to explain it. And from that
evolutionary perspective, war is something of a problem, because it
appears to be an altruistic act: You are risking your life for the
good of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altruism is the conundrum of Darwinian theory,'' Patton is
saying. ``When people use the term altruism, what they usually mean
is behaviors that appear to be altruistic but are really some form
of enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has theorized that warriors fight and kill in exchange
for a boost in status _ and that boost in status sets them up for
certain evolutionary perks.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's method is straightforward: He asks each Achuar man to
rank his fellow men, first by status in the community, then by
warriorship. Patton's only tools are a stack of Polaroids, a pencil
and a waterproof field notebook.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Ushpa lives on the riverbank. From his backpack,
Patton extracts his deck of Polaroids. Patton explains that he
wants Ushpa to arrange the Polaroids according to who is the most
``juunt'' _ an Achuar word that translates loosely as ``big.'' He
arrived at the term by talking to villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to them, 'Some people, when they talk, people don't
pay attention. But others, when they talk, people always listen. Is
there a name for someone like that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ushpa has the Polaroids laid out on the floor, a
photographic hopscotch of intense, unsmiling faces. After noting
the order of the photographs, Patton gathers them up for round two:
warriorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``?Quien es mas achima?'' ``Achima'' is the Achuar word for
``warrior.'' ``If a war was to break out and there was a battle,
who would prove himself to be the best?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has been asking the Achuar this question since 1992, and
his results are striking. When he lines up the rankings Achuar men
give for both qualities, warriorship accounts for as much as 78
percent of the variation in men's status. The better a warrior you
are, the more status you apparently earn.
</P>
<P>
   To Patton, this is the first step toward understanding how war
persists in human societies _ tracing the effect of being a good
warrior on your success in society, and ultimately in passing on
your genes.
</P>
<P>
   The Achuar concept of warriorship encompasses not only strategy
and skill but also valor, willingness and lack of hesitation.
Wisdom also plays a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to people about this, one of the things that kept
coming up was that a good warrior was `mas pensativo-' _ he's more
thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   A Polaroid of an older man invariably places higher on the
warriorship ranking than those of the town's youngest men,
regardless of the size of their biceps or the fierceness of their
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a society where in the past half the men got killed, you
assume that a man who reaches old age must be doing something
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in our society, where status is tied to income and address,
wartime exploits will carry a man a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this slide that I use in lectures that was the cover of
the National Enquirer,'' Patton comments. ``It says `Stormin'
Norman Schwarzkopf, Sexiest Man in America.' We still have this
tribal psychology about our warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ushpa is finishing up the warriorship task, but Patton has a new
line of questions for him: ``If a conflict arose here in Conambo,
who would side with whom?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton is aware that the town's social alliances can skew the
men's rankings of one another. In addition, the men of Conambo have
a keen sense of whom they can and can't trust in the event of
conflict. Patton would argue that this is an evolved trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong selective pressure to be able to make good
who-to-trust decisions: You're wrong, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, according to Patton, are the forces that were behind the
origin of human social structures. You want to be part of a group
that's big enough to beat the other guys, or at least be a threat
to them, yet not so big that you can't keep everyone fed.
Friendships are forged according to who can offer whom what, as a
sort of insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the natural state,'' Patton says.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Patton sees a strong parallel between Amazonian
tribes and inner-city gangs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a gang, just as here, there's no question that you choose
your friends in terms of who you think is going to back you up and
who might be an important person to have on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phrase,'' Patton says. ```An armed society is a
polite society.' When you don't have institutions like police and
any conflict can escalate to something serious, you have to be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, he's not making the case that the Achuar are
violent by nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a gene for violence here. We're
talking about the evolution of the strategic use of violence:
knowing when to push it and when not to. The biggest mistake people
make about the kind of anthropology I do is that they assume that
what we're talking about is these simple, knee-jerk instincts. When
in fact these instincts are complex, evolved strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives violence is: When do the costs and benefits favor
it, and when do they favor peace? I have no problem saying warfare
is a product of our biology. I also say that doesn't mean it's a
biological inevitability.''

   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ those feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The first attacks were brief. Then, over time, they lasted
longer, until one day a friend at work saw the sweat on his face
and the fear in his eyes. He thought Miguel was having some kind of
dizzy spell and made him lie down.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Miguel's wife took him to the emergency room at L.A.
County Hospital. That's when they did an electrocardiogram _ his
first ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extra heartbeats,'' the nurse said, ``but no sign of
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The intern on duty added, ``You're 38 years old, your blood
pressure's great, you don't even smoke. You've got a lot of miles
left on that heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So Miguel decided it was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The following winter Miguel caught a cold from his daughter. The
sore throat and aching muscles kept him in bed. Soon his feet and
ankles began to swell, and he couldn't get air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he spent an entire night bolt upright (since he could
no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing.
</P>
<P>
   And he worried ... something was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As an infectious-diseases specialist in Los Angeles, I first met
Miguel while doing rounds in our hospital's Coronary Observation
Unit. I guess Miguel was only a slow-motion disaster. Over a period
of months, he had gone from clinic to clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Miguel received a heart catheterization. Dye was
squirted through a tube placed in the heart to reveal its structure
and function. The results showed no coronary blockage.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Miguel carried the diagnosis of congestive
cardiormyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, idiopathic.
Basically, that meant he had a flabby balloon of a heart beating
dangerously out of control, and no one knew why.
</P>
<P>
   His heart and circulatory system were functioning so poorly that
fluids were building up. He had come to us for a possible heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Before I visited him, I scanned Miguel's chart. Since his first
attack of waterlogged lungs, he had taken digitalis and diuretics.
The digitalis helped his heart pump more efficiently, and the
diuretics helped flush out the fluid that was building up from the
failing pump.
</P>
<P>
   On his current chest X-ray, his heart was a large baggy mass in
the middle of his chest. But at least his lungs were clear. Thanks
to more potent diuretics, in the last few days they were free of
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I am a parasite sleuth. Today my quarry was Trypanosoma cruzi, a
single-celled protozoan that can burrow into heart muscle and lead
to Chagas' disease, named after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist
to expose the secret life of T. cruzi.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient, sickle-shaped organism indigenous to Central and
South America, T. cruzi remains in the 1990s one of the leading
causes of cardiac death in young and middle-aged people south of
the border. Right now, the invader inhabits 16 to 18 million humans
in Latin America and more than 300,000 U.S. immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But most victims are unaware of their infection as are their
doctors. Hence, even in southern California T. cruzi infections are
missed more often than they are diagnosed. I didn't want to miss
the diagnosis in Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a small farm with goats and pigs and chickens in
Jalisco,'' Miguel said. ``Our house? Oh, adobe _ very poor. And
yes, there are bugs in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the clues were adding up: farm, animals, insects. The
natural reservoir of T. cruzi is warmblooded animals.
House-dwelling insects, specifically known as conenose, or
``kissing,'' bugs (entomologists call them reduviids) transfer T.
cruzi from animals to man.
</P>
<P>
   The final clue was poverty. That's because reduviids often nest
in the nooks and crannies of the poorest rural dwellings. The bugs
emerge at night to binge on humans and purge: They first suck
blood, then dump parasite-laden feces next to the skin punctures
they've just created.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was ready to examine Miguel. I bent over his chest with
my stethoscope and heard the soft syncopation of a failing heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to Miguel's abdomen. First I felt for his liver.
It was slightly enlarged, confirming a blood buildup from an ailing
heart. As my fingertips continued to search, they also sensed
fullness of the colon. Did he have constipation? No, he said, not
usually.
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved. In my mental cinema, I had imagined
single-celled squatters, this time ensconced in the nerve clusters
that lace around the digestive tract. Parasite nests and
inflammation located here produce ``mega syndrome.'' in 6 to 10
percent of those infected, the gut enlarges because the nerves that
control the rhythmic squeezing of peristalsis die. Such nerve
damage can afflict other hollow organs too. Miguel had been spared
the indignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senora, if you are right, could I give this infection to my
family?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I said. Except for occasional cases of maternal-fetal
transmission, intrafamilial spread of T. cruzi does not occur,
except by the feces of reduviids.
</P>
<P>
   But did he, in fact, have Chagas' disease? Our best bet: the
antibody test for T. cruzi performed at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One week after drawing his blood, I heard from a technician in
Atlanta. Miguel's serum was unequivocally positive.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the real question facing Miguel was heart
transplantation. If Miguel had a transplant, he would need to take
drugs to rein in his immune response and prevent rejection of his
new heart.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell him that patients with endstage Chagas' disease had
gotten new hearts. But early results of transplantation had been
dismal. Most patients died within a year from new colonies of T.
cruzi sprouting not only in their new heart but in their skin,
brain and other organs. The drugs used to prevent organ rejection
created an open playing field for parasite growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Miguel made his own decision. He declined to be
placed on the transplant list, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, I heard he had died. He was one of more than
40,000 who lost their lives that year to a hidden intruder in the
heart.

   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ those feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced.
</P>
<P>

longer, until one day a friend at work saw the sweat on his face
and the fear in his eyes. He thought Miguel was having some kind of

`GODS AND MONSTERS' MAKE COMPELLING MUSIC TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ``Gods and Monsters'' were a piece of music, it would be a
duet _ for violin and bass viol, in a minor key. Call it Sonata for
Famous Old Man and Desired Hunk.
</P>
<P>
   Ian McKellen, the smaller, more sinuous half of the ensemble, is
the violin; Brendan Fraser, for reasons of physical size and vocal
sonority, the bass viol. The piece is short and intense, with
contrapuntal themes and a climax of fat fortissimos. And it must be
performed in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is key, because ``Gods and Monsters'' is filmmaking's
equivalent of a small gothic storm _ gothic not in its terror,
which is minimal, but in its bone-cracking embrace of human
frailty. Like all good tragedies, this one is about the monsters
within: ``The only monsters are here,'' says McKellen, tapping his
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a fictionalized drama based on a few weeks in the
later years of director James Whale (whose own gothic masterpieces
included ``Frankenstein'' and ``The Invisible Man''), which is to
say it whips up the facts into a stylish fantasy. The end product
is both literate and a load of fun, directed by Bill Condon (best
known for the shlock-gothic ``Candyman II: Farewell to the Flesh'')
with compassion and deft ironic nuance.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen's Whale is a stubborn rail of a man who attempts to
piece his life together following a debilitating stroke. The stroke
has left him physically able but cognitively disabled: He can walk
and talk all right, but he can't think. At random moments he lists
off toward nostalgia, taking imaginative jaunts to his hardscrabble
childhood and World War I service with a beloved young comrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent much of my life outrunning the past,'' he says,
``and now it floods all over me.''
</P>
<P>
   Into his life lopes Clayton Boon (Fraser), a handsome yardman
whose Greek form Whale admires through the window of his home. Boon
is avowedly heterosexual, but that doesn't stop Whale from pining
for him _ Whale asks for permission to sketch him (clothed), and
the young gardener, unaware he's being courted, agrees. Over time
and tea-time chats they become sort-of friends.
</P>
<P>
   The innocent Boon (shown in brief scenes to behave poorly with
the opposite sex) is intrigued by the old man, more so after
learning he's gay; he watches ``Bride of Frankenstein'' (from which
the ``Gods and Monsters'' come) and ponders the nature of
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monster's lonely, he wants a friend, a girlfriend,
somebody,'' says Boon, defending the ghoul to his barfly pals.
``What's so sick about that?''
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is: nothing. The long answer is a bit more
convoluted, involving themes of lost innocence, unrequited love and
the thin, tough ties that bond human to human and present to past.
Is Whale trying to turn Boon into a monster of his own devising? Or
is Whale the monster himself? (In such questions ``Gods and
Monsters'' differs from ``Love and Death on Long Island,'' 1998's
other story of an older English man yearning for a young American
heartthrob, which cast a more tragic-comic light on the matter of
loneliness.)
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Redgrave is all prickly heart as Whale's busybody
housekeeper, her harsh devotion humanizing Whale almost as much as
McKellen's own, magnificent performance. He will (big prediction)
be nominated for an Oscar; if he wins, he'll deserve it. Only
marginally less deserving is Fraser, who gives the big dunce Boon a
touch of self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   There's a stretch in the film's middle when the viewer starts to
lose interest _ all this jabbering about monsters and loneliness.
But by film's close Condon's sharp emotional mystery comes
together, reaching a height _ a crescendo _ of unexpected fury and
pathos. What an ending. And what a tale.

`DREAMS' IS A SLEEPER DESPITE LOFTY CAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil Jordan has had a few missteps in his career as a director,
but the creator of ``The Crying Game'' and last year's disturbing
``The Butcher Boy'' has never stumbled as badly as he does with
``In Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a glossy but nonsensical horror flick that likely
would have gone straight to video were it not for the presence of
Jordan and his star cast, Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr.,
Stephen Rea and Aidan Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   With its quality actors and smart cinematography covering a thin
story, ``In Dreams'' resembles a cheap mattress dressed by
expensive sheets, except the movie won't disrupt your sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens impressively enough, with divers exploring the
remains of a town that, for the past 25 years, has been covered by
a 2-billion-gallon reservoir. The searchers' flashlight beams splay
like huge yellow fingers across the blue-green atmosphere, brushing
the physical remnants of what once was a town called Northfield: a
graveyard, a diner in which eels now nest, a stone church with a
gothic spire that was the last visible evidence of Northfield
before the steeple, too, drowned beneath the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   It was atop that spire, surrounded by rising water, that a
screaming boy was found. Such a child would grow into an
interesting lunatic, one would think, given the unusual abuse that
broke his mind. But no. Now, 25 years later, he's a generically
kooky movie madman who haunts the dreams of Bening's character, a
children's-book illustrator named Claire Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Claire lives in a big white house with black shutters, a cozy
home to her, a beautiful daughter who goes to dance class and a
husband (Quinn) who drives a BMW and flies 747s for an airline.
</P>
<P>
   All would be idyllic for Claire, were it not for the nightmares,
populated by apples and imperiled children, that torment her sleep.
The dreams' recurrent character is also their source, a
rusty-haired bogeyman who, for reasons that are never explained,
sends his actions into Claire's mind. Addled, she drives her car
off a bridge, hurls her computer monitor through the attic window
and, once imprisoned in a mental ward, uses the F-word often.
</P>
<P>
   Because she's played by the ever-resourceful Bening, Claire
decides that the only way to stop the madman is to let him take
over her brain. And here, with crazy music and jerky hand-held
cinematography, is where the movie tries to go insane. Instead, it
simply stops making sense.
</P>
<P>
   Claire's mind-meld with the murderer enables her to escape from
the asylum and finally to meet the killer, named Vivian (Downey).
Her apple-filled dreams come true during their showdown, in an
apparently abandoned cider plant that nonetheless is mounded to the
rafters with piles of perfect fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian, wearing hair as bad as Norman Bates' mother wig, just
wants a mom to replace the one that left him to be drowned along
with the town. Claire just wants to kill him. Viewers just want
``In Dreams'' to end.
</P>
<P>
   Good horror movies surprise you. Bad ones cause you to ask
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Such as, why aren't all those apples rotten? If the police
searched every orchard in a 300-mile radius, why didn't they find
Vivian's hideout, which is as big as a Wal-Mart? And didn't either
Claire or Vivian or Jordan see ``Psycho''?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan explored the parent-child bond, fantasy, madness and
terror in ``The Butcher Boy,'' a chronicle of the disintegrating
psyche of an Irish child. His exquisite control and perfect balance
turned that movie into both a brilliant exercise in fury and an
inky-dark comedy. Its surreal logic and apocalyptic images stay
with you, as irresistible and indelible as a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The most lasting and affecting thing about ``In Dreams'' is the
Roy Orbison song of the same name. It plays over the closing
credits.

<P>
   If I have ever been to Austin, Texas, I don't remember the
trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that I regularly take trips on which I'm so
out of it that they leave no stain of memory in my skull or that
I've been to so many places that a trip to Austin simply got lost
in the crowd. I'm just making space for the possibility that on a
childhood trip or two to Texas I may have passed through Austin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether I have been there or not, the point is I'm glad I wasn't
there earlier this month when the place was simply overrun with
dazed-looking astronomers. Well, I assume they were dazed-looking.
If they weren't, they almost certainly don't understand how
discombobulated their world _ which, in the end, is our world _ has
become. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In just the past year, developments in astronomy have thrown
scientists a curve as they try to imagine not just how the cosmos
works but also as they try to answer the seemingly simple question
of how old the universe is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These puzzled astronomers gathered in Austin recently for a
convention of the American Astronomical Society. There they
presented papers galore and gave speeches and held seminars and
whatnot _ all, from what I can tell, in an effort to convince
themselves that sooner or later they will unravel the mysteries of
the vast cosmos, which they previously thought they might be
getting close to figuring out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in one presentation _ ``Hubble Space Telescope
Imaging of the Proto-Planetary Nebula M2-56,'' a title that suffers
from the same impenetrability and ennui afflicting a lot of
newspaper headlines _ two scientists wrote: ``Shock emission
dominates the optical line spectrum of the bipolar lobes of M2-56
and shocks probably play an important role in its dynamic
evolution.'' Memorize this. It will be on your final exam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But speaking of shocks, the news last year _ mostly ignored by
the science-challenged mainstream media (but not by me) _ was that
some respected scientists announced their puzzling conclusion that
the universe appears to be expanding at an accelerating rate.
Beyond that, it seems to have been doing this for about 7 billion
years. And even beyond that, Albert Einstein may have been right
when he postulated the existence of a repulsive force that acts
against gravity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Say what? I know that's what many of you are saying. And I don't
blame you. You can't help it if your astronomy education ended with
the information that the big shiny thing in the night sky is called
the moon and may or may not be made of moldy cheese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what the new insights in astronomy mean is that the universe
may well be a lot older than scientists had imagined. Instead of
being 12 billion to 15 billion years old, it may be as old as 18
billion. Imagine that. The universe seems to have been lying to us
about its age. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but if these new findings are correct, it
probably means we live in a cosmos that, to the surprise of
astronomers, will keep expanding forever _ not unlike, apparently,
the way the couch-potato dog that lives in my house keeps
ballooning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Maran, a NASA astronomer who serves as press officer for
the American Astronomical Society (which means he sends out a lot
of e-mail to people like me), says that if scientists are right
about all this stuff, ``there may be a Nobel Prize in this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think Maran is right. Which is why my new year's resolution is
to write such a stunning novel about the forever-expanding universe
that I'll win the Nobel Prize in Literature. I'll call the book,
say, ``Austin Cosmic Limits.'' &QL;

TOP FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR RUNS TRUCK-SERVICE BUSINESS  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Victoria Hendon wants to destroy a few myths about
truck drivers and the trucking industry. Contrary to what most
people think, Hendon says:
</P>
<P>
   - Her customers usually are generous and good-hearted men.
</P>
<P>
   - Truck stops don't have to be greasy, dirty, rough places.
</P>
<P>
   - A woman business owner can do quite well in the male-dominated
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon, president and owner of Danny's Family Truck Wash and
Service Center on Phoenix's west side, has some new credentials to
back it all up.
</P>
<P>
   Dun &AMP; Bradstreet information service and ``Entrepreneur''
magazine, in its January issue, named Hendon as one of their 10
female entrepreneurs of the year. Businesses had to have fewer than
100 employees, and the woman had to own at least 51 percent of the
business and be the founder and a hands-on entrepreneur, said Maria
Anton, senior managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon and Maria Hopkins, her operations manager and best friend
since their childhood in Detroit, admit it's an unusual business
that people either like or they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to want to work in the trucking environment. You have
to see it the way they (truckers) see it,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   That means realizing that drivers are on the road 10 to 15 hours
a day, that their $150,000 rigs are their homes on wheels, and that
truckers can go as wild buying chrome truck accessories as women
can buying jewelry. Treat them fairly, Hopkins says, and they will
loyally advertise the business to other truckers and the managers
in the home office.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon pitches in with day-to-day duties at the 24-hours-a-day,
seven-days-a-week business, remains approachable and doesn't brag
that she owns the place, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very down to earth, very good with the customers. She
never felt she was above them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon says her background working in a retail clothing store,
the mentoring she received and the lessons she learned have come in
handy in the truck business.
</P>
<P>
   The truck wash, at 59th Avenue and Interstate 10, actually is a
full-service center, offering repairs, paint jobs, scale service,
tires, wheels and chrome accessories. Hendon figures it washes 100
trucks, weighs another 100 and services 25 to 30 more each day,
making it the largest truck wash in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other parts of the country, the weather is so bad that when
they get to Phoenix the first thing they want is a wash,'' Hopkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   A truck wash takes 40 minutes and runs $54.99, though waxes and
tire treatments push the average ticket to $75, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck-wash side and the service side, which does everything
from oil and lubrication jobs to heavy repairs, are vying to
provide the largest share of the company's $3.5 million in annual
revenue, Hendon said.
</P>
<P>
   The chrome-shop part of the business is growing, too, thanks to
exclusive arrangements with Valley suppliers and Hendon's belief in
little extras like free shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're happy, they'll be back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon got started in the business when she and then-husband
Daniel moved to the Valley in 1984 and started Danny's Family Car
Wash. They built the chain to 10 car washes and the fledgling truck
wash, which Hendon ran, before divorcing in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The truck wash was slow to build a reputation and thus turn a
profit, Hendon recalls, and was draining the rest of the business.
The equipment, the payments and everything else about the business
was big compared to the car washes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she said, ``I wanted this place. I loved its
largeness.''
</P>
<P>
   Though her company now is separate from the Danny's chain,
Hendon says she has been fortunate to maintain a good relationship
with her ex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember what it took to start out,'' she said. ``We think
a lot alike about business and hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Hintz, vice president of development for Danny's Family
Carousel Inc., said Hendon's work growing her business has been
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   When he and the Hendons first opened the truck wash, they
thought it would be a copy of the car wash business, he said. But
the round-the-clock aspect of it and the customers' mentality made
it very different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled in the beginning,'' Hintz said. ``The business
wasn't anywhere near what it is now. Vicki has done a wonderful job
of growing the gross and adding services. She's gotten a niche.''
</P>
<P>
   A homey atmosphere and full staffing, at a time when competitors
are cutting workers, help set the truck wash apart in the industry,
Hendon said.
</P>
<P>
   She also remodeled the store last year, building an entryway out
of truck wheels and parts and studiously avoiding the cookie-cutter
look truckers would find in chain operations elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon treats her 70 employees, from truck washers to cashiers
to service department personnel, like family, too. Workers' choice
of music blares from the wash bays, and Hendon throws Christmas
parties for her staff. The company also offers profit-sharing,
hospitalization and vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created a family environment so when the customers come in
there is always someone to talk to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hendon can be tough, too, especially in negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you push her to a point and make demands . . .'' Hopkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pleasant,'' Hendon finished.
</P>
<P>
   Last year when Circle K Corp. sold its nearby location and the
truck wash property to a national chain, Hendon had to battle to
keep her lease and exclusive rights to certain services. Her
attorneys were prepared to give in, she said, but Hendon wasn't
going to be bullied in her meeting with the chain's top executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the lease because I had read it and read it,'' she
said. ``I said, `What am I afraid of? It's all here. I just have to
stand on it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The deal worked out in Hendon's favor, much to her advisers'
surprise, and today she has expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Hendon and Hopkins say the business gets only a percentage of
the truck traffic that passes through Phoenix, partly because of
their cramped location.
</P>
<P>
   They have bought land behind the truck wash to build a bigger
paved, lighted area where trucks can wait in line for washes. They
also are talking with Danny's Family Carousel about a partnership
on a second truck wash farther west along Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   The business will grow as the amount of goods transported by
truck increases and as the Valley becomes more of a warehouse and
distribution center for the Southwest, Hendon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Railroads are almost obsolete, so this is it,'' she said of
the trucking business. ``This is how people are going to get
things.'' &QL;

`RYAN' OVERSHADOWS `THIN RED LINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's any question that ``Saving Private Ryan'' changed
forever what to expect from a war movie, witness ``The Thin Red
Line'': As beautiful as it is, as unconventional as it tries to be,
Terence Malick's dreamy discourse on the inhumanity of war rings
strangely false.
</P>
<P>
   In another year it might have been radical. In another year it
might have been art. But this year, released six months after
Steven Spielberg's benchmark film, ``The Thin Red Line'' seems both
self-important and exquisitely contrived. The hyper-realistic
``Ryan'' stripped the artifice from film violence and found a
horrid poetry at its core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Line'' strips nothing away it piles on the images, looking to
draw profound conclusions about evil and the great unseen. The
conclusions are there to be drawn, but they're rarely genuine. It's
all some gorgeous trickery, lyrical and forced.
</P>
<P>
   Characters speak to themselves, in narration, in endless spurts
of internal dialogue. Dialogue swells with metaphor. Narrative
veers into flashback and misty jungle reveries. In a movie set in
World War II's Pacific Theater, Malick's swollen eye turns often
and artfully on nature birds, serpentine vines and roots and giant,
pocked leaves. The idea is to set the hideousness of combat against
the natural state of things; repeated shots of peaceful Aborigines
are included for emphasis. (Near the end, the Aborigines start to
bicker, a sure sign that humanity is worse off than we thought.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, ``The Thin Red Line''
follows C-Company through an assault on a hill defended by a
thickly armed Japanese bunker. Despite its willful poesy, the movie
owes a lot to standard-formula war flicks like 1959's ``Pork Chop
Hill,'' wherein rough men attack an enemy stronghold and pay for it
in corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that the men in ``The Thin Red Line,''
like the men in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' aren't so sure it's worth
the cost; these are conflicted, terrified soldiers, pushed into
carnage by a desperately ambitious colonel (Nick Nolte, screaming
until his veins pop).
</P>
<P>
   ``Does our ruin benefit the Earth? Does it help the grass to
grow, the sun to shine?'' asks Private Witt (Jim Caviezel, still
and ethereal in a break-out role), chief among many darkly
pacifistic narrators.
</P>
<P>
   So tight is Malick's focus on the metaphysics of war _ on good
and evil, love and strife, the next world and this one _ that
actual violence takes a back seat. There's gore, of course, but
battle sequences are mostly dominated by the boom-boom-booms and
rat-a-tat-tats of conventional filmmaking; absent are the flying
body parts and graphic snapshots that dominated Spielberg's
``Ryan'' and altered our view of what a war movie should be.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, we don't even see a Japanese face until about
halfway through the film: In the old days, movies demonized the
enemy, but now they demonize war. They're anti-war movies. The
chief drawback to Malick's is its exquisite beauty: Of Malick's two
previous films (``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven''; this is his
first in 21 years), ``The Thin Red Line'' is most similar to
``Heaven,'' one of the most rapturous visual feats in American
cinema. This one boasts ripe cinematography (by John Toll, who won
an Oscar for ``Braveheart'') and Malick's own adapted screenplay,
which stresses gem-like aphorisms at the expense of character and
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this world, a man himself is nothing, and there ain't no
world but this one,'' says C Company's resident existentialist, 1st
Sgt. Edward Welsh. Sean Penn brings a grim compassion to Welsh that
anchors a flighty movie when he's on screen, it's grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Penn and Caviezel, the film's other standouts include
Ben Chaplin (previously of ``Washington Square'') as a lovesick
infantryman and Elias Koteas (``Crash'') as the company's
ambivalent commander. (Koteas should, however, drop the DeNiro
routine.)
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the film is larded with famous faces in throwaway
roles, from John Travolta, John Cusack and George Clooney (in an
infinitesimal role as a captain) to Woody Harrelson as a guy who
loses a big part of himself. There are others, too, but by the time
you recognize them, they're dead. The surplus of cameos is
distracting.
</P>
<P>
   So, ultimately, is Malick's artistic vision. If ``Saving Private
Ryan'' taught moviegoers anything, it's that war is not a ballet;
despite the graceful horrors of ``Apocalypse Now,'' despite the
Samuel Barber swells of ``Platoon,'' human combat is as lovely to
behold as a slaughterhouse. (Hans Zimmer's cello-heavy score for
``The Thin Red Line'' actually smacks of Barber's Adagio.)
</P>
<P>
   Malick wants it two ways: He wants war, but he wants it
stylized. That's the oldest mistake of all.

MICHAEL JORDAN GETS CHANCE FOR ANOTHER KIND OF GREATNESS  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE JAN. 15 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He did it his way.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan retired this week at the peak of his game and the
peak of his fame. He did it on his terms, his way. He left the fans
the way fans should be left: Wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player who ever
lived, leaves a hole the size of the Asian continent in the NBA.
His skill, his grace, his hunger, his dazzling smile are unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was magic. One of the best descriptions of that magic
came from ``The Arizona Republic's'' own David Casstevens, who
observed long ago that ``points appear from his hand like endless
scarves blooming from a magician's sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   His athleticism was a beauty to behold.
</P>
<P>
   He will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   But he shouldn't be mourned.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was, after all, a basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't God. He wasn't a hero. He wasn't even a role model.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man of exceptional skill who marketed himself
exceptionally well. Nike, Gatorade, Wheaties, Hanes, McDonalds _
those are just a few of the many brand names to which Jordan lent
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan made millions. And millions. And millions. But he seemed
to do so with little social awareness and less social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was disturbingly silent through much of the Nike
sweatshop controversy, for example. After months of negative
reports about working conditions overseas, Nike finally announced
in May that it would raise the minimum age for its workers and
impose American air quality standards on its plants overseas.
Philip Knight, Nike's chairman and chief executive, was remarkably
candid about the damage the controversy had done his company in a
speech shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been said that Nike has single-handedly lowered the
human rights standards for the sole purpose of maximizing
profits,'' Knight acknowledged at the National Press Club in
Washington, D.C. ``The Nike product has become synonymous with
slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse. I truly believe
that the American consumer does not want to buy products made in
abusive conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan had shown half _ a tenth, even _ of the leadership off
court that he showed on the court, he may have been able to curb
human rights abuses, save lives even _ a far more remarkable
achievement than 10 scoring crowns and six NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's retirement, in many ways, is precisely what
professional sports needs. It will give other players a chance to
grow and shine _ out from under Jordan's long shadow of
superiority. And it will give Jordan an opportunity to reshape the
symbiosis between celebrity and leadership, fame and
responsibility, cash and conscience.
</P>
<P>
   We loved, admired and respected Jordan on the court. We want to
be able to love, admire and respect him off of it. &QL;

GUYS COULD USE A FEMININE TOUCH IN FACIAL CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MEN-SKINCARE-SHAVE)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RENE A. GUZMAN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For most of us guys, the extent of facial
maintenance back in high school was plopping Clearasil on pimples.
</P>
<P>
   But once we graduate from adolescence, our faces take on a new
texture. Zits may come and go, but now we have razor burn, skin
cancer and wrinkles to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Face it _ we may know a thing or two about shaving, but most of
us don't know soap when it comes to keeping our faces clean and
healthy. And with Old Man Winter chafing our cheeks, it's time we
learned for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, men are clueless because they didn't read the
same kinds of magazines girls were reading when they were
teen-agers,'' said Dr. Chris Nanni, a dermatologist in New York who
said that most men never grew up learning how to take care of their
skin.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't exactly stopped us from bumming moisturizer from
women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, guys aren't necessarily coming out of the medicine
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason why people haven't recognized (men's skin care) as
much is that men can use the same products as women,'' said Dr.
Darrick Antell, a plastic surgeon on New York's Park Avenue. ``It's
hard to segment it out. If a product is geared toward men, it's
just in the packaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like something strong enough for a man but made for a
women, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, skin _ male or female _ is similar in structure,
although men tend to have more hair and increased oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are somewhat fortunate since they shave and exfoliate
better than a woman does,'' said Judith Battista, a skin specialist
at Aesthetic Enhancement, a San Antonio clinic that provides skin
treatment and plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Exfoliation is simply removing dead skin buildup from the
surface. The epidermis, or skin layer, is constantly sloughing off
dead cells, which may clog pores. Exfoliation occurs with washing
or shaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key role in anything is to really exfoliate the skin,''
Battista said. ``Even models have been shaving the skin for years.
If a man was to put a razor to his whole face, he'd probably have a
better face.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. There's a better way to keep your face clean
without relying on the cheek sickle.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at what dry winter air does to your mug. During the
colder months, humidity levels are low. As the cooler atmosphere
sucks away moisture from the face, your skin becomes less flexible.
Ironically, going inside to warm up doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most heaters in people's homes and work environments take the
moisture out of the air,'' Nanni said. ``And that's a double
whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of moving to a tropical climate, there are ways to give
your face a break in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Start off by splashing your face with warm water. Hot water robs
your face of natural oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do is put soap on the face,'' Battista
said. ``Anything that's in bar form has wax in it, and that causes
you to get a waxy buildup.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider a chemical exfoliator with either alpha-hydroxy or
salicylic acid. They will gently remove that dead layer of skin and
leave your face baby-bottom smooth. Glycerin soaps or
impurity-cleansing clay soaps also work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   And forget cloths and sponges. Use your fingers, washing in
gentle, circular motions.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse with cool water to lock in moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Don't dry your face just yet _ you still need to moisturize,
within five minutes of washing. ``If you wait longer, the water on
your body evaporates and you're worse than before,'' Nanni said.
</P>
<P>
   If your face is oily, use an oil-free or water-based
moisturizer. If your face is dry, your basic petrolatum moisturizer
will do. Look for a Vaseline-based cream or an oil-based lotion
with Vitamin E.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've done all you can to protect your face indoors, but now
you need to protect it from the great outdoors. Overexposure to sun
will wrinkle your skin long before you're long in the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in winter, those ultraviolet-A rays get through the
clouds,'' Nanni said. ``With the ozone depleted, it's easy to age
just walking to the store or sitting in your car.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanni recommended a UVA or UVB sunblock to help prevent sun
aging, and make sure its SPF (sun protection factor) is at least
20. Apply it generously.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're ready to roll, grab a pair of sunglasses before
you're out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area where men suffer the most is crow's feet around the
eyes,'' Nanni said. ``Even wraparound sunglasses are helpful.
They're getting increasingly popular, but they also give a lot more
protection because they cover the side area of the eyes. They also
protect against getting cataracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget that kisser. The lips don't have any protective
coating, so wrap them up in petroleum jelly every morning after
brushing your teeth. Any over-the-counter lip balm will do.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that an ounce of prevention is worth years off
your complexion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of control over your age,'' Antell said.
``Genes are overrated. You need to consider external factors like
sun exposure and smoke exposure. The problem is that this doesn't
happen overnight but over years of exposure. You can delay that
with all these proper treatments.''

A SHAVE GENTLE ENOUGH FOR A BABY FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the smoothest shave that is good for your skin, specialists
recommend the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Moisturize before bedtime to keep your face fresh for its
morning-after scraping. You don't have to hit the sack looking like
Joan Crawford _ your face will absorb most moisturizers in less
than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you wake up and are ready to shave, splash warm water on
your face to open the pores. Shaving in the shower is a plus if you
have plenty of warm water, a steam-resistant mirror and no fear of
dropping the razor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use shaving foam that contains glycerin, aloe vera, chamomile,
and/or olive oil. They may cost more, but your shave will glide
instead of grind. Besides, most foams and gels in a can are usually
riddled with menthol, which closes pores (not what you want for a
close shave).
</P>
<P>
   _ Lather up with a shaving brush. It may seem like another
luxury, but we're talking about your face.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relax for a minute to let the cream hydrate the hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start shaving with the grain of your beard. If you go against
the face-hair stream, you're just inviting razor burns and ingrown
hairs. Don't pull on your skin either. That just promotes wrinkles
and skin sag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finish off with a splash of cool water to close those pores
and seal in freshness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for an after-shave with the same ingredients as the
shaving cream. Alcohol of any kind should never meet your face.
Ever.

KID ROCK: JUST SHOW HIM THE MONEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Celebrity status _ and all its pricey perks _ suits
Kid Rock, and he's not afraid to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lookin' slick right now,'' said Kid Rock, calling amid
endless chatter from friends and passers-by in Los Angeles. ``I got
my Fendi glasses on. I'm on Melrose on my cell phone. And my Rolex
... I'm doin' it. I'm rock 'n' roll, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old rockin' rapper from ``a little cornfield town''
known as Romeo, Mich., has found a potent blend in rap beats, heavy
guitar riffs and self-aggrandizing lyrics. It's a hybrid he
describes as ``Lynyrd Skynyrd and Run DMC in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock kicks off a string of U.S. tour dates with Monster
Magnet beginning Saturday in South Carolina. The show hits Houston
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rock-and-roll show. It's filled with talent and
entertainment and good songs,'' Kid Rock said. ``Ninety-nine
percent of the time, I'm on top of it. I got a better show than
anybody I've seen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   After building a loyal following via four barely promoted
albums, Kid Rock (whose real name is Bob Ritchie) signed with the
Atlantic/Lava imprint for his fifth release, ``Devil Without a
Cause,'' an eclectic, often clever mix of genres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot better musically. I learned how to sing a lot
better, play a lot better, write songs, and structure them a lot
better,'' he said. ``I was touring with Too Short and Ice Cube when
I was 19.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be enjoying a taste of the rock-star lifestyle now, but
the battle to get his music heard was fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted to give me a record deal for years. Everybody
either wanted me to do rap or do rock or pick something. So I just
kept puttin' out independent records in my basement, makin' cash. I
was sellin' out 3,000-seaters in Detroit, movin' like 14,000 to
20,000 records out of my basement. They had to give me a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast'' was released in 1990 on Jive
Records. Subsequent releases included 1993's ``The Poylfuze
Method''; 1994's ``Fire It Up''; and 1996's ``Early Mornin' Stoned
Pimp,'' issued on Kid Rock's own Top Dog label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always pretty good at what I did when I was young. I was
always coordinated,'' said Kid Rock. ``Any musician loves music,
obviously. That's why we do it. Then it's like, `Why do you really
wanna do it?' 'Cause you can make money really quick, have a good
time, buy your family nice stuff, take your friends nice places. I
wanna provide the party.''
</P>
<P>
   With his at-times astonishing confidence and penchant for
four-letter-words _ along with big-label muscle _ Kid Rock's latest
release has resulted in a higher profile for the entertainer,
including routine appearances on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devil Without a Cause'' is No. 9 on Billboard's Heatseekers
chart, which tracks the top-selling albums from new and developing
artists.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for mainstream success, Kid Rock is unflinchingly
honest about his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these bands act like they wanna make music and not be on
the cover of Time. They wanna make a bunch of political
statements,'' Kid Rock said of the anticommercial stance of many
up-and-coming acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not good enough to do it, so that's their scapegoat. I
want everyone to hear my music, have a good time, party ... and I
wanna get loads of stupid Elvis Presley money and have fun while
I'm alive, man. Everybody in music wants to be a rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Kid Rock was given the opportunity to play the major
leagues on Atlantic's team, he was more than willing to take advice
from record executives who wanted to tailor his act for a bigger
audience. He cleaned up some of his songs and even recorded a few
radio-ready singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want full creative control; I wanted someone to tell
me how this thing works,'' Kid Rock said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Kid Rock's ethnicity has drawn comparisons to other
white artists in rap, including the Beastie Boys. Other
comparisons, however, don't sit quite as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody should have their own opinion on the
record,'' he said. ``If they think it sounds like Vanilla Ice,
that's cool. Whatever. He's an idiot. I know that; everyone else
knows that. If they say I sound like the Beasties or House of Pain,
that's cool. They're influences of mine. Alice in Chains was,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons aside, Kid Rock hopes to build a long career from
his heavy-metal-meets-hip-hop sound. It's a feat he seems pretty
sure of accomplishing one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get a piece of the pie. I've been doin' it for
nine years. I'm proud of it, and I'm kind of cocky about it in a
way, because I'm good at what I do. I'm very talented. I play every
instrument, and I'm better than 90 percent of the people that are
doin' it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, growing up goin' to catechism and school,
all I kept hearing was, `Love yourself, love yourself, love
yourself.' That's why I say it so much.''
</P>

A `THIN RED' PUZZLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Moviegoers seeing ``The Thin Red Line'' when it opens
this weekend will know they've seen something impressive and
harrowing. They may also end up scratching their heads, wondering
just what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1998's other big World War II movie, Steven Spielberg's
``Saving Private Ryan,'' Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line''
sometimes seems to need, if not an interpreter, at least a tour
guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonlinear,'' said Jim Caviezel, who plays one of the U.S.
Marines who hit the beaches of Guadalcanal, finding themselves in a
desperate struggle against the Japanese, their incompetent officers
and their private demons.
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel was in Houston recently to talk about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like if you woke up from a dream and I said, `Tell me
about it,''' he said. ``And you said, `I started at Point A, and
then went to Point B, and then to Point D.' And I said, `Wait a
minute, what about Point C?' And you said, `It doesn't matter.'''
</P>
<P>
   A dream _ or nightmare _ is a good explanation for what viewers
experience in ``The Thin Red Line,'' which is based on the
best-selling 1962 book by James Jones, author of ``From Here to
Eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with Marines below deck on a ship, waiting to
invade Guadalcanal. The movie starts with Pvt. Witt, Caviezel's
character, doing an introspective interior monologue while on a
tropical island where he and another Marine have gone absent
without leave. The two are soon captured and sent back to their
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, harrowing combat scenes as realistic and
frightening as those in ``Saving Private Ryan'' are mixed with
memories of stateside lovers, considerations of the meaning of war
and life, and intimate, personal moments that are more literary in
tone than what we usually see on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Often it seems like the soldiers are fighting themselves _ or
war itself _ rather than a tangible enemy, a notion emphasized by
our not even seeing the Japanese except as vague shapes or gun
flashes for the first hour of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a meditation on the evils of war, as powerful as any
personal prayer you could say in a moment of tragedy,'' Caviezel
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Malick is like the professor Robin Williams plays in
`Dead Poets Society,' and he tells his students, `Open your book
and read the first couple of pages on how to write a poem.' The kid
starts to read it, and the professor says, `Tear it out. Don't let
anyone tell you how to make a poem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Terry does.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Malick does is attract stars like metal shavings
to a magnet. The movie-star lineup in ``The Thin Red Line'' is
impressive: Sean Penn, George Clooney, John Travolta, Nick Nolte,
John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and John Savage.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Penn and Nolte, most of the stars have small roles,
appearing in the movie just for a chance to work with Malick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be in it,'' Clooney said about his one-minute
role in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Malick, who lives in Austin, Texas, built a good reputation as a
director in the 1970s, based on only two films, which he also
wrote. They were the haunting young-criminals story ``Badlands''
and the heartbreakingly beautiful ``Days of Heaven.'' Neither was a
box-office hit, but both received good reviews and made it clear
that Malick was a filmmaker of unusual vision and extreme technical
skill.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Days of Heaven'' in 1978, for which he won several major
awards, Malick, a Rhodes Scholar, has been the J.D. Salinger of
cinema, retreating to Paris and almost completely from filmmaking.
His reputation as a recluse and the enforced absence from
filmmaking enhanced his status to near-legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   When word went out that Malick was again making a film _ a war
movie _ just about every male actor in Hollywood took notice. Which
explains why there are so many stars in the movie, and why Malick
was able to turn what the studio probably hoped would be a
straightforward, audience-thrilling war film into a complex, highly
personal ``meditation on the evils of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to back to Caviezel. With all these big names in
the cast, why is it that this virtual unknown has the largest role
in one of the most eagerly anticipated films in years? The movie is
an ensemble piece, with no real lead role, but Caviezel's Witt is
at its center.
</P>
<P>
   If the name of this rather shy young actor _ clearly
uncomfortable doing interviews _ doesn't ring any bells, don't feel
bad. You're not alone in not recognizing Caviezel, who was on the
verge of giving up acting before ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to playing this, Caviezel's most prominent role was
probably that of brother Warren Earp, in Kevin Costner's ``Wyatt
Earp'' in 1994. Most recently he was a minor character in ``G.I.
Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife, in another six months I'm seriously
considering wrapping this up,'' Caviezel said. ``Although I loved
acting, I felt it was important to be working. If we have kids, it
will be important that I pay bills. It would have been very
difficult (to quit) because I loved it, but I could always do
theater on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel, 30, is tall and lean, but not as gaunt as he appears
in ``The Thin Red Line,'' where his tall frame _ ``On a good day
I'm maybe 6 feet, 2 inches; on a bad day maybe 6-1 1/2'' _ carried
only 170 pounds, because the Marines were supposed to look like
they have not eaten well. His now clean, handsome face looks
haggard and dirty in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel didn't know who Malick was when he auditioned and was
asked to go to Malick's house to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthful, when I went in and met with him, I kind of
told him, this is who I was and what was important to me. We really
didn't talk about the movie much. Maybe that had something to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``School and many things in my life have been difficult for me.
I've had to work a lot harder than most people. I always figured
college was for smart guys, so I came to Hollywood,'' he said with
a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing was never a problem, and maybe it's a gift, is
character and integrity,'' said Caviezel, who is deeply religious.
``There are things that I believe in so strongly that I basically
have said I'm willing to give up what I'm doing in order to have my
family live a great life. I don't need to change. I need to be like
myself; this is who I am. From the get-go, that was either going to
push (Malick) away or draw us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it drew them together. Malick changed his mind about
the role he originally wanted Caviezel to play and cast him as the
moral Witt, who avoids killing, even when it might save his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel also lucked out in the editing process. Originally,
Witt was just one of several important characters. Many other major
and minor roles were cut completely from the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we shot a record 1 1/2 million feet of film,''
Caviezel said. ``That's basically 50 movies. Coming out of
(shooting) that, it was like, well, what kind of film are we going
to have here?''
</P>
<P>
   Some filmgoers will be asking that question as they leave the
theater. Few will doubt ``The Thin Red Line'' is achingly beautiful
and frighteningly intense. But it is also a film that demands
complete attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is very linear, Saving Private Ryan will work
brilliantly for them,'' Caviezel said. ```The Thin Red Line' could
have been about invading Guadalcanal, going to capture Henderson
(air) field, getting the Japanese off the island _ making it as
linear as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not. It's about the condition of the human heart and
spirit. It's about the thin red line between life and death,
between heaven and hell, between sane and insane. It stays true to
that line. It's not really tangible.''

`MST 3000' FINDS ITSELF IN SHAKY ORBIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a decade of growing cult status, critical praise and
impact on popular culture, the Satellite of Love may be sinking in
its orbit. But its network says it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Science Theater 3000,'' in which a man and two robots
stranded in space comically mock bad movies, is returning for a
10th season and its third year on the Sci-Fi Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But its season premiere won't be until April 11, more than six
months after its last original telecast on Sci-Fi, which has shown
reruns ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Sci-Fi also changed the show's time slot. Instead of
airing at 4 and 10 p.m. CST Saturdays, ``MST'' now airs from 10
p.m.-midnight Sundays, repeating at 10 a.m. the next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time is out, except for the West Coast, where Sci Fi's
live cable feed on Sundays airs at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sci-Fi also has scaled back the number of episodes per year. In
1997, its first year on the network, ``MST'' had 22 shows. Last
year it had just 13. Sci Fi's rationale was, ``We got a late
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year's April start is a month later than last year's
return on March 14, following 1997's premiere on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   MSTies, as fans are known, are alarmed. But Sci Fi officials say
not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Reynolds, Sci Fi's director of media relations in New
York, said the time shifts are among ``a lot of changes'' in the
network's schedule and are designed to boost ``fluctuating''
ratings for ``MST.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, she said, was late-Saturday competition from other
shows aimed at a young demographic, including ``Saturday Night
Live,'' ``Howard Stern Radio Show'' and ``MAD TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This show's audience was fragmented in that time period,'' she
said. ``There was no real consistency'' (in its ratings).
</P>
<P>
   As for the premiere waiting until April, she said the network
``has some new management, some new people, and they felt April was
the best time for the show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``MST's'' producers at Best Brains Inc. in Minneapolis had no
comment. But its official fan web page, Satellite News
(www.mst3kinfo.com/index.html), has been getting e-mail from
concerned fans. In fact, the News is suggesting a ``polite'' fan
campaign to boost the show's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the concerns come from the fact that ``MST's'' former
network, Comedy Central, torpedoed the show near the end of its
run, placing it in graveyard time slots and, in effect, shoving it
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Sci Fi has seemed a much better fit, given the show's spaceship
setting and its frequent use of sci-fi movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope (it will continue),'' Reynolds said. ``I'm a
big fan of it. And I personally think it's in a much better time
slot.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether this year will have 13 episodes or 22, she said
the decision to pick up additional shows will be made in March.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, stranded spaceman Mike Nelson (played by Michael J.
Nelson) and zany robots Crow and Tom Servo remain stuck in orbit,
making the world a funnier place for fans of bad cinema.

`IN DREAMS' IS ALL WASHED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claire Cooper has strange visions. Awake, she draws otherworldly
book illustrations for fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. Asleep,
she sees fragments of other people's lives _ the murder of a child,
an abandoned town drowned by a new dam, a serial killer who haunts
her dreams, menacing her husband, her daughter, even the family
dog.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the largely unrealized story elements of ``In Dreams,''
a high-gloss, low-yield supernatural horror film starring Annette
Bening as Claire and directed by Neil Jordan, of ``Interview With
the Vampire,'' ``The Crying Game'' and last year's ``The Butcher
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' has star power with Bening, comeback kid Robert
Downey Jr. and director Jordan, but it hasn't got consistency or
assurance. For this, responsibility rests with the maddeningly
uneven Jordan, who has turned in fine work such as ``The Miracle''
but also dreck like the remake of ``We're No Angels'' and his
bombastic ``Michael Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who wrote the screenplay of ``In Dreams'' with ``The
Killing Fields'' scenarist Bruce Robinson, stirs a big-budget
potboiler here. The film _ with color-saturated work by director of
photography Darius Khondji and lavish sets (some underwater) by
production designer Nigel Phelps _ looks great. It's the story,
which presumes to probe the psychological depths of Claire's
clairvoyance _ that's all wet.
</P>
<P>
   Claire keeps coming back to images of water in her dreams.
Eventually, she realizes, she is seeing images of a hidden crime
committed just as a pastoral New England town was deliberately
flooded by dam engineers 20 years earlier. The crime took place at
the bottom of what is now a reservoir abuzz with pleasure boats and
bathers; a subsequent series of murders can be traced to this
watery site.
</P>
<P>
   True to the conventions of the horror genre _ and ``In Dreams''
is nothing if not conventional _ evil lurks beneath the seemingly
placid surface of life in Claire's quiet, pretty town. Only Claire
can see the nature of that evil.
</P>
<P>
   As her dreams become progressively more disturbing _ and the
film, with sounds of ripping flesh, explosive surges of water, and
the gurgling of spilled blood, becomes progressively more graphic
and grisly _ Claire becomes more and more isolated. Her husband
(Aidan Quinn, in a gruff, impersonal performance), the town
detective (Paul Guilfoyle) and her psychiatrist (a miscast Jordan
regular, Stephen Rea) believe Claire is really losing it,
especially when she begins prophesying the killer's next moves.
</P>
<P>
   Claire is thrown into a mental institution, drugged and tied
down. But she breaks out and sneaks off to a meeting with the
killer in an attempt to finally foil him. The Evil One is played by
Robert Downey Jr., wearing a long-haired wig and cross-dressing in
scenes that look like outtakes from ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, the viewer is in even bigger trouble than poor Claire,
with ``In Dreams'' heading straight for high-camp territory.
Amazingly, the filmmakers don't seem to realize it. Downey plays
the flouncing, whining killer with a barely believable straight
face, Jordan tries to gussy up his poorly told tale from the dark
side with big, noisy special effects. And _ wouldn't you know? _
there's a labored surprise ending.
</P>
<P>
   Only Bening acquits herself with any style. She's especially
skillful in an interview with the shrink when Claire shifts from
absurdist laughter, to nervous tics, to terror, to tenderness. That
scene recalls what Bening can do with a substantial role _ e.g.,
``The Grifters'' _ but here she's just a fish out of water in
Jordan's sodden tale.

MAKING THE MOST OF FULL-TILT BOOGIE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One question PC buyers frequently ask is whether they really
need all the power that can be found in high-end machines. For
folks who are doing the basics, the answer is, happily, no.
</P>
<P>
   If all you ever want to do is surf the Web, send e-mail, use a
word processor and occasionally scan a family photo or two, even
low-end hardware will get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one category that just screams for power, and
that's gaming. Although it may seem outlandish to some to spend
$2,000 and up, up, up on a computer to play games, many do. The
graphics and programming in state-of-the-art, 3-D games demand
state-of-the art hardware.
</P>
<P>
   However, serious gamers know that, even if they buy the best off
the shelf, there still are some things that can be added to a
machine to achieve pure immersion _ that blissful moment when what
appears on the screen and what pumps through the speakers is as
close to reality as is technologically possible.
</P>
<P>
   Want to reach nirvana? Try these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Voodoo2 SLI: I've written about graphics cards that use 3Dfx
Interactive's Voodoo2 chipset here before. They are add-on graphics
adapters that both accelerate a game's video and enhance its
appearance. Games that take advantage of the Voodoo2's special
capabilities have a spectacular look.
</P>
<P>
   The Voodoo2-based cards have another feature that, when invoked,
further up the ante. You can pair two Voodoo2 cards in a PC,
linking them so they work in tandem. They share the process of
rendering images using Scan Line Interleave, or SLI.
</P>
<P>
   This allows you to increase both the speed and the resolution of
a game. With twin Voodoo2 cards, you can bump your resolution from
800-by-600 _ the maximum with a 12-megabyte Voodoo2 card _ to
1,024-by-768. The speed jumps, too. Depending on your processor,
memory and other variables, you can run at that resolution at up to
60 frames per second in graphics-intensive games such as Quake II
or Half-Life.
</P>
<P>
   I tried an SLI configuration in a 450-megahertz Pentium II
system using a pair of Diamond Multimedia Monster 3D II boards,
though you can use any of the Voodoo2-based cards together, so long
they are the same brand. The result was jaw-dropping, to say the
least. Motion was incredibly fluid, and having the screen real
estate at 1,024-by-768 kept me alive onscreen longer.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are two downsides to this. First, this takes up
two PCI slots in your computer _ in older or smaller PCs, two slots
may not be available. Then there is the cost. A Voodoo2-based card
can run $140 to $200 _ double that for two-card SLI configurations.
Diamond makes a less expensive secondary board that can only be
used with a full Monster II, but it still costs around $125.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voodoo Banshee: &UR;  &LR; For those on a budget, or without the slots
to spare for an add-on graphics card, consider a card based on
3Dfx's Voodoo Banshee chips. This is a one-card product that
provides many of the features of a Voodoo2 card, along with very
fast 2-D capabilities as well.
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo Banshee cards are sold by Diamond as the Monster Fusion;
by Creative Labs as the 3D Blaster Banshee; and by other
manufacturers under a variety of names. Some PC manufacturers, such
as Gateway, include it as a standard offering in their systems.
</P>
<P>
   It's less expensive than a Voodoo2 card, selling in the $100 to
$130 range. While it lacks some advanced features, it's perfect for
the gamer on a budget, or one who already has used up the extra
slots in a PC. It's available for both AGP- and PCI-based systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3D Positional Audio: What 3-D graphics cards do for video,
positional audio cards do for sound. Imagine playing a game, and
when an opponent is sneaking up on you, you can actually hear
footsteps coming from behind!
</P>
<P>
   I tried two cards, the Diamond Monster Sound MX300 and Creative
Labs' SoundBlaster Live! The MX300 uses a chipset from Aureal
Semiconductor called the Vortex 2, while Creative uses its own
design. Both boards support Microsoft's DirectSound scheme, and
both support Aureal's competing A3D 1.0 system. However, only the
MX300 supports A3D 2.0, the latest version of that system.
</P>
<P>
   Both cards produce spectacular sound for gamers, though the
SoundBlaster Live! card requires four speakers to achieve what the
MX300 can do with just two. With the Creative card, you place two
speakers in front of you and two in back for true surround-sound.
But with the MX300 and a game that supports A3D 2.0, the same
effect is possible with a single pair of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   You also can add two more speakers to the MX300, for even more
realistic sound.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Studio's Half-Life supports A3D 2.0, and it's an
excellent demonstration of how well that audio system works. Much
of Half-Life takes place in rooms that are stark, with concrete
walls and hard floors. The sound in these rooms echoes
realistically with A3D 2.0; less so with DirectSound.
</P>
<P>
   The Creative card holds the edge if you are interested in MIDI,
the computer standard for creating and playing music. The MX300 is
less expensive, at about $100. The SoundBlaster Live! sells for
about $175. Both require a PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   _ BSG Intensor sound chair: &UR;  &LR; For a real treat, try plugging BSG
Laboratories' Intensor chair into one of those sound cards. This is
a chair that comes with speakers and vibration-producing devices
built in.
</P>
<P>
   You'll love it _ but only for brief periods at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The Intensor comes in a clamshell case that folds up. You can
place it on the floor, or purchase an optional base that turns it
into a desk chair. You can also add a powerful subwoofer for a
serious base boost. The various configurations run $300 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the chair, sound swirls all around you for true
positional audio. When you fire a weapon, you feel its kick in the
chair. Pulling the trigger on a machine gun was never this much
fun!
</P>
<P>
   However, there is one minor drawback and another more serious
one. The chair base is incredibly difficult attach to the Intensor,
but fortunately you only have to do that once.
</P>
<P>
   Once you sit in the chair, you'll find it's an ergonomic
nightmare. It forces you into a rigid, 90-degree angle, and offers
only minimal padding. After an hour, my back was aching, and it
wasn't from machine-gun vibrations. BSG needs to seriously rethink
the physical design of this chair.

WHY WE'LL MISS MICHAEL JORDAN AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Jordan retired the first time, in 1993, I remember
thinking that his decision was good for the National Basketball
Association because it restored the league's competitive balance.
With Jordan gone, other players would emerge as stars; other teams
besides Jordan's Chicago Bulls would have a chance to win the NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd in hindsight, but I actually enjoyed watching pro
basketball while Jordan was away much more than I did when he was
playing. Not being a Bulls fan, I was pleased that opponents no
longer needed a battery of surface-to-air missiles to defend their
basket.
</P>
<P>
   My reaction then strikes me as odd now because, looking back, it
was obvious when Jordan returned late in the 1994-95 season how
much basketball had missed him. How much the world had missed him.
</P>
<P>
   No one else could provide Jordan's unique combination of fierce
competitiveness and spectacular showmanship. No one else could
provide the eye-popping, seemingly effortless displays of aerial
acrobatics that characterized the high-flying basketball spectacle
known as Air Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to it than that. No other athlete could
provide the dignity and class that Jordan brought to professional
sports. Somehow he managed to impose his will _ on teammates, on
opponents, on the universe _ without exhibiting an ounce of
arrogance or temperament. Even ego-crazed troublemakers such as
Charles Barkley seemed better behaved when Jordan was within
slam-dunking distance.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of overpaid, overindulged and underdisciplined sports
brats, Jordan stands above the crowd as a self-effacing hero who
deserves every bit of fame and fortune that has come his way. It's
tempting for just plain folks to resent the mind-boggling incomes
of today's pro athletes _ not to mention the ungrateful attitudes
that so many sports stars exhibit _ but I'm guessing that it would
be hard to find a fan who begrudges Jordan any of the spoils of
superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan sells products and sells out arenas like no athlete ever
has _ and fans have no qualms about putting a few more dollars in
his pocket. He's worth it, they figure; and besides, he gives a lot
back, quietly involving himself in the community without a hint of
self-promotion or personal aggrandizement.
</P>
<P>
   So if I was sort of glad that he retired in 1993, I was really
glad that he unretired in 1995. There aren't enough athletes who
inspire admiration; we couldn't spare the one athlete who inspired
more admiration than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has retired again, and this time he's certain that he
means it. Well, he's 99.9 percent certain that he means it. That's
extremely certain.
</P>
<P>
   And he showed us in his farewell news conference on Wednesday
why he means so much to basketball, to sports, to everyone who
yearns for heroes and role models in a culture of celebrity that
yields so few of both.
</P>
<P>
   Most retiring superstars would have read a canned statement
prepared by an agent or PR flack, taken a few questions and quickly
bolted for the door. Jordan spoke from the heart, explaining his
decision in candid detail and then patiently answering question
after question, as if he owed this time to an adoring public that
was sure to be distraught by his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions were pointless and stupid, as news
conference questions often are, but Jordan replied to every
question as if it deserved an answer. Many _ most? _ public
figures, especially sports stars, treat a news conference or a
media interview as an inconvenience, an intrusion. They often
respond to questions _ even appropriate questions _ with snide
remarks and angry outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan clearly understands that the media in such situations
are representing the public _ the fans _ and that the fans pay the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   He also understands that a sports hero has a responsibility to
those who look to him as an example. It's a responsibility that he
has always fulfilled, on and off the court. Which is why his
retirement was bad news for all of us.

CUTTING THE POWER TO THAT PASSWORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When my dear daughter set up our new computer,
she somehow set it up with a power-on password. I have tried many
times to get rid of it, with no success. I don't mind typing a
four-letter word every time I turn my computer on, but I'm curious.
Why can't I get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Say the Secret Word
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WORD: Only one four-letter word? Every time I sit down at
my computer it takes 15 or 20 of those, a few eight-letter ones
and, occasionally, the 12-letter biggie before I can get it to work
the way it's supposed to. Consider yourself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm wondering is why your kid put a password on there in
the first place unless she's gone paranoid from one too many
``X-Files.'' I could understand it if your computer were sitting in
a busy office with a bunch of nosy co-workers, like mine is, but
that's hardly the case. And I doubt you have all that many Russian
spies traipsing through your house looking for nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   You can get rid of it, but you're going to have to find the
manual that came with the computer. Power-on passwords aren't
stored on the hard drive, so even if you rebuilt Windows from
scratch, it would still be there. The password is stored on a chip
with the rest of your basic system information, such as how much
memory or which type of hard drive you have.
</P>
<P>
   You need to find out how to start your computer's setup program,
which will allow you to change the info on that chip. The manual
should have instructions on changing or clearing the password. Your
brand of computer may even let you clear the password by monkeying
with some settings on the motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Last week, I cut out your column on testing
your computer for the year 2000. I now cannot find the article. Can
you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why Too Kay
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KAY: Why sure! It's right there behind the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Many books on Windows NT include a CD for NT
Server good for 120 days. After running Service Pack 3 (downloaded
from Microsoft) I have run it for far longer. A friend ran Service
Pack 4 and the system went dead. The moral: Leave well enough
alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bandit
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BANDIT: Well, nobody ever said the people at Microsoft were
stupid. You might find a way to cheat them once in a while, but
they eventually close all the little loopholes. And now that they
know about you, you can expect the guys in black body armor to show
up at your door any minute.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Do you know anything about the Office 2000
preview? Is it crippleware (i.e., does it expire after 60 days or
something?).
</P>
<P>
   _ Early Adopter
</P>
<P>
   DEAR EARLY: Hey, pay attention! I thought I just said the
Microsoft guys aren't stupid. For 20 bucks they're giving you the
opportunity to own buggy, pre-release software that expires on Aug.
1. And so far, thousands and thousands of lemmings have jumped off
that cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. If you send me $20, I'll send you the pre-release version
of next week's column, full of unfinished thoughts and
ungrammatical sentences. I know, I know. What would be so different
about that?

DON'T BE BLIND TO PLUSES OF HAVING 3-BUTTON MOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm a computer novice, but I just got a new one, and I really
like it. I have seen several references to three-button mice. I
went to look at them and even saw four-button mice! Can you tell me
why I might want more than two buttons? And why would I even
consider four?
</P>
<P>
   A: You certainly don't need more than two buttons, but having
three and maybe even four means more convenience.
</P>
<P>
   In Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0, the left mouse button is used to
select and launch files and programs, while the right mouse button
is used to do all kinds of nifty things that are largely
conveniences. The most important is to generate pop-up menus. What
these menus include depends on what's being clicked upon, a feature
known as ``context sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   If you right-click on the open Windows 98 desktop, you'll get a
different set of menu choices than if you were to right-click on,
say, an icon on the desktop. Novices often don't play with this
feature, but it is very, very handy, and is a quick way to learn
about the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most people who use Microsoft Word, Microsoft Works
or Corel's WordPerfect probably cut or copy a word by highlighting
the word, then moving the mouse cursor to the button bar at the top
and hitting the Cut or Copy buttons. But you also can right-click
on the highlighted word and Cut and Copy will appear there as menu
choices. This is faster than dragging your mouse cursor across the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, though, when you add a third mouse button? Windows
doesn't have a natural use for a third button, though the software
that comes with these mice lets you program the middle button to do
things.
</P>
<P>
   On my system, for example, I have the middle button programmed
to act as a double-click. When I want to launch something that
doesn't respond naturally to the single-click feature of Windows
98, I use that middle button. When I was using Windows 95, which
didn't have the single-click option, I just about wore that middle
button out!
</P>
<P>
   Many mice now come with a wheel that doubles as a middle button.
The wheel is used to scroll up and down through long documents, and
it's great for reading Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   I use one of those four-button mice you talked about, a Logitech
MouseMan Wheel. The fourth button is where the thumb rests, and I
have it programmed to perform an auto-scroll _ click the button,
and all I have to do is move the mouse downwards and the page
scrolls automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's now a beta-test version of Internet Explorer 5 I can
get from Microsoft. I really like version 4, and I want to try 5,
but I have Windows 98. Since IE4 is integrated into the Windows
desktop, will installing 5 give me problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: It shouldn't give you any more problems than any other
beta-test software. Internet Explorer 5 is designed to work with
the Windows desktop, as is version 4, so you should not normally
anticipate any conflicts. I have it installed on a couple of
machines _ but not my everyday system _ and it seems to work just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   However, beta software is unfinished software. There is plenty
of work left to be done on IE5, and there are plenty of bugs in it.
If you have access to a secondary machine, I'd put it there first
before moving to the system that you use every day.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you buy the Office 2000 beta for Microsoft, it
will try real hard to convince you to install IE5, though it will
take no for an answer.

GROWING COMPANY NEEDS NIMBLE STAFF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Success, while wonderful, can breed its own kind of
problems. When a company is growing rapidly, sometimes not everyone
grows along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees embrace change and look for new challenges, but
some employees may lag behind, unable to keep up. It can be tough
to break out of that mold.
</P>
<P>
   M.W. ``Buddy'' Ellisor Jr., president of PolySpec Corp. in
Houston, has done a lot of thinking about that problem. His
industrial sealant and floor coating manufacturing firm has been
growing exponentially: It purchased two companies in the past two
years, and last year's sales reached $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ellisor is keen to grow the company _ he hopes to double sales
in the next three years _ and needs employees who have the
flexibility to fit into bigger roles.
</P>
<P>
   That's not always easy, Ellisor admits. Some employees have had
a hard time adjusting to new responsibilities or seeing the new
challenges as opportunities. They like the same old duties _ which
is often a matter of comfort, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common problem that's cropping up in a lot of companies
that have been restructuring lately, said Don Blohowiak, author of
the new book, ``Your People Are Your Product: How to Hire the Best
to Stay the Best'' (Chandler House Press). One of the most
stressful things is to have a job you're no longer qualified for.
</P>
<P>
   If an employee won't make the jump, Blohowiak suggests getting
together with the employee and laying out the new responsibilities
and what skills are required. Talk about the mismatch and ask the
employee what is needed to get up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   It's important not to make a judgment before that conversation
that the employee has to be demoted or dismissed. Give the employee
a chance to improve, he said. But specify a deadline _ for example,
that a decision will be made in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HIRE FOR TOMORROW'S JOB &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the problem from ever surfacing, it's critical to
find the right employees who can step up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Ellisor said he hires for what he envisions the job to be a year
or two down the line, not what it is today. That way, it's easier
to evaluate whether someone has what it takes to make it in a job
that may not even be created yet on the organizational chart.
</P>
<P>
   Ellisor said he looks for employees who have a lot of potential,
yet have been held back for one reason or another at a previous
job. Maybe they were in a dead-end job or maybe they'd have had to
transfer to another city to move up or maybe they were in a
stifling bureaucracy _ whatever the reason. It's like baseball, he
said. It's better to hire someone from the farm leagues with a lot
of potential than a superstar who's already made it.
</P>
<P>
   Ellisor said he recently hired three employees from a $3 billion
company who were used to operating in a sluggish, bureaucratic
environment that didn't reward new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Ellisor said that at first they were at a loss when Ellisor told
them of his ambitious sales goal and put them in charge of meeting
it. But pretty soon, the challenge energized the trio and they were
off and running.
</P>
<P>
   It's really a counter-intuitive strategy, said Steve Currall,
assistant professor of management and psychology at Rice University
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Initially they could be paralyzed, as Ellisor discovered, but if
the new environment encourages risk-taking, the employees could
become entrepreneurially driven, Currall said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOOK FOR FLEXIBILITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ellisor said he also looks for employees who are flexible
because job duties broaden, and he wants to ensure that the right
employee is in the right job. He recently shuffled the jobs of
three employees: the production assistant, inside salesperson and
order entry person. He said the employees in the newly defined jobs
are a better fit than they were in their previous jobs.
</P>
<P>
   If they weren't all willing to change, Ellisor said, the shift
would have been much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Blohowiak, who also is a management consultant in Princeton,
N.J., recommends that managers look for employees who show signs of
being learners.
</P>
<P>
   But don't just ask, Do you like to learn? because everyone would
say ``Yes,'' said Blohowiak. Instead, ask a job applicant how he
improved his skills during the past year or ask about how he solved
a problem he encountered at work. Find out what he learned from
that experience and what he would have done differently.
</P>
<P>
   Stay clear of applicants who say they did it as their boss
instructed them to, Blohowiak said. That's a sign of rigidity.

HISTORY HAUNTS A HUNT FOR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is not so much a race against time, which is too
clean, too much a cliche. No, Alice Winn's race now is against
death.
</P>
<P>
   She is 50 years old, has acute leukemia, and her sole hope for
survival is a bone marrow transplant, preferably within weeks. But
her doctors at Dana-Farber have combed through computer registries
the world over and have been unable to find a single suitable
donor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason for that _ an evil, maddening logic. Here in
the America of 1999, Winn's prognosis, her ability to survive, is
haunted by history, specifically the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   When Adolf Hitler presided over the mass extermination of
European Jews, he wiped out genealogies, cut off entire limbs of
family trees, and further diminished the ability of a people to
survive the natural ravages of time.
</P>
<P>
   And some 60 years later, Winn is another unlikely point of
proof. In the modern medical science of bone marrow transplants, a
suitable donor is usually found within someone's family, and if
not, within the ethnic group. In Winn's case, her siblings were not
suitable matches, and thus the search was extended.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the obvious problem. The vast majority of the six
million Jewish men, women, and children killed in the Holocaust
were, like Winn, Ashkenazi Jews. So when Winn's doctors broadened
the search, the pool of people with similar ethnic backgrounds
proved insufficient. Normally, one out of every 25,000 to 30,000
people would be a suitable donor, but such is not the case here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is another horrific legacy of Hitler's final solution,''
says Judi Krupp, a Jewish activist and a close friend of Winn's.
</P>
<P>
   But Winn will not be defeated, not easily. She is a strong,
resolute woman who has faced two months of punishing chemotherapy
treatments. Her disease is in what doctors fear is a brief
remission. She is a litigator in the state attorney general's
office, performing the largely unheralded work of defending the
Commonwealth against tort suits. She is a significant
philanthropist in the community and sits on the boards of
Dana-Farber as well as the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   She is also the mother of three successful children and the wife
of Arthur Winn, a well-known developer of subsidized housing and
the builder of the Bostonian Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   So the race is on. Dozens of people have rallied around their
reluctant, intensely private friend, putting together a bone marrow
drive scheduled for next weekend, Jan. 23 and 24. They specifically
are appealing to the Jewish community around Boston, hopeful that
if Ashkenazi Jews turn out to contribute blood, their match may be
made. The flip side is the unthinkable. Doctors warn that without a
donor, the leukemia will return within weeks or months, this time
more fiercely, this time against no line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cold mathematic exercise right now, and the odds are not
particularly favorable. Winn understands that she now exists in the
realm of the possible, the hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got 1,000 or 2,000 donors, there is a statistical chance
someone could be a donor,'' says Dr. Lawrence Shulman, her
oncologist. ``Even though it is not overwhelmingly likely one of
these people will be, it certainly is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The family takes tremendous heart in doctors' reassurances that
even though the marrow drive may not save Winn's life, it will
almost certainly, statistically speaking, turn up a bone marrow
match for someone else in need. In Massachusetts alone, there are
an estimated 250 people awaiting bone marrow transplants. But few,
if any, are in as dire a position as Winn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this because we have no choice,'' says her husband
of 27 years. ``This is the way we can save Alice's life. We know it
will definitiely save other lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So they hope and they pray as they contemplate a future that,
for now, is measured in weeks, and look for help from people they
have never met. They act somewhat embarrassed about seeking that
help, mostly because they are a couple who are used to giving
assistance, not getting it.

UNSPOOLING ART OF CINEMATOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's hands, light
and color become emotion. The sweeping epics ``Apocalypse Now,''
``The Last Emperor,'' ``Reds'' and ``Last Tango in Paris''
exemplify his ability to let visual surroundings tell the story in
an unspoken way.
</P>
<P>
   As for Storaro's skill with color, think back to ``Dick Tracy.''
The hues in this stylish adaptation of the comic strip were every
bit as bright as the movie posters in the theater lobby, which is
no common feat. Nor is it a coincidence that Storaro is a
three-time Academy Award winner, having collected Oscars for
``Apocalypse Now'' (1979), ``Reds'' (1981) and ``The Last Emperor''
(1987).
</P>
<P>
   The film series ``Writing and Light: The Cinematography of
Vittorio Storaro,'' getting under way at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, illustrates the achievements of a cinematic career
that spans 30 years and 40 films _ and continues today.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 tonight, ``The Conformist'' (1969) and ``Last Tango in
Paris'' (1972) will be paired. Both are collaborations of Storaro
and Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. At 7:30 p.m. Saturday,
director Warren Beatty stars in ``Reds'' with Diane Keaton and Jack
Nicholson in the epic film biography of left-wing journalist John
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The three-weekend series continues Jan. 22 with rare 70mm
screenings of two Francis Ford Coppola features, ``Apocalypse Now''
and ``One From the Heart.'' On Jan. 29, ``Dick Tracy'' and ``The
Sheltering Sky'' from 1990 will be paired. Storaro is scheduled to
attend the final event, a 7:30 p.m. screening of ``Tango,'' a
current release from Spain and that country's entry in the 1998
Oscar category for foreign-language films.
</P>
<P>
   LACMA's Bing Theatre is at 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles.

CLINTON TESTS LOTT ON GAY AMBASSADOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the time of the brutal murder of gay student Matthew Shepard,
President Clinton urged Americans to root out bigotry. It was
obvious that Clinton could start right there in Washington,
confronting powerful, antigay members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Clinton has made a start in that direction. This
week he did something he rarely has done in his presidency, stand
up for a principle. With little fanfare, he resubmitted the name of
James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, the 66-year-old philanthropist and Hormel meat heir,
would be the nation's first openly gay ambassador. White House
spokesman Barry Toiv said, ``We are hopeful that in the new
Congress fairness will prevail and he will have a chance to have
his nomination voted up or down. He is very well qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first try at nominating Hormel, the White House said it
had the support of 60 of the 100 senators. But Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott last year refused to let the nomination come to
the floor. Lott, influenced by loud objections by the far
right-wing, reportedly refused any meetings with Hormel, who tried
to soften the objections against him by saying he would not bring
his partner to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, is a well-known homophobe,
urging gay people to ``control'' their ``problem,'' comparing
homosexuality to kleptomania, alcoholism, and sex addiction. He
opposes federal antidiscrimination laws for gay and lesbian
workers, saying such laws are ``part of a larger and more audacious
effort to make the public accept behavior that most Americans
consider dangerous, unhealthy, or just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen what magic Clinton will work on Lott.
Perhaps Clinton sees enough momentum from the Democrats' success in
the midterm elections to win on such issues as Hormel. What is for
sure is that the primitive Lott is in even more need than ever to
cut his losses in the image department.
</P>
<P>
   This week The New York Times had a story about Lott's ties to
the Council of Conservative Citizens, a 15,000-member group that
grew out of the white supremacist citizens councils of the
mid-century. Two months ago, the council held its national
convention in Jackson, Miss., with Governor Kirk Fordice among the
300 people who sang ``Dixie'' amid Confederate flags, objects which
are like swastikas for African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Lott issued a statement condemning the group. Even
though 34 members of the Mississippi Legislature are members of the
group, even though the group runs Lott's newspaper column, and even
though the group has endorsed Lott in elections, Lott said he has
``no firsthand knowledge of the group's views.''But two months ago,
the Jackson Clarion-Ledger reported that several people at the
convention said that Lott was a member. In 1997, a smiling Lott
posed for a photograph with the council's state coordinator and
national president and executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The state coordinator, William Lord, said that Lott has appeared
at two rallies to raise funds for an all-white private school that
was created in Carroll County to let white children escape
desegregation. Lord said Lott gave a keynote speech to a national
board meeting of the council in 1992, reportedly saying, ``The
people in this room stand for the right principles and the right
philosophy. Let's take it in the right direction and our children
will be the beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``right direction,'' surprise, is segregation. A council
columnist wrote last fall: ``Western civilization, with all its
might and glory, would never have achieved its greatness without
the directing hand of God and the creative genius of the white
race. Any effort to destroy the race by a mixture of black blood is
an effort to destroy western civilization itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of this group having positive views about gay and
lesbian people is somewhere between none and nonexistent. Perhaps
Lott thought that if he could keep all that overt racism and
homophobia tucked away with his straight white buddies in
Mississippi, no one would pay him any attention.
</P>
<P>
   But the responsibility of holding a major Senate post can nudge
bigots into the 20th century. Hormel's nomination made it out of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a committee chaired by none
other than Jesse Helms, whose views on homosexuals is as nasty as
Lott's.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has said The New York Times and The Washington Post are
``infested'' with homosexuals. He called homosexuality
``sickening.'' But Helms has 17 other members on his committee, few
of whom desire Helms or Lott's vituperate image on homosexuality.
The nomination was approved by the committee. It will probably be
approved again. Then it will be up to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Now facing a rising scrutiny of his own behavior, Lott might
reconsider. He could start with the words of Republican colleague
Jim Jeffords of Vermont. Jeffords, a supporter of gay rights, said,
``People who work hard and perform well should not be kept from
leading productive and responsible lives because of an irrational,
nonwork-related prejudice.''

CUNNINGHAM REBORN WITH WINNING SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The images of the Vikings that overwhelm are two.
</P>
<P>
   The first is Randy Moss racing down the sideline _ almost always
down the sideline, seldom over the middle _ and hauling in a long
pass. It is a Sunday night staple on the highlight reels.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Randall Cuningham throwing that long pass from the
pocket _ almost always from the pocket, seldom while scrambling for
his football life _ and completing that pass. It, too, is a Sunday
night staple on the highlight reels.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be that simple?
</P>
<P>
   That Randall Cunningham has found a new life, been born again,
been saved from the football trash heap because he has three wide
receivers who are well nigh uncoverable and because now he stays in
the pocket and picks and chooses his goodies, whether to throw the
ball to Moss or Cris Carter or Jake Reed?
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia seems so far away. The scrambling, the running
around, the need as Cunningham saw it to make all the big plays
himself, the compulsion because he was so nimble afoot to run as
well as throw. Staying in the pocket was for all those other
quarterbacks, the ones who didn't have as much talent.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, The Philadelphia Story. The booing, the anger, the
tirades, the sulking, the losses, that final inglorious exit from
the Vet. The End.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I used to press to make things happen,'' said
Cunningham, the Vikings quarterback. ``That's because I thought
that's what I was supposed to do. Now I see other guys can get the
job done and I hand the ball off. It wears you out, trying to make
the impossible play.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Cunningham is one game away from the Super Bowl, a
prospect that truly was improbable, if not impossible, two short
years ago. If the Vikings can beat the Falcons in the NFC
Championship Game Sunday _ no easy task, that _ then Cunningham
will have validated this Year of the Codger QB, what with Vinny
Testaverde of the Jets back from his own funeral, Buffalo's Doug
Flutie rediscovered after almost a decade in Canada, and so many
others.
</P>
<P>
   There was one time when he really wondered if he'd get to such a
big game as Sunday's, said Cunningham. ``There were times when I
just felt it wasn't there for us (with the Eagles). It didn't
happen those times. It didn't work out. But now I feel totally
different. It's working out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So much about Cunningham looks the same, even if his face has
many more lines of age. His arm is still very strong, his passes
accurate, and _ just as in Philadelphia _ once the game is done,
Cunningham is the last to meet the media. And, also as in
Philadelphia, he meets the media with his trench coat or overcoat
on, always buttoned to the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the voice.
</P>
<P>
   So soft now.
</P>
<P>
   The words.
</P>
<P>
   So gentle now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' replied Cunningham when asked if his wildest
imagination two years ago could have conjured this, being one game
away from the Super Bowl. ``I never did.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be in the Super Bowl,'' Cunningham said, with soft
determination more than passion, ``and we want to be in there
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham says he has found God and God has changed him
in so many ways, softened him, mellowed him, given him
understanding, and whatever happens on the football field is minor
compared to what has happened to change his life. Usually, sports
media tread lightly when athletes bring up their personal beliefs,
but with Cunningham, those beliefs cannot be ignored because his
transformation has been so pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided two years ago just to do everything through
Jesus,'' he said, ``and look what happened. The Bible says you can
do everything through Christ, and that's just what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Here his words became filled with passion. ``When I got my life
right and became a strong Christian instead of a hypocrite, my
faith in God changed my life,'' he said. ``I can hope for things
now instead of just wondering, `What can I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, said Cunningham, ``I know I've matured. Right now
I'm really mature, mature as far as my life is concerned. Things
are really coming together for me now, and when I look over my
career, I look at the mistakes I've made. So I'm really calm about
what I do. I appreciate everything more.''
</P>
<P>
   What is true for the Vikings is also clearly true for him.
``What's so great about our team,'' he said, ``is that we don't go
through too many highs and we don't go through highs and lows.
We're appreciative of being in the situation we're in, being able
to go for the NFC championship, but we're not overly high about it.
We don't plan on this being the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham and the Vikings represent football's version of the
chicken-or-egg question. Is Cunningham so good now because of the
abundant offensive talent around him, or is that talent so good
because Cunningham has changed so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really a combination of both,'' he replied.
``Because of the people around me, now I can play a different style
of quarterback. I can be confident now when I step on the field
instead of trying to make everything happen myself. I have so many
guys to bring the ball to.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Eagles, he said, ``I was pressuring myself to make the
big plays because that's what I was told to do. But here, to see
other guys make it happen, gosh, just to hand it off and Robert
(Smith) has gained 7 yards and now we have a second and 3? That's
great. Like, in game preparation, I'm not looking for the extra
things that I have to do to make things happen or thinking I have
to scramble around the corner and try to throw a bomb because we're
down a touchdown or something. I just continue with the game
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Those weapons present many problems for opposing defenses. The
Vikings can throw, catch, run. Defenses can't overload on any one
player or on the run or the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the defense has to decide who they're going to double
or if they're going to double any (of the Vikings receivers),''
said Cunningham. ``It's hard to double Cris or Randy because we
still have (tight end) Andrew Glover in there and David Palmer
coming out of the backfield or Robert or LeRoy (Hoard) to run the
ball. Usually, there's some kind of coverage where we have
mismatches.''
</P>
<P>
   The results: Cunningham threw 34 TD passes in 1998, the most in
the NFL, led all QBs with a rating of 106.0, threw four TD passes
in four games, and, even though he's the all-time leader in rushing
for a QB with nearly 4,500 yards, gained only 132 yards on 32
carries.
</P>
<P>
   If a football observer ``looks at the teams still in the
playoffs,'' said Cunningham, ``if you look at the Broncos and if
you look at the Jets, these are teams that try to make things
happen on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But one who does not try to make things happen, but lets them
happen, is the quarterback of the Vikings. ``I just try to let guys
do their job,'' said Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Not the ``old'' Randall Cunningham, the 34-year-old who came out
of Las Vegas 14 years ago. But the new Randall Cunningham.

PASSIONATE, POIGNANT VIEW OF THE DU PRE SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HILARY AND JACKIE 
Directed by: Anand Tucker 
Screenplay by: Frank Cottrell Boyce (based on Hilary and Piers du
Pre's memoir, ``A Genius in the Family'') 
Starring: Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, David Morrissey, James
Frain, Charles Dance, Celia Imre, Rupert Penry Jones 
Running time: 121 minutes 
Rated: R (language and sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies like to portray genius as unstable. It's their way of
making us comfortable about not being geniuses. But ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' incredibly, blasts its way past the usual genius crack-up
cliches. That's because it wraps its sad depiction of the meteoric
rise, decline, and death of British cellist Jacqueline du Pre into
the context of a tempestuous and complicated sister relationship.
Jackie, as she's called in the film, was classical music's golden
girl of the 1960s and early '70s, both before and after she married
another star, pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim. As if
single-handedly flinging aside the reserve of her compatriots, she
threw herself into her playing with passionate expressiveness and
searching musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a dark side to her story, told in 1997 by her
sister, Hilary, and their brother, Piers, in their memoir, ``A
Genius in the Family.'' Hilary was a musician, too, a flutist. Like
Jackie, Hilary was a prodigy, driven by parental prodding and, even
more intensely, by sibling rivalry. When they were both in their
teens, Jackie overtook Hilary in acclaim and accomplishment,
partly, the film tells us, because Jackie made contact with an
encouraging teacher, while Hilary's talent was scotched by an
inhibiting martinet. Jackie had the big career. Hilary married a
young conductor, had two children, and moved to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the scandalizing part. In 1971, while married to
Barenboim, Jackie turned up at her sister's farm, saying her nerves
were frayed by the pressure of touring. She wanted some peace and
quiet. She also insisted on sharing Hilary's husband, Kiffer Finzi.
Her strong will prevailed, but it obviously was a situation that
couldn't last. Two years later, du Pre's erratic behavior was
attributed to the onset of multiple sclerosis, a degenerative nerve
disease. It ended her career at the age of 28. In 1987, after years
of immobility, it ended her life. Clearly, there were other forces
at work on her, and the film is nothing if not volatile as it
depicts her highly charged life and career.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the love and resentment is no easy task, and the
film could have easily degenerated into a settling of old scores.
Wisely, it alternates the sisters' viewpoints, making clear that
the empathy and intimacy between them was subjected to tremendous
pressures from the competitiveness instilled in them by their
genuinely devoted, but just as genuinely benighted, parents. The
film portrays Jackie as having lifelong insecurity because Hilary
at first seemed the family star. This insecurity culminates in
Jackie competing for Finzi, especially after Hilary tells Jackie he
makes her feel special.
</P>
<P>
   The two central performances are propelled by an exhilarating
force of daring. If you thought Emily Watson's performance was
revelatory in ``Breaking the Waves,'' there's even more to be
amazed by in this film, starting with a rare level of emotional
rawness. Working without a net from beginning to end, Watson throws
herself at the role as fearlessly as du Pre threw herself at the
cello, and with as little acknowledgment of limits. Never playing
for sympathy, she isn't afraid to portray Jackie as a bit of a
monster. In addition to a loose-cannon sensuality, she also conveys
Jackie's ambivalent attitude toward her instrument. If it was her
ticket to the world, it was also her prison, a circumstance
expressed in surrealistic ways. Du Pre's signature piece was the
ripely romantic Elgar Concerto for Cello and Orchestra. One of her
recordings was used (Caroline Dale plays the other cello music),
but Watson obviously has studied du Pre's videos, too, and attacks
the instrument with du Pre's uninhibited directness.
</P>
<P>
   Just as memorable is the performance by the hitherto
underappreciated Australian actress Rachel Griffiths as the less
spectacular, less aggressive, but more sympathetic of the two
sisters. (The film was taken from Hilary's book, after all.)
Griffiths always makes us feel the mixed emotions and the pain
beneath her calm and control. Also, to the credit of both book and
film, we feel the intense closeness between the sisters. The men _
David Morrissey's Finzi, James Frain's Barenboim, Rupert Henry
Jones's Piers _ are strictly peripheral figures here. ``Hilary and
Jackie'' is a sister act all the way, and it's a terrific one.

SIDES GEAR ARUGMENTS TO ARITHMETIC OF THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In theory, the Senate impeachment trial is being
heard by 100 jurors sworn to ``impartial justice.'' But just
beneath the surface, this group of politicians is divided into at
least four key factions: leaners, doubters, constitutionalists and
campaign 2000 worriers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the House prosecutors and White House defense
lawyers are tailoring their arguments with an eye toward each
faction. Thursday, for example, the House ``managers'' had two
goals. First, they sought to assure Republicans who lean toward
conviction that the case is strong enough to minimize the risk of
voter backlash. Second, their message to doubtful Republicans from
states where Clinton is popular was that they should suspend
judgment until the case is made.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers, meanwhile, have a parallel game plan that
will be on display when they deliver opening arguments next week.
The White House wants to reassure Democrats who lean to acquittal
that there are no surprises, which is one reason the White House
opposes any testimony by witnesses. Then the White House lawyers
aim to assure the constitutionalists such as Senator Robert Byrd of
West Virginia that the charges against Clinton, even if true,
aren't impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The key to keeping the factions in line may be whether the case
is perceived as ``just about sex'' _ and the effort to conceal it _
as the White House lawyers argue, or whether it is seen as one
built on irrefutable evidence of perjury and obstruction of
justice, as the House managers maintain.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is vital to the outcome because Clinton's fate
likely will be decided by a small faction of the Senate. A look at
the mathematics of impeachment explains why. It takes two-thirds,
or 67 of 100 votes to convict the president, which probably would
happen only if all 55 Republicans and at least 12 Democrats join
together.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it only takes 51 votes, a majority, to dismiss
the case, probably meaning that all 45 Democrats would join with
six Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, just like in a political campaign, each side starts with
the goal of maintaining their base. The House managers want all 55
Republicans to stick together at least through the early part of
the trial and avoid a dismissal vote, while the defense team hopes
all 45 Democrats are ready at any time to vote for dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the case is likely to be decided by a half
dozen or so moderate Republicans, including four New Englanders,
who might vote for dismissal; or, a dozen Democrats who might vote
for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an analysis of the Senate factions that could determine
the president's fate:
</P>
<P>
   --Doubters. Much of the focus has been on a group of moderate
Republicans who are believed to have doubts whether Clinton should
be convicted and are from states where Clinton is popular: Senators
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of
Vermont, John Chafee, Slate Gorton of Washington and Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the White House hoped this half dozen would join
with Democrats to dismiss the case. But in the past several weeks,
all these Republicans have indicated they want the trial to go
forward at least for awhile so they can weigh the evidence. Yet
while the White House hope for a quick dismissal of the case has
faded, Clinton's lawyers are still targeting this group for later
dismissal or a vote against conviction. The House prosecution,
meanwhile, is tailoring its case to convince the doubters there is
enough evidence against the president to merit a full hearing that
includes live testimony from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   --Campaign 2000 worriers. Of the 55 Republicans, 19 are up
reelection next year.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 19, according to political analyst Stuart Rothenberg,
five come from states where Clinton is popular and are expected to
face tough challenges: Senators Rod Gramms of Minnesota, John
Ashcroft of Missouri, Spencer Abraham of Michigan, Rick Santorum of
Pennsylvania and Gorton. In addition, senators viewed as stronger
candidates for reelection such as Chafee and Snowe also may be
concerned about their 2000 races.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollsters recently warned party leaders there could
be a voter backlash against senators who support conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said two senators who are trying to measure the
potential impact of all this on next election are Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who
heads the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. The top
priority for both men is to retain GOP control of the Senate, so
they might have the greatest interest in assuring that the
impeachment trial doesn't get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   --Leaners. Both sides in the case assume the majority of
Republicans lean toward conviction and the majority of Democrats
lean toward acquittal. So far, no Democrats have publicly said they
plan to vote to convict Clinton. Senator Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, who has delivered some of the harshest criticism of
Clinton's behavior, has said that he might vote for acquittal even
if he is convinced Clinton committed perjury. Yet Lieberman is
viewed by the House managers as the sort of moderate Democrat who
might convict the president if obstruction of justice is proven.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have said they wouldn't vote for conviction based
on the evidence they have seen so far. The question is whether
these Democrats will vote to allow witnesses, who might reveal new
information.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans have said there is a strong case for
conviction, many have remained silent, waiting to view the evidence
and see how the public reacts to the case.
</P>
<P>
   --Constitutionalists. Both sides in the case are appealing to
this group. While every senator says he or she will abide by the
Constitution, the reality is the same words in the Constitution are
interpreted differently. Democrats such as Byrd and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York are most frequently cited as senators who
might vote for conviction if they see no choice under the
Constitution, although Moynihan has indicated he favors censure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself appealed directly to this group on Wednesday,
saying, ``The important thing I think you should be asking yourself
is why did nearly 900 constitutional experts say that they strongly
felt that this matter was not the subject of impeachment?''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers sought to counter that argument Thursday,
reminding senators that the Constitution specifically made bribery
an impeachable offense, and that the Senate has equated perjury
with bribery in establishing federal sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury is the twin brother of bribery,'' Representative F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican and one of 13
House managers, said during opening arguments Thursday. ``By making
the penalty for perjury the same as that for bribery, Congress has
acknowledged that both crimes are equally serious.''

LESS RISK PART OF SHIFT IN RETIREMENT SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We are contemplating life after the kids finish college. This
49-year-old ``boomer'' and his 48-year-old wife have the following
assets, all in mutual funds, all earmarked for retirement: $120,000
in a SEP-IRA, $30,000 in an IRA, $70,000 in a 401(k), and $30,000
in other investments. I contribute $19,500 annually to the SEP-IRA
accounts, with $14,500 going to Fidelity Contrafund and $5,000 to
Bond Fund of America, and I add $5,500 a year to the assorted
mutual fund accounts. My wife and her employer add about $7,000 a
year to her 401(k). Would you invest the money going into the SEP
accounts any differently? If we continue to set aside funds at the
current rate and retire in 10 years, what would our nest egg and
retirement income be?
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Specifically, if you have the lion's share of the money in
stock funds and if you get average annual portfolio returns of 10
percent, the pool and the ongoing $32,000 annual contributions
would grow to $1,181,905 after 10 years _ at least on paper. If the
allocation of your SEP contributions generally reflect the total
portfolio makeup _ 75 percent equities and 25 percent fixed-income
_ an assumption of 8 percent average annual growth would be more
appropriate. That would take the accounts to $1,020,369 after a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   What might you expect as an income stream? Depending, of course,
on how much capital people have to work with, I generally suggest
that a significant part of their retirement savings be held aside
for long-term growth during the first 10 or 15 years of retirement.
You might put $200,000 of your retirement savings in this category,
leaving between $820,000 and $980,000 to supply an income stream.
Taking the most cautious route in which you spent only the yield
produced by a fixed-income portfolio, this would bring you a
retirement income between $53,300 and $63,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If you took another approach, you might ask how much these
savings pools could bring you if you estimated a specific period of
time during which you would make withdrawals, with the level of
withdrawals designed to deplete the savings pool by the end of the
period. You might calculate that you could withdraw between $75,840
and $87,732 a year, with the level dependent on whether you used
the 8 percent or 10 percent portfolio growth assumption. All of
these income stream figures are based on a presumed 6.5 percent
average from a fixed-income portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you, I'd make my plans at this point based on the
lower set of figures. You're precisely at the age when you can no
longer think of retirement savings as a long-term program; you've
just entered the intermediate-term investment time frame. For one
thing, that means it's time to think about some reduction in your
level of risk. And it means you can't be as confident as you were 5
or 10 years ago that a stock-dominated portfolio will deliver the
goods. For those reasons, I'd aim for the lower-risk portfolio and
make my plans based on the lower growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you don't give enough details about your overall
portfolio for me to make any very pungent suggestions. Certainly
both the funds you are using are excellent entries in their
categories. But remember what I've been saying to others _
diversification goes beyond owning a number of funds. Make sure
you're diversified among fund sectors as well _ with mid-caps,
small-caps, health care and international offerings holding down 40
percent to 50 percent of the stock portfolio, and with the domestic
large-caps such as Contrafund representing no more than 50 percent
to 60 percent of your stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I would like to retire around age 60 with an
income of $2,000 a month. We are now 46, our home is paid for, and
our children are grown. We have $24,000 in savings earning 5.55
percent, $30,000 in mutual fund IRAs in the Fidelity and Galaxy
families, $15,000 in bank CDs earning 4.75 percent, $30,000 in a
former employer's 401(k) invested with Fidelity, $100,000 in my
present employer's 401(k) invested with Vanguard, and $2,000 in an
annuity. We add $60 a week to my 401(k) and $35 a month to the
annuity. And my wife adds $400 biweekly to a savings account, now
earning 2.75 percent, and I put the same amount into a demand note
earning 5.55 percent with the same frequency. Does our goal seem
attainable?
</P>
<P>
   G.V., Blackstone, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right on track.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: If you achieved an average 6.5 percent return
from a fixed-income portfolio, you would need $370,000 to provide a
$24,000 annual income stream without invading the principal.
</P>
<P>
   What you probably want is to have $2,000 worth of buying power
in today's money when you retire. And second, I'll bet that what
you also want is to keep on having that same buying power, no
matter what happens with inflation after you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that inflation runs at a 3 percent average for the
next 14 years. The effect of this is that suddenly that $370,000
jumps to $559,658. And if we raise the ante to a 4 percent presumed
inflation rate, the pool jumps to $640,720. So all of a sudden what
seemed like that very comfortable margin has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. If you keep up with contributions at your current
rate, again achieving average 8 percent annual portfolio gains,
your pool would be $1,201,068 after 14 years. That would be the
equivalent of $794,047 in today's money if inflation runs at 3
percent; if it's 4 percent, the number would be $693,586.
</P>
<P>
   How reasonable is that expectation of 8 percent average returns?
It depends on how your IRA and 401(k) money is invested. If those
accounts, which represent nearly 80 percent of your savings, are
primarily invested in stock-dominated funds, you should be in good
shape. If, on the other hand, they're primarily in fixed-income
funds such as bonds or money markets, the 8 percent assumption is
probably stretching it. If the investments are dominantly on the
fixed-income side, I suggest you begin a program of slowly moving
some of the money into stock-oriented funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and I'm sure you expected this, please urge your wife
to lose that 2.75 percent savings account. She could achieve better
than 5 percent yield if she moved to a mutual fund money market
account, and while she would be adding an infinitesimal level of
risk, she would lose no liquidity through such a change.

FAMILY ROOTS TANGLED IN LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acertain mystery attends the Institute for a Civil Society,
which calls itself a ``nonprofit organization that provides funding
and technical assistance for innovative grass-roots organizations
working on community science policy, health-care reform, and
educational reform.'' Founded in 1996, the institute has doled out
millions of dollars in grants to sundry causes. Earlier this week,
it forked out $1.5 million to rescue Bob Coles's superb magazine
DoubleTake. Other recipients include John Rosenthal's Stop Handgun
Violence, the Rev. Eugene Rivers's Ten Point Coalition, and the
Ella J. Baker Home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   From day one, president Pam Solo has scrupulously avoided naming
the ``anonymous New England family'' that committed $35 million to
start the institute, located in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The family in question is the Lutzes of Cambridge, New York
City, and Perkinsville, Vt. According to the latest filings at the
state attorney general's Office of Charities, Solo isn't even the
institute's president, as she has claimed. She is identified as a
``clerk-director,'' earning salary and benefits slightly over
$200,000. The president of record is Christopher Lutz of Cambridge,
who draws no salary. (Institute senior fellow Gail Pressberg says
the board, which consists of Lutz family members and Solo, recently
changed Lutz's title to chairman and Solo is now president.)
</P>
<P>
   While hardly a household name in New England, the Lutzes have a
rather astonishing history, one that may explain their penchant for
privacy. Christopher Lutz is the son of Herbert ``Whitey'' Lutz, a
man who made his money the old-fashioned way: He married it. One of
his wives was Evelyn ``Evie'' Lilly, who became Christopher's
stepmother. Evie was the great-granddaughter of Colonel Eli Lilly,
who founded the $8.5 billion pharmaceutical firm that bears his
name. (Key word: Prozac.) Through her mother, Evie was also heir to
a stack of cash from Colonel Lilly's onetime compadre, William
Fortune _ remember that name.
</P>
<P>
   Bad publicity has haunted the Lutzes for years. Evie predeceased
Whitey, leaving him a substantial legacy. But when Whitey died in
1982, his third wife, Elena Yee, battled with Christopher Lutz over
Whitey's estate. The case was a colorful spectacle, featuring the
youngish Yee _ she was 40 years younger than Whitey _ and her two
celebrity lawyers, former Los Angeles mayor Sam Yorty and the
self-styled ``King of Torts,'' Melvin Belli of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Indiana Court of Appeals, Whitey had been
declared incompetent. Christopher sued in Vermont, the Virgin
Islands, and Indiana to keep his father's estate from the clutches
of the woman The Indianapolis Star called Lutz's ``mysterious
Oriental wife.'' Although she called herself ``the Lilly heiress''
(and, untruthfully, a former US ambassador to China), Yee got only
half the estate. Belli and Yorty later sued their flamboyant client
for unpaid bills, a litigation spiced up considerably by Belli's
testimony that he had sexual relations with Yee while representing
her.
</P>
<P>
   Remember William Fortune? According to the Indianapolis Business
Journal, another vast probate dispute is shaping up over his
legacy, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The
childless Evie Lilly legally adopted Christopher's young daughter
Sarah Lutz. So through Evie, Sarah is now a beneficiary of William
Fortune's estate, a situation that pits her against William
Fortune's six grandchildren.

   The David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at

Untold Story of the American Coup in Guatemala.'' ``Fruit,''
written by former Globe Latin American correspondent Stephen Kinzer
(now with The New York Times) and Stephen Schlesinger, is a minor
classic and an all-Boston story. The villainous, banana-mongering
United Fruit company was headquartered here, and their story is
waist-high in Cabots and Lodges. United Fruit's PR adviser Edward
Bernays lived here for years, and I rubbed shoulders with former
exec Tom McCann, author of ``The Tragedy of United Fruit,'' just

SOME ANSWERS TO LOCKOUT QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The NBA ended its lockout nine days ago, meaning people
no longer have to ask if there will be a season before October
1999. But that's only one answered question. There are several
post-lockout questions still in need of answers. Here are eight of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Question 1: Where's Antoine?
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Antoine Walker said he would be in Boston Tuesday.
Today is Friday. Walker is not in Boston. Many have wondered if the
third-year Celtics forward plans to ride into the North End from
Chicago via horseback. There has also been speculation that the
Celtics do not know of his whereabouts and are unhappy with his
absence from the team's voluntary strength and conditioning
program.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Walker is in Chicago. The Celtics know this because they
have talked with him several times this week. The talks have not
been acrimonious. No one is disappointed or angry with anyone else.
Walker was originally booked on an American Airlines flight from
Chicago to Boston Monday. His original flight and several later
ones were canceled. The next day, he began taking care of some
personal and family business which would keep him in Chicago until
the end of the week. He called Rick Pitino and told him that; the
coach said it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about Antoine,'' Pitino said Thursday. ``I
know he's just not at home doing nothing. I know he's in shape.
He's a basketball junkie. Some guys play golf for their enjoyment.
Not Antoine. His enjoyment is playing basketball, watching
basketball, and talking about basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Question 2: Why isn't Pitino angry at Walker, the team captain,
for not being here?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The coach has known Walker long enough to know that he
keeps himself in shape. He works out for three hours each day. And
since the coach is also an author, he is familiar with
dictionaries. In them, he has come across the word ``voluntary''
and learned its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Question 3: Where's Dontae?
</P>
<P>
   Dontae Jones, a man who truly knows the art of watching a game,
has not been spotted yet. Jones knows how to watch because, of a
possible 164 games he could have played in his career, he has
appeared in 15. And in those 15, he averaged six minutes. And in
those six minutes, he found a way to take only five fewer
3-pointers than Ron Mercer. Jones is loved by his teammates because
of his wit. He tends to annoy his coaches because of his sense of
time (he set a Knicks record with more than $80,000 in fines in
1996-97).
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Well, let's just say the Celtics aren't looking for him.
He will most likely be a Celtic because they will not be able to
find many teams willing to trade for him, unless it is part of a
larger package. But when _ or if _ he does come here, he will go
back to watching. Paul Pierce, Walter McCarty, Bruce Bowen, Mercer,
and Greg Minor will take any minutes he could receive.
</P>
<P>
   Question 4: What's up with the schedule?
</P>
<P>
   You may be wondering when Larry Bird and the Pacers are coming
to the FleetCenter. You may be wondering when you can buy a
single-game ticket for a night of watching Knicks, Nets, or
Cavaliers. You may be wondering because the NBA schedule has not
been released.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Word is that the schedule will be complete Tuesday. At
that time, teams could put their tickets on sale. Pitino and the
Celtics are not eagerly anticipating the schedule's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a bad schedule,'' the coach predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FleetCenter is booked for most of February, the
Celtics will almost certainly spend most of the month on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Question 5: Why do players and coaches talk about Shaun Brown
with such reverence?
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the team's strength and conditioning coach. He and
trainer Ed Lacerte have supervised the team's voluntary workouts at
Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Brown may be the most important Celtic in the first few
weeks of the season. Everyone acknowledges that conditioning will
be a factor early. So Brown is the man trying to make sure the
Celtics have conditioning as an advantage. Long before the lockout,
he gave the players a workout plan to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you ask him to do, he finds a way to make it
happen,'' Pitino said. ``I've seen him take 100 pounds off (current
76er) Nazr Mohammed and help him keep it off. I've seen him put 30
pounds on Walter McCarty.''
</P>
<P>
   Question 6: McCarty has a thimble-thin body and has trouble
keeping on weight. How did he gain 30 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Brown put him on an amazing 12,000-calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
   Question 7: Will the Celtics be able to sign Popeye Jones or
anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Going strictly by the numbers, the Celtics have a
one-in-six chance of adding the 6-foot-8-inch Jones, an
above-average rebounder. That's how many teams, at least, are in
pursuit. The number could be as high as 12. If Jones does not stay,
the Celtics still have options for bringing in decent big men. They
have a little more than $1 million to use if Pervis Ellison is out
for the season. They can also use an additional $1.7 million
exception as a starting point for another free agent. That won't be
enough to get Matt Geiger, but it can lure some big men to the
parquet.
</P>
<P>
   Question 8: Antoine Walker wears No. 8. Where is he again?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: In Chicago. En route to Boston. Via airplane.

WAX, DO NOT PAINT ALL EDGES OF SASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am replacing the weighted window sash in my house with new
double hung sash, and will fill the weight pockets, and am ready to
prime and paint. I would normally paint all sides, surfaces and
edges, but I understandthat I should not paint the vertical edges,
where the windows run in grooves in the jamb. If I should not paint
the edges, what can I do with them?
</P>
<P>
   JACK CAHILL, Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Leave the edges plain, untreated wood. This will allow better
movement of the sash up and down, reducing friction and keeping the
sash the right size. Painting not only widens the window (very
little, but it can be enough to inerfere with its function), but
also sometimes uncured or not completely dry paint can make things
much worse. But here is one thing you can do: rub the edges
thoroughly with wax. This will not only reduce friction but also
help prevent moisture from entering the wood and swelling the sash.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the face of the sash (indoors and out), don't
forget to paint the top and bottom edges of each sash and the check
rail, where the two sash meet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a wood stove and have had good luck with a creosote
cleaner that keeps the flue from building up excessive creosote. I
also brush (sweep) my chimney often. I noticed that the main
ingredient of the creosote cleaner I have been using is trisodium
phosphate (TSP). I've been wondering: TSP is a a lot cheaper than
my creosote cleaner, so would it work as well as the cleaner in my
chimney?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE CREEGAN, Somersworth, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. A short answer to a long question: Why not? Make yourself a
guinea pig and try it. If it works, fine; if not, there is no harm
done. One wonders just how much is the ``main ingredient,'' but it
still is worth trying. Just don't mix it with ammonia and/or
bleach; there is no reason that you would, but it's just a standard
warning against mixing various materials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The kids got crayon on a bluestone hearth. Neither alcohol
nor Windex worked. How can I get it off?
</P>
<P>
   CINDY STONE, Wrentham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape off any gross part that can be scraped, then try
DeSolvit, if you can find it in a hardware stores. Also, apply a
little toothpaste and brushing the stone. We got that information
from Marguerite Jablonski of Medfield, Mass. (Hey, said Cindy
Stone, I know Peg Jablonski!). It certainly is nice that you know
her; it's a small world, eh? Also, Thelma Dame of Guilford, N.H.,
told us she used Ultra-Brite toothpaste to clean crayon from
marble. If it works for marble, it also should work for bluestone
and other stone or stonelike material.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The epoxy paint on my basement floor held up well for years,
but now, after some flooding, it is flaking. How can I remove it,
and what can I put on it that will last?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK BASHORE, Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try a paint remover such as Citristrip (it has a citrus
base), but make sure it is nonflammable because there are heating
units in the basement. Or, rent a grinder from a rental store.
Don't use a sanding machine; the concrete dust will ruin it. Then
apply a concrete stain, which will resist peeling. Muralo makes one
with quite a few colors to choose from, sold in paint stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My kitchen cabinets are made of particleboard coated with a
resin. Near the oven, some of the doors have developed very fine,
hairline cracks. How can I remove them?
</P>
<P>
   DOROTHY FELDMAN, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the cracks are the same color as the door, and don't show
too much, I think it is best to live with them. If they are a
different color and sort of stand out, try this: Sand thoroughly
and apply a satin or eggshell finish latex wall paint. You will
probably never get the right sheen, but I think it is your best
bet. Of course, sand and paint the whole door, not just the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In my six-room house, all the steam radiators have covers,
but I don't get much heat from them. Would it be the fault of the
covers?
</P>
<P>
   MARY McKENNA, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the covers cover just the tops of the radiators, it is not
the fault of the covers; it probably is the fault of the steam
valves, those shiny valves at the high end of each radiator. They
are not opening when the steam comes up, so little or no steam gets
into the radiators. To fix, try this: Unscrew a valve and boil it
in vinegar or just plain water; sometimes a bit of grit gets into
it and disables it. If that doesn't work, replace the valve.
</P>
<P>
   If your radiators have enclosures, covering the entire radiator,
it still probably is not the enclosures' fault, if the enclosures
are designed correctly. An enclosure should be open in the front
(there is usually a grille), with a three- to four-inch opening
along the bottom of the front. This allows cool air to enter at the
bottom, be heated by the hot radiator, rise up, and come out the
front.
</P>

A DOUR-FACED GENTLEMAN POL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After World War II, a crew of veterans from Western
Massachusetts met regularly at a Springfield diner to swap personal
dreams and hatch political schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster Furcolo became governor. Larry O'Brien hitched his wagon
to a star named Kennedy. John Thompson became speaker of the
Massachusetts House, a legendary character who flamed out as ``The
Iron Duke.'' The fourth was Maurice Donahue of Holyoke, who died
Wednesday at 80.
</P>
<P>
   A state legislator for 26 years, he was Senate president from
1964 to 1970, when he ran for governor and finished second in a
field of four in the Democratic primary behind Kevin White, who
then lost to Frank Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue was not quite the last link to World War II veterans in
politics _ US Representative Joe Moakley ran away to the Navy as an
underage sailor. But Donahue was the last sitting legislative
leader to mount a serious bid for statewide office. He ran as a
dour, unsmiling, gravel-voiced gavel-wielder of the old school, and
Kevin White's more media-savvy ways put paid to Donahue's old-style
reliance on unions, endorsements, and personal relationships with
powerful interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's there to smile about?'' was a throwaway line crafted
for Donahue, I thought by his onetime gagwriter, Dick Flavin. But
Flavin Thursday credited a Holyoke ad man, Maurice Casey, with
coming up with that attempt to humanize Donahue's grim visage and
forbidding mien. If you think of successful politicians as media
massagers, then Bill Clinton would be at the top of the scale, and
Maurice Donahue at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Even his loyal protege, David Bartley, who became House speaker
and is now president of Holyoke Community College, jokes about
Donahue's cranky, crabby image. But Flavin credited Donahue as a
gifted teacher and skilled parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Harrington, who succeeded Donahue as president, said
Thursday from Florida: ``Of all leaders I've known, Maurice Donahue
was the only one who was genuinely loved by everyone who served
under him, of both political parties. Some leaders operate with
fear. But he was the only guy I ever saw for whom the affection was
almost tactile.''
</P>
<P>
   A pretelevision candidate in the television age, Donahue looked
like a classic heavy. ``In public, he never smiled,'' said
Harrington. ``I remember when Judge J. John Fox was going through
some photos, looking for a picture he could use in that '70
campaign. Fox said the only pictures with Maurice smiling were when
he was surrounded by fellow legislators. Donahue should hever have
left; he was happiest in the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is a given that legislative leaders cannot win higher
office, and few even try. ``You can't hide from too many tough
decisions,'' said Harrington, ``and you are seen by the public as
responsible for all the peccadilloes of the people serving with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue never married; he had a brother who was a priest and
leaves two surviving sisters. One of his legislative colleagues,
former state Senator George V. ``Gi-gi'' Kenneally Jr., died
Monday, at 69, in Florida. Kenneally was a hail-fellow-well-met
Dorchester pol, lighthearted and gregarious in a way Donahue was
not.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue was popular with fellow legislators and old-time
political reporters, with whom he'd unbend, but he formed an
abiding mistrust of the media during the seven-year struggle of
Republican Governor John Volpe, Boston newspapers, and the
political establishment to impose a sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe eventually won the sales tax tong war, but Donahue had a
measure of revenge. When Volpe was upset in the 1962 governor's
race by Endicott ``Chub'' Peabody after Volpe spurned campaigning
for a leisurely trade mission to Japan, Donahue cracked: ``They
loved him in Yokahama.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Flavin: ``There was a civility on Beacon Hill in the old
days. Maurice had a wonderful relationship with Phil `Turkey'
Graham of Hamilton. He gave a speech in 1965 at a Republican
fund-raiser for Graham. You'd never have that happen today. Maurice
had no ego. His office was just a little closet. I loved him. He
was a great guy to work for when you were learning the ropes. He
was a great teacher.'' And teach is what Donahue did at
UMass-Boston, an institution he nourished as Senate president, as
he had the UMass Medical School in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   To Harrington, Donahue was the first state legislative leader
``to bridge the generations both before and after World War II.''
At the instigation of the wily State House character Michael Paul
Feeney, legislators of 1946 surreptitiously moved up the filing
date for running for office to the winter, so returning vets of
World War II could not sweep out the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   But that sweep came with a vengeance in 1948, when the Democrats
under Tip O'Neill took the House for the first time; 10 years
later, they took the Senate. Republicans have been an afterthought
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, there was practically no television, and the
roads from Western Massachusetts were primitive,'' said Harrington.
``Donahue and John Thompson would stay at the old Madison Hotel at
North Station for $5 a night, and they and Sid Curtiss, who became
the Republican leader, would sit around in a hotel room and quiz
each other on parliamentary procedure. That was their game. Those
people were unique individuals, survivors of the Great Depression,
veterans who fought in World War II, they were unique.''

ESPN OFFERS A TALE OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the greatest 20th-century athletes are well known. Less
familiar are definitive answers to the eternal questions.
</P>
<P>
   Was Joe DiMaggio better than Ted Williams? Could Jack Johnson
whup Muhammad Ali? Is Michael Jordan the greatest athlete of all
time . . . and would Len Bias have surpassed him?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, there are no answers, just debate among
academics, media, and sports talk show callers. Coming up with
reasonable answers requires some sort of argument, some sort of
rationale, for determining that Bob Cousy was better than Jerry
West, or that Cy Young was better than Honus Wagner. Was Rafer
Johnson a better athlete than Michael Johnson? Who knows? But if
you had to choose, would you pick Gordie Howe or Bobby Orr?
</P>
<P>
   Probably Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Mario Lemieux probaby would have something to say.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN definitely does. In one of the most ambitious projects this
century, the cable network has spent $35 million to produce an
unprecedented 60 hours of programming to document sports throughout
the last 100 years. ``SportsCentury'' debuts next Friday with
several components.
</P>
<P>
   Naming the best 100 athletes and profiling the top 50 in
30-minute shows is one. ESPN's rankings were based on the input of
48 noted panelists, including Sam Lacy, George Will, Bob Costas,
Curt Gowdy, Harry Edwards, David Halberstam, Jim Murray, Shirley
Povich, Bert Sugar, Bob Ryan, and Will McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Evert came in at No. 50, Pete Rose at 56. Bo Jackson was
No. 72. Bobby Hull 86, Josh Gibson 73, George Blanda 95. No. 100?
Jack Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's mission was to pick the best North American athletes (so
long, Nadia Comaneci, Pele, and Hermann Maier) based on their
sporting accomplishments. That's a hard thing to do, almost
impossible, largely because it is difficult to separate Ali's
boxing talent from his political stances or Jackie Robinson's
ability to play baseball from his historic impact in breaking the
color line.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Jack Johnson. He fought at a time when
feelings of white superiority ran rampant, and his rise to
heavyweight champion, coupled with his flamboyant lifestyle and
relationship with white women, came with a price. Johnson
ultimately fled America.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weren't just sports stories,'' said Mark Shapiro, the
28-year-old wunderkind who produced ``SportsCentury.'' ``They were
cultural events. This will be the most comprehensive sports history
ever produced. But if it's just that, we've failed. It's got to
define history. It's got to put individuals and events into
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN gets around the apparent contradiction of choosing the top
100 athletes based solely on their athleticism without regard to
their role in society by producing six two-hour ``SportsCenter''
programs. Those shows review each decade, the first involving
1900-49, and attempt to cover the events as ``SportsCenter'' would
have if it were in existence at the time. The format allows for
discussion on the events of that day, providing perspective and
social context. Of course, ESPN has the benefit of historical
hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``SportsCenter'' is shot in black and white and
features five veteran journalists _ Dick Schaap, Curt Gowdy, Jim
McKay, Jack Whitaker, and Dave Anderson _ sitting around a table in
a newsroom talking about the century's first 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The final component of ``SportsCentury'' is four programs that
focus on the century's greatest coaches (two hours), greatest games
(two hours), greatest dynasties (90 minutes), and most influential
individuals (90 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The research behind ``SportsCentury'' is astounding. ESPN
interviewed 700 people and worked with 100 photograph libraries and
more than 50 footage houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have devoted tremendous resources to `SportsCentury' _ both
on air and behind the scenes _ to make this the definitive sports
millennium project,'' said ESPN senior vice president John Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   That is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``SportsCentury'' is unbelievable.

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Terrell Davis? Ha.
</P>
<P>
   Ha ha.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets laugh in the face of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Ha ha ha.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, so maybe they don't exactly laugh in the face of the
Davis danger. But many a mention of the Denver Broncos running back
at their Hofstra University practice facility this week elicited
lighthearted responses from the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Davis's vision puts him above the rest of the best
NFL backs, coach Bill Parcells said, ``It's a combination of
things. It's not his vision. I've got good vision and I can't run
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guffaws all around.
</P>
<P>
   So, defensive tackle Ernie Logan, how do you solve a problem
like Terrell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Heh-heh.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous laughter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it takes a total team effort,'' Logan said. ``It's the
defense all across the board. You have to play your technique
longer than they play theirs. You have to swarm the ball. This guy
breaks tackles. If the first guy misses him and you don't have
anybody there, it could be a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   And, linebacker Bryan Cox, will you guys approach shutting down
Davis the same way you approached shutting down Jacksonville's Fred
Taylor last week?
</P>
<P>
   Cox laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a moron to tell you that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the Jets are not taking this task lightly. Nor
are they about to tip their game plan for Sunday's AFC Championship
Game at Denver. Defensive guru Bill Belichick likely was hunkered
down in the building at that very moment, still fiddling and
fine-tuning and trying to devise a way to stop the best runner in
the business. No, these guys weren't about to give away any
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's easier to think and chuckle about Davis half a
continent away at midweek than it will be Sunday when they're
separated only by the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   And know this as well. The Jets may not have played the Broncos
and Davis as a team since 1996 _ way back when Parcells was
coaching and Curtis Martin was running for you know who _ but they
know all about him.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,008 yards this year. The 21 rushing touchdowns. The 5.1
yards per carry. And that was just in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Last week there was the demolishing of the Dolphins with 199
yards, 9.5 a carry, and two touchdowns. There are the five playoff
games, all ending with him gaining more than 100 yards. The Jets
know about the quick and active offensive line. They know Davis
loves his cutbacks. They know he had 29 yards against Miami Dec.
21, and three weeks later, Denver adjusted with an unbalanced line
and he ran wild.
</P>
<P>
   They know this. They respect this.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells puts Davis in a group with the most dangerous backs
he's ever coached against. Earl Campbell. Tony Dorsett. Billy Sims.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys, when he gets the ball, he's one of
those guys that you have to worry about every play that he's going
to break a long run,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's big, he's fast, he's durable,'' Cox said. ``He can run
the ball 40 times a game and get stronger as the game goes along.
He can catch the ball out of the backfield. He can block. He can do
a lot of different things for that ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   The defenders, said Parcells, must tackle well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of making sure you hang on until you get
him to the ground,'' said backup linebacker Chad Cascadden. ``While
you watch film, you see a lot of times you think he's about to go
down and the defender falls on the ground and he's still going. He
keeps his feet going and he's excellent at not going down. Bill
always tells us the last half of the season's always the time when
tackling is most important. It gets cold, it's late in the season,
and maybe that's a fundamental that's not practiced as much.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, a few other details with which the Jets
must contend. John Elway. Rod Smith. Shannon Sharpe. Ed McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, teams go into Denver and it's `stop Terrell,
stop Terrell,' and Elway kills them and they play-action them,''
Logan said. ``We've got to play all the way across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they respect Davis and the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Can they stop them?
</P>
<P>
   If they can, the Jets may well be laughing all the way to Miami
and their first Super Bowl appearance since they won it with Joe
Namath in 1969.

DAVIS PUTS DENVER ON SOLID GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ On the all-time roster of notable TDs, we find a
bandleader (Tommy Dorsey), an actor (Ted Danson), a basketball
player (Tim Duncan), and even a fine local hockey player (Ted
Donato).
</P>
<P>
   (Hold the cards, letters, faxes, and phone calls. Anyone knows
there has to be a hundred more.)
</P>
<P>
   But has there ever been a more appropriate matchup than the
reigning TD of our times and the end result of his labors? I mean,
TD, Terrell Davis and TD, touchdown. How can you beat that?
</P>
<P>
   Here are three additional letters by which to identify Mr. Davis
_ M, V, and P. He was Most Valuable Player in last year's Super
Bowl and last week he was named Most Valuable Player of the 1998
NFL season. For several years, when the topic of great running
backs was introduced into the conversation, the first name on
everyone's lips was Barry Sanders, but no longer, and not because
there is anything wrong with the great Detroit runner. It's just
that Terrell Davis has moved to the head of the class with a
succession of spectacular performances, the latest of which was a
199-yard effort last Saturday afternoon in the midst of Denver's
38-3 destruction of the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has played in five career playoff games. No team has been
able to hold him under 100 yards. In those five games he has
averaged 5.9 yards per carry. That's Jim Brown territory.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is one of those stories that demonstrate the chancy nature
of scouting. Never, ever forget that identifying talent in team
sports is a thoroughly inexact science. Mike Piazza was about the
10 millionth guy taken in his baseball draft, and then only as a
favor to his godfather, Tom Lasorda. There were two guys taken
ahead of Michael Jordan in the 1984 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   And there were 194 deemed more worthy of selection than Davis
when the NFL Wise Guys went through their deliberations in 1995.
One hundred ninety-four! That's enough to stock four full teams.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters now. Davis has made the Broncos look
prescient. He gained 1,117 yards as a rookie, 1,538 yards his
second year, 1,750 yards last year, and a majestic 2,008 yards this
past season. Counting the playoffs, he has scored 53 touchdowns, 25
of which came this year (23 regular season, two against Miami).
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 11 inches and 210 pounds, he is a combination of power
and finesse. Until last Saturday, he was known more for the former
than the latter. But that assumption may now have to be rethought
after his dazzling display of hip-shaking artistry in the open
field. Once sprung by his superb offensive line into the secondary,
he revealed a top-of-the-line ability to make defenders miss. He
said he was ``taking a page out of the Barry Sanders book.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, inquisitors basically wanted to know, ``Hey, how did
you do that?'' Great runners normally have no answer, and Davis is
no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of instincts,'' he explained. ``When you're
running the football, it's a matter of angles. You see someone, or
you sense someone is coming, and you go the other way. Instincts,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have the requisite humility we demand of our
superstars. ``It all starts up front,'' he says of his offensive
line. ``Their job is to get me to the secondary, and they've been
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of his admiration for John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number 7 is my role model,'' Davis points out. ``I talk to him
every day. I observe him and I try to do the things he does. It's
worked so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Herschel Walker, the University of Georgia has
proven itself to be the incubator of superior running backs. In
addition to Walker, the school has churned out the likes of Rodney
Hampton, Garrison Hearst, Tim Worley, and our own Robert Edwards.
Davis, however, may have had the most curious path to Bulldog
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Did you realize, for example, that he started his college career
playing for none other than George Allen? When Davis came out of
San Diego's Lincoln Prep High School he headed to Long Beach State,
where the legendary coaching genius was making a Last Stand. But
after Davis finished a fairly quiet (262 yards, 4.8 yards per
carry, two TDs) freshman season, the school dropped football and
Davis traveled across the country to Georgia, where he spent a
great deal of his career backing up Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's show against the Dolphins last week repesented something
of a payback. As the football world knows, the Dolphins had beaten
the Broncos by a 31-21 score in Week 15. It was the week after
Denver's unbeaten season had been wrecked by the New York Giants,
and so the widespread assumption was that the Broncos' hearts
really weren't in the game. And of all the sorry numbers posted in
that game, none was more worthy of being framed in technicolor than
Davis's running yardage _ 29.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread Assumption turned out to be on the right track. The
Broncos asserted immediate superiority over the Dolphins in a game
that really mattered, and no one was more productive than Davis,
who exceeded that 29-yard total by his fourth carry on the first
Denver possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that we didn't put forth our best effort in
Miami,'' acknowledged Davis. ``We took this game personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is proud of his accomplishments, of course, but he is not
the strutting type. He leaves that to Jamal Anderson, the
loquacious Atlanta running back, who is more the
kick-butt-and-take-names type. ``I'm not thinking of myself as the
MVP,'' he says. ``I don't walk on the field now thinking that
because I'm the MVP now that things are going to just happen.
Anyway, I think an award like that is as much the line's as it is
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis has one distinction, but it's not one he relishes.
He is a migraine headache sufferer, so much so that he has founded
the Terrell Davis Foundation for Migraine Education and Treatment.
Those dastrardly things have a fiendish way of cropping up at the
most inopportune time. In Davis's case, that time was the Super
Bowl last January in San Diego. He had an attack in the second
quarter a few minutes after one of the Green Bay players struck him
in the head with his leg. Moments later Davis's vision was blurry,
and soon he couldn't see a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Davis returned to the game in the third period, and performed
well enough to be the game's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of who this guy is. The main difference between him
and a similarly affected private citizen is that he turns around
and becomes a headache himself. Ask any defensive coordinator.

`DEAR JESSE' FILMMAKER UNWITTINGLY HONORS SLAIN GAY STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 17)  
 (ATTN: North Carolina, Wyoming)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Like much of the gay community, filmmaker Tim
Kirkman was outraged into action by the brutal killing of Matthew
Shepard. He wrote to members of Congress. He sent electronic mail.
He raged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was obsessed with the case,'' Kirkman said in a recent
telephone interview from New York City. ``It was a groundswell of
shock and horror and revulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, 21, an openly gay Wyoming college student, was beaten,
burned and tied to a split-rail fence in October. He lingered six
days in a coma before dying. The case became a rallying point for
hate-crimes legislation throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hit Kirkman until three days after the attack that he
had met Shepard _ and, more importantly, filmed him _ two years
before in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``My producer (Mary Beth Mann) mentioned casually that he had
lived in North Carolina,'' he said. ``As soon as she said that,
that's when I knew I met him.''
</P>
<P>
   That interview has been tacked on to Kirkman's 1996
award-winning documentary, ``Dear Jesse,'' as one of the most
chillingly coincidental and prescient postscripts in film history.
The film makes its television debut on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. EST on
Cinemax (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesse'' is not a love letter. Rather, it is a documentary
that asks a question: How can two men, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and Kirkman, have so much in common, yet disagree on so much?
</P>
<P>
   Like Helms, Kirkman grew up in Monroe, N.C. Both Southern
Baptists attended nearby Wingate College for a year before
transferring. Both worked in journalism and radio.
</P>
<P>
   And both have an obsessive interest in gay men, Kirkman says.
The difference is, Helms rails against homosexuality; Kirkman is
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkman was a closeted homosexual during his younger years, and
became at ease with his orientation only after moving to New York.
In 1996, he returned to North Carolina to more deeply explore race,
gender and sexuality issues, and why Helms, the staunchly
conservative senator, and some citizens of their home state are so
anti-gay.
</P>
<P>
   What results in this open letter to Helms is not a harangue
against an inflexible Southern state, but rather a portrayal of a
surprising level of acceptance in Bible country, and the fondness
Kirkman still has for North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that state,'' he said. ``All these people reminded me
of why I love that state so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms was not interviewed for the film, although some of his
previous televised interviews and speeches are used in the
documentary. Absent are condescension and anger toward Helms you
might expect from the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In making the film, it was very important not to do to Jesse
Helms what he continues to do to gay people ... which is to
demonize them,'' Kirkman said. ``I hope people come away with the
sense I didn't try to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Kirkman is still left with questions about and for
Helms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, to some you seem evil, dangerous, immoral,'' Kirkman
says in the film. ``To some, I seem evil, dangerous, immoral. Are
you? Am I?''
</P>
<P>
   There is an entire sub-genre of filmmaking going on in which gay
documentarians are returning to their Southern roots. In addition
to ``Dear Jesse,'' others include the 1997 film ``Family Name,'' in
which Macky Alston examined his ancestors' link to slavery in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about the Southern experience that insists
upon an oral history,'' Kirkman explained. ``There is a drive to
reclaim and accept and reconcile the contradictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkman is now working on an independent film adaptation of the
off-Broadway play ``The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,'' an Obie
Award-winner about a gay man coming of age in 1980s New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dear Jesse,'' one of the most moving passages is an
interview with Patsy Clarke, whose son died of AIDS. Once a family
friend of Helms, she wrote the senator asking him to end his
opposition to research and funding for a cure. His response: ``He
said he was very sorry my son had chosen to play Russian roulette
with his sexuality,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   But the most charged portion of the film didn't even make the
final cut until it was added after the documentary's release as a
postscript. It was an interview done on the campus of Catawba
College the first day Kirkman filmed in North Carolina, featuring
two gay college students.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting was bad, the angles were wrong, and neither had
anything particularly insightful to say.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the students was Shepard. To a filmmaker, this was
blood-stained gold.
</P>
<P>
   He had to use it, but tastefully. Kirkman already had the deal
to show the film on Cinemax, which was supportive of him tacking on
the Shepard footage. Others came calling: Out of respect, Kirkman
turned down offers from the tabloid television shows to sell the
footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to put a face with this tragedy,'' he said. ``I
wanted to be as responsible as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That face is of a short, slight young man. ``He clearly could
not fight back,'' Kirkman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary, Kirkman is apologetic he could not offer
more from _ and for _ the doomed student.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only footage I have of Matthew,'' Kirkman says.
``It isn't fair. It isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did give Shepard a face and a voice. It was indeed
enough.

DESPITE ITS FORMULA, `VASRITY' DEFIES CLICHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
VARSITY BLUES 
Directed by: Brian Robbins 
Screenplay by: W. Peter Iliff 
Starring: James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight, Paul Walker, Ron Lester,
Scott Caan, Amy Smart, Ali Larter. 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: R (stong language, nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, ``Varsity Blues'' suggests a scary flashback to the
most recent football flick-cum-fable, ``The Waterboy.'' There's the
motley crew of Southern characters _ among them obese,
maple-syrup-swilling Billy Bob, beer-guzzling party animal Tweeder,
fair-haired quarterback Lance. There are foxy cheerleaders, an
eccentric teacher, a hopelessly one-dimensional coach, and a moral
universe that hinges on moving a pigskin ball downfield.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities, however, prove to be purely incidental.
``Varsity Blues'' is far sweeter and a good deal deeper, although
almost any film could outpace ``The Waterboy'' in those regards.
``Varsity Blues'' is a fun-lovin' teen-dream distraction with a
conscience. Buffed bodies abound, to be sure, dripping with sweat
and mud in locker rooms, cavorting in a stolen patrol car, and
judiciously lathered during a botched seduction scene involving a
whipped-cream bikini. It is, after all, an MTV Films production.
But ``Varsity Blues'' isn't about sex. It's about another way we
grow up: going toe-to-toe with adults who would squash youthful
ideals with a self-serving smack upside the helmet. While the film
largely adheres to coming-of-age formula, it defies cliche with a
cast of well-drawn, appealing characters.
</P>
<P>
   High school senior Jonathon Moxon (James Van Der Beek) is
second-string QB in West Canaan, Texas _ a town obsessed with its
championship high school football team. When the star quarterback
suffers a season-ending injury, bookish Mox is forced to contend
with Bud Kilmer, his boorish coach (played with sadistic fervor by
Jon Voight), and the sudden onslaught of small-town celebrity. Van
Der Beek, best known as angst-ridden Dawson on the hit TV show
``Dawson's Creek,'' knows from adolescent dilemmas. Suffice to say
Mox is more of a sequel than a stretch _ he reads Vonnegut on the
sidelines, dreams big dreams about escaping to Brown University,
dissects his values, agonizes over his goodness, and delivers lines
like ``It's been a really weird night'' with utter conviction. Van
Der Beek does bright, righteous, and torn like the career teen he
is.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vastly greater leap for veteran actor Voight, who has
farther to fall than the rest of the young cast combined. Granted,
Coach Kilmer is an unrelenting louse with an eye only for the next
trophy. But playing a character who moves through life with
blinders on doesn't require acting with blinders on; some
variations on a theme of bitterness and abuse would have rescued
the role from caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Even the proverbial bodacious babes, who generally parade
through this genre like so many yelping cheerleaders, are given
dimension. Jules, Mox's sweetheart, is played with levelheaded
cynicism by Amy Smart, and Ali Larter manages to imbue blond
temptress Darcy with the desperate ache of a girl whose last great
hope is sleeping her way out of a small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, everybody gets what they deserve in ``Varsity
Blues'' _ including the audience. It's a simplistic portrait of
heroism _ where being yourself and standing up to authority and
playing an inspired game of football is the secret to success. Not
that that sort of idealism hurts. It actually feels pretty good.

TARGET WRONG; IDEAS AREN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, we reported an imbroglio involving a fisherman
and a Wheaties box. The fisherman in question _ Denny Brauer, a
good old boy from the Ozarks who made more than a million bucks
with his fishing rod _ was chosen to be featured on the December
Wheaties box for having won the BASS Masters Classic, the sport's
premier tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone seemed pleased with the selection of the
49-year-old angler who graciously thanked all the right people,
including the Wheaties folks who put him up in the familiar orange
breakfast marquee, graced in the past by the likes of Ted Williams,
Michael Jordan, and Ken Stabler.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor types were especially pleased at Wheaties' decision to
include angling in its firmament of American sports. At the time,
Jack Sheehan, spokesman for General Mills, told the Globe that it
was the company's intention to expand the Wheaties box marquee to
include stars from nontraditional sports. The reason is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked around and we saw 45-50 million people fishing in
this country,'' said Sheehan. ``There's such a growing popularity,
it just seemed to make sense for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as we reported in this space some three months back, there
were some dissenters. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
a well-known anti-hunting organization from Norfolk, Va., was
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   PETA wrote to General Mills asking that the cereal company
cancel its plans and ridiculed the notion that fishing is sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tricking small animals into impaling themselves on hooks and
ripping them from their homes _ from the comfort of an expensive
boat _ requires no athletic skill whatsoever,'' wrote PETA's
executive director, Ingrid Newkirk. ``Anglers have no place next to
real sportsmen like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, who better
represent the Breakfast of Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   (Aside: Ingrid, I don't know how much fishing you've done, but
tricking a brown trout into impaling itself on a fly up on the
Batten Kill is as difficult as making a 100-foot putt.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, General Mills politely rejected PETA's protest; end of
story. Brauer was immortalized on the Wheaties box, marking the
first time since 1935, when Wheaties started depicting athletic
heroes on its box, that a fisherman was so honored.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, polar explorer Robert Bartlett and the Flying Wallendas
acrobatic troupe were the only nontraditional athletes ever to have
appeared. Brauer was chosen over John Glenn when the 77-year-old
astronaut was preparing for his space flight. Newkirk referred to
this as a ``snub'' of Glenn and noted that Glenn was rejected
because he was a nonathlete.
</P>
<P>
   But the protest did not stop with the letter from PETA to
General Mills chairman Charles Gaillard. PETA wrote several more
letters, demonstrated in front of the General Mills offices in
Minneapolis, and continued to appear at fishing tournaments around
the country to protest the suffering being inflicted on the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Showing it could mix some humor with its protest, PETA made a 3
1/2-foot-high replica of a Wheaties box and labeled it ``WEENIES,''
displaying it under a banner that read, ``CEREAL KILLERS.''
</P>
<P>
   PETA also sent out 2,000 postcards to grocery stores asking them
not to stock the Wheaties box with Brauer's picture, though there
was little response, according to Dawn Carr, who heads the fishing
project for PETA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did write to Denny Brauer and said we would like to meet
him,'' said Carr in a phone interview Thursday, ``but we have not
heard back.''
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, PETA has taken a conciliatory step. ``We
figured that realistically, fishing isn't going away any time
soon,'' said Carr, ``and so we put together a list of five
guidelines we hope will be adopted at fishing tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ``Save Our Schools'' campaign letter, PETA recommends the
following:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ban livewells, keepnets, and stringers: Up to 43 percent of
fish die after release from baitwells, according to recent stidies.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ban barbed hooks.
</P>
<P>
   3. Permit only artificial lures: Since fish are more likely to
swallow baited hooks, the risk of serious injury is high.
</P>
<P>
   4. Demand cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   5. Practice careful handling of fish to be released: Land fish
as quickly as possible . . . never let fish come in contact with
carpeted boat floors, towels, or nets . . . and always handle with
wet hands.
</P>
<P>
   But for a couple of details, there's little in the PETA
guidelines to argue with. Certainly, striped bass anglers have used
barbless hooks for years and treat their catch with extreme care.
As for cleaning up, it's a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for the hook-and-bullet community to ridicule PETA
(though to all appearances, it is peopled with polite, responsive,
nonhysterical believers in its cause).
</P>
<P>
   But it might be more productive to at least listen to them. Even
when they're messing around with our breakfast.
</P>

FUN AND GAMES FOR SABERHAGEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If they were all like Bret Saberhagen, things might be
easier for the Red Sox. No contract hassles. Never a gripe about
leaving a game. A smile even on those days when the pain in his
right shoulder refuses to go away.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, the 34-year-old Saberhagen has a delicious
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are boring,'' he told the media after a series of
questions that probably were. ``Can you think of anything
interesting to ask?''
</P>
<P>
   One reporter on hand for the Boston Baseball Writers Dinner
Thursday night ventured, ``What do you think about President
Clinton's chances?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' responded Saberhagen, ``I think our chances are a
lot better than his.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Saberhagen is having fun again. After having his
career nearly derailed by shoulder problems, he was the improbable
success story of 1998, posting a 15-8 record with 100 strikeouts in
175 innings as he helped pitch the Red Sox into the American League
playoffs. Because of the huge medical question mark hovering over
him, he worked under tight constraints, knowing that one bad pitch
after the fifth inning could be his last and failing to register a
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   There are no doubts now. On Sept. 18, the Sox gave Saberhagen a
three-year contract worth $12.5 million. With incentives, he can
make up to $18 million. No wonder he's in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern medicine is a great thing,'' said Saberhagen, who was
honored with the Tony Conigliaro Award for courage. ``Especially in
my case. If this would have happened 10 years ago, more than
likely, I wouldn't be pitching again. I'm very fortunate to be
pitching in the era I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I all the way back? Far as I know. It's really going to
depend upon how I feel during spring training. Hopefully, my
shoulder is going to get better. The one hurdle I want to get over
is to get into the late part of the game rather than work just six
or seven innings. We'll know that by the end of April or early
May.''
</P>
<P>
   While Saberhagen may no longer be questionable, Boston's
pitching is. After indicating that they would pursue a top-shelf
starter in free agency to join Pedro Martinez, Tim Wakefield, and
Saberhagen, the Sox brought in Mark Portugal and Pat Rapp, a couple
of veteran journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who shed a similar tag last year, wonders whether
lightning might strike twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them won 12 ballgames while both played for two
sub-.500 teams,'' said Saberhagen. ``What they did for their
respective ball clubs (Portugal with the Phillies, Rapp with the
Royals) would have been outstanding for our ball club _ 15 or 16
games won. The big thing is that it will take some pressure off the
rest of the pitching staff, knowing that on any given day, we've
got a great chance to win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen understands that with Mo Vaughn gone, pitching will
be at a premium this year at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played on clubs that relied on pitching before,'' he
said. ``So I don't think losing one guy necessarily says we're not
going to be able to score runs. We will. But you're talking about
replacing 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. It's going to be a little bit
tougher for everybody. Mo did a lot for the team when it came to
speaking up and putting a lot on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could still happen in a trade. I know we have five
second basemen and four or five DHs. I'm looking forward to seeing
how things pan out. There is going to be a lot of weight put on
some other guys' shoulders as far as dealing with the media and
stepping up, being a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen knows a lot about winning and leadership. In his
years with Kansas City, the Mets, Colorado, and Boston, he has
provided both. Now it would be nice if an everyday player like a
Nomar Garciappara stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't step into a leader role,'' Saberhagen said.
``It's not something you can hand to somebody. You have to earn a
leader's role. Nomar is young. He fits into that category. Let's
just see how things pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Sox, a lot of things have to pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The improved pitching will keep us in ballgames,'' Saberhagen
said. ``Unfortunately, we might be in the wrong division. There are
a couple of powerhouses in the AL East. Then again, Baltimore was
stacked last year and people picked them to win the World Series.
They had a pretty dismal season. So things can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of question marks (about the Sox) last year.
Now the only question is who is playing first and who's playing
second, how good Trot Nixon will be. Hopefully, it will pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   What about personal goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never put one in mind as far as (getting) the win,''
Saberhagen said. ``A lot of times, we don't have a say. A lot of
things can happen if you come out of games and don't finish. A lot
of games, you pitch well and you don't win. Other times, you pitch
terrible and you win. The thing I put the emphasis upon is games
started. If I can get the ball 30-35 times, that's my main
priority. I know I'm helping the team. And I'm not going to bitch
and moan if I don't get the win.''

ON THE SURFACE, THOMPSON RESIGNATION DIDN'T MAKE SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that we've absorbed the sudden resignation of Georgetown
coach John Thompson, the question that remains is why? And, more
specifically, why now?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson explained part of that at last week's press conference
announcing his resgination. He cited ``personal'' matters.
</P>
<P>
   But those problems have been ongoing for at least a year. They
were present at the start of the season. Presumably, they will not
be solved with a quick fix now.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson _ quite correctly _ is reticent about discussing
personal matters. Even with his friends, he does not often reveal
his inner feelings.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two months ago, during Big East media day,
Thompson sounded more upbeat than he had in years, enthusiastic
about starting his 27th season. He had a solid recruiting class
coming in next season.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Hoyas seemed to be struggling this season. Which begs
another question. Why leave when the ship was listing just a bit?
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be several reasons for the move last week. Some
of which make sense, some which makes you scratch your head in
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there was never a doubt that long-time assisistant
Craig Eshereick was the heir apparent. Thompson wanted it, and as
everyone around the Hoya program knows, Thompson generally gets
what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson gave the Hoyas administration (with their consent) very
little choice. By resigning so suddenly, he essentially handed
Esherick the job.
</P>
<P>
   There was no room for debate or speculation about a successor,
which would have occurred if Thompson had announced he would be
resigning at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw how North Carolina did it with Dean (Smith) and
(Bill) Guthridge,'' said one source familiar with the way the
situation was handled. ``They thought that was the best way to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the winningest coach in the history of college
basketball, had announced his retirement shortly before the Tar
Heels' season opener last year, which allowed Guthridge, a
long-time assistant and friend of Smith's, to take over a team that
was talented enough to reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson did the same thing with Esherick. The rest of this
season will be a period of adjustment for the Hoyas, followed by an
upswing next season if the recruits turn out to be as good as
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thompson? Look for him to return to coaching, perhaps as
early as next season. ``I resigned from coaching,'' he said. ``I
have not decided to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   For now. John Thompson is what he is _ a coach. He did it very
well for almost 30 years. It was time to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll surface in an NBA that should have no labor problems
for the next several years. Maybe he'll return to college coaching,
though that seems less likely.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lingering question of his health. And while there may
be what some friends term a ``minor'' problem, it is not of a
serious nature.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Thompson can do what he has not done for
nearly 30 years: He can take trips to Vegas and feed his passion
for the slots and not have people at Georgetown tut-tut him, saying
that is not appropriate behavior for a high-profile basketball
coach. He can laugh and joke with old friends such as former St.
John's coach Lou Carnesecca.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he can be himself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting his kicks
</P>
<P>
   Duke might be one of the most talented teams in college
basketball, loaded with blue-chip All-America players such as Elton
Brand, but one of Blue Devil coach Mike Krzyzewski's favorite
players is a 5-foot-9-inch, 135-pound walk-on named Jay Heaps.
College basketball fans may not recongize that name. But college
soccer players know it. Heaps was the 1998 National Soccer Player
of the Year and one of the reasons the Blue Devils were 18-4. Heaps
is also a huge hoops fan and earned a spot as part of the Duke
scout team with his gritty play. ``He's a no-ego guy,'' said Coach
K. ``He's one of the favorite guys I've had here.'' . . . Indiana,
one of seven Big Ten teams ranked this week, has gone to the
football team to fill out its roster. Freshman quarterback Antwaan
Randle-El has been a contributor to the Hoosiers since swapping
cleats for sneakers . . . North Carolina's recent dip after a quick
November and December start, coupled with the prominence of Duke,
Maryland, and Clemson, has some long-time Tar Heels watchers
wondering if this season will be the end of a remarkable streak.
Consider this: North Carolina has not been out of the Top 3 in the
Atlantic Coast Conference since 1964 and has been as low as third
only five times . . . One of the problems Rhode Island has had this
season has been a lack of 3-point shot production. Last season, the
Rams averaged almost eight 3-point baskets a game. The Rams are
averaging less than half of that total this season . . . Notice to
St. Joseph's fans: Check out the halftime score. In the Hawks'
first 14 games, the team leading at halftime won.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shameful nonsupport
</P>
<P>
   We can understand why Boston College is averaging only 2,900
fans a game at Conte Forum. The Eagles have been in a
wait-until-next-season mode all year and are not a very good team.
But what's Miami's excuse? The Hurricanes are an NCAA
tournament-caliber team but are only averaging only 2,400 people
per home game, the lowest total in the Big East . . . Delaware has
become the class of the America East Conference, and apparently the
league wants it to remain that way. When the Blue Hens were an
under-.500 team, no one really cared too much that the first few
rounds of the postseason tournament were played at the Blue Hens'
Carpenter Center, a user-friendly facility. But now that Delaware
has emerged as a league power, the thought was that playing the
first two rounds at Delaware in addition to giving the Hens a
home-court edge for the championship game (which is played at the
site of the highest remaining seed) was too much an advantage. So
the tournament was shopped around. Boston University and
Northeastern offered to cohost the event, starting next season. But
apparently that's not going to happen and the tournament will
return to Delaware for at least one more season . . . One of the
developing stories of the year is the success of Iowa. The Hawkeyes
are 13-1, haven't lost since November, and are leading the Big Ten.
All of this in Tom Davis's lame duck (not by choice) season. More
good news for the Hawkeyes. Next week they get Sam Okey, the Big
Ten Freshman of the Year two years ago at Wisconsin, who sat out a
year after transferring . . . Providence's win at Syracuse on
Tuesday night was another example of the superb job Tim Welsh has
done since arriving last spring. The Friars were regarded as a
bottom-half-of-the-Big-East team in the preseason, but already have
11 wins, including four straight over ranked opponents, which
include Syracuse and Purdue as well as state rival Rhode Island . .
. Nebraska coach Danny Nee may be in trouble. Funding is down a
million dollars in the past five years, crowds at the Devaney
Center are almost nonexistant, and the Huskers are only an average
team at best . . . The University of Connecticut's Richard Hamilton
is showing signs of returning to the Player of the Year form he had
in the Big East last season, which is bad news for teams who hope
to upset the No. 1-ranked Huskies. The Huskies are so deep and so
versatile that it will take a breakdown on their part to saddle
them with their first loss. No one remaining on their schedule _
with the possible exception of Stanford _ can match up with them.

MORE FAMILY SHOWS, LESS SEX AT NBC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The new chief programmer at NBC, signaling a
philosophical shift at a network strongly identified with racy
programs featuring single adults in urban settings, said Thursday
he plans to reduce NBC's sexual content and develop programs
revolving around family life.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sassa, newly installed as president of NBC Entertainment,
also said he will insist on more ethnic diversity in the casts of
shows _ NBC has sometimes been derided as standing for ``Nothing
But Caucasians'' _ and will try to find more programs that are set
outside New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to TV critics here, Sassa said NBC has ``shifted too
far away from traditional families'' and has sometimes used sex
``to get an easy laugh,'' adding: ``We could use a few more words
between `Hello' and `Would you sleep with me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sassa emphasized that ``we're not going to become a
family channel'' and that ``I'm not saying no sex, I'm saying less
sex, and it depends on the kind of show it is.'' For example, he
said that sexual situations are an important comedic device on a
show like ``Friends,'' which revolves around six people in their
mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   But he made clear that his goal is to ``lessen the amount of sex
that's gratuitous'' and better reflect the lives of the network's
audience with more diverse casts and more shows featuring nuclear
families. The bottom line, Sassa said, is that ``people want to be
able to watch TV with their kids. . . . We need to be more balanced
in what we show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa's words were striking because they came from the
entertainment chief of a network that rose to No. 1 under his
predecessor, Warren Littlefield, largely on the strength of
sexually candid urban sitcoms like ``Friends,'' ``Just Shoot Me,''
and ``Veronica's Closet.'' In keeping with its edgier persona, NBC
is the only major network that has refused, despite pressure from
Congress and activist groups, to affix content labels to its
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, Sassa said his policy on sexual content is
not driven by outside pressure or by NBC's ratings decline, but by
his own ``concerns that in some cases, people don't really need to
see that much sex on TV, when it's done in ways that aren't
important to the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, who replaced Littlefield in October, takes the reins of
NBC Entertainment at a challenging time.
</P>
<P>
   After being ranked No. 1 for three years, NBC dropped to second
place in total viewers behind CBS this season, having seen its
audience decline 16 percent. While still the leading network in the
18-to-49 demographic prized by most advertisers, NBC is also down
20 percent this season among viewers in that age group. Among male
viewers aged 18 to 54, NBC is down 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, NBC also shows signs of health. It had six of the
top 10-rated shows last week, and the new ``Providence'' debuted
last Friday with the highest ratings of any new drama since ``ER''
premiered in 1993. Moreover, the network continues to dominate late
night and early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa said NBC's lower ratings in prime time this year are
largely due to the loss of ``Seinfeld'' and NFL broadcasts. Asked
whether he plans to move ``Frasier'' from 9 p.m. Thursdays and
install the stronger ``Friends'' there instead, Sassa replied that
while he would ``never say never,'' the network ``continues to
believe in'' the strength of ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Grammer and the rest of the cast stood in the
Paramount Studios lot in Hollywood where ``Frasier'' is filmed and
fielded questions about the show's performance this year, both in
terms of ratings and content.
</P>
<P>
   Between ``Cheers'' and ``Frasier,'' Grammer has been playing Dr.
Frasier Crane on NBC for 15 years, a remarkably lengthy lease on a
single role at a single network in the here-today-gone-tomorrow
business of television. But last fall, the Peacock Network cast
Grammer and ``Frasier'' in a new and daunting role: as the
successor to ``Seinfeld'' and the vital anchor of its powerhouse
Thursday-night lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with both ``Frasier'' and NBC performing well below the
level of the giddy ``Seinfeld'' years, the heat is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC didn't slip because of `Frasier,' '' Grammer insisted.
``NBC is, you know, quite responsible for its own problems. I'm not
going to carry that one on my back. There were a number of things
that went on that maybe in hindsight were not good choices. It'll
all work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa and other NBC executives have to hope so. ``Frasier,''
while fourth-ranked overall, has not come close to ``Seinfeld'' 's
ratings and has had particular difficulty attracting the male
viewers who flocked to watch Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer week
after week.
</P>
<P>
   Grammer said he believes some fans of ``Frasier'' were turned
off by the nine-episode story arc involving Frasier's unemployment
after the character lost his job at the radio station. ``He became
sadder on some level,'' Grammer said of his character. ``It was
almost hard to watch him suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the network's downturn, Grammer was philosophical, saying
that some of NBC's viewers have migrated to upstart networks like
the WB and UPN, while others left because NBC lost the rights to
broadcast pro football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the business is that it's cyclical, isn't it,''
said Grammer. ``I remember when I was first on NBC, it was way
down, and then it became the giant of the industry. This year it's
slipped a little. It'll come back around.''

`IN DREAMS' TURNS OUT TO BE A NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
IN DREAMS 
Directed by: Neil Jordan 
Written by: Neil Jordan and Bruce Robinson 
Starring: Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Aidan Quinn, Stephen
Rea, Paul Guilfoyle 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: R (violence, gore, children endangered) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claire Cooper can see things before they happen. She has dreams
filled with frightening images of an underwater town, butchered
bodies, and a mysterious man with long hair and sneakers leading a
trusting child through an apple orchard to her inevitable death.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Cooper can see bad things _ which makes it odd that she
didn't use that prescient inner eye to warn Annette Bening and
Robert Downey Jr. against having anything to do with this
unbelievably awful film.
</P>
<P>
   The year is a mere 15 days old, and already there's a solid
candidate for the worst film of 1999. What makes the complete
failure of ``In Dreams'' all the more shocking is the many talented
people involved, beginning with writer-director Neil Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   He has always had a split personality as a filmmaker. He's made
films like ``The Crying Game'' and ``Mona Lisa,'' but he's also
been responsible for ``We're No Angels'' and ``High Spirits.'' But
``InDreams'' may be the worst misfire of all since it had clear
aspirations to be a thrilling, involving film. Instead, it's a
tedious mishmash of psychobabble, and chiller-flick cliches cribbed
from a half-dozen better films by everyone from Nicolas Roeg to
Alfred Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   As Claire, Bening works mightily to generate suspense and
meaning, but you just can't make a dollar out of 50 cents. Her
Claire is a children's book author long tormented by weird,
fragmented dreams. Lately, they've been getting worse, involving a
missing girl, a mysterious stranger, and lots and lots of apples.
(It's hard to like any film which tries to transform the Andrews
Sisters's delightful song, ``Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree,'' into
an insidious sign of pending horror.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one believes Claire _ not the cops, not her
often-absent airline pilot husband, Paul (Aidan Quinn), even when
really horrible things begin to occur.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of those dreams is Vivian Thompsom (Downey), a
wacked-out killer whose still ticked off about his hellish
childhood. As a tyke, he was left chained to a bed by his mother
when their town of Northfield was completely flooded to make a
reservoir. He freed himself, but was soon dumped into an asylum
where he received the requisite electro-shock treatments. Claire's
erratic behavior, including two suicide attempts, lands her in the
same snake pit, in very room Downey inhabited. Her doctor is Jordan
film regular Stephen Rea, who seems as sluggish as he is miscast.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing here worthy of praise is the rendering of the
underwater town. Bathed in a dreamy green light, divers explore its
submerged cemetery and church. Its eerily gorgeous and breahtaking,
and cinematographer Darius Khondji is the only person on the film
who did anything to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where the pridefest should end because there's
nothing else to recommend the film. Even after it becomes apparent
that Downey is somehow telegraphing to Bening previews of crimes he
has yet to commit, the movie just seems ludicrous. To swallow this
film wouldn't take so much a suspension of belief as a boycott of
brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Downey, who overacts so much it's a wonder he didn't
hurt himself, it's hard to watch this film without asking the
question, ``He got out of jail for this?'' When the actor was doing
a stint last year in the LA lock-up for a variety of offenses, he
was allowed to interrupt his sentence temporarily to finish this
film. Having seen the lousy final product, the injustice of his
special treatment now seems even greater.

A NEW KID MOVES DOWN THE BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Teenybop groups are the rage these days with the Backstreet
Boys and 'N Sync selling millions of albums. But paving the way was
Boston's New Kids on the Block, who became a stadium act in the
early '90s, yet were faced with problems that these new groups
haven't had to confront.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups have it a lot easier than we had,'' says Joe
McIntyre, a former New Kid now on a solo career. ``They don't get
hit with charges of racism, and the Backstreet Boys are even
nominated for a Grammy. The Grammy (voters) wouldn't touch us.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Kids were often maligned by racism talk, even though
they had a black producer (Maurice Starr, who also discovered New
Edition back when Bobby Brown was still well-behaved) and started
out playing talent shows for predominantly black audiences at the
Joseph E. Lee Middle School in Dorchester, a Boston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The New Kids shut everyone up with their meteoric rise, though
as McIntyre says, ``It was fun in the beginning, but then it got
out of hand. Once we started doing the stadiums, it had lost its
charm for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Kids called it quits in 1994 _ and McIntyre, the
youngest of the group, admits that ``I went through a period where
I didn't have much drive.'' But that drive is back with his first
solo album _ the ambitious ``Stay the Same.'' It won't be out until
March 2 but will be previewed with two shows in Boston Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now 26, McIntyre wrote all the songs. An advance listen reveals
a wide variety of styles, from the slinky funk of ``We Can Get
Down'' (with a rap added by New Kid Donny Wahlberg), to the Smokey
Robinson-like doo wop of ``One Night'' (McIntyre's high-register
voice has matured into a sweet-soul vehicle) and the
positive-thinking ballad, ``Stay the Same,'' which has been a hit
on KISS-108 for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After KISS disc jockey Kid David started playing that song, it
became the most requested track on the station. That prompted
Columbia Records to sign McIntyre, who had financed the song and
the album himself. The album has a simple, feel-good quality to it,
for which McIntyre also credits coproducer/writer Joe Carrier, a
New Bedford native.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, who has been studying with Brandeis University voice
teacher Marya Lowry, is going to surprise people with this album.
Many critics believed that McIntyre, though the youngest of the New
Kids, always had the best voice in the group; and he proves them
right.
</P>
<P>
   It took time for McIntyre to do the disc because he got
sidetracked as an actor. He starred in Israel Horovitz's play,
``Barking Sharks.'' ``It was eight shows a week. I did it for a
month and a half, then decided I didn't want to do that anymore,''
says McIntyre.
</P>
<P>
   So he started recording at the now-closed Normandy Sound studio
in Warren, R.I., where the New Kids had mixed their albums.
Normandy owner Phil Greene even plays some smoldering guitar licks
on the ballad, ``Without Your Love.'' (Some fans have already heard
the record, because McIntyre released 2,000 limited-edition copies
via his web site at www.joemcintyre.com.)
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre promises to ignite ``one hell of a party'' at the
Paradise next week. He may even do the New Kids song, ``Right
Stuff,'' but that's about it from that era. The rest will be Joe
McIntyre, circa 1999.

   Seven bands in one: The Buck Dewey Big Band is starting to make
waves around town. The group is not a big band per se, though it
does include two horn players. Instead it plays ``garage jazz,''
along with craftily bastardized funk, dub reggae, swing, rock, rap,
and what can only be called Salvation Army band music on acid. ``I
like that description. And wait until we get into Stravinsky and
start writing fugues,'' says singer-guitarist Jimmy Fox. ``We're
not a typical big band, but what's big is the music. We think of
ourselves as seven bands in one. We have a lot of permutations.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent show at the Lizard Lounge was a wild demonstration of
that. All five members sing and play two or more instruments. The
band includes Rob O'Dwyer (trombone/percussion), Chris Barrett
(trumpet/keyboards), Matt Myers (mainly drums), and Daigo Fujiwara
(bass/flute). The group dresses like a retro-swing outfit, but
don't label them a swing band. ``We don't want to be pegged as a
swing thing, because that's in car commercials already,'' says Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Buck Dewey name is fictitious (it's meant to suggest a
``1940s bluesy ballroom jazz guy''), but the group does have a
real-life CD, ``Friday Night Chicken Waltz,'' on its own Fruitpunch
Records (www.fruitpunch.com). For more Buck Dewey, you can hear
them perform the ``Winter X-Games'' theme on ESPN at various times
next week. But the group is best appreciated in concert. Catch 'em
at the Middle East  &UR; tonight &LR;  at 11.

A BRILLIANT MOON ECLIPSED BY ROCK AND ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

MOON 
The Life and Death of a Rock Legend 
By Tony Fletcher 
Spike/Avon, 608 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 6, 1978, the last night of his life, Keith Moon went to
a London party hosted by Paul McCartney, celebrating the movie
``The Buddy Holly Story.'' Moon snorted a bit of cocaine
beforehand, but drank surprisingly little at the party. Still, he
was slurry _ the result, it turned out, of a prescription drug
called Heminevrin, used in the treatment of alcoholism. The drug
mimicked alcohol's effects; used with alcohol, as it shouldn't be,
it multiplied them.
</P>
<P>
   Moon and his girlfriend Annette Walter-Lax left the party early,
around midnight. At home, she cooked him lamb chops. Then, says
Walter-Lax, ``He has his usual glass of water and bucket of
pills.'' Moon woke up one more time, early in the morning, and
demanded she cook him a steak. He ate and went back to sleep. That
was it. An autopsy revealed 32 Heminevrin pills in his system.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, Keith Moon, drummer for the rock group The Who, died
before he got old. But not before he looked old. By the end, at 32,
Moon resembled a caricature of his young self.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fletcher's ``Moon: The Life and Death of a Rock Legend'' is
the literary equivalent of manic-depression, a condition from which
Moon likely suffered. He may also have suffered from multiple
personality disorder. Moon, the youngest member of The Who, was
certainly the most dysfunctional member of a highly dysfunctional
musical family. He was not, on the surface, a complicated man (his
core philosophy was hedonism), but he was a sharply contradictory
one. Fletcher's long tome is hilarious at times _ Moon and his
buddies cruising neighborhoods in his Bentley and announcing on a
loud PA, using proper upper-class diction, a warning from their
``Conservative candidate for Parliament that a boatload of refugees
was about to move into the neighhorhood.'' You can't help but
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But then it gets harrowing _ Moon trying to chop down the door
to the bathroom to get at his wife, Kim, a la Jack Nicholson in
``The Shining.'' There's the story of Moon being quite likely at
the wheel of a car that ran over and killed a member of his
entourage, Neil Boland. (Moon was legally cleared, but guilty in
his own mind, Fletcher writes.)
</P>
<P>
   Moon's life was one where the gleeful exuberance and casual
miscreance of youth gradually hardened into something harsher and
meaner, though not without charm, over time. You can't pinpoint the
moment the trajectory started to head downhill. And the fact is,
through thick and thin Moon's humor often came poking through. He
relished sending up the opulent rock-star lifestyle while he
simulataneously indulged in it.
</P>
<P>
   Moon saw life as performance art, every day a dress rehearsal.
His humor could go over the edge. Throughout his life he favored
Nazi regalia. He'd dress up as Rommel in jodhpurs, binoculars, knee
boots, leather coat, and cap and march up and down the beach. Or
show up like that at a business meeting. Moon was a megalomaniac;
he was also the most humble and approachable of rock stars _
everybody's friend. He was generous, abusive, hypocritical. He had
an overwhelming desire to get messed up. He snorted heroin once,
didn't like it, got sick. But just about everything else was fair
game _ he was forever swallowing handfuls of whatever he was
handed. Pete Townshend, who declined to be interviewed for the
book, wrote Fletcher: ``show business and society . . . fed and
rewards addictive and ultimately suicidal behavior.'' The author
agrees. He is, in fact, quite balanced in telling the tale. It's
not a simple, drugs-are-bad morality story.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Fletcher cites Moon's insecurity _ his feeling
unloved despite being loved by one and all. At least when he was
sober, which he rarely stayed for long. Moon's ethos was ``too much
ain't enough.'' Add to that the obscene amount of money and fame,
and the attendant perks, and you get a man whose routine consisted
of hurling TVs out of hotel windows and de rigeur room trashing. Is
it a rock star sending up consumerism and establishment mores or an
example of sociopathic behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher pays a great deal of attention to Moon's early, pre-Who
life _ when the highs were natural and the music pure. It is argued
that the best time of his life may have been while playing with the
Beachcombers, a competent but unremarkable cover group that gave
Moon his first taste of rock 'n' roll as a career. Fletcher also
does a fine job of describing Moon's chaotic brilliance, noting the
``frenetic roll through the endless seas of tom toms,'' Moon's
notion of ``leading from the back, filling up spaces that had
always been left open, leaving gaps where usually lay the beat.''
Moon didn't like drum solos, but favored ``continuous
punctuation.'' Friend and admirer Jeff Beck had no clue: ``I could
describe a car crash easier.'' His art was like his life.
</P>
<P>
   Moon died shortly after the release of The Who's album, ``Who
Are You.'' On the cover, the members of The Who stood amid their
gear, Moon sitting in a director's chair emblazoned with the
phrase, ``Not To Be Taken Away.''

NOLTE HAS ROLE OF HIS CAREER IN `AFFLICTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AFFLICTION 
Written and directed by: Paul Schrader (based on Russell Banks'
novel) 
Starring: Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafoe,
Mary Beth Hurt, Jim True, Marian Seldes, Holmes Osborne, Brigid
Tierney, Sean McCann, Wayne Robson 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The affliction in ``Affliction'' is the chain of emotional
barrenness and eruptive violence passed from father to son in a
bleak and metaphorically wintry New Hampshire town. Paul Schrader
has made a harrowing film of Russell Banks's novel about a heritage
of male violence, and it would be nice to be able to report that it
arrives at redemptive purity. But anyone who knows Banks's novels
or Schrader's films knows enough to expect the implacable. Its
protagonist, Nick Nolte's part-time cop and full-time loser named
Wade, struggles heroically, if cluelessly, to throw off a twin yoke
of heredity and environment. There's a hangdog nobility about him
as he shambles through the ashes of his life, trying to get things
right after a long series of dead ends. Nolte is heart-wrenching in
the best and most challenging role of a career that has been built
on challenge, on finding the humanity in guys living on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   He trails broken relationships behind him, trying not to become
his father, an alcoholic brute played with lacerating power by
James Coburn in a scathing and all too relevant film that taps into
a subterranean malevolence that's closer to the mainstream than we
like to think. A man less self-aware would think that a throbbing
toothache suffered by Nolte's ironically directionless traffic cop
is affliction. But Nolte's eyes project too much pain and awareness
not to tell us that he's all too aware of how the violence in his
own family has twisted him. He's sitting on a lot of rage. He
hasn't a clue about how to relate to women _ from his ex-wife to
his young daughter, who resents the weight of expectation he puts
on her, to the current woman in his life, a waitress played by
Sissy Spacek with a sweetness and patience that we hope aren't
foreshadowings of her own victimization.
</P>
<P>
   As the film begins, it's very much a possibility. His own father
has declined into an insensate animal, from whom all humanity has
fallen away, whose neglect of his wife caused her death because he
was too drunk to check that the heat was on in their shabby
farmhouse. Hellish as the place may have been for Wade and his
brother, Rolfe (Willem Dafoe), whose boyhood beatings at the hands
of their father we see in flashbacks, Wade moves back there from
his trailer because his father's infirmity requires looking after.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the old man appreciates it. Although he's only a shell
of his fierce former self, Coburn's jolting performance as the
primeval ruin of a patriarch leaves no doubt of his brutishness or
his ability to still do damage, living as he does on the
destructive side of masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Wade can resist succumbing to the old
male patterns once he moves back to what is laughably called home
and is subject to the infantilizing reversion it seems to spawn.
Spacek plays the woman so gently that we hold our breath, willing
her to get out before she becomes a stand-in for Wade's abused
mother in a grim pattern of history repeating itself, taking its
cue from DNA and conditioning. The surprising thing is that Nolte
projects gentleness, too. Simmering as he is, there's also
something befuddled about him. Part of it seems shame at having
allowed himself to be humbled since boyhood, part of it simple
bewilderment at his inability to get anything right in his
relationships, genuine as his yearning for a decent, righteous life
may be.
</P>
<P>
   Events are precipitated by a death that Wade thinks might prove
his worth to the town and to himself. A powerful union leader is
killed while hunting. It's called an accident. But Wade thinks it
might have been murder, linked to the scheme of the richest man in
town to complete his virtual rape of the working-class community by
lopping off a piece of prime land and developing it. It's to the
eternal credit of Schrader, though, that the inner mystery
supersedes the nominal one. Taking his cue from Banks, he shot the
film in starkly elemental-looking locales near Montreal, crafting
psychological darkness into the looming, primeval,
brink-of-nightfall atmosphere. It pervades this film about the
forces racing to devour Nolte's agonized Prometheus, trying to
illuminate his own soul in order to right it while he still can.
He's as plain as a lunchbox, yet he achieves tragic grandeur.

DIFRANCO GROWS `UP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Musicians adopt very different strategies for releasing a new
album. Some will hang around and turn into control freaks, as they
badger managers and record companies to make sure an aggressive
marketing campaign is in place. Others, like indie-folkie Ani
DiFranco, take the opposite approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I release an album, I just leave the country!''
DiFranco said this week, before heading off to tour New Zealand and
Australia. ``It's a strategy I invented when my last album, `Little
Plastic Castle,' came out.''
</P>
<P>
   For DiFranco, it's an attempt to stay away from the commercial
madness and sometimes nasty album reviews that can occur. It's her
way of preserving her sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my new thing,'' she said of her exit strategy, just as
her new disc, ``Up Up Up Up Up Up,'' is due Tuesday. ``It adds
significantly to my mental health to leave the continent when all
the reviews and the chatter and the dissection come out. People
have all these opinions about what you're trying to do, about
what's successful or not. Of course, it's different for every
person who is commenting, but it plays heavily on your thoughts and
starts to mess with your head.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco, 28, has become an unlikely star in recent years. An
ardent, punk-influenced folkie, she has carved a niche with her
Buffalo-based label, Righteous Babe Records. But she's also one of
the most overanalyzed singer-songwriters of her time. On her last
album, she even wrote a song about how some fans interpret her
every move as if it ``is my new statement for all of womenhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot on that album about struggling with my job and
with finding myself hoisted into this position of what you could
call celebrity,'' DiFranco said. ``But mostly, it's the media
speculation and the Internet spew that can get very claustrophobic
if you're just trying to live and be human and make art.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco has made that art with increasing skill through a
prolific 10 albums, highlighted by 1995's ``Not a Pretty Girl'' and
1996's ``Dilate.'' The next chapter is ``Up Up Up Up Up Up,'' which
is less song-oriented than her past work, but more loose and
jam-heavy because her new touring band recorded with her. Two tunes
stretch beyond eight minutes, ``Come Away from It'' (a put-down of
cynicism and selfishness) and the amusingly bohemian ``Hat Shaped
Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more organic,'' she said of the studio recording that
was done in New Orleans. ``We were just rolling tape at all times
and just playing together. I was throwing out ideas and then I
picked what I thought was working. . . . We had so much fun! My
mind has also been opening up about how to make a record. In the
past, I'd go in with songs and get all set up and get uptight and
then somebody presses the record button and you try not to make a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also ready to make a new record that departed from my
verse/chorus/verse folk music roots, so I could just feel my head
drifting into new territory,'' she said. ``I was getting out of
traditional song structures. That has to do partially with having a
band now, a cool band to interact with musically. So I'm doing a
lot more arranging. Before, I would bring the songs into the band,
and say, `Here's the finished song, figure out stuff to play on
it.' But now, I have a musical relationship with these fine players
that is developing. I can come to them and say, `OK, I have this
idea and it goes like this.' And sort of really create something
with the band. There's only so long that you can groove hard on a
(solo) acoustic guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up'' has slower tempos than past efforts, feeling like
meditations at times. ``Yeah, I've been noticing the titles of my
songs lately, like `Virtue' (on the new disc) and an even newer one
called `Providence.' I was thinking, `Oh, my goodness, what's
happening to me? Am I going to be born-again in another week or
something?' But I think I'm just taking a few more steps in looking
at my life.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even a verse on the sparse title track that notes,
``God's work isn't done by God, it's done by people.'' As DiFranco
explained: ``I was just thinking of all the good work that people
do, all the necessary work that people do to try to mend the world
and create the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But listeners shouldn't overestimate any spiritual messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I operate on a tense, taut level pretty effectively,'' she
said. ``I don't want to relax too much or become too in touch with
the self, for fear of what's there. I'm a spiritual person in my
own way, but I think a lot of my spirituality has to do with my
music and my art. That's when I'm meditating or exorcising my
demons or getting in touch with my gods. It's on stage, I suppose,
where I channel it all. I'm pretty much an atheist outside of that.
Also, I'm getting a little older _ and you start to look at things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Older, and more mellow musically on the new album (which gets
better and better with repeated listens), but DiFranco still hits
hard with her political lyrics. She opens with the provocative ``
'Tis of Thee,'' about racial and economic oppression and how in
some cities ``they put everyone in jail except the Cleavers and the
Bradys.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Tis of Thee' is also very much about the drug war,'' she
said. ``I think the drug war is still just a war on poor people.
It's an attacking of symptoms and an ignoring of an economic and
racist disease. We're the most imprisoned industrialized nation, I
believe. We've surpassed Russia and we've surpassed South Africa.
There are more young black males in prison under the age of 25 than
there are in college. That's disgusting. I think it's a
conservative victimization of an expendable population and it
terrifies me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still writing about a lot of the same things I was writing
about, but I frame them a little differently than a few albums
back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, though, the album lacks any obvious radio single. It
affirms a remark she made last year that she's never had a radio
single and doesn't expect to have one. She almost laughs about it
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a non-radio album,'' said DiFranco. ``I feel almost
guilty when I walk into the Righteous Babe Records office. I don't
give them a lot of tools to work with. There's a gentleman whose
job is radio promotions and I say to him, `Good luck!' But it's not
a problem with me.''

ACTING MAKES `FIRST SIGHT' WORTH SEEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AT FIRST SIGHT 
Directed by: Irwin Winkler 
Screenplay by: Steve Levitt (based on a story by Oliver Sacks) 
Starring: Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino, Kelly McGillis, Bruce Davison,
Steven Weber, Ken Howard, Nathan Lane 
Running time: 124 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (scenes involving sexuality and nudity, and for brief
strong language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``At First Sight'' avoids most of the obvious pitfalls faced by
a film that wants to be a love story between a blind man and a
sighted woman. But it's hampered by a clunky script and
insufficient directorial finesse. In the end, it's worth watching _
but only just _ thanks to the appeal and resourcefulness of Val
Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. He's a laid-back masseur at an upstate
resort visited by Sorvino's stressed-out Manhattan architect. So
effective is his soothing touch that she's quite attracted to him
before she realizes he's blind. In fact, his blindness seems less
of an obstacle to their making a go of a relationship than their
cultural and attitudinal differences.
</P>
<P>
   What's refreshing is his attitude toward his blindness. Utterly
demolishing any thought that he sees himself as a victim waiting to
be saved, Kilmer's tough-minded Virgil is utterly without
self-pity, quite well-adjusted to his sightlessness and unselfish
enough to be willing to be the one who makes all the big changes
when he and Sorvino's Amy decide to live together in her Manhattan
loft. What he doesn't realize is that Amy has done some research
and has found a surgeon (Bruce Davison) who offers an experimental
procedure that may return Virgil to the sight he lost as a boy.
Things get prickly for a while, especially since Virgil sees
himself as a person not in need of anyone's bounty, including
Amy's.
</P>
<P>
   Had Virgil not agreed, and had not the surgery worked, however,
we would not have the pleasure of seeing Kilmer portray with
affecting skill the reactions of a man suppressing his fears enough
to adjust to living in a new world of depth and space and color and
facial expressions he can't fathom. Part of what he has to overcome
is his own naivete, and while he's sweet enough to want to please
Amy, he also refuses to adopt a placating attitude or play for
sympathy as they wait to see whether the operation's success will
be long-term or short-term. Reinforcing his tough-mindedness is his
sister, played by Kelly McGillis, who's afraid he'll get hurt and
argues for the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Sorvino's character could be a pill, too, but isn't, thanks to
the awkwardness with which Sorvino plays her. Far from seeming a
bossy know-it-all, she shows an awareness in her gestures and
expressions of how tentative any relationship is and how easy it is
to upset the fragile equilibirum they have. About half way through,
you find yourself wishing that the two actors had simply been
allowed to improvise their lines. They surely would have been
guided by their instincts into more productive territory than the
script's leaden metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to remind us of the differences between blindness and
perception, and of the ways in which so-called blind people can see
more than so-called sighted people, they prevent the acerbic edge
that makes Virgil so invigorating from working its way into the
rest of the film. As Virgil, Kilmer gives his best performance in
ages. As a director, Winkler is improving, but he still succumbs to
a tendency to say clumsily with words what can be said more
economically and eloquently with the right facial exprression. ``At
First Sight'' could have been worse, but it certainly could have
been better.

great national saga with a fresh star and at least a fair shot at a
happy ending _ even if it involves what Americans may regard as
minor characters. Edward, the queen's youngest and least famous
son, prefers to be called Edward Windsor when he is away from the
palace and is making his mark in the world of producing TV
documentaries. He's the producer formerly known as prince. But for
a royal household eager for a little good news, the announcement of
engagement to his girlfried of five years produced near giddiness.

   CASTLE16 _ By failing to show up to serve a 10-year prison term
in 1977, Sam Castle bought himself 21 years of illicit freedom. He
also bought himself an extra 12 months in a federal prison, the
sentence he received Friday on federal charges of fleeing to avoid
confinement. Castle, 63, was convicted in the early '70s of arson
for blowing up his sailboat at a Lantana marina, but he fled the
state while free pending his appeal. He dodged authorities for
years, but was caught in Seattle in the summer when the feds
trailed his wife there from Hawaii, where his wealthy family lives.
Before serving his federal sentence, Castle must first serve his
original time for arson _ but he will also enjoy the easier
sentencing laws in place when he was convicted. Probation officials
said Castle will likely only have to serve 2 1/2 to 4 years of his
10-year state term, though it could be slightly more if he loses
some gain time for escape. Still, it probably won't be 85 percent
of his sentence, which is the current sentencing law. Also, he's
already served 7 months of the federal charge. In exchange for his
guilty plea, federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue Castle's wife
or parents, who helped him avoid investigators all these years.

NEW NBC ENTERTAINMENT BOSS TALKS FAMILY VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Scott Sassa may just be a temporary Band-Aid
as NBC tinkers with its programming, but right out of the gate he
is making some interesting suggestions for the network: Less sex
and more family.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, NBC's new entertainment president, has a tough act to
follow. Warren Littlefield was in that position for nine years and
loved the limelight of the job. Of course, NBC began its crash and
Littlefield was dumped and Sassa _ who has more of a business than
programming background _ took over.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Sassa to program anything. He will eventually be
promoted to West Coast president, then he'll hire an entertainment
president (most likely Garth Ancier, formerly of The WB) to replace
himself. So, as NBC continues to give off a desperate aura of a
ship sinking fast in a cold, heartless sea _ despite being No. 1 in
the advertising-friendly demographic range of 18-49 _ Sassa's job
is to give the network vision.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the same vision that Ancier outlines, given he's
coming from the red-hot, teen-sex obsessed WB, but for stop-gap
measures it sure opened some eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He wants more traditional families on NBC. ``We've shifted too
far away from that,'' Sassa said, in the understatement of the
decade. NBC is not a family network. It's the young, good-looking
people living in big cities and working in media network. Families?
The closest is ``Mad About You,'' which was essentially two
good-looking people who had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have less of an emphasis on sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't having sex the whole consuming obsession of most people on
NBC?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe this is a way we need to move. When I talk to
people, they want shows they can watch with their kids. We need to
be more responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Sassa tried to move onward, yet the
questions wouldn't go away. ``I want to be clear here,'' he said,
laughing and shaking his head. `I'm not saying no sex, I'm saying
less sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could use a few more words between `Hello' and `Will you
sleep with me?' We want to lessen the amount of sex that is
gratuitous.''
</P>
<P>
   And about those families? ``We're not trying to create a family
channel here,'' Sassa said. ``I'm talking about better balance.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. NBC is out of balance if you're talking about the
whole single-people-abstaining and families-galore thing. There's a
reason for that: Sexy singles was the network strategy for, oh,
about a decade. Maybe more balance will make NBC a better network _
and it certainly needs to do something different as it drowns under
the weight of a lot of really mediocre sitcoms _ yet even minor
adjustments in those areas represent a major overhaul for the
Peacock network.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more diversity in future NBC shows, said Sassa,
who is Japanese-American. He thought the network did well with its
dramas, though not its comedies. He also wants less of an emphasis
on New York, an NBC staple for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other places are cool, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa announced that ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' was coming back
for another year. He said the network plans a three-hour telecast
of ``Saturday Night Live'' in September to celebrate that show's
25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   He said NBC had three shows that might or might not be used in
the spring, two of them dramas. He spun numbers like a good
entertainment president should _ against his competitors and
against cable, as is the new trend. He tried to change the
perception that NBC was reeling from the loss of ``Seinfeld'' and
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is indeed reeling. Those spring replacement shows aren't
honed and ready _ an indication that the network's development
season has been poor and is in dire need of Ancier (or someone) to
arrive. It has alienated some of the studios by demanding ownership
of shows (a fight NBC has lost), and no other network has a worse
working relationship with the press.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, there's a feeling that NBC is in a holding
pattern, waiting for an experienced programmer like Ancier to truly
set the direction. If that's so, then Sassa's ``vision'' could be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it was quite an eye-opener.

everyone. Old Victorians that landlords had chopped into two or

WHEN THESE TRUCKS MEET, IT'S A MONSTER SMASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By IHOSVANI RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ There's a primitive sense of seduction in watching a
10-ton vehicle going vertical.
</P>
<P>
   It's an allure compounded by watching it, seconds later,
furiously hammering granny's little green Chevette into the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a world made whole by ballet, Tex-Mex cuisine and
Nobel-worthy medical breakthroughs _ the finer things in life _
it's comforting to know there's still room for the monster truck
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Crankshafts ... tubular chassis systems ... pistons ... roll
cages ... the peculiar smell of burned alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Men, women and children all praying for a wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Eardrums violently assaulted, jingling, a kind of hurt that
feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are bloodthirsty people,'' said Jack Koberna, the
owner and driver of one of these vehicular killer whales. ``You
think they care about you destroying your $100,000 truck? No, they
want to see you wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   With a price tag of at least $100,000, you can bet these big
babies have never hauled a load of dirt, much less kids and dogs on
a country drive. The testosterone-fueled machines carry names like
Liquidator, Eradicator, Cyborg and Grave Digger.
</P>
<P>
   If Wild Thang were a person, he'd be facing 15 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   A monster truck a highly modified 4-wheel-drive vehicle, the
most distinguishing characteristic being the outsized tires. Most
monster trucks are speed- and handling-enhanced to race similar
behemoths over obstacle courses usually set up with cars to crush
and dirt ramps to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world there are more than 500 monster trucks, with
about 300 in the United States. Top trucks compete in 45 to 50
events a year, with drivers spending 200 days a year on the road,
logging 60,000 to 70,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   When the monsters meet, it's a David vs. Goliath engagement of
motorized carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Koberna and his wife Roxanne own the Cyborg, a red, 20,000-pound
behemoth with tires the size of baby elephants. For 18 years, the
couple from Tulia, in the Texas Panhandle, have traveled the
country showing off the Cyborg and previous incarnations of it,
riding the wave that's become the high-risk sport _ and the
higher-stakes business _ of monster trucking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, monster trucks was about watching Big Foot do
wheelies and crushing cars,'' Roxanne Koberna said last weekend
during a break in the show at the packed Astrodome, referring to
the godfather of all trucks. ``Now it's a legit sport. It took
NASCAR almost four decades to get as popular as it is today.
Monster trucks is moving at a faster pace than that.''
</P>
<P>
   This thing the Kobernas refer to as a sport looks like yet
another American cultural staple, almost an obsession, that most of
us are afraid to admit to enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people that look down at us because it's considered
a sport only rednecks like,'' said Johnny Campos, owner of Extreme
Off-Road of San Antonio, a shop that for 25 years has been
specializing in converting pickup trucks into beasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the biggest misconception,'' he said. ``Yeah, you're
going to have your cowboys who really get a kick out of it, but in
the last couple of years it's become a type of entertainment that
crosses all cultures, especially the youngsters. Not everyone will
admit they're fans, but look at all of the sold-out stadiums and
see for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   On this cold night in Houston, the clobbering and pulverizing of
decommissioned cars begins promptly.
</P>
<P>
   In pairs, trucks race each other through an obstacle course
built solely to keep these mammoths airborne as much as possible.
After a while, nobody seems to be keeping track of who's winning.
Heck, it doesn't really matter. Just keep those babies jumping.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner inside the stadium, Koberna is sitting inside the
Cyborg, waiting patiently to take his crack at going home with some
points and cash.
</P>
<P>
   How he got here has become his and Roxanne's routine. It's the
same in every town: A couple days ago, the Kobernas pulled into
Houston in their 18-wheeler that's been heavily modified to serve
as their home on the road. The truck is also mechanical shop,
business office and Cyborg's piggyback ride across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing,'' said Roxanne Koberna, referring to this
on-the-road, 30-weeks-a-year lifestyle. ``You get to do what you
like to do and have fun instead of living inside a cubicle, like
Dilbert.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Waist deep in the big desert?
 &HT;    For release Jan. 20, 1999. Moving in advance because of the MLK
holiday.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why, whenever I read of a further escalation of our conflict
with Iraq, do I hear, subliminally, the strains of Pete Seeger
singing ``Waist Deep in the Big Muddy?''
</P>
<P>
   How deep are we going to descend into this sandy void,
physically disparate to Vietnam's ``Big Muddy'' but tactically just
as dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   During those somewhat glorious-sounding days of Desert Storm in
1991, it was golden the way we responded to our men and women
kicking Saddam Hussein's posterior. Overnight, heroes were born:
Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf and Dick Cheney at the top along
with thousands of others, trudging the sandy battlefield with gas
masks at their sides.
</P>
<P>
   We later found out, of course, that despite the efforts of our
troops, pilots and sailors, what we thought was the objective had
not been attained: Hussein still was there. We were told,
afterward, that Hussein never was the target, just his missiles and
germs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's posterior may have been kicked but he remains a pain
in ours.
</P>
<P>
   These years later _ support for continued enforcement of United
Nations sanctions eroding in the world community _ we are back at
it trying to keep our foot on the neck of Hussein; us and the
British, with vocal support from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Israel and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Iraqis were somewhat right when they charged
that the U.N. inspection teams were spying for the U.S., something
we denied emphatically until faced with documentation. And then the
U.S. poured doublespeak into the media to muddle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   With each day new activity arises, much of it inspired by the
acrimonious Iraqi leadership, which is trying desperately to
position itself as the aggrieved victim of U.S. intransigence, a la
Fidel Castro. Sadly, it's working.
</P>
<P>
   As activity accelerates over no-fly zones and in saber-rattling
from Baghdad toward Kuwait, as missiles fly here and there, we are
going to reach a day when a U.S. or British plane will be shot
down. And with that comes the possibility of one or more of our
people, dead or alive, being dragged through the streets of
Baghdad, or hung from a lamppost, or forced to confess through
bruised lips that he intentionally bombed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Somalia, and so disturbed were the
American people by the sight of American dead being dragged through
the streets that we had to get out and leave Somalia to its
warlords.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened to us in Vietnam. In the earliest days of
our involvement, the gullible among us _ including me _ rallied
around what we thought was the right cause. Others, early on, saw
through the deceits proferred not by the valiant young Americans in
combat, but by the likes of the Pentagon, Lyndon Johnson and Robert
McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   It took 50,000 dead, emphasized by the gruesome visuals sent
back to us through TV, magazines and newspapers, before we realized
the pit into which we had descended _ that Big Muddy _ and our
inability to achieve success.
</P>
<P>
   Our policy toward Iraq is in disarray, our former Allies queasy
about our itchy trigger fingers. How soon will it be before more
troops are called to the sands to defend Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, or
to contain Iraq _ whichever you believe the mission to be?
</P>
<P>
   And whatever happened to the U.N.; wasn't this their thing?
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs to pause and study what we're getting into. If
Saddam Hussein still isn't the target, if we're still only intent
in setting back his war machine a year at a time, then turn up the
volume on that old Seeger anti-war song.

<P>
   If I could have picked a moment to retire right on the spot, it
would have been opening day, 1975. It was my first game as a
Milwaukee Brewer after 21 years with the Braves. Somehow, I reached
first base in that game and then took off to steal second. I ran as
hard as I could, and when I was finished sliding, it seemed as if I
was about half a block from second base. Needless to say, it was
the last time I tried to steal a base.
</P>
<P>
   I knew at that moment that I wouldn't be able to play ball
anything like I had for the previous 21 years, but I also knew that
retirement wasn't an option. I had signed a two-year contract with
the Brewers, and they were counting on me to bring a lot of fans to
the ball park.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, I didn't want to retire. I had become very fond of
Milwaukee in the 12 seasons I spent there before the Braves moved
to Atlanta, and wanted to finish my career there.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, you never know what's going through an athlete's
mind when he decides to retire. Some athletes might give you
reasons, but you're never sure whether those are the real reasons.
In most cases, all you can do is speculate.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I found myself doing yesterday when Michael Jordan
retired. I was on an airplane when he made his announcement, but I
couldn't help speculating about it like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement is a personal thing. I can't say whether it's best to
retire at the top of the game, as Jordan did, or a few years later,
as I did. Everybody has his own reasons. Sandy Koufax retired at
the peak of his career because he couldn't lift his arm. Jim Brown
retired after his eighth rushing title in a nine-year career
because he had something else to do. He was going to make movies.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes back to what motivates people. And it's very seldom
that the public knows what goes on inside a professional athlete's
head. People expect us to make decisions based on their own
standards, and sometimes those standards have nothing to do with
what a person is really all about.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some people thought I should have retired after
the 1973 season, which ended with me one home run behind Babe
Ruth's record for home runs in a career. I guess they figured that
would be a way for me to honor Ruth. But it never entered my mind.
I didn't play baseball to honor Babe Ruth. I played it because I
loved it and it was the thing I was best at.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan's case, I firmly believe that he quit because he saw
his ball club being dismantled and didn't think the Bulls could
play at the only level he'd be satisfied with. He could probably
have gone to any number of teams and brought them a championship,
but I don't think he was interested in starting over.
</P>
<P>
   I think he was only interested in winning championships with the
Bulls. That was the standard he had set for himself.

SAN FRANCISCO POLICE TO ENFORCE SMOKING BAN IN BARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS and MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly one year after the California legislature
banned smoking in every bar in the state, the San Francisco police
are warning 2,400 bars and restaurants in the city that officers
will soon begin busting bar patrons who defy the law by lighting up
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a smoking ticket: $76.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to bars and restaurants, Police Chief Fred Lau and
Health Director Mitchell Katz said teams of officers and health
inspectors would make surprise visits to the city's more than 800
bars to ensure that the smoking ban is being honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visits will be unannounced and will focus on bars or taverns
where there have been complaints about patrons smoking,'' Lau
wrote. ``We recommend that you inform your patrons who are smoking
at your business that they will be subject to penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was good news to health advocates, who had groused
for months that the city was ignoring the anti-smoking law.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some health groups had began threatening a
lawsuit aimed at forcing compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is the worst place in the whole state on this,''
said Dr. Stanton Glantz, a professor at the University of
California at San Francisco and an anti-tobacco activist.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Health Department showed the no-smoking
law is being ignored in about half the bars in the city. It is a
different story in restaurants that also have bars _ 90 percent of
them are smoke-free, the survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
   The health groups say the law is important to protect the health
of people who visit bars as well as those who work in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bars and gaming clubs are workplaces, and we need to protect
workers,'' said Kirk Kleinschmidt of the American Heart
Association. ``Environmental tobacco smoke is a recognized health
toxin.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Licavoli of the American Lung Association said enforcement
got off to a slow start in the city. Early on, the Health
Department concentrated on making sure bar owners posted ``No
Smoking'' signs and issued citations if they took the signs down.
</P>
<P>
   However, under the law as interpreted by the city attorney,
Licavoli said, health inspectors had no power to cite a bar patron
who was smoking in defiance of the ban. Because the police weren't
involved, no one enforced the no-smoking law.
</P>
<P>
   The health groups praised the city for announcing the new
enforcement effort and said they expected results.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come back at the end of February and we ask, `How many
citations did you issue?' that will tell us how seriously the city
is taking enforcement,'' Kleinschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   If the city isn't enforcing the ban, he said, ``We'll review all
options, including a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's pledge to fine violators of the law was not welcomed
by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still going to smoke in bars, no matter what,''
said Ursula McGrath, 26, leaning forward for her boyfriend to light
her Marlboro Lights cigarette at one San Francisco bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't want to smoke, keep them at home,'' she said.
``Smoking has been in bars forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Dewayne Tully said Lau was meeting with the
Health Department to plot the scope of the enforcement program. No
officers have yet been assigned to the project, but Tully said the
chief means business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law's been ignored. Patrons continue to smoke in bars, and
hence they're meeting on how to enforce it,'' Tully said.

</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-RDP (Rio de Janeiro) _ Brazil abandons its efforts to
defend its currency, allowing it to float freely. At last look, the
real stood at about 1.48 to the dollar, down 11 percent from
Thursday. Its weakest point Friday morning was about 1.53 to the
dollar. On Tuesday, the day before officials launched their brief
effort to live with a wider trading band, the real was quoted at
1.21 to the dollar. Brazilian stocks have shot up an astonishing 27
percent (but are still down 5 percent on the year). By Diana Jean
Schemo. (With graphic.)

a float, rise. At midday, the industrial average was up 129 points,
or 1.4 percent, and the Nasdaq index was up 42 points, or 1.9
percent. Elsewhere, the Tokyo market was closed for a holiday,
while Hong Kong shares declined 0.4 percent. Stocks rose 1.5
percent in Frankfurt and 2 percent in London. They were up 6.7

nearly a full point, with the yield at 5.12 percent. By Edward

   VOLVO-SCANIA (London) _ Volvo buys 13 percent of Scania for 5.2
billion kronor, or $666 million, and says it wants to buy the rest.
By adding to its truck operations, Volvo may be preparing to sell
its car unit, which has been the subject of much takeover talk. On
the Big Board, Scania's depository receipts rose as much as 16
percent. By Alan Cowell.

</P>
<P>
   FBN-JETS-PARCELLS (Undated) _ Coach Bill Parcells is used to
surpassing expectations when it comes to pulling a football team
from the ashes. He did it with the New York Giants, transforming a
beleaguered franchise into a two-time Super Bowl winner. He did it
with the New England Patriots earlier this decade. Four years after
winning only two games in 1992, Parcells had the Patriots in the
Super Bowl. But nothing in Parcells's resume _ perhaps in no
professional coaching resume _ compares with what Parcells has
accomplished with the Jets. By Mike Freeman. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-JETS (Denver) _ There's a reason they call it Mile High
Stadium, but Bill Parcells of the Jets, who once coached at nearby
Air Force, downplays the effect altitude might have on his team,
especially late in the game. By Gerald Eskenazi.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-VIKINGS (Minneapolis) _ Everyone knows Minnesota's offense
is the one of the best in league history, but the Vikings'
defensive players say they know they're a big reason the team has
lost only one game this season. Stopping Atlanta's strong receiving
and running game on Sunday will put them in the spotlight. By Jack
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-RHODEN-COLUMN (Minneapolis, Minn.) _ Sports column on Alan
Page, former Purple People Eater turned Minnesota judge. By William
C. Rhoden.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-BRONCOS (Englewood, Colo.) _ For Tyrone Braxton, it's Wayne
Chrebet drifting behind the linebackers and staking out the middle
of the field. For Ray Crockett, it's about matching his swift moves
and finesse against Keyshawn Johnson's towering strength. For Neil
Smith, the key is burying Curtis Martin before he pops through the
offensive line. The Bronco defenders are articulate about the
threats they face against the Jets in Sunday's American Football
Conference championship game. But they are more defensive about
their unit, which for much of the season didn't play like defending
Super Bowl champions. By Joe Drape.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-KNICKS (New York) _ This is the last weekend the Knicks have
to get their act together before training camp starts next week. By
Selena Roberts.

Williams to a $85 million contract, New Jersey looks in better

WHAT YOU NEED IN A CAR IS A FOUL-WEATHER FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last, the perfect match of the right car in the right
weather. Meaning, of course, that the weather is absolutely wrong.
You couldn't have planned it any worse: wide temperature swings,
ice, freezing rain, snow, bitter cold. When it comes to weather and
cars, I take my cue from the witches of Macbeth _ what's foul is
fair and what's fair is foul.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not quite a perfect match; the car is a Mercedes E320
sedan with 4Matic, the old techno name resurrected on the new
all-wheel-drive system, and it can handle virtually anything Mother
Nature can throw in front of your headlights. But it would be
perfect, perhaps if it had that heated seats option, the $595 extra
also available with rain-sensitive wipers and headlamp washers in a
$1,675 package. That might be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'm spoiled. I didn't grow up with that kind of luxury _ who
did? Growing up in my economic segment (it's called poverty, but
nobody told us, so we didn't know) one walked home in the cold and
snow. Or took public transport if you had a nickel or a dime. Even
without heated seats, frozen buns in a Benz E320 AWD is a lot
better than the snow-filled, wind-blown open top of a Fifth Avenue
Coach Co. double-decker rushed into emergency service for the
blizzard _ ah, that was fun. Not.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, Jan. 8, the weather news is not good. Traffic
news is worse. As the Benz exits the Globe lot onto Morrissey
Boulevard, the traffic mavens at WBZ are speed-speaking the bad
news. The traffic report is the only thing moving at speed; traffic
isn't. The Expressway is a parking lot, Route 93 is clogged, the
bridge is jammed, the tunnel ramps are plugged _ but no one has
mentioned the Ted Williams. It's Friday. I head through South
Boston in what seems to be light traffic, turn into the TWT just as
the speed-speaker reminds all that the TWT is indeed open to all.
This is the only good thing that hapens for the rest of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   On Route 1 just south of the 129 underpass, I catch up with the
clog. It is snowing, and, for once, people are slowing. Benz has
elected to equip its cars with a single long wiper blade that
sweeps across a wide swath of windshield; it has some winter
drawbacks. The longer the arm, the more ice and snow will build up
on it _ this is not a winter blade wrapped to protect the fingers
that give it flexibility. Snow and slush clog it, keeping it from
bending to the contour of the windshield, which means the part I
see through isn't getting wiped clear.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 95 below Portsmouth is grim, and the Spaulding Pike
is grimmer, even though the DPW lads are out there. The E320 plows
along, steady as if on a dry road. The normal one hour, 20-minute
commute stretches to two hours, 50 minutes. What would it have been
without the TWT?
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday, Jan. 9, the natal day of the first born of the
auto writer, the daughter who is about to celebrate the passage of
three decades on the planet some 60 miles distant, and the weather
is lousy. Exceedingly lousy. I begin by chipping my way through the
ice to get into the car, then chip and scrape some more as it warms
up, slide down the driveway, and slither down the street to clear _
more or less _ pavement. It is raining; it is 30 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heading southwest on New Hampshire Route 125, the rain is
increasing in intensity, and the temperature is rising. It jumps 17
degrees in 20 miles, and now the rain is coming in torrents. The
car is fine, except I can't see anything, and must pull over until
either the rain abates or Noah happens by.
</P>
<P>
   It is 20-odd degrees warmer in Lowell than at the start of this
trek, but we celebrate, I, daughter, and a score of her nearest and
dearest. I leave before the celebrating is all done to find the
thermometer is doing a Wall Street impression and dropped a bunch.
The puddles have frozen in mid ripple; common sense says head for
the interstates and take the long way around to home. I am big on
common sense, but tonight it seems to be locked in the trunk or
something. I head for the back roads.
</P>
<P>
   The E320 is making occasional odd sounds to the accompaniment of
a little flashing light telling me what I already know; I am
driving on black ice. There are abundant patches of it, but the
E320 zips quietly along, electronically correcting for yaw, for
wheel slip, for imminent skids. I throttle back; just because it
moves forward quite well is no indication one can stop the thing.
The instant the brakes are applied, what little traction that is
available on ice disappears with the smidgen of heat a braking
wheel generates. But the celebrant behind me (not from the birthday
party, I assure you) can't take the hint, zooms by, mostly
straight.
</P>
<P>
   The public works guys are out in force, sanding, salting, trying
to render passable as much of the road network as possible as
quickly as possible. From time to time, I fall in behind one; from
time to time, some fruitcake passes us both, to boldly go where no
earthling should go before _ before the sander onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long, slow, slippery trip. Patience and a full
windshield washer tank are necessary equipment.
</P>
<P>
   This is a $48,990-plus-$595-delivery sedan, very well equipped,
and very well designed to handle rotten road conditions with
all-wheel drive adjusting torque automatically to take advantage of
available traction at any corner, antilock brakes, air bags, all
the bells and whistles _ thus underscoring the obvious: Safety is
readily available to the rich. Cutting-edge safety technology is
rarely available to the less-than-well-to-do except as a
hand-me-down, usually long after it has ceased to be cutting edge.
The silver lining in this socioeconomic cloud is that five years
hence, when the Benz has depreciated to the point where the lower
middle-class can stretch the budget to reach it, the technogizmos
will likely still be working _ and you, too, can then enjoy the AWD
and swear at the dismally inconvenient (but geometrically arrayed)
radio controls and grumble at the single wiper. Of course, the
maintenance expense may be . . . but enough carping; it is snowing
again, and time to play in traffic.

WHICH BUSINESSES WILL BE DESTROYED BY THE INTERNET? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are attentive to the news media at all, you know one
thing for sure: Internet stocks are overvalued. Everybody from the
Wall Street Journal to the Howie Carr Show says so. Every day,
experts blather on about this ``speculative bubble.'' And after the
latest evidence of dot-com stock mania (Amazon.com up 100 percent
in two weeks!) has been smothered in pontification, the portentous
question is asked: When is the bubble going to burst?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple. It won't. It'll shake out, certainly, but
it won't crash. The Internet is here to stay. It is a transforming
technology. It will alter the way business, commerce, medicine,
science, communications, the law, politics, and government are
conducted. The Internet changes everything it touches, and it
touches almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows which Internet companies will thrive and
prosper, but there is no question that some of them will. The real
question for investors in 1999 is not, ``When is the bubble going
to burst?'' The real question is: ``Which traditional companies are
going to be destroyed by the Internet?'' There are five business
categories that seem especially vulnerable to Internet attack:
banking, financial services, retail, telephony, and media.
</P>
<P>
   There are others. But consider these five.
</P>
<P>
   How do you like your bank? This year, AOL expects to create a
common banking platform that will become the first functional
on-line bank. To attract customers, they will offer credit cards at
exceptionally low rates of interest _ for life. They will also
offer mortgage loans, home equity loans, and education loans; all
of which will be aggressively priced to attract as many customers
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So let's see. You can pay Big Bank 14.9 percent on your Visa
card or you can pay Bank.com 3.9 percent for the first six months
and then 8.9 percent for life after that.
</P>
<P>
   Bank.com will likely shave one point off your mortgage and two
points off your car loan and another 2 points off your home equity
line, and it won't charge you a fee at the ATM. In two years,
Bank.com will offer a service called ``bill-payer'' which will
electronically keep all your accounts current. And they'll do all
this without any ``branches'' filled with surly people snarling at
you because you've deigned to ask them to provide some service.
How's that work for you?
</P>
<P>
   Your money is now in one place. You want to invest. On-line
trading houses will be more than happy to help you. You don't have
a lot of money, but that's OK, on-line brokerages actually want
your business. The minimums are $1,000 to $2,500; $10,000 gets you
premium service. Try walking into one of the traditional brokerages
with a $2,500 check. They'd send you out for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Once the clearing mechanisms are worked out, the on-line
brokerage business is going to decimate the traditional brokerage
business. It will be much cheaper, faster, more user friendly, less
dishonest, less arrogant, much better informed. It's a slam-dunk.
And the wonderful thing is the on-line brokerages must, in order to
survive against its on-line competitors, win your trust every day.
If they break your trust, they're finished. Those are the dynamics
of the web.
</P>
<P>
   Retail is a no-brainer. You can fight your way down to a gloomy
mall and buy a new refrigerator, or you can buy it on line. It's
the exact same refrigerator. It'll be a lot cheaper on the
Internet, and you won't have to pay any sales tax because of the
Internet sales tax moratorium. You will save at least $200 to $300.
Does the Sears experience really mean that much to you? Fill in the
blank on a thousand retail products and ask yourself the same
question.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, 65 million households will be on line. Pentium
chip computers will cost $500. In two to three years, modem speeds
will be 100 times faster than they are today. Assume that you are
an AOL customer and every one of your family and friends is an AOL
customer. With Internet telephony, you can call them for a fraction
of the cost of long distance or local telephony. What would you
choose? Ten cents a minute on Sprint or roughly one cent per minute
using the Internet? What do you think every large, medium, and
small-sized business will do?
</P>
<P>
   Think about publishing. Local newspapers make money because of
classified advertising. You can get classified advertising in a
much more user-friendly way on the Internet (and it's global).
That's what eBay is about. With high speed Internet access, where
are you going to go for the best inventory? The Manchester Union
Leader or eBay?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble story is a sidebar. The real story is what
is happening to businesses that aren't adapting to Internet
technology. Their stocks are stagnant. Their business models are
out of date. In some cases, their days are already numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changes everything it touches. It touches almost
everything.
</P>

DR. GERALD KLOOSTER, SUBJECT OF CUSTODY BATTLE, DIES AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dr. Gerald Klooster, who suffered from
Alzheimer's disease and became the focus of a custody battle when
his wife was accused of arranging a suicide with Dr. Jack
Kevorkian's help, died Wednesday of natural causes at the hospice
where he lived. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Klooster, a retired obstetrician, received national attention
when in 1995 his wife, Ruth, contacted Kevorkian, the retired
Michigan pathologist known for specializing in physician-assisted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Klooster's son, Dr. Gerald ``Chip'' Klooster II of Petoskey,
Mich., objected to his mother's contacting Kevorkian and took his
father to Michigan against her will. Klooster lived with his son
for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Klooster acknowledged talking to Kevorkian, but denied
plans to have her husband euthanized, and a custody battle ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Klooster said he was saddened by the death of his father,
who was diagnosed with the ravaging disease nine years ago, but he
also felt at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of peace about doing the right thing and my
dad didn't want his life ended by another man's hand, namely Jack
Kevorkian's,'' said Klooster, one of the couple's five children.
</P>
<P>
   The family battled for months in court, and judges in Michigan
and California reached opposing decisions. A settlement finally was
reached under which Klooster was returned to California to live
with his wife in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Klooster was found unconscious in his home
from an overdose of alcohol and barbiturates. His son suggested his
mother had given Klooster the cocktail, a charge Ruth Klooster
denied.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials originally called it ``an attempted suicide
with suspicious circumstances,'' but later downgraded the incident
to simple overdose.
</P>
<P>
   After the overdose, a court ordered Klooster to live with his
daughter, Kristen Hamstra, but he was allowed to return home to his
wife in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Klooster had been in a residential care facility in Castro
Valley, Calif., for about 18 months, Chip Klooster said.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Klooster, who had not seen his father since they were
living together in Petoskey, said the consequences of his actions
were painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the other road been taken to euthanize him, it would have
created more family problems,'' he said. ``Let me tell you, it was
a very painful experience ... I had to do what I did in order to
preserve my father's right to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my father wanted to kill himself, he would have done it.''

MANAGING YOUR PET'S MENTAL HEALTH: THE DEBATE ROARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government's approval of a new antidepressant drug
for dogs, announced last week, has thrown open a window on a
relatively new and rapidly expanding field: the management of pets'
mental health. It's also shedding light on major disagreements on
how to help them, and has some players in the debate growling at
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the key figures in the disagreement were in two
camps, dog trainers in one and behaviorists and behavioral
pharmacologists in the other. With the introduction of Novartis's
Clomicalm, marketed to relieve separation anxiety in dogs, another
group will enter the picture, local veterinarians with a link to
major drug companies. (Other drug companies are developing their
own treatments for pet behavior problems.)
</P>
<P>
   The growth of options is good news in helping pets, but the
changing landscape may leave pet owners confused about whom to turn
to when behavior problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   Behavioral counseling made its first appearance on the American
Veterinary Medical Association's surveys in 1996. Dr. Franklin
Loew, president of Becker College in Worcester, Mass., and formerly
a dean at both the Tufts Veterinary School of Medicine and Cornell
School of Veterinary Medicine, says the growth of the field is
based on an increased understanding of human brain chemistry and
either ``the swelling public interest in the well-being of
animals'' or ``the elevated moral status of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of behavior problems to treat _ aggression,
fear, and inappropriate waste elimination among them. Novartis is
looking to treat one group _ dogs who behave badly when the owner
goes away. Yet that one group makes up, according to the company's
estimate, 14 percent of dogs in this country or a whopping 7
million animals. Considering that the treatment with Clomicalm
(chlomipramine hydrochloride) costs a dollar a day and that the
course could take three months, it's easy to see that we are
potentially talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Add in all the other behavioral problems _ issues that can mimic
human obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, even depression _ and
you can see that we are witnessing the birth of a medically
intriguing field, one that is both large and lucrative. But how do
we, as pet owners, choose the right kind of care?
</P>
<P>
   The animosity between the established camps is obvious and is
often compared to that between psychologists and psychiatrists. Dog
trainers are suspicious of all those pill-popping behavior guys,
and the behavior guys are suspicious of trainers, who don't have to
go to school or pass a test before hanging out their shingles. Now
both sides are turning a wary eye toward drug companies that will
make it easier for vets, many of whom have little in the way of
behavioral training, to diagnose such problems and treat them.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Margolis, dog trainer and host of the popular PBS series
``Woof! It's a Dog's Life,'' says, ``Never in 30 years of dog
training have I needed to put a dog on medication. Dogs don't get
depressed, people do.'' Margolis says he's less than thrilled with
the introduction of easier-to-get-at behavior drugs, and he worries
that owners will look for ``a quick fix.'' He compares the fast
reach for this medication with a human patient who doesn't feel
well rushing to surgery. Dr. Nick Dodman, a professor at Tufts
University School of Veterinary Medicine, and one of the great
founding gurus in behavioral pharmacology, agrees. ``Veterinarians
will experience something like a knee-jerk response,'' Dodman says.
He too fears that dispensing medication could become routine. But
that's where his agreement with Margolis ends.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis tells the story of a dog who experienced clear signs of
separation anxiety. The dog barked incessantly at the front window
when the owner left. The problem was solved faster than you can pop
a pill. ``I told her to close the curtains when she left,''
Margolis says. And it worked. No more barking when the dog was left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman says, ``Yes, sometimes there are elementary cures, but
there are many cases that simply cannot be managed without
medicine.'' Dodman has written several popular books on the topic,
such as ``The Dog Who Loved Too Much'' (the dog of the title
suffers from separation anxiety), and he has authored many
scientific articles on the subject. He is angered by what he sees
as the facile explanations and old-fashioned ``military'' methods
of many trainers, whom he compares to ``the one-eyed myopic man in
the kingdom of the blind.'' Bristling at Margolis's anecdote,
Dodman says he challenges Margolis ``to take on one of my cases and
cure it with something as simple as closing a curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodman is against any coercive methods of training, and he
includes in that category a common technique employed by trainers:
the ``corrective jerk,'' which is pulling a choke or training
collar in a quick pop motion and releasing to correct a dog. Dodman
says positive reinforcement works better and gets astounding
results. ``You can get an enormous killer whale to launch itself
out of a pool and urinate in a tiny plastic cup with a whistle and
a bucket of fish,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the news of Clomicalm is hardly all bad to those in
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally-known dog trainer and author Brian Kilcommons says
Clomicalm will ``be extremely valuable with certain dogs,'' though
he thinks all behavioral aspects should be exhausted before
bringing ``drugs into the picture.'' And he makes the point that
good training should be applied before there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman has been at the center of the media frenzy over
Chlomicalm. He's been interviewed on the subject over the last few
weeks by NBC's ``Dateline,'' USA Today, Time magazine, The
Economist, and the BBC, among others. And he says all the hoopla
helps increase awareness, it ``legitimizes'' the field, and it may
actually save animals' lives, since behavior problems are one of
the leading reasons people have dogs put to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman has used the generic form of Clomicalm to treat dogs
himself for several years, though he says there are ``better,
smarter'' drugs that he is now using. (Dry mouth is one possible
side effect of the drug, which can cause increased thirst and
increased urination.)
</P>
<P>
   Our growing concern for our pets can be measured in dollars and
cents. Between 1991 and 1996, the American Veterinary Medical
Association estimates that the amount US households spent on
veterinary medical expenses annually went up from $4.931 billion to
$7.008 billion. (Currently, the American Animal Hospital
Association estimates that we spend $20 billion a year all together
on vet care, food, and supplies for the pets.)
</P>
<P>
   Considering the critical nature of the field, are
general-practice veterinarians prepared to enter the behavioral
fray? Novartis is aiming a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign
at both consumers and veterinarians to make sure the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Loew, the former dean of two veterinary schools, says
instruction of veterinary students in the field of training and
behavior is ``uneven at best.'' However, he has seen the growth of
interest in the subject and says veterinarians increasingly have
the option of exploring behavioral issues through the continuing
education courses they are required by the state to take.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randy Feld of the Belmont (Mass.) Animal Hospital does treat
animals with behavior modification techniques. But he says that if
he thinks a patient requires drugs for that kind of problem, the
best bet is to see a specialist with a wide array of medications,
so he refers them to Dodman.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Sawyers of the East Boston Animal Clinic, however,
says that not only would he treat a dog with Chlomicalm, but he's
about to call Novartis and order some for a 50-pound Norwegian
elkhound who barks incessantly when the owners leave. Sawyers has
only performed about 12 debarking surgeries in the past 20 years,
but he says in cases where frustrated owners are considering
destroying a dog or having the debarking surgery, he'd like to give
them the Chomicalm option.
</P>
<P>
   Are veterinarians versed enough in behavioral problems to do
this? Sawyers says, ``Hey, wake up guys, you better get out your
books and learn. The information is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   For dog owners, the good news is that the options are rapidly
expanding, but it will take some effort and common sense to
negotiate terrain that is still being mapped. It's enough to make
you sit up and beg for an antidepressant yourself.

GARDENING IN LA NINA'S WORLD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Usually, January finds gardeners sitting snugly
inside while the rain drums on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   They peruse seed catalogs and plan their next garden. They may
even clean and oil their trowels and shovels.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't do is water. Mother Nature usually provides
plenty of that.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, La Nina, the dry year that traditionally follows
a wet El Nino year, has left gardeners high and dry _ and triggered
an unseasonably early spring.
</P>
<P>
   For gardeners, the unusual weather creates a good news-bad news
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that now is a fine time to plant cold-weather
vegetables and nearly any flower available at commercial nurseries
because, while days are warm enough for flowers, they're not hot
enough to make cool-season veggies bolt and go to seed.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that since Mother Nature isn't providing her
usual January rains, home gardeners need to supply the missing
moisture for both existing and new plants.
</P>
<P>
   Winter zoomed right through, announcing itself only briefly with
two short wet spells in early November and early December (dropping
a total of less than 2 inches of the wet stuff, about one-third of
normal to date), then a cold snap in mid-December (when
temperatures dipped into the high 20s for two or three nights in a
row, freezing many tender plants). And true winter, with its usual
cold temperatures and gray, rainy days, shows no signs of
returning, as daytime temperatures consistently hit the 70s and
80s.
</P>
<P>
   Although some retail nursery owners warn that another cold spell
!ital!could!off! show up to freeze newly planted flowers and
veggies, weather experts say there's no sign of either significant
rain or greenery-freezing cold in the forecast for late January or
early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forecasts I've seen are for a similar pattern to
continue,'' said William Russell, professor of meteorology at
Pierce College. ``The winter season runs from October through
April, and I'm sure we'll get some rain before April, but it'll
probably be far less than normal. We usually get about 15 inches,
but this is a real sporadic pattern. There's no telling what will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Plants listen to nothing but their own internal clock. All they
know is that warm weather means winter's over and spring's here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees that usually leaf out in late February are coming to
life now,'' said Yvonne Savio, manager of the University of
California Extension's Common Ground Garden Program. ``It's so
warm, they think it's time to wake up. Spring's two months early
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead and start that garden. But before you do, check the
moisture level in your soil; El Nino and La Nina may have another
surprise in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to take a trowel and dig down four to six inches
to see what's happening in the soil,'' Savio advised. ``Despite the
fact that it's been quite a while since it's rained, they should
see that it's still quite moist because it hasn't been hot enough
during the day for the soil moisture to evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a simple rule of thumb for judging your backyard soil
conditions. If the soil down 4 to 6 inches deep sticks together
when you grab a handful, it's too wet, Savio says. If it crumbles
in your hand, it's ready for planting. And if it's light-colored
and dry, get out the hose.
</P>
<P>
   Dry soil around established plants _ or where you're planting
new growth _ should be well watered to a depth of at least 6
inches, which means about a half-hour of watering for a light,
sandy soil or up to two hours for heavy clay soils. Some heavy
soils may be so hard to saturate, you may have to water for 15
minutes or so every few hours so the water will penetrate instead
of running off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets hot, those plants are going to be raring to go
because they're already established,'' Savio said. ``What you have
to plan for is not now, but for those weeks when we have above
90-degree temperatures, and those plants are big and they'll need
lots of water.''
</P>
<P>
   While vegetable growers are preparing to protect new seedlings,
flower gardeners so far are less worried by the lack of winter
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Irises and other rhizome- and bulb-based plants like tulips,
daffodils, lily of the valley, jonquils, crocus and narcissus
aren't suffering _ yet _ because they have their own energy source,
said Jeanne Clay Plank, vice president of the San Fernando Valley
Iris Society. But as temperatures climb and they begin to leaf out,
they'll need watering, too.
</P>
<P>
   And she is concerned about the possibility of another cold snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer we get to March and April, and if it dips down to
the 50s and 60s and nighttimes are in the 40s, then you get a very
distorted bud, misshapen flowers, short stalks.''
</P>
<P>
   Roses, hardy plants that can withstand the ice and snow of
colder regions, are mostly dormant now, when gardeners are pruning
back dead wood and getting rid of old leaves that may carry rust,
black spot or other diseases, said Bev Osborne, president of the
San Fernando Valley Rose Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting along fine, but they do need water now _ at
least once a week,'' she said. ``A lot of people haven't watered,
waiting for it to rain. Well, it's not, and roses that haven't been
getting any water kind of stay in a little comatose state.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're very hardy. It takes a lot of neglect to kill a
rose. Water, prune and feed them, and they'll leaf right out. When
you have winds, you should water maybe twice a week. If you have
roses in pots, you should water them every other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now's also the time to deep-water trees, said Robin Pokorski,
president of the Southern California Garden Club, who points out
that an early, warm spring may be a harbinger of a long, hot
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If trees are watered now so they develop deep roots, they'll
have a better chance of getting through a drought,'' she said. ``If
they're well-rooted and healthy, the lack of water later on won't
hurt our trees and sturdy bushes, like azalea and lilac, that have
been going for years.'' &QL;

THE DEEPER THE BETTER FOR ROOTS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; La Nina may try to keep the rain at bay, but
gardeners who prepare for dry weather now can still look forward to
a lush spring.
</P>
<P>
   The trick? Train your plants to drink deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Savio, manager of the University of California
Cooperative Extension's Common Ground Garden Program, says the key
to surviving droughts is to help your plants establish deep,
drought-resistant roots.
</P>
<P>
   For vegetables, Savio offers this gardening tip:
</P>
<P>
   Dig a hole the depth of a one- or five-gallon bucket, then sink
the bucket _ the kind larger nursery plants come in, with drainage
holes in the bottom _ up to the lip in the soil. Plant seeds _ this
is particularly good with squash, cucumbers or other climbers that
don't like to be transplanted _ in little depressions around the
outside of the bucket. Water well to make seeds sprout. After
seedlings begin to grow, fill the bucket with water once a week or
more often when it's hot and dry or windy. The water will drain
slowly through the holes, and the plants' roots will reach down for
the water.
</P>
<P>
   Place a large tomato cage over the bucket, and the new plants
will have something to climb on, keeping the fruit off the soil and
making it easier to harvest. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; With this year's apparent early spring, gardeners
can do some planting that normally would have to wait until January
rains ended. Here are some tips from the University of California
Cooperative Extension on what to plant now:
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLES: Plant cold-season crops like lettuce, spinach,
broccoli, cauliflower, kohlrabi, cabbage, greens, onions, peas,
radishes, kale, chard and rhubarb. Leave warm-season veggies _
tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, beans _ until the days and
nights are warmer.
</P>
<P>
   HERBS: Put in rosemary, thyme, sage. Leave the more tender herbs
_ basil, parsley, oregano, mint, chives, coriander, dill, tarragon
and marjoram _ until the weather's warmer.
</P>
<P>
   FRUITS: Plant grapes, berry vines and strawberries through
March. Now's also the time to put into the ground bare-root fruit
and nut trees (except citrus and avocados, which need warmer
weather).
</P>
<P>
   FLOWERS: Plant wildflowers, including California and Shirley
poppies, bare-root roses, snapdragons, stocks, sweet peas, sweet
william, hollyhocks, alyssum, calendulas, columbines, English
daisy, delphiniums, forget-me-nots, violets, larkspur, pansies and
most other flowers that can be found in commercial nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   ORNAMENTAL TREES: Plant acacia, dogwood, forsythia, lilac,
mimulus, flowering quince. Wait until it grows warmer to plant
jacaranda, Brazilian pepper and coral trees. &QL;

VIDEO GAME BECOMES OSCAR CONTENDER

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's an Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd World.
</P>
<P>
   Abe the Mudokon is a little different: froggy face, topknot, bad
posture, greenish skin, three-fingered hands, mouth partially sewn
shut. In short, a real looker.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the star of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, the computer game
and now, a short, quirky animated tale trying to cadge an Oscar
nomination for best animated short film.
</P>
<P>
   Abe's creators at Oddworld Inhabitants of San Luis Obispo are
billing it as the first time a computer game's animations have
become the basis for an Oscar competitor, something
animation-industry observers say is probably correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true as far as I can see,'' said Wendy Jackson, a Los
Feliz-based animation consultant and writer. ``They don't really
have a claim unless they get nominated, but in terms of nomination,
it's never been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Baisley, editor in chief of Animation magazine in Agoura
Hills, said she can't recall any shorts based on videogame work
either among all the hundreds of pieces her staff sees every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I've heard of one originating from a game,''
Baisley said. ``It hasn't been unusual to see that stemming from TV
shows or features, and it may have happened for one created for the
Internet. But probably not, because the quality of the Internet
animation is not good enough to (compete). Now (the competition)
has much higher production values.''
</P>
<P>
   The production values aren't a problem for the Oddworld piece,
however. Many recent games, created either for computers or
consoles such as Sony's PlayStation, use eye-popping animated
opening sequences and ``interstitials'' between game levels.
Powered by increasing graphics capabilities, programming savvy and
many of the same animation programs used in movies, the work is
increasingly of movie quality in games such as LucasArts Star Wars
Rogue Squadron on the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   The great look of Exoddus in particular isn't a surprise,
either, given the Hollywood special-effects backgrounds of Oddworld
founders Sherry McKenna and Lorne Lanning.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked for most of two decades with such special effects
stalwarts as Douglas Trumbull and Rhythm and Hues before striking
out to create what McKenna calls ``movie-quality games.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first try, Abe's Oddworld, was a million-seller, leading
to the Exoddus successor and to the decision to create a separate
short film using some of the 25 minutes of high-quality
computer-generated animation they had created for that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just blown away'' last fall when Lanning showed her the
game's animation all strung together, McKenna said. ``I said, `This
is Academy Award stuff.' Then I said, `Wait a minute. Why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   To make the animation eligible for the Oscars, however, it had
to be released before the game came out, under Academy Award rules
designed to protect the film business. That gave Lanning two weeks
to create additional animation that would tie the interstitials
together in a coherent narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Then the company had to arrange a short premiere run in a
Burbank theater last October and show the film enough times before
a paying audience to make it eligible for the Oscars, McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Hollywood will (thumb) their noses at us, but so
what?'' McKenna said. ``At least it's a start. Maybe people will
realize not all games are the way we preconceive them.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece tells the story of Abe's crusade to save his fellow
Mudokons from oppression and extinction at the hands of another
grotesque species, the Glukkons, who use Mudokon bones and tears to
create an addictive drink at the SoulStorm Brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The short film is a first step in McKenna's long-term goal of
creating products that aren't violent, can appeal to a broad
audience and can be easily translated to movies, television and
other venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to eventually get into movies that we, as opposed to
Hollywood, control,'' McKenna said. ``We want to create a database
that can transfer to movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are successful this first time around will be
interesting to watch, said Jackson, because the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences just passed rules that made ineligible
animation created for television series and pilots.
</P>
<P>
   TV work had in the past been a fertile source of excellent
animated shorts from such cable children's channels as Nickelodeon
and the Cartoon Network, Jackson said. Now that part of the
increasingly busy field of animation is clear, though plenty of
other competitors here and abroad are still jostling for attention,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been some nominees in there'' from television
without the rules changes, Jackson said. ``Since those got nixed,
it really opened up some opportunities. I think the people at
Oddworld are very clever and saw an opportunity before anybody else
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest new area of competition will come from the companies
that make and use special-effects programs as they let their
employees create shorts both for corporate demo reels and to
provide them a creative outlet, Baisley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddworld's'' major competition for the nomination includes
work from Walt Disney Animation, Digital Domain and Blue Sky
Effects as well as a stop-motion clay animation piece called
``More,'' Baisley said. That latter piece was created by Mark
Osborne with backing from the Large Format Cinema Association, a
trade group for the IMAX and similar massive-screen theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a big fan of the first Oddworld game, said she believes
``Oddworld'' can compete fairly well with those contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if anyone could do it, they proved themselves with
that first game,'' Jackson said. ``I'm really curious to see if the
academy will go for it though. Some folks in the TV arena might
feel a little jilted. But it's definitely an emerging area that you
can't ignore anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   BAMBI FIGHTS BACK: One of the most unlikely success stories of
recent years in the computer game business has been the runaway
sales of Deer Hunter and a series of knockoffs and successors,
mostly sold in stores such as Wal-Mart rather than traditional
gaming outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In them, would-be game hunters stalk a variety of prey with a
variety of weapons and locations. The games themselves are
generally startlingly low-tech, deliberate to the point of glacial
and widely mocked by the twitch-happy crews running most gaming
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The games also are ripe for parody, and that's finally come
along with Simon &AMP; Shuster Interactive's Deer Avenger for the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Avenger allows Bambo, the toughest buck in town, to take up an
M-16, bazooka or deer-pellet-laden slingshot against hunters. It
even comes with ``special hunter stalking devices,'' such as a
variety of hunter calls like ``Help, I'm naked and have a pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   As jokes go, it's pretty hilarious. As games go, it's not bad.
And it's sure to be the only hunting game likely to be played on
the office computers of the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. &QL;

A HIGH-FLYING `BIRD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ellen McLaughlin's ``Tongue of a Bird,'' at the
Mark Taper Forum, continually plays with ever-changing
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The higher pilot Maxine (Cherry Jones) flies, the more she can
see, but what does she lose in the details? Does she become more
detached? Her grandmother, Zofia (Marian Seldes), urges Maxine not
to hold onto the ``wrong things,'' to get rid of them, lose them
all. But if you do jettison your bad memories, are you free, or do
you have nothing? Dessa (Diane Venora) tells Maxine that her
missing daughter was wearing a powder-blue coat, but when she
points to a place in the sky to find the color's perfect match, she
becomes exasperated because it is gone before she can capture the
moment. Don't look for what you see now, Dessa orders, but what you
saw before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue of a Bird'' is like watching a series of loops and
dives by a stunt plane. Sometimes you're just waiting for it to
crash (sure that it will) as it screams toward the ground.
Sometimes you're mesmerized by its beauty and aerial acrobatics.
And sometimes you're left wondering if it makes any sense as you
watch the pilot put the plane into another death-defying spin.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, ``Tongue of a Bird'' never flames out. It's kept
aloft by playwright McLaughlin's poetic prose, her injection of
unexpected humor and a commanding performance by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The play tells the story of Maxine, a search-and-rescue pilot
who has a perfect record in finding people. She is asked by a
desperate Dessa to look for her 12-year-old daughter, Charlotte
(Ashley Johnson), who was abducted by a man in the wilds of the
Adirondacks while on an outing. The girl has been gone for 11 days,
and the other searches have failed to turn up anything.
</P>
<P>
   While Maxine's record may be perfect in finding lost people, she
has never been able to find the memories of her mother, Evie
(Sharon Lawrence), who killed herself when Maxine was 6. You never
really rescue anybody or see them face to face, Dessa tells Maxine.
You just spot them from up in the air and never see their pain.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate search for Charlotte has released Maxine's
painful, pent-up memories of her past, and her internal ghosts
become external. Evie begins to appear to Maxine in specter form,
visiting her at night, hovering above her bed dressed as an
aviatrix.
</P>
<P>
   I don't get it, Maxine says. Why the Amelia Earhart outfit? You
never flew. But the outfit reflects Maxine's own attempts to free
herself from her confines. ``The farther up you are, the more you
see,'' she says, but it has also left Maxine emotionally distanced.
The missing girl, bloodied and dirty, also visits her. You don't
really want to be found? she asks Charlotte, but she could just as
well be talking about herself.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in her plane while she searches, Maxine tries to
understand why she fled into the clouds, pondering her fascination
with Earhart. Earhart, air heart, she muses, about the emptiness
she feels inside over not knowing her mother. In a lesser actress's
hand, this could seem, well, too precious, but Jones is so grounded
in her character that the moment rings true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue of a Bird'' is very much about mothers and daughters,
but it's also about women freeing themselves from the confines of
their identity. The wonderfully sardonic Zofia, who seems to be
having out-of-body experiences, tells Maxine about her great
grandmother, who was a ``traveling woman'' who could fly across the
skies. You mean a witch? Maxine exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Zofia laments over a starling caught in her chimney, its
wings beating frantically against the walls. Images of flight and
being trapped resonate throughout ``Tongue of a Bird.'' The play's
opening and closing scenes reflect that. It begins with a woman,
wrapped in white gauze like a mummy, fascinated by a glowing,
spinning globe, which is a nice counterpoint to the cathartic
moment at the play's end.
</P>
<P>
   Strong acting by the entire cast is a major strength in ``Tongue
of a Bird.'' Seldes and Venora are particularly wonderful in being
able to navigate the emotional highs and lows of their characters.
</P>
<P>
   Director Lisa Peterson also deserves much credit for keeping
things lively, and Rachel Hauck's set designs are spare but
striking. Mary Louise Geiger's lighting and Gina Leishman's sound
help create the moody, shifting ambience.
</P>
<P>
   There are some rough spots in ``Tongue of a Bird,'' but even
those aren't uninteresting. In some ways the play is a meditation,
but it is one filled with lovely flights of fancy that make for
wonderful theater. &QL;

`SELMA' DOCUMENTS THE STRUGGLE OF BLACK VOTERS IN ALABAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SELMA, LORD, SELMA 
Starring: Jurnee Smollett, Mackenzie Astin, Clifton Powell, Ella
Joyce, Afemo Omilami 
Produced by: Christopher Seitz 
Directed by: Charles Burnett 
Written by: Cynthia Whitcomb 
When: Sunday at 7 p.m.; ABC 
Rating: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost a year ago, ABC aired ``Ruby Bridges,'' a ``Wonderful
World of Disney'' telefilm about the civil rights struggle. The
account of the 1960 integration of a Southern grammar school
involving the inspiring girl of the title was finely crafted and
deeply moving. It was also a critical success, which perhaps
explains why ABC acquired a similar family-style Disney production
for broadcast this year, Sunday from 7 to 9 p.m., on Channel 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selma, Lord, Selma'' dramatizes the perilous black voting
rights initiatives in Alabama in 1965. Fueled by the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., the struggle culminated in a historic, brutally
suppressed march across Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge and led
directly to the Voting Rights Act politically empowering black
Southerners. It was a critical moment in American history, and the
fiery, watershed events in Selma will not soon be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of the well-intentioned television movie
starring Jurnee Smollett, who plays 11-year-old Sheyann Webb, with
whom we experience the bittersweet struggles in Selma. ``Selma,
Lord, Selma'' is based on the memoirs of Webb and classmate Rachel
West Nelson. The Webb character is the drama's centerpiece, a
precociously brave child who meets her hero Martin Luther King in
church, inspires activists with her sweet singing, and marches into
hateful opposition and swinging clubs for the sake of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selma'' never rises above the level of a Classic Comics
version of civil rights history. It so neuters and simplifies
historical events that their power to move and inspire us is all
but negated. A good deal of the problem is Cynthia Whitcomb's
script, which has the majority of the characters talking in
expository essay form. Further, the characters are forged in stark
black and white _ no shadings of complexity allowed, as they were
in the far superior ``Ruby Bridges.'' For example, the tempers of
black characters constantly confronting hate and death rarely flare
or fray.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, the level of the acting in ``Selma'' is high. One
notable performance, Clifton Powell's as King, even manages to
break through the production's obvious limitations. His sometimes
surprisingly complex interpretation suggests, at moments, a kind of
hurried glibness that anyone so prominent and pressured probably
has to master to survive. He's pleasant to Sheyann and her friend
Rachel, but sometimes clearly preoccupied with other concerns.
While evoking King's moral strength, purpose, and enormous dignity,
he crosshatches these qualities with subtle, barely suppressed
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Also to its credit, ``Selma'' manages to illustrate the virtues
of nonviolence, showing how it exposes repression and moral
corruption, and stimulates change. A worthwhile lesson. But,
unfortunately, most of ``Selma, Lord, Selma'' feels more like a
classroom exercise than living drama.

   HOUSTON _ There's a primitive sense of seduction in watching a
10-ton vehicle going vertical.
</P>
<P>
   It's an allure compounded by watching it, seconds later,
furiously hammering granny's little green Chevette into the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a world made whole by ballet, Tex-Mex cuisine and
Nobel-worthy medical breakthroughs _ the finer things in life _
it's comforting to know there's still room for the monster truck
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Crankshafts ... tubular chassis systems ... pistons ... roll
cages ... the peculiar smell of burned alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Men, women and children all praying for a wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Eardrums violently assaulted, jingling, a kind of hurt that
feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are bloodthirsty people,'' said Jack Koberna, the
owner and driver of one of these vehicular killer whales. ``You
think they care about you destroying your $100,000 truck? No, they
want to see you wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   With a price tag of at least $100,000, you can bet these big
babies have never hauled a load of dirt, much less kids and dogs on
a country drive. The testosterone-fueled machines carry names like
Liquidator, Eradicator, Cyborg and Grave Digger.
</P>
<P>
   If Wild Thang were a person, he'd be facing 15 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   A monster truck a highly modified 4-wheel-drive vehicle, the
most distinguishing characteristic being the outsized tires. Most
monster trucks are speed- and handling-enhanced to race similar
behemoths over obstacle courses usually set up with cars to crush
and dirt ramps to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world there are more than 500 monster trucks, with
about 300 in the United States. Top trucks compete in 45 to 50
events a year, with drivers spending 200 days a year on the road,
logging 60,000 to 70,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   When the monsters meet, it's a David vs. Goliath engagement of
motorized carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Koberna and his wife Roxanne own the Cyborg, a red, 20,000-pound
behemoth with tires the size of baby elephants. For 18 years, the
couple from Tulia, in the Texas Panhandle, have traveled the
country showing off the Cyborg and previous incarnations of it,
riding the wave that's become the high-risk sport _ and the
higher-stakes business _ of monster trucking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, monster trucks was about watching Big Foot do
wheelies and crushing cars,'' Roxanne Koberna said last weekend
during a break in the show at the packed Astrodome, referring to
the godfather of all trucks. ``Now it's a legit sport. It took
NASCAR almost four decades to get as popular as it is today.
Monster trucks is moving at a faster pace than that.''
</P>
<P>
   This thing the Kobernas, both 40, refer to as a sport looks like
yet another American cultural staple, almost an obsession, that
most of us are afraid to admit to enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people that look down at us because it's considered
a sport only rednecks like,'' said Johnny Campos, owner of Extreme
Off-Road of San Antonio, a shop that for 25 years has been
specializing in converting pickup trucks into beasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the biggest misconception,'' he said. ``Yeah, you're
going to have your cowboys who really get a kick out of it, but in
the last couple of years it's become a type of entertainment that
crosses all cultures, especially the youngsters. Not everyone will
admit they're fans, but look at all of the sold-out stadiums and
see for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   On this cold night in Houston, the clobbering and pulverizing of
decommissioned cars begins promptly.
</P>
<P>
   In pairs, trucks race each other through an obstacle course
built solely to keep these mammoths airborne as much as possible.
After a while, nobody seems to be keeping track of who's winning.
Heck, it doesn't really matter. Just keep those babies jumping.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner inside the stadium, Koberna is sitting inside the
Cyborg, waiting patiently to take his crack at going home with some
points and cash.
</P>
<P>
   How he got here has become his and Roxanne's routine. It's the
same in every town: A couple days ago, the Kobernas pulled into
Houston in their 18-wheeler that's been heavily modified to serve
as their home on the road. The truck is also mechanical shop,
business office and Cyborg's piggyback ride across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing,'' said Roxanne Koberna, referring to this
on-the-road, 30-weeks-a-year lifestyle. ``You get to do what you
like to do and have fun instead of living inside a cubicle, like
Dilbert.''

SENATE TRIAL TO SET STANDARD FOR FUTURE CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan, 17) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When 100 senators vote on President Clinton's fate,
perhaps by the end of the month, they will fashion their own
definitions of high crimes and misdemeanors, the constitutional
standard for removing a president.
</P>
<P>
   And, in so doing, a standard will emerge that the House can
weigh the next time it considers impeaching a president and sending
the case to trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Described by late 19th-century historian James Bryce as ``the
heaviest piece of artillery in the congressional arsenal,''
impeachment has never before been fully employed against an elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon short-circuited the process by resigning in 1974
and Andrew Johnson, who survived the only Senate trial by one vote
in 1868, took power after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't visit an issue once every century and a half and
feel that you are comfortable with it,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin,
D-Illinois. ``We have some guidance but certainly not a body of law
to turn to. I hope we don't have another impeachment trial for
another century, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors argue that the presidency has been weakened by
Clinton's acknowledged misbehavior in the wake of his consensual
extramarital affair and that not removing him from office will make
future presidents untouchable by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar will be so high that only a convicted felon or a
traitor will need to be concerned,'' the prosecutors said in a
report to the Senate. ``If this is not enough, what is?''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which begins making its case Tuesday, contends
that removing Clinton on the evidence outlined by the House would
``substantially alter the delicate constitutional balance'' between
the Congress and the nation's chief executive. It would lower the
bar to a point where presidents could remain in office ``only at
the pleasure of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts dismiss these arguments as hyperbole
largely because of how the impeachment process is structured and
because there are never any assurances that whatever standard
emerges from Senate deliberations will be used by the House the
next time it calls for removal of the nation's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``While comity certainly is something we encourage and expect in
relations between the House and Senate, there is no constitutional
obligation for one to follow the expressed wishes of the other,''
said Victor Rosenblum, a law professor at Northwestern University.
``Each case is new as it arises.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment was written into the Constitution more than two
centuries ago as a way of reining in corrupt chief executives,
Cabinet members and federal judges. The Senate was picked by the
founding fathers to try impeachment cases because it was believed
to be less susceptible to popular passions than the House.
</P>
<P>
   The two-step process _ impeachment by a House majority, trial by
the Senate with a two-thirds vote required for conviction _ has
been used 14 times in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the nation's 42nd president, faces two articles of
impeachment, which were approved in a party-line vote by the House
four weeks ago. The articles allege that Clinton committed perjury
and obstructed justice in trying to hide his White House affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already we've seen a lowering of the standard for
impeachment,'' said Bruce J. Schulman, a history professor at
Boston University. ``If Clinton is removed, then we will have
established a precedent for removing a president from office for
misconduct, which we've never done before. It will alter the
balance between the branches'' of government.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bond, a political science professor at Texas A&AMP;M University,
said the bar for impeachment ``has been lowered by the House, but
by how much depends on how you weigh the other two cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who took office after President Lincoln's death, was
impeached largely because of disagreements with radical House
Republicans over Reconstruction policies toward the states of the
former Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Nixon grew out of hearings pushed by
congressional Democrats that unearthed presidential misuse of
federal agencies and a conspiracy to cover up administration
involvement in the Watergate burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scales are imprecise. ... The Clinton case is between
those two types, but closer to the Johnson end in terms of
partisanship,'' Bond said. ``If we want to preserve this system of
government with its separation of powers, it's equal branches of
government, what we can hope for is that the Senate will dismiss
this case fairly quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although conventional wisdom holds that the Senate will come up
short of the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton and terminate his
presidency, no one expected his sexual misbehavior with a woman
half his age to snowball into a Senate trial while two-thirds of
the public continues to give him high marks for his job
performance.
</P>
<P>
   While some pundits call the Clinton scandal and impeachment a
constitutional crisis, Ross Baker of Rutgers University dismisses
the characterization. ``A constitutional crisis occurs when the 2nd
Infantry shows up on the west lawn of the Capitol,'' Baker said.
``What we have going on in Washington is the normal functioning of
a process proscribed in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Senate's decision on Clinton's fate cannot be
appealed, the entire imbroglio ``has its costs,'' said Baker, a
political science professor. ``If the Republicans are determined
that the president must be removed from office, and he's as popular
as Clinton is, and people remember that in 2000, Congress will be
punished in the elections. It's one of the checks and balances
built into our system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the checks against abuse of power is the requirement
that both the House and Senate vote to remove a president.
``Presumably, the two-part system of impeachment (by the House) and
Senate trial is designed to winnow out the frivolous
impeachments,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The first chance the 55 Republican and 45 Democratic senators
have to signal their intentions on Clinton's case will come Jan.
25, when they will consider motions to dismiss the case or to
proceed and summon witnesses, which are to be decided by majority
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and most Senate Democrats fear live testimony
will drag out the trial and could dredge up more damaging evidence
against Clinton. Some Republicans insist, however, that only a
full-scale trial with witnesses such as Lewinsky will do.

   NY-BRAZILIANS (New York) _ Monday is Brazil Night at Cafe Wha, a
cozy basement at West Third and Macdougal Streets in Manhattan.
Brazilians and wanna-Brazilians came to drink, dance and listen to
Rio jazz, Sao Paulo rock and Bahian drumming. Many in the warm and

   NY-SHOE-SHOPPING (New York) _ On a wintry Saturday, Valerie
Steele, chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of
Technology, saw the summer sandal of her dreams. She was at Manolo
Blahnik in Manhattan. She cradled it in her hand like a precious
jewel, eyeing it from every angle _ the slender but comfortably low
heel, the twigginess of the coral, the near weightlessness of the
strips of leather masquerading as a shoe. Ms. Steele was not just
being covetous. This was  &UR; research &LR; . (Although Ms. Steele is also
an avid shopper.) She is the curator of ``Shoes: A Lexicon of

   NITEOUT-DEMARCHELIER (New York) _ Patrick Demarchelier, 55, is a

Madonna, Demarchelier's modus operandi is to make models happy. His
work has careered crazily from the ridiculous to the sublime and
back again. He has created ad campaigns for Brooks Brothers and

continued to delight as I walked by or stopped to give them, at
most, a weekly watering. They are plants that look good, no matter
what. By Patricia A. Taylor.  &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the most comprehensive look at lesbian health
to date, a government-funded panel has found that lesbians aren't
inherently more at risk to disease than their heterosexual
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy
of Sciences, said there was very little good information on the
health needs of lesbians, and recommended more research.
</P>
<P>
   What little data exist suggest that lesbians drink more than
heterosexual women, are more overweight and may use tobacco more,
the report found. Those are all risk factors for various ailments,
including cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the report also found that lesbians have fewer
pregnancies and are less likely to use oral contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Childbirth has been linked to lower rates of breast cancer, and
there have been concerns that lesbians get significantly more
breast cancer than heterosexual women. But no studies support that
conclusion, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have sex with women may be at less risk for cervical
cancer, which in many cases is linked to a virus often transmitted
by heterosexual intercourse. But the panel said it doesn't mean
lesbians don't get it, or shouldn't get regular Pap tests, as all
women are advised to do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, drawing meaningful conclusions from the data available is
tricky because most studies on lesbian health have been small, and
many found their subjects by surveying places like lesbian bars,
where researchers were more likely to run into smokers and
drinkers. Furthermore, most studies focused primarily on white
lesbians, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as women's health has been invisible on the radar screen
for so many years, I think lesbian women in particular have not
been well-enough served, mainly because we as health professionals
haven't had the information we need,'' said Iris Litt, a professor
of pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine and a
member of the committee that produced the report.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Gay and Lesbian Medical Association,
which has lobbied federal officials to increase attention to
lesbian health issues, called the report ``groundbreaking.'' Its
public policy director said it should be used to shape a lesbian
health research agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In other observations, the report found:
</P>
<P>
   _ While it has been assumed that lesbians don't get many
sexually transmitted diseases, there isn't much data to say one way
or the other. For one kind of bacterial infection that can lead to
pelvic inflammatory disease, some studies found lesbians were
somewhat more likely to carry it, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women who have sex with women do have a somewhat higher rate
of HIV infection than heterosexual women, even though there have
been few documented cases of female-to-female sexual transmission.
The reason for the difference remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   _ What data do exist about mental health suggest that lesbians
have about the same rates of mental illness, depression, physical
abuse and childhood sexual abuse as other women. There doesn't
appear to be any research to support the often-cited statistic that
up to 30 percent of young people who commit suicide are gay or
lesbian, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some surveys have found that many lesbians report that health
care providers assume they are heterosexual, and most do not tell
their physicians about their sexual orientation. There have also
been reports of lesbians encountering outright prejudice, including
refusal of treatment and negative comments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interest in studying the health of lesbians is fairly new, and
what little research has been done has had to grapple with such
basic problems as how to define who is a lesbian. Researchers have
adopted various definitions, making it hard to compare results.
</P>
<P>
   Better data may be on the way, however. A large study that
tracks the health of 116,000 female nurses included a question
about sexual identity in its 1995 questionnaire. And the Women's
Health Initiative, another major study of 100,000 post-menopausal
women, also is asking questions about lifetime sexual partners that
could yield useful information about the health of women who have
sex with women.

 GARDENING: UNUSUAL, LOW-MAINTENANCE PERENNIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 17) 
(mk) 
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, a group of perennials in my central New Jersey garden
were just great. They sailed through the extremely wet spring
months with perfect aplomb. And then, with the advent of one of the
driest summers and falls in a century, they continued to delight as
I walked by or stopped to give them, at most, a weekly watering.
They are plants that look good, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these are popular: orange butterfly weeds; blue balloon
flowers; pink coral bells; fragrant, gleaming white Festiva Maxima
peonies, and evergreen candytufts. Others, however, are not so well
known, and there lies their special attraction. Gardeners love to
have new flowers in their borders.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for something uncommon yet truly reliable,
try one or more of the following plants. Aside from the
requirements for light noted under each description, all must have
good drainage _ and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   Spring flowers and handsome foliage throughout the growing
season are the hallmarks of prairie heuchera (H. richardsonii) and
bigroot geranium (G. macrorrhizum, Ingwersen's variety). Prairie
heuchera, a coral bell relative, is indigenous to open spaces and
can be found growing wild throughout the northern Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   For four or five weeks, starting in mid-May, it bears half-inch
creamy bells, which dangle from sturdy three-foot stems. Earlier,
however, and until frost, it is admired for its rich green, three-
to four-inch scalloped leaves, which form a handsome mounded clump.
This is a superb perennial for those who have too much sun to grow
hostas.
</P>
<P>
   Bigroot geranium must have shade, whether bright and open or
dark and dreary. While the species plant has attractive one-inch
magenta flowers, Ingwersen's variety _ named for Will Ingwersen,
one of Britain's premier horticulturists _ has delicate pink
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Blooming from mid-May through mid-June, it is lovely next to
softer-color flowers like blue Jacob's ladders and pale yellow
cowslip primroses.
</P>
<P>
   A low-growing plant, bigroot geranium can be used in large
swaths as a ground cover or as a front border specimen. The
three-inch-wide five-lobed leaves have a fragrant pungency that
repels deer, slugs and chewing insects. They remain a warm green
throughout summer and in late fall acquire pink and yellow hues
before going dormant over winter.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate, bright green, ferny foliage sprays of dwarf
aruncus (A. aethusifolius) present a striking contrast to the
stolid leaves of bigroot geranium, which is why I have paired the
two in one of my shade gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Dwarf aruncus forms a neat, elegant eight-inch mound, which
slowly expands over the summer. To keep its size within bounds, I
ruthlessly yank out the outer edges and use them as handsome,
long-lasting fillers in cut flower arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to the plant. In July, small white bottlebrush
flowers crown wiry 12-inch stems for two or three weeks. Additional
color is provided in late fall, when the foliage is usually
splashed with reds and oranges before going dormant.
</P>
<P>
   False baby's breath (Galium mollugo Victor Jones) blooms from
July until a hard frost. I have tried it in light ranging from full
sun to bright shade and have decided that bright shade is best. The
relative darkness insures that the myriad tiny white flowers are
not washed out. They look like evening stars as they spray over an
underskirting of green epimediums.
</P>
<P>
   And spray they do, because this perennial is a flopper. If it is
staked, its pipe-cleaner-thin stems would stand four to five feet
tall.
</P>
<P>
   Every two inches, an even slimmer side stem, crowned with the
tiny flowers, branches out. The overall effect is an airy,
billowing presence in the garden and in floral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Through spring and early summer, the foliage of curly chives
(Allium senescens var. glaucum) and hadspen heron hosta provides an
icy-blue accent in front borders. In late summer, each bears
flowers for three or four weeks on 12-to 14-inch stems _ the Curly
chives shaped like lilac pompons and the Hadspen Heron hosta like
white trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   Curly chives, which are among the most unusual alliums I have
come across, form a low, six-inch-wide mat of circular stems.
Though they are recommended for full sun, I have found they also do
well in part shade, where I have paired them with the similarly
colored foliage of catmint and Hadspen Heron.
</P>
<P>
   The lance-shape leaves on Hadspen Heron are nine to 10 inches
long. I have placed them throughout front borders in part shade to
full shade and have found that chewing pests like slugs and beetles
do not like them as much as the leaves on other hostas.
</P>
<P>
   Hadspen Heron's elegant blue tones also pair well with
purple-foliage plants, including alumroots and Japanese painted
ferns. The profuse August flowers are a wonderful bonus and look
good in arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal conditions, these lovely, undemanding perennials
are stalwarts in borders. Under deluge or drought, however, they
are absolute treasures.
</P>
<P>
   False baby's breath is available from Bluestone Perennials, 7211
Middle Ridge Rd., Madison, Ohio 44057; (800) 852-5243; free
catalog.
</P>

by the Crownsville Nursery, P.O. Box 797, Crownsville, Md. 21032;
(410) 849-3143; catalog, $3.

THE WB LOOKS FOR LAUGHS IN NEW PLACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Watching Selma Blair making the press rounds
to promote her new series on The WB, it's easy to see why network
executives and producers were oh-so-eager to get her signed, sealed
and delivered on the air as quickly as humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   In person, she's disarmingly witty, bright, innocent, funny,
self-effacing and so TV-type charming that if ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP;
Jane'' doesn't generate enough ratings to get invited back for the
fall, Blair most probably will.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at The WB, which debuts the series at 8 p.m. CST
Sunday, are hoping it doesn't come to that. But if ``Zoe, Duncan,
Jack &AMP; Jane'' follows the path of the network's other sitcoms of
late, it should be history by May.
</P>
<P>
   Though dramas like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's
Creek'' and ``Felicity'' have assumed a firm grip on the network's
teen target audience, The WB has yet to discover the formula to get
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The string of sitcom deaths was supposed to end last season with
``Alright Already,'' starring former ``Seinfeld'' writer Carol
Liefer as a single woman surrounded by a quirky family. Viewers
passed; The WB punted. This season's ``The Army Show'' was a
critical and popular mess and deserved its court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Executives are high on ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' because they
consider it the first comedy to speak directly to The WB's
youthful, but precocious, audience.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which focuses on a quartet of Manhattan teens, has
neither the look nor joke-for-joke rhythm of typical teen sitcoms.
It's even fair to call its writing and slice-of-life situations
somewhat daring, if not all that rip-roaringly funny.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope future episodes will have the kids in more
interesting settings than what I've seen so far: The teen clique
trips out when Zoe's (Blair's) mom dates a guy with one long
eyebrow; Zoe uses a classmate to get to her cute brother.
</P>
<P>
   At least it's unapologetically New York. Its high-minded plans
are to explicitly explore the idiosyncrasies of young-adult life in
a city where cars are a handicap and colorful attire louder than
gray is an unforgivable fashion miscue.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stars, Blair plays Zoe Bean as the bright but blunt
leader of the pack. She shares her teen angst with Jane (Azura
Skye), a tortured soul constantly at odds with her egocentric
fraternal twin Jack (Michael Rosenbaum).
</P>
<P>
   Jack's flamboyance amuses but mostly irks buddy Duncan (David
Moscow, who played the young Tom Hanks in ``Big''), the insecure
one of the group with a habit of telling women he's
``lactose-intolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the four spend most of their time together, talking
endlessly about their lives, it's clear that the producers are
transforming the show into a close cousin, if not a copy, of shows
like ``Seinfeld'' and ``Friends.'' The producers even refer to its
style of humor as observational comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs is executive producer, but the supervising producers
(they run the show on a daily basis) are Sue and Daniel Paige, a
husband-wife team ``frustrated with the sensibilities of
traditional sitcoms.''
</P>
<P>
   From the look of ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' and an upcoming
sitcom from ABC, ``It's like, you know ... ,'' we're simply
embarking on another sitcom tradition. Let's call it Seinfeldian
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Selma, Lord, Selma'' (6 p.m. CST Sunday, ABC): This is a
well-intentioned but way-over-the-top dramatization of a crucial
chapter in the story of the civil-rights movement. Revisiting this
era through the eyes of two little girls is a nice angle, but this
is one of the more heavy-handed, and therefore somewhat distorted,
films on the period that has aired in some time. The cast includes
a list of unknowns, except for Yolanda King, the acting daughter of
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time at the Top'' (7 p.m. CST Sunday, Showtime): Just as
interesting for family viewing is this film, about adventures
occurring after a lonely Philadelphia teen (Elisha Cuthbert)
discovers she can use the elevator in her building to travel
through time. Timothy Busfield (''thirtysomething'') also stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unmentionables: A Brief History'' (8 CST Sunday, A&AMP;E): If
there's anything amazing about this two-hour informational
documentary on underwear, it's that it could go for two hours and
seem as though it's actually making a logical case for its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What We Did That Night'' (8 p.m. CST Monday, ABC): The title
cheapens this watchable thriller about a misfired college prank
that returns to haunt the perpetrators years later. Rich Schroder
stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Weird'' (6 p.m. CST Monday, Disney): Cara Delizia, Disney's
latest find, is a computer-loving 13-year-old who, while traveling
with her rock-star mother (Mackenzie Phillips), has way too much
time on her hands. So she investigates paranormal phenomena. This
is a new series for the family cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gypsy Rose Lee: Naked Ambition'' (7 CST p.m. Monday, A&AMP;E): The
popular musical is based on the life of the woman who became ``the
world's most famous stripper,'' but is there more to the story than
that? This installment of ``Biography'' makes it clear that sibling
rivalry and parental pressure contributed to Lee's drive to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesse'' (5:30 p.m. CST Tuesday, Cinemax): Tim Kirkman, a
filmmaker from Jesse Helms' hometown of Monroe, N.C., offers a
``letter'' to (and about) the conservative senator. Kirkman's
disgust with Helms is clear early on, when he admits that the one
thing he and Helms have in common is that both have been obsessed
with homosexual men. (Helms has opposed funding for AIDS prevention
and research while speaking intolerantly of homosexuality.) This is
a moving, well-crafted documentary, even if it is shamelessly
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed'' (8 p.m. CST Wednesday, WB): This new drama series
continues to gain in popularity. In this episode, Phoebe (Alyssa
Milano) must deal with the return of an ex-boyfriend who seems to
have some dangerous baggage _ a stolen Egyptian urn that carries a
mortal curse. As if we'd expect anything less sinister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honoring Richard Pryor'' (9:30 p.m. CST Wednesday, Comedy
Central): Pryor receives the Mark Twain Prize for contributions to
American humor in a ceremony at Washington's Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts. I haven't seen a tape, but I expect tributes from
Robin Williams, Chris Rock, Damon Wayans and Richard Belzer to be
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paramedics: Desert Jackpot'' (7 p.m. CST Friday, TLC): The
ongoing series takes a visit to Las Vegas. It's actually a small,
somewhat sleepy place. But with so many people going to the city's
famous strip to gamble, it is said to receive more 911 calls per
capita than any other U.S. city. I could imagine.

SUFFERING FOR HIS ART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was modern art's first pop saint, impoverished
and obscure during his too-brief life, yet elevated through death
to the stature of a holy man, who suffered so that the rest of us
might see the world differently.
</P>
<P>
   He was proletarian before prole was cool. He jump-started his
career by reinventing his style. Today, we might consider him some
distant, Flemish spiritual ancestor of, say, Kurt Cobain, slashing
away at his canvases in a controlled fury of creativity. He lived
fast, died young, left an amazingly beautiful body of work.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most casual art lover may need little introduction to
Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), the Dutchman who is the star of ``Van
Gogh's Van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum,
Amsterdam,'' the career survey of 70 works that opens Sunday at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   We feel we already know him, this unsmiling figure of shabby
gentility and weather-beaten dignity, whose ferocious gaze is the
human correlative to his churning suns and writhing wheat fields,
his wobbly bedrooms and woozily regimented farmhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even hanging flat against a museum wall, van Gogh's landscapes
bend and sway like cypresses in a storm. Even at rest, his agitated
self-portraits seem wrapped in some infernal atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Yet van Gogh's fitful shapes and violently juxtaposed colors _
``brutal extremes,'' the artist called them _ somehow resolve
themselves in tranquillity and harmony. Madness? Yes, but there's
method in van Gogh's near-insane intensity of feeling and
expression.
</P>
<P>
   How could we not know van Gogh, when he is everywhere? On
postcards, neckties, tote bags, dozens of Web sites and in a
half-dozen movies. On posters and ``Starry Night'' coffee mugs. In
cartoon parodies and easy-listening pop homages:
</P>
<P>
   Starry, starry night/paint your palette blue and gray/look out
on a summer's day/with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
</P>
<P>
   How could we not know van Gogh? He left us so much. Not only the
paintings, perhaps 700 altogether, still fetching record sums, but
also the stacks of eloquent, self-revealing letters written to his
steadfast patron and brother Theo.
</P>
<P>
   How could we not know van Gogh, when his life conforms to all
our cherished ideals of what a long-suffering artist should be?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sort of post-romantic, bohemian myth,'' said Graham
W.J. Beal, LACMA's director. ``With van Gogh, you have the bohemian
artist, slightly mad clinically, inventing a new way of painting,
despised by his contemporaries, and then of course the suicide, the
ear.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, the mobs.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is getting ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' thanks to a
unique occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the exhibition consists entirely of
works from the latter collection, the world's single largest van
Gogh repository.
</P>
<P>
   Spanning the artist's entire career, the works trace an arc from
the gloomy austerity of ``Potato Eaters'' (1885) through such
late-career masterpieces as ``Self-portrait With Felt Hat'' (winter
of 1887-1888), ``The Zouave'' (1888), ``The Bedroom'' (1888) and
the dazzling ``Wheatfield With Crows,'' painted shortly before van
Gogh put a gun to his heart and shot himself in July 1890. He died
a few days later at age 37.
</P>
<P>
   The priceless paintings are being allowed to travel to the
United States while the 25-year-old Dutch museum is closed for
eight months to undergo a major renovation and expansion.
</P>
<P>
   At $20 a ticket, ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' at LACMA reportedly
will be the most expensive public art show ever. So far, that
hasn't discouraged the public from snapping up nearly a quarter of
the available tickets. To meet demand, LACMA recently extended the
show's running time by six weeks, to May 16.
</P>
<P>
   A concurrent LACMA exhibition, ``Van Gogh and the Japanese
Print,'' will open Jan. 21 and run through April 4. Located in the
museum's Pavilion for Japanese Art, it will showcase approximately
35 works illustrating the influence of Japanese woodblock prints
and Japanese aesthetics on van Gogh's own sensibility, whose other
major influences were the French impressionists Camille Pissarro
and Georges Seurat, and J.F. Millet, the tender but unsparing
chronicler of harsh peasant lives.
</P>
<P>
   The projected attendance for ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' in L.A. is
900,000, about double the number that are estimated to have seen
the show at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., the tour's
only other stop. Attendance here will even exceed the 547,000 who
paid $12.50 apiece to view the Cezanne retrospective at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1996, pumping $86 million into the
Pennsylvania economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, because the National Gallery is a publicly funded
facility, all ``Van Gogh'' tickets were distributed free, along
with an additional 1,800 same-day passes daily on a first-come,
first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   The result: long lines leading to other long lines, and scalpers
cashing in on the hottest ticket in town.
</P>
<P>
   There will definitely be long lines at LACMA, too. But officials
hope to help offset the huge crowds by keeping the new LACMA West
extension (the former May Co. building), where the exhibition will
be held, open 12 hours a day, seven days a week. That's an extra
day per week and more hours per day than the rest of the museum is
open.
</P>
<P>
   All tickets will be dated and timed, and visitors will be
admitted at regular intervals. Museum officials estimate the
average museum goer will take 45 to 50 minutes to navigate the 70
works.
</P>
<P>
   Although that sounds like an abnormally quick pace at which to
take in so many paintings from a renowned artist, LACMA officials
say it is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are going to take longer,'' said museum media
relations director Adam Coyne. ``But some people are going to whip
through it. Some people just like to take a look and leave. With
the audio tour, you can comfortably get through the exhibition in
an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA art professor Henry P. Hopkins, who recently retired after
4{ years running the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum, said the pace seems
a bit brisk, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will certainly take longer, and may even be there
for hours in some cases,'' said Hopkins. ``But even the average
viewer, if they take a minute a work, it's well beyond 45 minutes.
It seems like 45 minutes is not quite giving the public its due.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said crowd-control problems early on are a likely
result, although typically, museum officials use the first few days
to gauge how to manage the flow of people. LACMA generally has done
a pretty good job of crowd control in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain a steady traffic flow, there won't be a single
bench in any of the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all things we hope will mitigate the craziness, and
the fact that the tickets do have a cost,'' said a LACMA
spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Besides tickets sales, LACMA also figures to reap increased
membership from ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs.'' Last July 1, before its
Picasso retrospective opened, LACMA had 64,000 members. It now has
95,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet blockbusters like ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' have become
increasingly expensive to mount, as the costs of insurance,
marketing and security climb, particularly for shows of popular
painters such as Picasso and the impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make clear that while this is great news
financially, it's not a windfall,'' said Andrea Rich, LACMA's
president and CEO, who declined to reveal how much it's costing
LACMA to bring ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a downside to these blockbusters. They're an
artificial bump and you can't do it every year, and it masks the
institution to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's all we did, one would wonder what's the
seriousness,'' Rich continued. ``You could just be a rental hall.
Blockbusters aren't our mission. Our mission is to build a great
collection and to explore things that are not (as accessible as van
Gogh). A show like this allows us programatically to do things that
are arcane or with a narrower focus.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you look at it, ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' figures
to be the cultural event of the year in a city that since last
year's opening of the Getty Center has begun to see itself as a
destination for more than sun, surf and Space Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Like Coca-Cola and the Olympic Games, van Gogh is a brand name
others want to buy into, including L.A.'s hotels and restaurants.
It's Robert Barrett's job, as associate vice president specializing
in cultural tourism for the Los Angeles Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau, to help them do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have done our best to create a comprehensive
marketing plan,'' said Barrett from his offices on the 60th floor
of the Library Tower in downtown L.A.
</P>
<P>
   A major component of the $1.5 million national marketing
campaign is a deal that offers free admission to the exhibition to
anyone booking one or more nights at one of eight participating
L.A.-area hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``So hotels bought into this program; they then owned the brand
name,'' Barrett said. ``They had a right to the brand of LACMA and
van Gogh.''
</P>
<P>
   To help draw visitors from outside Southern California, ad
spreads up to 12 full pages have been taken out in seven national
magazines and newspapers such as Travel &AMP; Leisure, The New Yorker
and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors bureau also is promoting mini-tours of works by
``Van Gogh and His Contemporaries'' scattered throughout the
region: at the J. Paul Getty Museum; UCLA at the Armand Hammer
Museum of Art and Cultural Center; the Norton Simon Museum in
Pasadena; and the Huntington Library, Art Collections &AMP; Botanical
Gardens in San Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows that 10 van Goghs live in four L.A. museums, so
we're here to tell you. So if you come to see 70 van Goghs, you can
see 80,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said LACMA recognized the necessity for such a marketing
push after observing the success of similar efforts for the Cezanne
show in Philadelphia. The visitors bureau will pay close attention
to local economic spinoffs from ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs,'' hoping to
use the data to attract future blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exhibition we will track very, very carefully,'' Barrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   What van Gogh _ who sold just one painting during his lifetime,
for $80, and adopted the lifestyle of a working stiff _ would make
of all this adulation and attention is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Protestant minister, van Gogh was a failed teacher,
preacher and art dealer before finally turning to painting.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than staking his place in fashionable Parisian cafe
society, he found spirituality in the orchards and wheatfields,
living among miners and farmers. For the minister's son, painting
became what scholar Richard Kendall refers to in a catalog essay as
``evangelism by other means.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One must paint the peasants as if being one of them,'' van
Gogh wrote his brother Theo.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in fact, no saint, but a man given to consorting with
prostitutes and to deep depression. But his mood swings also
resulted in one what one admiring critic in 1913 referred to as the
``hallucinatory monstrances'' on van Gogh's canvases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do not give vent to my feelings, I think the boiler would
burst,'' van Gogh told his brother.
</P>
<P>
   To some, van Gogh's art may look too simplistic, too broadly
accessible. It's the old saw: If everybody likes something, how
good can it be?
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like democratic parity,'' said LACMA's Beal.
``There's no iconography, there's no saints, there's no myths. It's
a day in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a mistake, Beal suggests, to suppose that
because van Gogh's paintings are concerned with everyday subjects
and ordinary lives, they don't raise critical interpretive and
art-historical issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is, in a way, the original modern expressionist,'' Beal
said. ``He was the man who made paint color itself directly express
the inner mind of the artist and imposed the innerness on whatever
he painted. That then freed Fauvists up to paint noses blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping van Gogh's achievements in perspective may be difficult
over the next five frenzied months. When you stand in LACMA's
galleries, try to look past the 25 people around you and absorb van
Gogh's blazing brush strokes. Relish the religious ecstasy he drew
from the mundane. Savor his struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are half a dozen really great pictures,'' Beal said.
``There are a couple of dozen wonderful pictures. You don't get
this monolithic view of one, great singing picture after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what really comes across in this exhibition is the
distance he traveled in such a short time.'' &QL;

WHAT YOU NEED IN A CAR IS A FOUL-WEATHER FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last, the perfect match of the right car in the right
weather. Meaning, of course, that the weather is absolutely wrong.
You couldn't have planned it any worse: wide temperature swings,
ice, freezing rain, snow, bitter cold. When it comes to weather and
cars, I take my cue from the witches of Macbeth _ what's foul is
fair and what's fair is foul.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not quite a perfect match; the car is a Mercedes E320
sedan with 4Matic, the old techno name resurrected on the new
all-wheel-drive system, and it can handle virtually anything Mother
Nature can throw in front of your headlights. But it would be
perfect, perhaps if it had that heated seats option, the $595 extra
also available with rain-sensitive wipers and headlamp washers in a
$1,675 package. That might be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'm spoiled. I didn't grow up with that kind of luxury _ who
did? Growing up in my economic segment (it's called poverty, but
nobody told us, so we didn't know) one walked home in the cold and
snow. Or took public transport if you had a nickel or a dime. Even
without heated seats, frozen buns in a Benz E320 AWD is a lot
better than the snow-filled, wind-blown open top of a Fifth Avenue
Coach Co. double-decker rushed into emergency service for the
blizzard _ ah, that was fun. Not.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, Jan. 8, the weather news is not good. Traffic
news is worse. As the Benz exits the Globe lot onto Morrissey
Boulevard, the traffic mavens at WBZ are speed-speaking the bad
news. The traffic report is the only thing moving at speed; traffic
isn't. The Expressway is a parking lot, Route 93 is clogged, the
bridge is jammed, the tunnel ramps are plugged _ but no one has
mentioned the Ted Williams. It's Friday. I head through South
Boston in what seems to be light traffic, turn into the TWT just as
the speed-speaker reminds all that the TWT is indeed open to all.
This is the only good thing that hapens for the rest of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   On Route 1 just south of the 129 underpass, I catch up with the
clog. It is snowing, and, for once, people are slowing. Benz has
elected to equip its cars with a single long wiper blade that
sweeps across a wide swath of windshield; it has some winter
drawbacks. The longer the arm, the more ice and snow will build up
on it _ this is not a winter blade wrapped to protect the fingers
that give it flexibility. Snow and slush clog it, keeping it from
bending to the contour of the windshield, which means the part I
see through isn't getting wiped clear.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 95 below Portsmouth is grim, and the Spaulding Pike
is grimmer, even though the DPW lads are out there. The E320 plows
along, steady as if on a dry road. The normal one hour, 20-minute
commute stretches to two hours, 50 minutes. What would it have been
without the TWT?
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday, Jan. 9, the natal day of the first born of the
auto writer, the daughter who is about to celebrate the passage of
three decades on the planet some 60 miles distant, and the weather
is lousy. Exceedingly lousy. I begin by chipping my way through the
ice to get into the car, then chip and scrape some more as it warms
up, slide down the driveway, and slither down the street to clear _
more or less _ pavement. It is raining; it is 30 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heading southwest on New Hampshire Route 125, the rain is
increasing in intensity, and the temperature is rising. It jumps 17
degrees in 20 miles, and now the rain is coming in torrents. The
car is fine, except I can't see anything, and must pull over until
either the rain abates or Noah happens by.
</P>
<P>
   It is 20-odd degrees warmer in Lowell than at the start of this
trek, but we celebrate, I, daughter, and a score of her nearest and
dearest. I leave before the celebrating is all done to find the
thermometer is doing a Wall Street impression and dropped a bunch.
The puddles have frozen in mid ripple; common sense says head for
the interstates and take the long way around to home. I am big on
common sense, but tonight it seems to be locked in the trunk or
something. I head for the back roads.
</P>
<P>
   The E320 is making occasional odd sounds to the accompaniment of
a little flashing light telling me what I already know; I am
driving on black ice. There are abundant patches of it, but the
E320 zips quietly along, electronically correcting for yaw, for
wheel slip, for imminent skids. I throttle back; just because it
moves forward quite well is no indication one can stop the thing.
The instant the brakes are applied, what little traction that is
available on ice disappears with the smidgen of heat a braking
wheel generates. But the celebrant behind me (not from the birthday
party, I assure you) can't take the hint, zooms by, mostly
straight.
</P>
<P>
   The public works guys are out in force, sanding, salting, trying
to render passable as much of the road network as possible as
quickly as possible. From time to time, I fall in behind one; from
time to time, some fruitcake passes us both, to boldly go where no
earthling should go before _ before the sander onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long, slow, slippery trip. Patience and a full
windshield washer tank are necessary equipment.
</P>
<P>
   This is a $48,990-plus-$595-delivery sedan, very well equipped,
and very well designed to handle rotten road conditions with
all-wheel drive adjusting torque automatically to take advantage of
available traction at any corner, antilock brakes, air bags, all
the bells and whistles _ thus underscoring the obvious: Safety is
readily available to the rich. Cutting-edge safety technology is
rarely available to the less-than-well-to-do except as a
hand-me-down, usually long after it has ceased to be cutting edge.
The silver lining in this socioeconomic cloud is that five years
hence, when the Benz has depreciated to the point where the lower
middle-class can stretch the budget to reach it, the technogizmos
will likely still be working _ and you, too, can then enjoy the AWD
and swear at the dismally inconvenient (but geometrically arrayed)
radio controls and grumble at the single wiper. Of course, the
maintenance expense may be . . . but enough carping; it is snowing
again, and time to play in traffic.

`ZOE, DUNCAN, JACK AND JANE': WACKY NEW YORK TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; check local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zoe befriends the meanest girl (and most dangerous dodge-ball
player) in school because the girl's brother is a hunk. Zoe's mom
is dating an airline pilot with one eyebrow. Duncan can't get a
date because he's lactose-intolerant. His mother also makes him
scrape his tongue every day. Jack may be wearing enchanted shoes.
Jane, his fraternal twin, likes to use terms like ``raw sex'' and
has a fixation on breasts (her own). Are these New York City high
school students wacky or what?
</P>
<P>
   They're certainly trying to be, as the leads in ``Zoe, Duncan,
Jack and Jane.'' This sitcom, WB's latest effort at cornering the
market on teen-age viewers eager to identify with characters their
own age, has its premiere Sunday night at 9 ET. But it's no ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The four young stars are all relative newcomers. David Moscow
(Duncan) has the most impressive movie credit; he played the young
Josh Baskin, the Tom Hanks character, 11 years ago in ``Big.''
Michael Rosenbaum (Jack) had a role in the 1998 horror film ``Urban
Legend.'' Selma Blair (Zoe) and Azura Skye (Jane) are even newer.
</P>
<P>
   These four are personable and attractive and they're trying
hard, but they're stuck in the most banal kind of sitcom: one with
goofy-misunderstanding plots. In the first episode, Zoe is all
atwitter because she runs into the handsome Montana Kennedy (Scott
Foley) in the subway station, but just as he's saying something to
her about Saturday night, the train arrives with its ear-splitting
screech. Did he ask her out or not? What should she do? What should
she say?
</P>
<P>
   And when she maneuvers her way back into his presence, he
mentions Saturday night again but before the essential information
is out of his mouth, someone nearby drops a stack of dishes and the
clatter drowns out his words. Poor, dopey old Zoe: She still
doesn't know what he's suggesting! (Couldn't she just say, ``Sorry,
I couldn't hear you''? Maybe Manhattan teen-agers aren't as
sophisticated as everybody thought.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a glimmer of hope at the very end of the first episode,
when Jack, who has borrowed Duncan's ticket to the opera, eases
himself into the box seat next to Duncan's mother and slips his arm
around the back of her chair as ``Rigoletto'' begins. Of course,
Pacey has already done that older woman-younger man thing on
``Dawson's Creek.''

EUROPE'S LEGACY IN AFRICA: DOMINATION, NOT DEMOCRACY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, scarcely a decade after Africa's great
independence wave had begun, many of the continent's new political
creations already had begun to resemble disasters. With no ready
answers to their problems, many African leaders struck upon a new
strategy for explaining their failings to impatient populations
while simultaneously drawing more outside aid: blaming the European
colonizers for Africa's seemingly intractable difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   But if this approach was at least temporarily successful in many
cases, the increasing stridency of the claims made against the
West, set against the backdrop of the growing despotism of the new
leaders, quickly backfired, as both foreign sympathy and assistance
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades or so, conventional wisdom largely
rejected African assertions of outside responsibility for the
continent's problems, and many in the West argued, often with a
growing vehemence of their own, that Africa's bad leaders were
primarily to blame rather than any European legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing years of this century, though, historians,
political scientists and other students of African affairs have
begun a searching re-examination of the continent's recent past.
Increasingly they have concluded that many of its most persistent
curses _ from the plague of ethnic hatred widely known as tribalism
to endemic official corruption _ have powerful roots that are at
least partly traceable to European subjugation and rule.
</P>
<P>
   Among the writings that helped forge this reconsideration are
works like ``Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the
Legacy of Late Colonialism,'' by the Ugandan scholar Mahmood
Mamdani. Mamdani's 1996 book draws extensively on colonial records
to show how Europeans administered their new subjects through a
deliberately authoritarian form of indirect rule _ for which the
author coined the term ``decentralized despotism'' _ that greatly
reinforced or even created notions of ethnicity, helping set the
stage for the tribal conflict that wracks the continent today.
</P>
<P>
   Another work, Basil Davidson's ``Black Man's Burden: Africa and
the Curse of the Nation-State,'' depicts the European process of
decolonization in Africa as one of hasty, even offhand
decision-making filled with a disdain for Africans and their
history and an unquestioning arrogance that assumed that the
political structures of the West were appropriate for Africans even
when they had been given no preparation for making them work.
</P>
<P>
   In these and other scholarly works, African specialists have
made the point that the example left by European rule was one of
politics by sheer domination and not democracy. Then, as is so
often the case now, African states were run with little thought to
the benefit of their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no country in Africa today displays the consequences of
Europe's African past as harshly as Congo, where the
three-decade-old Mobutu dictatorship was violently overthrown in
1997, only to be followed by a bumbling new authoritarian figure,
Laurent Kabila, and more recently by a succession of new rebellions
that are tearing his vast country apart.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before suddenly granting independence in 1960, amid a
wave of simultaneous African independence ceremonies, Belgian
colonial planners still spoke dreamily of holding onto their
possession _ a country 77 times as large as their own _ for decades
more.
</P>
<P>
   At independence in 1960, Congo entered the modern era, nominally
at least, with only a few score high school graduates and less than
500 miles of paved road. The country's first university had been
created by the Belgians only six years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colonial history of the Congo has inclined that country in
a more tragic direction than even most other African countries,''
said Zine Magubane, a South African professor of sociology and
African studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana. ``The
Belgians had no interest in establishing any sort of permanency or
any true state. The country was instead run by a series of
companies that had a free hand at pillaging the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Other African scholars place an emphasis even further back, on
the last decades of the 19th century, when Europe's imperial powers
divided up the continent and defined the borders that remain today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you had before the imposition of this great iron grid of
colonialism was an extraordinarily variegated network of
cultures,'' said Rene Lemarchand, a professor emeritus of the
University of Florida at Gainesville and a lifelong student of
Africa. ``That certainly included some rather extensive and
elaborate kingdoms _ take the case of Ashanti, of Buganda, of Kongo
or of the Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the iron grid was removed,'' he continued, ``what
resurfaced were residues of traditional systems, and in many cases
pre-colonial antagonisms resurfaced.''
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, many Africanists say, colonial subjugation
brutally ended Africa's sovereign evolution toward modern
nation-states, a gradual process of conquest and agglomeration that
has occurred throughout history around the world.

 &HT;    SOLOMON SAYS DRAFT-BUSH MOVEMENT WILL GO PUBLIC IN SPRING
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newly retired Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said
Friday that his informal movement to draft Texas Gov. George W.
Bush as the GOP presidential nominee will become public and formal
when the Texas legislature adjourns this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to lay the groundwork so that when the Texas
legislative session is over, we can get the public to convince him
to come and save America,'' said Solomon, who has been building a
network of Bush supporters among current and former members of
Congress since last April.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeals both to ``doctrinaire conservatives like myself''
and to Republicans whose main concern is choosing a winner, said
Solomon, who was House Rules Committee chairman during the last
four of his 20 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush believes in conservatism with compassion, which
really describes Ronald Reagan,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's record in office and two victories in Texas
gubernatorial races also show he is the ``most electable'' in a
field of GOP hopefuls that eventually could include ``such good
candidates as Dan Quayle, who's a personal friend of mine, or Jack
Kemp, who's from my home state, or even Elizabeth Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Quayle was successful in 1988, but
unsuccessful in 1992 as the GOP running mate of the governor's
father, former President George W. Bush. Kemp was the losing vice
presidential candidate on the Republican ticket headed in 1996 by
Dole's husband, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, a 65-year-old ex-Marine who sponsored the bill that
created the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn't
become Secretary of Veterans Affairs in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be an honor, but I wouldn't do it. I'm through with
public office,'' said Solomon, whose final term ended last week.
</P>
<P>
   He said he now splits his time evenly between his draft-Bush
efforts and managerial duties at a new lobbying and political
strategy firm in Washington. He and some of his former
congressional aides formed the firm in conjunction with two other
lobbying firms one headed by Reagan's former campaign chairman,
Paul Laxalt, and the other by Laxalt's daughter, Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   During their first year out of office, neither Solomon nor his
aides can directly lobby members of Congress. But they can advise
clients and supervise lobbyists. They also can work with incumbents
on non-legislative activities, such as choosing the party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said ``a large number'' of current and former members of
Congress are involved in the effort. He declined to name them.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of other draft-Bush movements have less experience in
national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Two independent organizations that can be accessed on line are
the ``Bush 2000 Network - B2K''
(http://www.egroups.com/list/bush2000/info.html) co-moderated by
University of Pennsylvania junior Patrick G. Ruffini, chairman of
the Penn College Republicans, and ``Unofficial Governor George W.
Bush for President in 2000 Web Site''
(http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/4124/) created by
Canadian conservative Michael McCafferty of Regina, Saskatchewan.

UNDATED: the world. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Americas, native populations were exterminated by
arriving Europeans or saw their cultures marginalized by the makers
of new states. In India and many other parts of Asia, conquering
Europeans imposed their new colonial order on states that already
had begun to coalesce to one degree or another around an idea of
national identity.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, meanwhile, Europeans carved out new frontiers as a
function of the existing power balance among themselves, giving an
occasional nod to natural features of the continent like broad
rivers but almost never paying heed to the chosen identities of
Africans themselves or to the political systems already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The example I like to think of is if an African imperial army
had marched into Europe in the Middle Ages and required Germany,
France and England to live together by force of arms,'' said Makau
wa Mutua, a Kenyan scholar who teaches law at the State University
at Buffalo. ``It would have unleashed untold mayhem, and not to
excuse the villainies of Africa's subsequent leaders, that is
precisely what happened when Europe did this to Africa in the span
of 30 years by destroying Africa's existing political structures,
some of them powerful and far-ranging kingdoms, and imposing its
own borders, religions and administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In cataloguing and later registering their African subjects,
Europeans everywhere reinforced and sometimes completely invented
ethnic distinctions that Africans themselves had hitherto managed
with far greater suppleness.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case of this now is that of the Hutu and Tutsi
who predominate in Rwanda and Burundi and are a small minority in
Congo. For centuries the two groups had coexisted peaceably,
marrying, sharing a language and a king. When Belgium imposed its
administration, however, it glorified the minority Tutsi peoples
for their supposedly more European features, creating a de facto
ethnic underclass of the majority Hutu and sowing the seeds of the
cycles of mass killings that have afflicted the two groups since.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, almost every time the Europeans created a state,
ethnic groups or previously existing African polities were split by
the new borders, undermining the new states' claims to legitimacy
in the eyes of their inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging African nations' first brush with legitimacy came
with the independence movements that swept the continent in the
1950s. But in the case of Congo, as with many other countries, the
nationalism of the leader who best channeled pro-independence
sentiment, Patrice Lumumba, quickly was seen as a threat by Belgium
and by a Cold War-driven United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries worked to undermine and ultimately overthrow
Lumumba, who was subsequently assassinated under murky
circumstances. The man they helped replace him with was Mobutu Sese
Seko, the dictator who ruinously ruled over Africa's third largest
country with strong Western backing for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   For most of that period Mobutu loomed over his country and over
the continent's affairs. The West had decided that Zaire, as he
renamed his country, with its borders with nine other African
countries, was of strategic importance. Acting on behalf of his
foreign sponsors, Mobutu intervened freely in his neighbors'
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, however, Western interest in
propping up Mobutu, Western interest in Africa generally,
evaporated. It was then, through the collapse of Mobutu and the
crumbling of a dozen or more countries that the myth of the modern
African state began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   For Mobutu the end came quickly at the hands of Kabila, long an
obscure and inconsequential rebel leader who this time had the
critical backing of Rwanda and Uganda, two neighbors that decided
to pursue their own security interests in Congo aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Shorn of foreign assistance, the Mobutu government, a creation
of the West, could not pay its civil servants, equip its army or
even move its ill-disciplined troops from one part of the country
to another when war came.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congo, which owed its definition and preservation to the
outside world, is being dismembered by its neighbors while the West
averts its suddenly disinterested gaze.
</P>
<P>
   The first to feast on Central Africa's largest piece of real
estate have been Uganda and Rwanda, two of Africa's Western
favorites now.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of these two nations, which already have
carved out large spheres of interest for themselves in the
country's eastern regions, other neighbors, some less favored by
the West, aggressively are asserting their interests too.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe and Angola, Congo's southern neighbors, have rushed to
Kabila's defense, invoking the principle of territorial integrity
as they position themselves to profit from the country's immense
mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``States which are more stable and can project more economic or
military power are going to interfere more readily in the affairs
of their neighbors,'' Mutua said.
</P>
<P>
   A century after Europe created the edifice of African
nation-states, many observers of the continent's affairs say they
foresee a potentially perilous period in which the structure
progressively crumbles, with no one quite sure what to expect next.

CADILLAC KEEPS ITS SALES TITLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Countering the expectations of analysts and even of its own
executives, the Cadillac division of General Motors held onto first
place in the luxury class last year _ but just barely.
</P>
<P>
   Going into December, it seemed that Lincoln, the luxury marque
of the Ford Motor Co., would surpass Cadillac in overall sales, a
feat Lincoln last accomplished in 1939. With Lincoln leading by
7,000 vehicles as of Dec. 1, Cadillac conceded that it could lose
its title.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by that prospect, Cadillac went on a selling blitz,
ultimately recording one of its strongest Decembers ever and
beating Lincoln by just 222 vehicles. The final score: Cadillac
187,343, Lincoln 187,121.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln benefited last year from brisk demand for its Navigator
sport utility, against which Cadillac did not compete until it
introduced the Escalade in the fall. But Cadillac's biggest blow
was a two-month strike by the United Automobile Workers that shut
down nearly all of GM's American assembly plants and cost Cadillac
an estimated 10,000 sales.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for that shortfall, Cadillac offered a variety of
inducements as the year was ending. John Smith, the division's
marketing general manager, said Cadillac could afford customer and
dealer incentives _ which he called ``modest'' though he declined
to give a figure _ because the division had surpassed its year-end
profit goals in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac figured the strike had prompted many previous owners,
who typically buy at the end of the model year, to delay purchases.
A mailing went to 80,000 owners, suggesting that the end of the
calendar year was a good time to trade in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac also promoted its products to employees and retirees,
and it benefited from fourth-quarter incentives for 350 high-volume
dealers. By meeting sales targets set in October, November and
December, dealers received increasing amounts of cash for each car
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac also paid salespeople additional incentives on the
Seville, which resulted in sales of more than 5,000 Sevilles last
month, the highest level in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from incentives, GM produced more Escalades than expected.
December sales were also helped by the addition of a fleet order
for 4,080 cars that had been postponed because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case when there is a photo-finish sales race
in the industry, the accounting of year-end sales became creative.
(Toyota and Honda give their results in sealed envelopes to
impartial third parties, to guarantee that the other company
doesn't peek and then inflate its figures to claim victory.)
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers reported that Cadillac counted sales that were not
yet completed, as well as dealer orders and vehicles in inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each month, every brand is counting sales that may or may not
stand up to close scrutiny, especially when incentives apply,''
Smith said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scramble, both Cadillac and Lincoln say the
objective is not to lead in sales, but to enhance their brands.
``Luxury car leadership between the domestics isn't the point
anymore,'' Smith said, adding, ``I'll be happiest when Lincoln and
Cadillac combined not only drive the imports back to their shores,
but start showing up on their doorsteps.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Driving imports away won't be easy. Mercedes trailed Lincoln by
less than 17,000, with Lexus and BMW close behind.

state organizations that are going to receive grants from the
foundation of up to $1 million each to fund ``outreach'' campaigns
intended to get uninsured children enrolled in one of two federal

   BRITAIN-RHYSJONES _ LONDON _ When Prince Edward's engagement to
Sophie Rhys-Jones was heralded across this island last week, it
seemed only reasonable to expect newsclips of Queen Elizabeth
passing out celebratory cigars to the editors of the nation's
tabloids. For both sides, it was a dream come true: A sequel in the
great national saga with a fresh star and at least a fair shot at a
happy ending _ even if it involves what Americans may regard as
minor characters. Edward, the queen's youngest and least famous
son, prefers to be called Edward Windsor when he is away from the
palace and is making his mark in the world of producing TV
documentaries. He's the producer formerly known as prince. But for
a royal household eager for a little good news, the announcement of
engagement to his girlfried of five years produced near giddiness.

   EVERGLADES _ In a dispute between federal agencies, scientists
at Everglades National Park say the Army Corps of Engineers' $7.8
billion Everglades restoration plan falls far short of its goals
and needs at least an extra $1 billion. Rather than restore South
Florida's natural areas, the scientists say, the plan would offer
modest improvements but leave the Everglades fragmented by canals
and levees, continue to plague areas with too much or too little
water, and fail to solve Lake Okeechobee's pollution problems.

   AUS-PESTICIDE-REPORTS _ AUSTIN _ More than 10 years ago,
Congress began requiring chemical plants, steel mills,
computer-chip manufacturers and other industries to file public
reports detailing how much toxic pollution they release to the air,
water and land. The federal law did not require the companies to
reduce their emissions, but that is precisely what many companies
did following the disclosures. Now, environmental activists in
Texas are seeking a similar reporting requirement for the sale and
use of pesticides. (Haurwitz, Austin American-Statesman)

<P>
   CASTLE16 _ By failing to show up to serve a 10-year prison term
in 1977, Sam Castle bought himself 21 years of illicit freedom. He
also bought himself an extra 12 months in a federal prison, the
sentence he received Friday on federal charges of fleeing to avoid
confinement. Castle, 63, was convicted in the early '70s of arson
for blowing up his sailboat at a Lantana marina, but he fled the
state while free pending his appeal. He dodged authorities for
years, but was caught in Seattle in the summer when the feds
trailed his wife there from Hawaii, where his wealthy family lives.
Before serving his federal sentence, Castle must first serve his
original time for arson _ but he will also enjoy the easier
sentencing laws in place when he was convicted. Probation officials
said Castle will likely only have to serve 2 1/2 to 4 years of his
10-year state term, though it could be slightly more if he loses
some gain time for escape. Still, it probably won't be 85 percent
of his sentence, which is the current sentencing law. Also, he's
already served 7 months of the federal charge. In exchange for his
guilty plea, federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue Castle's wife
or parents, who helped him avoid investigators all these years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ A salute is in order for Miuccia Prada. Her stark
collection was hip, inventive and handsome, a salubrious ambrosia
for men's fashion. In Milan this season, where the shows of men's
clothes for fall 1999 ended on Wednesday, Ms. Prada was peerless.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest international talents are those who have been able
to sustain the delicate balance between wearable and creative
fashion, at least half the time. A smattering of them _ Ms. Prada,
Helmut Lang, Alexander McQueen, Jean Paul Gaultier and Karl
Lagerfeld included _ repeatedly offer new, plausible ways of
looking at fashion. This is said without malice toward other
designers, of whom at least a dozen more deserve to have their
names in stone because of particular talents.
</P>
<P>
   But true groundbreakers, like Ms. Prada, stretch the boundaries
of our conventions, persuading us to accept and fit into a new
construct. It is difficult to define the elements that make Ms.
Prada's work stand out, but here's a try: her relentless use of
industrial fabric, leaner shapes that seem to suit modern style,
risk-taking, romantic realism.
</P>
<P>
   She makes clothes come alive, lifting them beyond body
coverings, imbuing them with higher intellectual meaning or wisdom
of the street.
</P>
<P>
   From a dashing poncho to a new slim suit with forgiving
trousers, Ms. Prada's collection had all of these properties, and
spirit besides.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Piaggi, the one-of-a-kind doyenne of Italian fashion, who
often writes the verbosely metaphysical program notes for Ms.
Prada's shows, summed up the clothes in just two words: ``country
surplus.'' There was a rural hardiness and a breath of fresh air to
coats in olive or tan, uncluttered by fasteners except a brown
leather tab at chest height. Furry black vests complemented padded
and zipped nylon fatigue pants. How do you make a pert pair of
knee-length trousers look serious? Cut them in flannel and add
buckles or Velcro fasteners to close slits on the side at the
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prada took the idea of motocross padding, popular with so
many designers these days, one step further, adding a series of
fabric striations, like welts on the skin, to the elbow of a
jacket. And it could only have been a Prada woodsman who slew a
deer to turn its hairy skin into a glistening jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The designer continued the evolution of body bags that she and
others showed for their women's spring lines. Her male models could
have packed enough supplies into their pouches, bags and pockets so
as never to have to return to their hotels for bottled water or a
change of clothes. Strapped across one mole-colored nylon vest _
suitable for a country hike or, under a jacket, a city stroll _ was
a flat bag that could function as a container or a torso protector.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting, soothing and defining the body are concepts that
men's-wear designers have strongly embraced this season. A cape
concealing a man's girth, or a padded jacket cushioning the chest,
gives clothes dual purposes. Calvin Klein and Donna Karan have
claimed this idea as their own. Likewise, Giorgio Armani, whose
current emphasis is on cashmere and the linings of clothing; Ennio
Capasa for Costume National, who offers padded trousers, and the
impressive newcomer Neil Barrett, who showed a padded,
chest-bulking flannel vest. These are the good guys.
</P>
<P>
   The bad boys of fashion, on the other hand, don't believe in
quiet sensuality. They prefer a blatant sexuality. These are
designers for whom the forward march of fashion is irrelevant, as
they go gaily floating along in their own bubble, including
Gianfranco Ferre and Antonio D'Amico, a former head designer for
Gianni Versace's Istante and Versus Sport, who made his debut this
season. The 1980s may have ended, but on the bad boys' runways the
broad shoulder is alive and well, to say nothing of tight and
sweaty leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, whose Versace roots showed well enough, knows how to
cut a precise suit and, like Ferre, believes in the bosom-revealing
men's sweater. But if his goal is to create an important
collection, a more pronounced emphasis on the easy trousers and
outerwear he showed will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, whether or not he succeeds in any given season, always
insists on being at the contemporary edge. He is the high-school
guy who doesn't always go to the trouble of planning a party of his
own but says, ``If someone else does it, I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitude keeps Klein hip (not merely successful). It is
what leads him to seat the editor in chief of Vibe magazine,
visiting the Italian men's-wear collections for the first time, in
the front row of his show, alongside the more heavyweight editors
of GQ and Details.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Klein was very much at the party, showing sensuous
clothes as gentle armor, including smooth leather pullovers with
hidden zippers, stretch wool suits and padded jackets. Padding in
jackets and flannel track pants might be the kind of stealth armor
that deflects a punch in the stomach. More important to today's
man, it can also be clothing that soothes and reassures, like a
baby's safety blanket.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Ms. Karan's presentation, the designer herself held court,
describing each outfit. Born with the words ``sensuality'' and
``cashmere'' on her lips, Ms. Karan helped usher in the current
mood in men's wear, although she has yet to profit much from it (in
part because men are still uncomfortable buying from a female
designer, in part because of her own lack of creative consistency).
Ms. Karan's cashmere-lined leather jackets and quilted pullovers
that can be worn alone or under nylon sweatshirts give men
something to slip cozily into.
</P>
<P>
   As for suits, designers are finished with the extreme disheveled
look of one or two seasons ago. They're keeping the relaxed styling
of the recent past, but adding some structure and control. Armani
achieved the effect with unusual fabrics like synthetics fused or
woven onto leather, and with wrinkle-resistant polyester.
</P>
<P>
   What has been most disturbing about Armani lately is his refusal
to experiment with the patented Armani look. It can be said,
however, that he did so this time, at least to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   One always imagines Armani as a stern doctor forcibly
administering style prescriptions to make us look better. Not a
moment too soon, he has lightened up, adding a sense of playfulness
with supple leathers, feathery cashmere sweaters and cashmere
overcoats as simple and alluring as a favorite cardigan.
</P>
<P>
   Emblematic of the difference between the modesty in fashion that
is current and the immodesty that is dated are styles by Capasa and
Ferre. Capasa used rabbit fur in great reversible pullovers, while
Ferre showed a hustler's white leather topcoat lined in mink.
</P>
<P>
   Tight and well rounded, Capasa's collection continued Milan's
tactile story. He showed wonderful sporty pony-skin jackets, and
coats and jackets with necklines that rose upward, sheltering the
neck and even the mouth. Mid-thigh jackets were paired with skinny
trousers with curved zippers from the back of the calf to the front
of the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, a former designer for Gucci and most recently Prada,
which he left in August, presented his first collection, whose
central idea was clothes that protect the body and amplify its
proportions. He showed a sweater knitted in heavy yarn on top to
enhance the chest and fine yarn across the stomach to slim the
waist, and padded track pants that give a man the illusion of
having muscular legs. Barrett was one of several designers
providing an ingenious, sturdy inner strap with coats and parkas,
meant for carrying coats like a backpack or a messenger bag when
things become too hot.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a fragile strap from which Romeo Gigli's men's wear
hangs. An undistinguished mix, it offered neither joyous adornment
nor sensuous protection. The collection's wild swings in style in
the last few seasons have been perplexing. Restructuring in his
business may be having an impact on Gigli's creative powers, but
ill-fitting jackets and funereal colors should not mark a
collection by a designer best known for royal hues and precise
shapes. Crushed suits were never meant to look so artless.
</P>
<P>
   Even the models, probably depressed by the glossy black fedoras
they had to wear, showed the strain, looking like somnambulists
drifting down the runway. When at the close of the grinding show
Gigli came out skipping and smiling, one had to wonder whether this
was a designer without a clue _ or just one perversely amused by
ugly clothes. &QL;

DEMOCRATS REMINDED OF WORDS THEY SPOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. was expelled from
the federal bench, the decision was done with a few committee
hearings, a swift impeachment vote, and a series of scorching
remarks that might raise eyebrows in the current Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, one Democratic senator said in 1989, was impeached
because of a ``single, discreet false statement before a grand
jury.'' A moderate Republican accused the judge of playing a
``semantic shell game.'' Another Democrat said Nixon was ``probably
not a liar at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in my judgment, he did lie in this instance,'' Senator
Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, said after Nixon's impeachment.
``He misled the grand jury. These acts are undisputably criminal
and warrant impeachment. I do not buy the argument that he forgot''
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have seized on these nearly decade-old remarks in
recent days, digging them out of the congressional archive as
evidence the Senate has already defined perjury as an impeachable
offense _ and as proof the Democratic senators who voted to convict
the federal judge are shifting ideological gears to accommodate
President Clinton in his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a fundamental difference between the two
cases: Nixon, appointed in 1968 to his Mississippi post for life,
was sitting in prison at the time of his impeachment, already
convicted for lying to a grand jury about his role in a drug
investigation. The lie was related directly to his job. Also, he
was one of nearly 1,000 federal judges, not the president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Senate began its trial of Clinton Thursday, some of
the 27 Democrats who voted to oust Judge Nixon, including Senators
Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry, are faced with a delicate
reconciliation of their past and present views. In his opening
statement Thursday, Representative James F.Sensenbrenner Jr. of
Wisconsin reminded senators of the precedent, saying Nixon had been
ousted for lying to a federal grand jury, ``precisely the same
charges contained in Article I against President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is the truth and a lie is a lie,'' Sensenbrenner
said. ``There cannot be different levels of truth for presidents
and for judges.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska who voted to oust
Nixon, said earlier this week, ``It's one of the things you have to
consider: whether there's a different standard for the president
than there is for a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican, said: ``I think the
standard should be the same. But the standard is whatever each
individual senator determines. So naturally, it may be different
than what it was for Judge Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon initially came under investigation for his role in a drug
case involving Drew Fairchild, the son of his friend and business
partner, Wiley Fairchild of Hattiesburg, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of his wealthy friend, Nixon put in a good word
with the prosecutor involved in investigating Fairchild's son. Drew
Fairchild eventually pleaded guilty to drug charges but never went
to jail. Nixon said a plea deal had been worked out before he got
involved.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Nixon's later lie _ not his alleged influence in the
drug case _ that got him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators from the public integrity unit of the Justice
Department questioned him, Nixon denied ever talking to anyone
involved in the Fairchild case. He later told a grand jury he
``never talked to anyone . . . that in any way influenced
anybody.'' In 1986, he was charged with perjury, convicted, and
sentenced to five years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon continued drawing his $89,500-a-year salary while he was
serving time, and he vowed to return to the bench upon release. In
this environment of swirling accusations about drugs, power, and
judicial abuse, the 60-year-old judge was impeached by the House of
Representatives and found guilty in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his case, it involved a previous criminal conviction, which
of course is dramatically different from the kind of circumstances
we're talking about now,'' Kennedy recalled. ``There is a very
significant difference between someone who is serving a life
appointment, which a federal judge is . . . and someone who is
really accountable to the people, which an executive is, subject to
removal every four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's impeachment case was tried over several days in front of
a Senate committee, then voted on by the full Senate, where he was
convicted on two counts of lying under oath by votes of 89-8 and
78-19. A third count, which accused him of having betrayed the
integrity of his office, failed 57-40. Kennedy voted in favor of
all three counts; Kerry supported the two lying counts,
congressional records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was involving himself in a criminal enterprise that
involved the safety and well-being of the American people,'' Kerry
said recently about the Nixon case. ``President Clinton's
underlying offense is having an extramarital affair, and in no way
affects the safety and well-being of the American people, except to
the degree that the prosecutor chose to make it a case.''
</P>
<P>
   But senators were far less forgiving of lying under oath at the
time of Nixon's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, for example, voted to impeach Nixon on two counts and said
at the time: ``Judge Nixon struck me as someone who dug himself
into a hole _ and then kept digging when he realized he was
stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator James M. Jeffords, a Republican from Vermont who is
considered a moderate in the current impeachment debate, said the
Nixon matter never would have led to impeachment ``but for Judge
Nixon's choice to obstruct the ability of the investigators to look
for connections between these two events by lying about whether the
conversations took place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only the lies which have caused his demise,'' Jeffords
wrote at the time.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Democrats said there are differences between the
Nixon and Clinton cases. Several pointed to an opinion written by
US Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist _ now presiding over the
impeachment trial _ that upheld the Senate's conviction of Nixon,
saying it was specific to impeaching a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers, in their legal brief filed this week,
say that unlike presidents, who are elected for a maximum of two
terms, federal judges are appointed for life and hold their offices
``during good behavior,'' according to the Constitution. Therefore,
impeachment is the only way to remove a judge from office.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republican Representative Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina said the senators' remarks in the Nixon case speak for
themselves. Graham said the Nixon case offers solid evidence for
why senators should consider removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of our case is what the Senate has done in the
past with people who violated the law in ways similar to this,''
said Graham, one of the House managers during the impeachment
trial. ``They used the same legal standard, they lost their jobs
for good reason. It's inconsistent, being a perjurer and a judge.
And we'll make that same argument for the president.''

 (For release Sun., Jan. 17)   By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a wintry Saturday, with the rain letting up but
the sky still chalky, Valerie Steele, chief curator of the Museum
at the Fashion Institute of Technology, saw the summer sandal of
her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   She was at Manolo Blahnik on West 54th Street, and there on a
high perch was the barest black sandal, with a whisper of a sling
back and instep collar and a slender ribbon of leather bejeweled
with a branch of fake coral designed to slither down the length of
the foot and disappear between the toes. The sandal evoked romance,
dancing under a canopy of stars, yachts bobbing in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one I  &UR; love &LR; !'' Ms. Steele said. ``It's like being naked,
but better. It's the ultimate minimalism in a shoe. It's just a
sole and a strap. If I could buy one thing in here, it's this.''
</P>
<P>
   She cradled it in her hand like a jewel, eyeing it from every
angle _ the slender but comfortably low heel, the twigginess of the
coral, the near weightlessness of the strips of leather
masquerading as a shoe.
</P>
<P>
   This was  &UR; research. &LR;  She is the curator of ``Shoes: A Lexicon of
Style,'' an exhibition of 150 modern shoes, which promises an
exploration of ``the symbolism and social psychology of shoes.''
Opening at the Fashion Institute here on Jan. 26, it includes
styles ranging from a pump fluffy with feathers to a stiletto-heel
boot exposing the back of the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Steele, who wrote the show's catalog (and is the author
of seven books on fashion), a shoe is sculpture and cultural
artifact. The foot is not just an essential body part, she said,
but also a highly eroticized zone. ``People anthropomorphize the
foot,'' she said. ``It's sexualized, so the back is like the
buttocks, and the toes are like the breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a biological reason that our feet are hard-wired into
our brain as being particularly erotic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog, Ms. Steele cites the research of Wilder
Penfield, a Canadian neurosurgeon, as described by V.S.
Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee in ``Phantoms in the Brain:
Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co.,
$27). Penfield found in the 1940s and '50s that sensations from
different parts of the body are mapped on the surface of the brain
and that the receptor areas for the genitals are adjacent to those
for the feet. Ms. Steele writes, ``It is possible, even likely,
that many of us have a bit of cross-wiring, which would explain why
we perceive fondling and caressing of the feet as sexually
pleasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   If feet are sexual, then the shoes that frame them are liable to
provoke sexy thoughts. ``Shoes are beautiful objects,'' Ms. Steele
said. ``Most clothes have no hanger appeal, but shoes can exist
just like objects.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not enough, ``Shoes express personality,
emotional mood and drama,'' Ms. Steele said. ``Most people have one
or two looks in clothing, but shoes can play many roles _ Doc
Marten, femme fatale, sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fashion Institute show illustrates how the pump, once a
man's shoe, became a woman's shoe by the 19th century. Yet, men
still can have cowboy boots, because the image of the cowboy is so
macho that he can wear a high-heeled boot glittering with
rhinestones.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition demonstrates how sneakers transcend their sports
function, and it identifies ``style tribes.'' The sneaker wearers
that Ms. Steele calls ``techno urban warriors'' go in for athletic
shoes that are heavy and elevated by platform soles and that
generally defeat any sports purpose. Another tribe craves sneakers
with the most advanced technology to enhance sports performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele shops for shoes and other clothes once a week. Part
of her shopping is homework _ investigating, for instance, why hats
have disappeared. (``The hair became the crowning glory and
replaced the hat,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   But she also shops for herself, usually during sales. ``I like
shopping for fashion in general, but shoes are the most
satisfying,'' Ms. Steele, who is 43, said. ``There's lots of
clothing I can't wear anymore, but your feet will never get too fat
or too old to wear beautiful, sexy shoes.'' For the flirtatious
woman of a certain age, the feet may be the last thing to flaunt.
Toe cleavage may have to substitute for the other kind.
</P>
<P>
   She virtually had to invent her specialty. As a graduate student
in European history at Yale University in the 1970s, she found the
time was not yet ripe for someone interested in clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In academia, fashion is frivolous, sexist, bourgeois,
materialist and beneath contempt,'' Ms. Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   But one day in 1978, she was taking a seminar on European
history when a classmate gave a presentation on the Victorian
corset, questioning whether or not it was oppressive. The
proverbial light bulb went on. ``I could have this new field in
cultural history, in material culture, and study gender, sex and
social psychology in fashion,'' Ms. Steele said. That seminar led
to her doctoral dissertation, which turned into her first book,
``Fashion and Eroticism,'' published by Oxford University Press in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   She worked first at the National Museum of American History at
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, then taught fashion
history at the Fashion Institute from 1985 to 1997, when she became
the chief curator of the museum. She also edits Fashion Theory: The
Journal of Dress, Body &AMP; Culture.
</P>
<P>
   As both a scholar and a woman who walks smoothly on three-inch
heels, Ms. Steele has much to say about the feature of the shoe.
``The heel is the single most important element,'' she says.
``People react viscerally. Show a flat oxford _ and suddenly pump
it up with a  &UR; heel &LR; .'' The first says function; the second, sex.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that high heels are sexy is that ``they produce an
erect ankle and an extended leg,'' Ms. Steele explained, adding:
``The arch of the foot is radically curved _ like a ballet dancer
on point. The entire lower body is thrown into a state of tension
resembling that of female sexual arousal. By tilting the pelvis,
high heels cause the lower back to arch. The breasts thrust
forward, and the derriere protrudes.''
</P>
<P>
   At Blahnik, Ms. Steele's eye was drawn to a gold mule with a fat
cluster of fake Baroque teardrop pearls. ``You're half-naked with
the whole back part of the foot exposed,'' she said. ``The back is
sort of undefended.'' Then she noticed a high-heeled black sandal,
fastening at the ankle with an inch-and-a-half band of leather, cut
out in vertical strips. Ms. Steele dubbed it ``the sandal with the
cage around the ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Caged is beautiful,'' added the curator, who wrote a book
called ``Fetish,'' published in 1996. ``Anything that wraps the
ankle, anything that ties and laces, plays on the bondage look.
It's the foot in bondage of the shoe, and the bondage of love. It's
very romantic. It's not S &AMP; M.''
</P>
<P>
   What laces and straps do is fit the shoe to the foot. In putting
on or taking off the shoe, one touches the foot, perhaps even
caresses it. Fitting a foot into a shoe can be a very special
gesture. Just ask Cinderella.

CLINTON OUTLINES INITIATIVES TO BOOST INVESTMENT IN NATION'S
POOREST AREAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Urging Wall Street to invest in ``new markets'' in
urban and rural America, President Clinton outlined a series of
initiatives Friday to encourage financial pioneers in the nation's
poorest areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed using tax credits and loan guarantees to spark
$15 billion in investments in those areas left out of the country's
thriving economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest pool of untapped investment opportunities and new
customers are not beyond our shores, they're in our back yard,''
Clinton told business executives gathered at the World Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The president left the nation's capital, where the Senate
continued a trial to determine whether to remove him from office,
to attend the second annual Wall Street Project conference
organized by Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine speakers before him heaped such praise upon the
beleaguered Clinton for his efforts on the economy and minority
issues that even he joked it was too much.
</P>
<P>
   The president quipped that the praise was ``the sort of thing
people say for your funeral. I don't think we're there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As has become his custom, he made no reference to Republican
efforts to ensure his political funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Project attempts to encourage investments in
minority businesses and poor neighborhoods. It's a coalition that
includes the leaders of the nation's major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, noting it was Martin Luther King's birthday, said
Clinton's policies ``represent the fulfillment of his (King's)
dream'' of one big tent for all America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who play have stains on their uniform. I'd rather be on
the field with a dirty uniform and hurting than relaxed on the
bench. Let me play in the big game,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The new White House initiative seeks to use tax credits and loan
guarantees to encourage greater investments and to use expanded
technological assistance to help new companies survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the economy is so good, now is the time to build that
bridge,'' Clinton said. ``If there was ever a time when none of us
have an excuse, this is that time. But the world changes very fast
and we have to seize the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The key feature of Clinton's proposal would provide a tax credit
worth 25 percent of the investment made by companies into community
development banks, venture funds and corporations. Those entities
in turn would provide investment into small technology firms,
inner-city shopping centers, manufacturing and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimated that the New Markets Tax Credit would
generate $6 billion in investments and cost the government $1
billion in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for the creation of America's Private Investment
Companies, or APICS, a domestic version of the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation. The APICS program would pool investor
equity of a minimum of $100 million into new investment
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration and the Department of Housing
and Urban Development would provide another $200 million in loan
guarantees. APICS would then invest in businesses moving to or
expanding in inner city and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for new loan guarantees through the SBA's
small business investment company program, which has helped nurture
upstarts such as America On Line and Staples.
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiatives likely will be included in his
fiscal year 2000 budget request to Congress.

MARTIN LUTHER KING REMAINS AMERICA'S GREATEST COMMUNICATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Jan. 18)   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wasn't the first
to perfect the art of using television as a tool for social change.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't even the first cleric to use TV. That nod goes to the
original televangelist, Archbishop Fulton Sheen (and in radio their
venomous forerunner was the racist Rev. Charles E. Coughlin, in the
1930s).
</P>
<P>
   King's ability to rally masses of people gathered before him in
church pews and parks and on the streets translated equally well in
the 1960s to the growing medium of television. Unlike the preening
pols of today, with their canned responses tailored to make CNN or
MSNBC or the networks, King's brilliance came more naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was made for television,'' said Dr. Rob Thompson, director
of the Center of Popular Television at Syracuse University.
``Martin Luther King is as good as anyone to give the award to as
the first master of the media sound bite.''
</P>
<P>
   King was able to capture vast philosophical tenets in a modicum
of beautifully connected words _ ``eminently quotable bits of
poetry,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   King's speech at the Civil Rights March on Washington in 1963
was, is and will remain among history's great orations. But it was
not a singular feat; consider this line from a lesser-known speech
in Detroit that same year: ``If a man hasn't discovered something
that he will die for, he isn't fit to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Powerful, succinct and tragically prescient.
</P>
<P>
   There were several factors that enhanced his televised visage,
much of which we take for granted in the now-familiar
black-and-white footage from his black-vs.-white time.
</P>
<P>
   There were the eyes, aflame in passion and surety, but not wild
with the excesses of a zealot. And his round face, turned upward
and leading with the chin, as if he were speaking to the heavens
above him, as well as to the people before him. His points were
punctuated with hand gestures, theatrically large and perfectly
timed, lest anyone in the back row miss what he was trying to
emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   As the camera moved in for the mandatory closeup, King did not
play to it. He didn't have to. The bearing, the dignity, the
intellectual fervency: a viewer with the sound off knew this was a
person of substance.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy showed in his 1960 campaign, against Richard
Nixon and his five-o'clock shadow, that an appealing television
image is, if not everything, something needed to at least get
people to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   There was more to King than just style in appearance. There was
what he had to say, and just as importantly the way he said it _
lyrical yet substantive, entertaining even, even at his most
serious. Rather than the pompous diatribes that dominated public
speaking of the day and before, he brought a preacher's sensibility
to the secular arena, uttering passages that burned into the memory
regardless of education, race or social standing. He could make his
call to nonviolent arms heard everywhere, even in the limited news
window of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense this guy had a certain Moses-like quality,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mythical, when this nation still allowed for mythical figures, a
time when we did not know _ or care _ if our president wore boxers
or briefs, and the national news was contained to 22 minutes a
night on each of the three networks, not 24 hours a day across the
cable dial.
</P>
<P>
   The thought creates an interesting hypothetical on the day we
honor the slain civil rights leader: Would King's impact on
television, and in general, have been diluted if today's media
environment existed in, say, 1963? Would his words have had such an
impact if delivered on ``Geraldo'' or ``Charlie Rose'' instead of
in front of thousands at outdoor rallies?
</P>
<P>
   Even at his most eloquent, would the nation merely shrug and
say, ``There is that guy again,'' before flipping over to
``Bonanza''? And one wonders if the crush of talking-head
round-table shows and television news magazines and the tabloids
and talk radio would have allowed King to achieve what he
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   How long would it have been before he was just another joke on
Leno? A guess: We would have known more then about Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. We would just have so much less now.

<P>
   The last of the great Aqua Net abusers, Miss Graham was not only
a television legend as the host of ``Girl Talk'' in the 1960s, but
also the keeper of the bouffant flame. Decades after the fall of
helmet hair, she lacquered her tresses into an abstract form
resembling a Dairy Queen soft-serve crossed with the Nike swoosh.
</P>
<P>
   It was something to behold, and as much a key to her appeal as
her rapid-fire ability to turn a phrase. I met her twice: once to
ask her about Barbara Bush's influence on fashion _ ``She might be
a  &UR; roll &LR;  model,'' Miss Graham said at the time _ and once when she
was trying a comeback as the host of a radio call-in show. Miss
Graham did the show by phone from her lavender bedroom sitting on
the edge of her coverlet-draped bed, as perfectly coifed and
fashionably dressed as if she were on television.
</P>
<P>
   That's dedication.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what the razor-sharp woman in the high-rise do would
say about Terry Ventura, the unassuming, down-to-earth new first
lady of Minnesota. The other day Ms. Ventura, the wife of Jesse
Ventura, the professional wrestler turned governor, said she'd been
feeling pressure to change her hairstyle, citing a letter to a
gossip columnist. Her hair is dark and long, and as au naturel as
Miss Graham's was artificial. ``My mom said, `Well, do you like
your hair?' and I said, `Yes, it keeps me warm in the wintertime,''
Ms. Ventura said. And that, at least for the time being, was that.
</P>
<P>
   While Miss Graham's hair was Space Age, Ms. Ventura's is the
future. Her practicality doesn't bode well for high style, but her
candor and self-deprecatory nature are so genuine that they're
irresistible to the great mass of people, particularly those who
elected her husband.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Ventura doesn't bow to makeover madness _ and there is a
sense that she won't _ it will speak volumes about where America
is, stylewise, in 1999. In an era of telecommuting and online
shopping, people don't have the kind of commitment to style that it
took for someone like Miss Graham to wear a hairdo that required
not only a weekly wash and set, but also a certain sleep posture to
preserve its lusciousness between visits to a beautician. Hers was
a don't-try-this-at-home hairdo. Ms. Ventura's is do-it-yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Before the shock of Miss Graham's death had worn off, a postcard
arrived inviting me to Charivari on 57th Street _ to a bankruptcy
sale, as another family-owned fashion store falls by the wayside,
like the original Barneys in Chelsea. Charivari's demise, too,
signals the end of a fashion era, the last of a breed.
</P>
<P>
   Charivari was a place where you could happily spend $200 on a
polka-dot party shirt and feel as if you were getting every penny's
worth. It was a temple to fashion as Fashion, a salute to clothes
that called attention to themselves and the wearer. The people who
worked there were cute. The people who shopped there were cute. You
wanted to be one of them, or at least dress like them, in Claude
Montana, Yohji Yamamoto or Jean Paul Gaultier. It wasn't about
practicality. It was about feeling special, even if you couldn't
pay your Visa bill at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   With the passing of personal touchstones like Charivari and Miss
Graham, I am wont to say that fashion is over. The reply is
usually, ``How can you say that?'' followed by a litany of examples
of fashion's health: the many hours now devoted to it on
television, the plethora of stores offering tasteful clothes
accessible to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   But as someone who believes that fashion's most alluring
characteristics are its mystery and its exclusivity, I find myself
quoting Yogi Berra: ``Nobody goes there anymore _ it's too
crowded.'' My friends are saving to buy homes now, or to put their
children through college 15 years into the new millennium. They're
no longer making the scene; they're making dinner at home and
watching ``All in the Family'' reruns on TV Land and ``Laverne and
Shirley'' on Nick at Nite.
</P>
<P>
   In a populist world of Banana Republic, Club Monaco and Zara
International _ when Gap khakis and a black J. Crew cashmere
turtleneck can get you through almost any occasion _ fashion for
fashion's sake is over.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Ventura's attitude prevails: If it keeps you warm in
wintertime, it's enough. Still, I'm going to miss that big head of
bulletproof hair on Miss Graham, and that rent-money shirt I
gleefully bought so long ago at Charivari. We won't see their likes
again. Impractical they were. Marvelously impractical.

 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ Maury Willman says her start-up ergonomics
company is receiving valuable services from a local business
incubator group, even if they don't include one usual benefit:
office space at reduced rents.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group, the Fort Collins Virtual Business
Incubator, started in March and is intended to nurture new
companies and help create jobs in this city of 110,000 at the foot
of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Through it, Ms. Willman's company, Ergonomic Health Systems,
obtains the services of a lawyer, an accountant and a marketing
firm at one-fourth their usual fees, as well as free managerial
advice and encouragement from volunteer experts and business
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I got into the incubator, to surround myself with
knowledge and excitement,'' said Ms. Willman, 41.
</P>
<P>
   What she does not get from the incubator is a place to run her
company. Unlike more traditional business incubators, which provide
low-rent floor space, often in factories or warehouses left vacant
after larger companies move out, the Fort Collins group is an
``incubator without walls.'' It does not deal in real estate _ a
policy that has resulted in both praise and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 550 incubators in the United States, up from 12
in 1980, according to the National Business Incubation Association.
It says the groups have nurtured nearly 19,000 companies that now
employ more than 245,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify as a business incubator _ as opposed to another kind
of business development program _ a group must employ a manager,
provide a comprehensive assistance program and require clients to
graduate _ to operate eventually without the program's help.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 of the newest programs are incubators without walls,
like the one in Fort Collins, said Susie McKinnon, the
association's director of member services.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willman and her partner, Robin Herron, a Colorado State
University expert on ergonomics, develop and sell software to help
companies improve workplace safety and prevent health problems like
repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the business moved from Ms. Willman's home into a
1,000-square-foot ground-floor office on a busy street, College
Avenue, where the rent is $1,300 a month. Discount space from the
incubator would have been a big help, Ms. Willman said. Still, she
declared herself happy with the assistance she receives.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Kregel, director of the Fort Collins incubator, said she
is glad she needn't worry about mortgage payments and empty real
estate. ``We are very selective,'' Ms. Kregel said of the committee
that approves start-up clients for the incubator. ``I have
definitely turned down some candidates. If I was sitting on a big
mortgage, I might not be doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   By not offering floor space, the virtual incubator is also
avoiding the problems that shut the Eastview Technology Center, a
high-technology incubator in Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Its landlord, the White Plains school board, has sued the
center's management company, seeking $450,000 in back rent. A
countersuit, seeking $659,000, contends that the school district
reneged on an agreement to provide adequate space. The start-up
companies in the center had to move out last November.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator in Fort Collins is a joint project of the city,
Colorado State University and the Fort Collins Economic Development
Corp. The city, the university, local businesses and the state have
each contributed $15,000 to defray the first year's costs. But not
everyone in town thinks the money has been well spent.
</P>
<P>
   Donald C. Bishop, a high-technology recruiter and business
consultant in Fort Collins, says the incubator is merely a channel
for recruiting new clients for local banks and professional firms.
A big problem for start-ups is raising capital for real estate,
personnel and equipment, he said, but the incubator offers ``no
facilities, no real cash, so it is a major failure as an
incubator.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients of the incubator disagree. Kristin Romberg, director of
sales for Infusion Technologies, which makes custom software for
call centers like those used by telemarketing and customer-service
units, said the incubator's services were ``a tremendous value''
for the company. ``They have even gone and talked to venture
capitalists for us,'' she said. In September, she added, Infusion
signed its first big contract with a call-center operator, for
$375,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Bruno, an assistant city manager in Fort Collins who wrote
the original plan for the incubator, said he had initially hoped it
would provide office and laboratory space, but there was not enough
money to do so. Now the incubator is better off without real
estate, he said, because ``we're much more focused on the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   A sharp focus has brought rapid growth to the Central Florida
Innovation Corp., a three-year-old virtual incubator in Orlando,
with a 1999 budget of $1 million and a selective approach to
helping technology start-ups. If prospective clients are not
expecting annual revenues of at least $2 million in two years,
``they're thinking small, and that's a disqualifier,'' said Richard
Fox, the incubator's president.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors include the city of Orlando and the University of
Central Florida. Three big companies that operate in the area _
Lockheed Martin, Thermo Electron and Nationsbank _ contribute to
the budget. The incubator wants to help create businesses with $1
billion in revenue by 2002, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   It has raised $57 million in out-of-state venture capital,
mostly for Triton Network Systems, which uses Lockheed Martin
technology in a high-speed wireless system for transmitting data.
In a year and a half, the company has grown to employ 77 people; it
occupies 37,000 square feet of its own space.
</P>
<P>
   Brick-and-mortar incubators still have fans. Jerry Donahue,
executive director of the Boulder Technology Incubator in Colorado,
with 15 resident clients in two sites, said, ``I prefer to have
them in our facilities, where I can do more for them, because
you're seeing each other every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinah Adkins, executive director of the National Business
Incubation Association, said another benefit of close proximity is
that clients learn more from one another in a ``synergistic
environment.'' And the clients' rent payments, even if below market
rates, are a useful flow of revenue, helping to keep incubators in
business when subsidy sources dry up, she said.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 17, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HOWLONG?-REVIEW (Washington) _ Whether they want to see
President Clinton driven from office or they have completely tuned
out the Senate trial, most Americans agree on one thing: they want
it to be over. But the dissection of the the Lewinsky affair will
continue at least as long as the Senate trial grinds on and maybe a
lot longer than that. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   FLYNT-BARR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Porn publisher Larry Flynt has
shown that he can get the mainstream media to give him a platform
in exposing the sexual misconduct of conservative Republicans. But
it is also clear that, unless the target of his attacks responds
and thus makes news himself, self-appointed newsmakers like Flynt
can't necessarily keep the press' attention very long. His
accusations against Rep. Bob Barr received relatively little news
coverage. By Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   FIDGETING-CALORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Old-fashioned fidgeting _
tapping your pencil against a conference table in a make-or-break
meeting, jiggling your leg while gabbing on the phone, pacing back
and forth behind your desk _ may emerge as a new weight-control
strategy. That seems to be a major implication of a Mayo Clinic
study that sought to explain why some people can eat anything and
everything and not gain an ounce, while others bulk up with every
swallow. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT-SECURITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Airport security can
leave passengers feeling insecure. Checkpoint screeners miss
weapons that undercover testers hide under their clothes, or they
notice them but do nothing. Ticket agents forget to ask if
passengers are carrying packages from strangers, or fail to react
properly if the answer is yes. Airport employees don't single out
passengers who buy tickets with cash at the last minute or
otherwise act suspiciously. Ground crews leave airplanes unlocked
and unattended, giving intruders an opportunity to plant a weapon
or a bomb. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   STANDARDIZED-TESTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Standardized reading tests
in New York and other states raise questions about the difficulties
of placing a yardstick against the wide range of development of
students so young _ and about whether their ability to deconstruct
a fable, which was included in the New York test, is an appropriate
benchmark and predictor of future success. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-ANALOGIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Not every sports star can be
called another Michael Jordan. There's no Michael Jordan of golf
because there's a Tiger Woods of golf. Olympic gold gave freestyle
skier Jonny Moseley so much cachet that he doesn't need anybody
else's famous name. So here's a guide to Jordans still at work.
Meet the Michael Jordan of ... .
</P>
<P>
   TRAFICANT-SPEECHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Rep. James Traficant,
D-Ohio, is a pro-labor, pro-school prayer ex-county sheriff
congressman who has turned the House's traditional one-minute
speech into a personal trademark and art form. A look at some of
his mini-addresses.
</P>
<P>
   DEAD-MAN-WHINING-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ A look into a heated
dispute between actor Sean Penn and 20th Century Fox over the use
of a corporate jet. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-LEGACY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Brazil has been attracting
treasure hunters of all stripes for centuries. From the Portuguese
who colonized it beginning in the 16th century to the Wall St.
money managers who made it a darling of emerging-market investors
in the 1990s, Brazil's economic promise is a perennial lure. But,
as Brazilians like to joke, theirs is the country of the future _
and always will be. By Timothy L O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   EXEC-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the global economy spawns more
mergers between American and foreign companies, discrepancies in
the pay of top executives from each country quickly become
apparent. Then the pay of key officers of the merging companies
typically rises to the higher denominator, and American-style
capitalism claims a little more foreign turf. But is the American
way of compensating top executives _ with opportunity for
tremendous riches from bonuses and incentives tied to a rising
stock price _ better? By Adam Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM-REVIEW (Washington) _ The United Nations Special
Commission, charged with disarming Iraq after the 1991 gulf war,
became an international intelligence service for the new world
order. It was the first of its kind _ and, it now seems, maybe the
last. For the more secret its work became, and the more estranged
the enforcers of disarmament grew from each other, the less Unscom
could withstand accusations of serving the last superpower, its
main supplier of spycraft: the United States. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-REVIEW (Miami) _ One year after Pope John Paul II visited
Cuba and urged the island nation to open itself up to freedom and
to the outside world, the Cuban government has made little progress
in improving its record on human rights, religious freedom and
economic reforms. By Larry Rohter.

   FLA-CLAY-HOTEL-COX (West palm Beach) _ At the Clay Hotel, in the

A whisper among the banana trees _ ``I'll see your hundred and
raise you two more.''

section of natural history in the Wind River Range. By Todd Mason.
</P>
<P>
   TINSELTOWN-THEMEPARK (Anaheim, Calif.) _ One of the strangest
and most revealing spectacles the entertainment business has ever
created is Tinseltown, a new theme park and dinner theater complex

   BRAZIL-LEGACY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Brazil has been attracting
treasure hunters of all stripes for centuries. From the Portuguese
who colonized it beginning in the 16th century to the Wall St.
money managers who made it a darling of emerging-market investors
in the 1990s, Brazil's economic promise is a perennial lure. But,
as Brazilians like to joke, theirs is the country of the future _

<P>
   EXEC-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the global economy spawns more
mergers between American and foreign companies, discrepancies in
the pay of top executives from each country quickly become
apparent. Then the pay of key officers of the merging companies
typically rises to the higher denominator, and American-style
capitalism claims a little more foreign turf. But is the American
way of compensating top executives _ with opportunity for
tremendous riches from bonuses and incentives tied to a rising
stock price _ better? By Adam Bryant.

<P>
   UNSCOM-REVIEW (Washington) _ The United Nations Special
Commission, charged with disarming Iraq after the 1991 gulf war,
became an international intelligence service for the new world
order. It was the first of its kind _ and, it now seems, maybe the
last. For the more secret its work became, and the more estranged
the enforcers of disarmament grew from each other, the less Unscom
could withstand accusations of serving the last superpower, its
main supplier of spycraft: the United States. By Tim Weiner.

   CUBA-REVIEW (Miami) _ One year after Pope John Paul II visited
Cuba and urged the island nation to open itself up to freedom and

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ashley Judd had been in the studio earlier in the
day, and it sounded as if she had been a handful.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked for water, and it had to be 72 degrees,'' said a
blond amanuensis to Patrick Demarchelier, the celebrity
photographer. The young man wore a black T-shirt, black pants, a
Rolex watch. ``So we had to put it in the microwave, because it was
cold,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``My, my,'' said another, also wearing black and a Rolex. ``I
would have just put it under my armpit for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Demarchelier was nowhere within earshot at his studio
on Thursday evening. Whether shooting Evander Holyfield or Madonna,
Demarchelier's modus operandi is to make models happy.
</P>
<P>
   Now 55, he has created ad campaigns for Brooks Brothers and
photographed Brooke Shields for Playboy (she kept her clothes on).
He shot an almost-nude Janet Jackson, a man covering her breasts
from behind, for Rolling Stone and created a portrait series of
Diana, Princess of Wales, for Harper's Bazaar. He is as ropy as
beef jerky, and his eyebrows run amok across his tanned forehead.
His French accent is so thick that VH-1 once ran an interview with
him, speaking in English, with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Demarchelier just had come back from a month in St. Barthelemy.
Now, at 7 p.m. in his office, pellets of snow tinkled against the
windows behind his desk, which was scattered with a picture of him
with Donald J. Trump, Lauren Hutton's phone number and a bill from
Rizzoli for $25,000 and change. He sighed and began his night's
work: a four-hour shoot of the Siberian model Irina Pantaeva for a
Saks Fifth Avenue catalog. (His workdays often begin at 9 a.m. and
end at 11 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   First, everyone had to eat. The assistants, hairdresser,
publicity agent and the makeup artist Laura Mercier sat down to a
dinner of sushi, seafood risotto, grilled chicken and fried
calamari. Gathered around a long table, the group, clad in black
except for the terry-robed Ms. Pantaeva, resembled a French Fellini
family. Then Ms. Pantaeva got up. Behind a screen, she discarded
her robe, slipped on a Tse cashmere sweater and linen pants and
emerged for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful!  &UR; Genial! &LR;  Baby! Genius!'' Ms. Mercier shouted,
mimicking Demarchelier's usual cries, as the wind machine ruffled
Ms. Pantaeva's long dark hair and he clicked the shutter. At 9
p.m., the gallery owner Tony Shafrazi wandered in, wearing a
double-breasted flannel suit. Demarchelier took a break to discuss
the placement of his work in a show, ``Patrick Demarchelier: New
Photographs,'' which will go up at the Shafrazi Gallery on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like cinema,'' Shafrazi said, gesturing at a tiny
model of the gallery set up in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it will be beautiful,'' Demarchelier said, admiring
pictures of Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Hopper and other famous faces.
Shafrazi picked at leftovers. Ms. Pantaeva, on her way to change
outfits, said to him, ``There's sushi, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking up at her, Shafrazi said a word that sounded like,
``French?''
</P>
<P>
   ``French sushi?'' she asked back.
</P>
<P>
   They paused, considering whether French sushi was so new they
had not heard of it, then shook their heads. ``Fresh,'' he said.
``I said fresh!''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed. Demarchelier ran a hand through his curls.
``Crazy,'' he said, snapping away.

`VIRUS': AT LEAST THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE WORTH CATCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long on adrenaline and special effects as it is short on
genuine novelty and intellectual content, ``Virus'' can at least
lay claim to being the sci-fi thriller that literally takes the
Frankenstein story to new heights and uncharted depths.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a comic book and reminiscent of predecessors like
``Alien'' and last January's ``Deep Rising,'' this film pits the
scruffy, mostly American 10-member crew of an ocean-going tug
against something deadly that arrives from outer space via the Mir
space station. It's ``lightning that can think _ a new life form,''
in the words of Nadia (Joanna Pacula), the chief science officer
and sole whole survivor aboard the Russian research vessel that has
been invaded by it.
</P>
<P>
   In the bowels of this high-tech ship as it lies dead in the
water in the eye of a typhoon, ill-tempered, clacking, whirring,
spying robots of all sizes are busily plundering bodies for body
parts. To the new life forms, it is the humans who are the virus _
invasive and destructive.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the tug's crew to do when their mates begin to
vanish and an anchor, dropped with murderous intent, sinks their
ship? Do they argue among themselves? Die grisly deaths? Wind up in
the robotic chop shop and reappear minus a few organs and plus a
few components? Find weapons, blast away and try to devise ways to
save their lives before it's too late? And maybe save mankind too?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the director, John Bruno, a special-effects expert
who has worked on films from ``Titanic'' and ``Terminator 2:
Judgment Day'' to ``The Abyss,'' for which he won an Academy Award,
knows enough to keep the drivel flowing too quickly for anyone to
slump unconscious over their popcorn and sticky soda with a bad
case of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   And he has wisely hired leading players who know their way
around such fare: Donald Sutherland as a desperately greedy,
soon-to-be-wacko tugboat captain facing financial ruin and seeing a
$30 million salvage payday if he can bring the research ship to
port with none of the original crew alive; Jamie Lee Curtis as an
admiral's daughter who just happens to be the tug's navigator, and
William Baldwin as the stalwart chief of the tug's engine room
crew.
</P>
<P>
   If you can read this, you know the ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virus'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes disfigured people, gore, medical
procedures, violence and impolite language.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:

 &HT;    CLINTON OFFERS NEW PLAN TO AID INNER CITIES AND IMPOVERISHED
RURAL AREAS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton, basking in the praise of Jesse
Jackson and captains of commerce, observed Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday Friday with a proposal to channel credit and capital to
the impoverished inner cities and rural communities of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the economy is so good, now is the time to build that
bridge,'' Clinton told the hundreds of business executives gathered
for Jackson's Wall Street Project conference. ``If we can't do it
now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it? If there
was ever a time when none of us have an excuse, this is that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the uncertainty in foreign markets, Clinton said American
businesses need to be looking for new markets and new customers.
``And the largest pool of untapped investment opportunities and new
customers are not beyond our shores _ they're in our backyard,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal previewed by the president _ it will also be
included in his State of the Union speech next week _ requires
congressional approval. And Congress is busy considering whether to
remove the president from office for allegedly violating his
constitutional oath.
</P>
<P>
   During the event, held on the 106th floor of the World Trade
Building, Clinton did not mention his impeachment trial. But after
an impromptu series of testimonials hastily arranged by Jackson
before the president's speech, Clinton jokingly compared the praise
to a funeral eulogy. He laughingly added, ``I don't think we're
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``New Markets Initiative'' would create a partnership
between private investors and the federal government through the
Small Business Administration, the Treasury Department and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it would be modeled after the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC), which provides government backing
for risky private investments abroad. Under the proposal, firms
investing in inner cities and rural areas would be eligible for
government guarantees of twice their investment.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed tax credits worth up to 25 percent
for companies that invest in a wide range of economic vehicles in
rural communities and inner cities, including community development
banks and an SBA pilot program to provide financing for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the program could require $1
billion in federal funds, but they estimated that the initiative
could generate as much as $15 billion in economically distressed
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The government funding would require congressional approval, and
Clinton urged the business leaders to lobby Congress to approve the
measure. ``This ought to be an American issue. We all have a stake
in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a seldom quoted portion of King's ``I Have A Dream''
speech about the ``vaults of opportunity'' in America, Clinton
said, ``Today, those vaults of opportunity are richer and fuller
than they ever have been. Wall Street has helped to make that so.
Now what we need to do is to open those vaults up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not care if the Republican majority in
Congress took credit for the initiative. ``If I thought it would
pass it, I would be glad to call it the Herbert Hoover-Calvin
Coolidge-Warren Harding Economic Development Act,'' he quipped. ``I
will do anything to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president praised Jackson for organizing the Wall Street
Project, now in its second year. He said he was especially
gratified that Jackson had used the event to focus attention on the
economic stress in Appalachia as well as the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how ``sobering'' it was when he became governor of
Arkansas two decades ago to see the level of poverty in the Ozarks
of his home state. ``It's all the more sobering that it hasn't
changed all that much in a lot of rural America,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in his introduction of the president, praised Clinton
for his efforts to ``help us build a bridge ... from Wall Street to
Appalachia and Harlem.'' And, alluding to the impeachment
proceedings in Congress, Jackson compared the president to King. He
said both had undertaken the task of ``making crooked ways
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Chairman Michael Armstrong and Richard Grasso, head of the
New York Stock Exchange, were among those Jackson tapped at the
last minute to deliver testimonials in praise of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said that because the president had made ``the tough
decisions'' in balancing the federal budget, ``a lot of us in our
businesses look awfully smart.''
</P>
<P>
   He used Jackson's conference to announce a new $1 billion AT&AMP;T
bond offering, to be co-managed by a minority firm. He said the
Wall Street Project is ``absolutely the right project at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso, noting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had tripled
during Clinton's presidency, said much of Wall Street's success was
due to ``our great president, William Jefferson Clinton.''

A THINKING DIRECTOR'S HORROR MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Neil Jordan does not need to make horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most acclaimed directors, the 49-year-old
Irishman's resume boasts a box-office blockbuster, an art-house
phenomenon and an admired run of films about his country's troubled
society and larger-than-life characters.
</P>
<P>
   A successful fiction writer as well, Jordan won an Oscar for
scripting ``The Crying Game.'' And although he isn't a painter like
his mother and two sisters, Jordan is known for the resonant visual
richness and complexity he brings to every film, regardless of
whether it's an obsessive love story like ``Mona Lisa'' or a
historical epic such as ``Michael Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's reputation is so sterling, in fact, that even the
barely seen ``The Butcher Boy,'' a film about a cute Irish kid who
turns into a homicidal maniac that even he admits is uncompromising
and disturbing in the extreme, was listed by many critics as one of
last year's best.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Jordan lacks neither work offers nor artistic
freedom. So why go back to the disreputable fright-film genre for a
third time with his new movie, ``In Dreams''?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps out of affection. ``The Company of Wolves,'' his 1984
second feature and the one that established Jordan as a world-class
filmmaker, examined the psychological and mythic dimensions of
werewolf legends, while ``Interview With the Vampire'' (1994) was
his biggest commercial hit. Not surprising, then, that when Jordan
speaks about horror movies, he sounds like somebody trying to save
some wayward thing that's very precious to them _ which is, after
all, the same thing most of his films are about.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fascinated me about `In Dreams' was the possibility of
doing a horror movie that was far more psychologically based than
the things that you see nowadays,'' Jordan says while taking
afternoon tea at an elegant Beverly Hills hotel. ``It was a bit
like `Don't Look Now' or that Polanski movie `Repulsion.' There was
this possibility there of creating this world of inner dread _ of
mental terror, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Bari Wood's novel, ``Doll's Eyes,'' ``In Dreams''
charts the psychic connection between a children's book illustrator
(Annette Bening's Claire Cooper) and a mad child killer named
Vivian (Robert Downey Jr.). When Claire's own daughter falls victim
to the lunatic, she tries to track him down the best way she knows
how to: by letting his increasingly intense ESP overtures deeper
into her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a downside to this strategy. Claire risks
going as nuts as Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show how seriously terrifying different mental
worlds can be,'' Jordan says, rubbing dark strands of flyaway hair
all around his forehead. ``In a way, Claire has to sacrifice
herself in order to eliminate this monster that Vivian has become.
To even find out where he is, she has to surrender herself to him.
It's almost like an act of sex, in a way; she has to give herself
up to these bloody dreams that he's imposing on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were lovely ironies in it, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Which should not be confused with the kind of ``air-quote''
irony so prevalent in horror movies these days.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Scream' and all those Wes Craven movies are very witty, but
they've become a joke,'' he says. ``I basically feel that there's
room for a terrifying film that takes itself seriously. It's been
quite a while since one of those hasn't had its tongue stuck in its
cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some critics have found aspects of ``In Dreams'' kind
of goofy. Its visual reliance on apples _ lots of apples _ for
instance (although that motif is more than counterbalanced by the
eerily lyrical scenes shot in an underwater town, which were filmed
in the same huge Mexican tanks as ``Titanic'').
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Downey's performance, a grab-bag of psychosexual
pathologies that makes Norman Bates, Hannibal Lecter and Chucky the
demon doll all seem well-adjusted by comparison. Some will find it
laughable, others daring and admirable, but it was cCD%91y the
result of some very hard, concentrated work.
</P>
<P>
   Which was exactly what Jordan intended. While ``In Dreams'' was
filming in the fall of 1997, Downey was sentenced to jail for
violating probation conditions of a widely publicized, drug-related
court ruling. Jordan says he wasn't unduly concerned about that _
according to him, the judge in the case agreed to delay Downey's
incarceration until principal photography was completed.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't taking any chances, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have our problems,'' Jordan says, shrugging. ``I know I
have; I've just never been in that extreme a situation. But when we
began to work, Robert was fine like I knew he would be. I think
boredom can drive anybody to distractions, and I knew he wouldn't
be bored on this movie. Y'know, if you're doing one of those big,
huge-budget things, people go to the trees, don't they? But for
this, there was something for Robert to do every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds supernaturally calm, doesn't he? Evidently, it's not an
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil excels at being able to inspire fantastic teams of people
in a way that is not dictatorial or foot-stamping, which is how a
lot of directors I've had to work with in the past think is the way
to do it,'' says Englishman Stephen Woolley, who has produced all
of Jordan's films since ``Company of Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's personal life is only slightly less orderly than his
on-set demeanor. There are two daughters from a failed marriage and
three sons with partner Brenda Rawn. He lives in Dublin, where he
was raised in a religious, intellectually nurturing household _ and
far away from the pressure-cooker industry centers of L.A. and
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, I had a very happy childhood,'' Jordan says. Then,
anticipating the next question without missing a beat, he adds,
``Where does this weird stuff come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeah. Not just the interest in substantially scary movies,
but things like Jaye Davidson's big ``Crying Game'' secret and
Sinead O'Connor as the Virgin Mary in ``Butcher Boy,'' among
numerous other outrageous acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must go to a psychiatrist, actually; I don't know where it
comes from,'' the never-analyzed Jordan jokes. ``Maybe it's because
I used to be very religious as a child, obsessed with another
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, maybe it's because me father used to always tell
me ghost stories. He came from a rural background, he was a
schoolteacher, and he was obsessed with stories about possession
and transmigration, all these Irish folk tales. I was filled with
them from the age when I began to learn to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   We might have something here. Perhaps Neil Jordan does need to
make horror movies, but for reasons that go a lot deeper than your
average frightmeisters' do.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of movies can be seen as trash,'' Woolley
observes, ``but I think Neil wants to make them something he could
still be proud of in 50 years and make an audience feel good about
what they're seeing. You could very easily dismiss a type of film
like `In Dreams,' but I think it's made with a great sense of
beauty and a great sense of care.'' &QL;

&HT;        PA. LAWMAKERS CRAFTING LEGISLATION TO CURB CHEAP FOREIGN
STEEL IMPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 -- Pennsylvania officials, disappointed with
President Clinton's plan to curb the surge of cheap foreign steel
imports, are preparing to announce what they describe as a
``tougher'' strategy next week.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Arlen Specter, Rick Santorum and lawmakers from
other steel-producing states plan to tackle the problem through
legislation they will propose Wednesday to coincide with a ``Stand
Up for Steel,'' rally in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, chair of the Senate Steel Caucus, said the plan is
still in the works, but may include measures that set quotas on
steel imports or charge duties to countries that sell their product
too cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procedures we have under our international trade laws are
very cumbersome,'' Specter said. ``They take months and months and
months to work through, and by that time, thousands of steel
workers have lost their jobs and tremendous losses are sustained by
the steel industry.'' The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to
issue a preliminary decision in mid-February on whether Japan,
Russia, and Brazil are engaged in steel ``dumping'' -- selling
their product for below production cost, or below what it sells for
in its home market. The duty would make up the difference between
the ``dumped'' price and the market price to take away the
incentive for the country to sell their product so cheaply that
domestic companies can't compete, Specter said. The Clinton
administration's plan to combat the surge, released earlier this
month, proposed $300 million in tax breaks for steel companies. But
many lawmakers from steel states and industry officials said the
White House proposal isn't strong enough to save U.S. steel jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania State Sen. John Wozniak was one of several
officials who had reservations about the Clinton plan. He
participated in a conference call to the White House Tuesday, along
with officials from other steel states, to urge quicker action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has been energetic in finding a
solution to the problem of steel dumping,'' said Wozniak, a
Democrat whose district includes Cambria, Clearfield, Somerset, and
Westmoreland. ``One of my concerns, however, is reaction time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report ordered by the last Congress, Clinton outlined his
plan, but did not call for quotas on steel imports or force nations
to adopt voluntary limits on the exports -- two measures pushed by
steel industry officials.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the administration has put anti-dumping
investigations on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   Steel industry officials in Pennsylvania and other states have
charged that foreign steel companies are selling their product so
cheaply that domestic companies can't compete and are having to cut
back in production.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign steel industry officials say they are not to blame.
Instead, they have pointed to other economic conditions as the
cause for the hard times on the domestic industry.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bitterly cold air mass responsible for the snow and ice that
plagued the Northeast for the past few days has retreated far to
the north, leaving most of the contiguous United States in
relatively mild conditions for the middle of January. A vigorous
west-to-east jet stream flow will keep arctic air locked in
northern Canada for the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   A fast-moving front with limited moisture will produce abundant
clouds and patchy precipitation through the Northeastern states.
Ahead of the front, milder breezes from the southwest will be
accompanied by spotty showers over the northern Ohio Valley and
eastern Great Lakes. Patchy freezing drizzle and bit of light snow
will precede the arrival of the milder air over northern parts of
New York and New England. The coastal Northeast will have some sun
before clouds increase Saturday afternoon. In the wake of the
front, a few snow showers will occur near the northern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Mild weather with ample sunshine will prevail from the
Southeastern states to the southern Plains as sprawling high
pressure moves off the Southeastern coast. Increasing breezes from
the southwest will draw very warm air into southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the latest in a series of Pacific fronts will bring
rain to the Northwest Coast. Locally heavy snow will fall in the
Cascades. Most winds from the west will promote snow along
west-facing mountain slopes from western Montana to northern parts
of Utah and Colorado. Meanwhile, high pressure will keep the
Southwest mainly dry and warm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Glittering Glaze
</P>
<P>
   Flashes of lightning caused the icy glaze on trees in parts of
New Jersey to sparkle early Friday as the unusual combination of a
thunderstorm with freezing rain was observed. Thunderstorms
typically form when air near the ground is warm and humid while the
temperature decreases rapidly with height. Freezing rain can occur
when a shallow layer of cold air hugs the surface while warmer air
lies above. Monday, the warm, humid air that fueled the
thunderstorms was few thousand feet above the ground. These
``elevated thunderstorms'' resulted in the glittering glaze.

`ZOE' A SORT OF `SEINFELD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The WB network sure knows how to attract teen and
post-college audiences, filling prime time with earnest young
adults on hit shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Charmed'' and ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 4-year-old network will tread new territory tonight (9
p.m., Channel 5) when it launches its first companion comedy show,
``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   You might say the WB is trying to create its own ``Seinfeld'' or
``Friends,'' and that's exactly what they've done with ``Zoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Seinfeld,'' ``Zoe'' is an observational show centered
around one character and three quirky friends that peels back
layers of life's minutiae. Like ``Friends,'' it features four
attractive people who hang out in a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   In this new sitcom, the characters are four teen-age
Manhattanites who attend the same private high school. New York
City is their playground, and the subway symbolizes freedom.
Boy-girl issues, parents and even dodge ball are among the everyday
life events that comprise their universe.
</P>
<P>
   The writing needs improvement. The first story, which had no
resolution, twice uses the same joke about Zoe not being able to
get a boyfriend over the roar of a subway.
</P>
<P>
   It did set up the characters well and signaled potential.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the show reaches its potential is to be seen, but it's a
good play in the network's game plan of depicting the world through
the eyes of people on their way to adulthood. And it's certainly a
major step forward for the WB, which has had some terrible
half-hour shows, including ``Alright Already,'' ``The Tom Show''
and ``The Army Show.'' And that's just in the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The four stars are Zoe (Selma Blair), the central character;
Duncan (David Moscow), the wacky lactose-intolerant one who is the
best bet to be a breakout star; Jack (Michael Rosenbaum), the Don
Juan type; and Jane (Azura Skye, the only real teen-ager in the
cast), Jack's twin sister.
</P>
<P>
   The show is far from perfect, but so was ``Seinfeld'' when it
debuted. The network believes in ``Zoe,'' which will give the show
time to find itself.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, on the comedy totem pole, ``Zoe'' is far closer to
``Friends'' than it is to ``The Army Show.'' &QL;

JAPANESE OFFICIALS WORRY STRONG YEN WILL STIFLE RECOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Last summer, Japanese financial authorities were
desperately trying to prop up their almost embarrassingly weak
currency. Lately, their dreams for a stronger yen have come all too
true.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Tuesday's government intervention in the currency
market, the yen is up 29 percent from early August and remains so
strong that it is harming the economy. While officials have seemed
somewhat relieved to see the value of the yen dipping again, the
strength of the currency has handed the government a new problem
just when it thought it was on its way toward stimulating the
economy with billions of dollars in taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with other problems, like a sinking stock market and a
sudden spike in long-term interest rates, the strong yen is
threatening to stifle any economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the yen stays strong, it will offset the positive impact of
the stimulus package,'' said Peter Morgan, economist at HSBC
Securities Ltd. in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yen traded at 114 to the dollar Friday, down from 108.93 on
Monday, but up from a nearly eight-year low of 147.35 in August. At
these levels, the yen is still strong enough to steal precious
growth from the economy and further sap energy from an incipient
rebound in other ailing Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cite numerous possible reasons for the greater demand
for yen. Japan has a strong surplus in its current account, which
measures the country's flow in goods and services, and this often
corresponds to a strong currency; the nation's banks are bringing
home their dollar loans and repatriating profits from abroad ahead
of their fiscal year-end book closing on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has forecast that the economy will grow
five-tenths of 1 percent in the 1999 fiscal year, which begins
April 1, but it has also acknowledged that nearly two-thirds of
that growth could be lost if the currency rises by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Private economists say that all the government's projected
growth could disappear if the yen rises by 10 percent for the year,
and they also take a much dimmer view of the economy for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to face a very, very hard landing,'' said a
central bank official, who refused to be identified. ``We are at
wits' end _ at the moment of final reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in long-term bond yields, which nearly doubled at one
point last year to more than 2 percent in just a couple of months,
is also disturbing many investors. Some rough estimates show that
an increase of 1 percentage point in interest rates takes away
about three-tenths of a percent in economic growth. At the same
time, stocks remain sluggish. The Nikkei index of 225 issues, which
rose just 5 percent in 1998, is down about seven-tenths of 1
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real risks here because the financial markets have
moved in an adverse direction,'' said Jeffrey D. Young, an
economist with Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. ``Equity markets, the
bond markets and the yen have all moved negatively for the Japanese
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet there have been confusing signals from senior government
officials. While some are alarmed that the strength of the yen will
make exports uncompetitive, others have suggested that the recent
strength is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense as a policy stance to be in favor of the
yen at these levels,'' said Richard Jerram, an economist with ING
Barings Securities (Japan) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Japan worried about potential trade frictions with
the United States if Japanese exports continued their dramatic
surge. And because Japanese exports tend to crowd out exports from
other Asian countries, a weak yen also threatened to scuttle the
export-driven rebound of other Asian economies, particularly South
Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. Japan did not want to be blamed for
setting off a round of competitive devaluations that could
ultimately erode profits everywhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the yen began to rally strongly in early October. Long-term
rates jumped in late December after Japan said that it would curb
the amount of public money used to absorb government bonds, and
rates jumped further when Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank
of Japan, the nation's central bank, suggested that he believed the
central bank was holding too many government bonds. Moreover,
Japan's ballooning budget deficit and the government's growing debt
burden, which are the costs of stimulating economic growth, have
led investors to expect higher long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential troubling issue is short-term rates. For now,
they have not risen, even though Japanese news reports have said
that the Bank of Japan may sell some of its short-term assets,
called financing bills. Economists said that such a move would end
up raising short-term interest rates, which would hurt financial
institutions and also raise the cost of borrowing throughout the
economy. They added that the central bank was unlikely to do so if
it put economic growth at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many economists say that the Bank of Japan may
ultimately be forced to pour more money into the economy,
essentially printing more yen. That strategy is about the only one
that has not been tried, but it has been taboo because it recalls
the postwar period of hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Teizo Taya, an economist with the Daiwa Institute of Research,
said that the Bank of Japan might be forced to print money, a move
that would weaken the yen and help bolster confidence and thereby
bring investors back into the stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a policy change could solve all three problems at once,''
he said.

IMPEACHMENT PUSHES CHARACTER ISSUE TO THE FOREFRONT IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Election Day 2000 is 22 months away, but thanks to
the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton, the question of
character is already a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   At least one conservative activist plans to insist that
prospective 2000 presidential candidates answer his questions on
character and sexual indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy cleansing process,'' said Rev. Lou Sheldon,
chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition. ``It's not
McCarthyism.'' The Coalition draws members from 40,000 evangelical
Christian churches around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But interest in the issue is not limited to the religious right.
In ballot-box exit polls last November, morality came in second as
the trait that mattered most to voters in deciding House races.
Eighteen percent of those polled named ``moral and ethical
standards'' as their top priority. Only education, traditionally a
key concern, ranked higher, with 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a Washington Post poll last month, 37 percent said their top
consideration in choosing a president will be the candidates'
stands on the issues. But 16 percent _ the second highest number _
said their primary criterion will be the candidates' personal
morals and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual peccadillos of presidential candidates have long been
campaign fodder. The most famous case of the last century came in
the 1884 campaign in which Grover Cleveland won the election
despite revelations that he had fathered an illegitimate child.
</P>
<P>
   Morality was an issue in 1988 when former Democratic Sen. Gary
Hart's chances fizzled amid reports of sexual romps with a model
named Donna Rice. Earlier, George W. Bush _ now governor of Texas _
defended his father, then Vice President George Bush, who was
running for president when rumors surfaced that he had had an
adulterous affair. George W. Bush said of the rumors: ``The answer
to the `big-A' question is N-O.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton himself in 1992 had to overcome reports of his
affair with Gennifer Flowers to win the Democratic nomination and
later the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts point out that elections are often thinly
veiled referendums on the current White House occupant. Disgusted
by the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard Nixon from
office in 1974, Americans turned to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in part
because he promised, ``I'll never lie to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, with Carter's presidency on the rocks because
of recession, gasoline lines and Iran's holding of American
hostages, voters turned to Ronald Reagan and his tough
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged as it is, the Clinton presidency may prove difficult to
judge, says Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American
University here. ``Nixon's and Carter's were failed presidencies,''
he said, adding, ``People may think what Clinton did was
reprehensible, but this is not a failed presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that throughout the year-long scandal over Clinton's
sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
the president's job-approval ratings have remained high.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's personal ratings have hit bottom. A Gannett Poll
last week showed that while 65 percent approved of Clinton's
stewardship as president, only 34 approved of him as a person.
</P>
<P>
   With the 2000 primary season approaching, Republicans can be
expected to put a premium on character. The early GOP presidential
possibilities include the younger Bush, former American Red Cross
president Elizabeth Dole, Arizona Sen. John McCain, former Vice
President Dan Quayle, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, House
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. Robert Smith of
New Hampshire and magazine publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has acknowledged some unspecified shortcomings earlier in
his life but insists those days are long over. McCain, a Vietnam
prisoner-of-war, and Dole, wife of 1996 GOP candidate Bob Dole,
have sterling personal reputations, and the others have been in the
public eye for years with nothing besmirching their backgrounds so
far.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats say privately they are relieved that
their leading contender, Vice President Al Gore, has a
straight-arrow personal reputation and that his chief potential
rivals, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, do too.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Republican consultant, Keith Appell of Alexandria,
Va., sees a possible ``pitfall'' for Gore in next year's campaign
because of his steadfast defense of Clinton throughout the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, however, argue that the morality issue, while
not necessarily helping their side, could work against Republicans.
Mark Mellman, a Washington-based Democratic pollster, said,
``There's a negative face on the Republican Party because they've
made clear they don't give a damn about the issues that matter to
the American people. They only want to get Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the focus on morality is expected to grow and its
impact is unclear. ``It may mean we'll have more boring
candidates,'' said James Thurber, director of the Center for
Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University.
``But maybe we need more boring candidates.''

   The lesson of Brazil's two devaluations last week is simple: If
you are invested in emerging markets, accept the roller-coaster
ride and commit only a small part of a well-diversified global
portfolio to them. Or get out and stay out until you are sure that
the uncertainty and volatility have settled down to a manageable
level.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened in Brazil last week is precisely the kind of
reversal that tempts some investors to ignore such advice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's right, two devaluations: A limited, 9 percent
devaluation on Wednesday, which sent the Brazilian stock market
down 14.5 percent in two days. And a full devaluation on Friday,
allowing the real to float freely. That made investors believe that
Brazil's high interest rates could fall, opening the way to a 29
percent rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It's anyone's guess what happens from here, though it is clear
that Brazil's problems are not over.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Lachman, the director of emerging-markets economic
research at Salomon Smith Barney, said the full devaluation was
positive because lower interest rates would slow the economic
decline that has started in Brazil. But he said the Friday rally
was in part a pop, because investors were caught expecting the
stock market to fall further. And he said the future depended on
whether the government could put in place the spending cuts and tax
changes still needed to reorganize the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is in a position to build around this devaluation,
Lachman said. ``But can they deliver on the budget?'' he asked.
``Can they get the implementation process back on track?''
</P>
<P>
   There is also uncertainty about how the United States and the
International Monetary Fund will react. The devaluation violated
Brazil's agreement with the IMF that brought the country $41.5
billion in aid last fall. But the IMF did say on Friday that
letting the real float freely was better than trying to defend a
limited devaluation. The devaluation also raises the threat of debt
defaults, because it increases Brazil's repayment costs.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Howe, vice president of the international equities
division of Bankers Trust, said he and his colleagues were waiting
to see what happened next. ``You certainly don't want to do it in a
rush,'' he said of jumping backing into Brazil and the rest of
Latin America. But then, Bankers Trust decided some time ago to
reduce its exposure to the region.
</P>
<P>
   That process began in June and July of last year. At the time,
Howe said, $250 million was invested in Latin American stocks
through Bankers Trust's international, emerging-market and Latin
American-focused funds. Now the amount, aside from the funds
dedicated to the region, is down to ``very little.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bankers Trust money managers were getting out, mutual fund
investors were fleeing, too. During the same period, there was a
net outflow of $661 million from Latin American funds followed by
AMG Data Services. That was 40 percent of the total decline in
assets in those funds. The rest was from the plunge in the stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bankers Trust and those risk-averse mutual fund investors
looked pretty smart until October and November, when Latin American
stock markets began to rebound in the wake of interest-rate cuts by
the Federal Reserve and the assembly of a $41.5 billion rescue
package for Brazil. Both moves helped stave off what investors
worldwide feared the most at the time: a devaluation of the
Brazilian currency.
</P>
<P>
   And up those Latin American markets went. The Morgan Stanley
Capital International index of Latin American funds surged 38.7
percent from its low on Sept. 10 to Jan. 7, the day Brazil's stock
market began the collapse that resulted in last week's currency
devaluations. Brazil's Bovespa index of 56 stocks climbed even more
_ 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the six trading days trough Thursday, Brazil was off 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Friday. But don't kick yourself too quickly for
missing the 32 percent rebound. That rally was in Brazil's suddenly
cheaper currency, the real. In dollar terms, the Friday gain was 21
percent. Or. put another way, the Brazilian market on Thursday was
down 31 percent in dollar terms for the year _ and after Friday's
rally was down just 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So Howe and many mutual fund investors who got out of Latin
America still look smart. ``It's been a very good move in the
end,'' Howe said. But he acknowledged that ``we were hurting in
October and November, when the markets moved up 40 percent or 50
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another twinge on Friday, but he still said, ``I don't
think you should have gotten too excited.''

   EBAY, up 1,240 percent. Ubid, up 611 percent. Broadcast.com, up
325 percent. Call the roll of the red-hot Internet stocks that made
their initial public offerings in 1998, and you might think it was
a great year for IPOs over all.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be wrong. According to the Securities Data Co., the
research firm in Newark, 191 of the 373 stocks first offered for
public trading in 1998 finished the year below their offering
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Bloomberg IPO Index, which measures new issues one year
from their offering, returned 12.8 percent last year, versus 28.6
percent for the broader market, as measured by the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index. And the average new offering had an 18.7
percent gain. But toss out Internet stocks, and that declines to
6.1 percent. Eliminate all technology offerings, and it declines to
an average loss of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a year of Internet blockbusters sprinkled with
insanity.com,'' joked John E. Fitzgibbon Jr., editor of the IPO
Reporter, an investment newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that last year's loser bin holds a bundle of cheap
stocks, many of them solid companies with good growth prospects.
``With the exception of Internet stocks, there's definitely more
value within the IPO market now than a year ago,'' said Robert
Gardiner, manager of the Wasatch Micro-Cap fund, which often buys
new issues.
</P>
<P>
   Why the underperformance? Take your pick of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of last year's losers came to market in July, just as the
markets started to wobble, said Gail Bronson, an analyst for IPO
Monitor, a Los Angeles research firm. It was also a year of
investor disinterest in small- and medium-capitalization stocks,
which form the lion's share of IPOs, said Edgar Larsen, chief
equity officer at AIM Management Group, a Houston fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Some offerings were too expensive to start with. ``That left
very little on the table for investors,'' said Linda Killian, a
portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital, an investment firm that
specializes in IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   As the new year begins, the bargains even include some Internet
stocks. One of Ms. Bronson's favorite stocks is Pilot Network
Services, which offers security services for commerce over the
Internet. The company has strong management and a strong business
model, she said, yet the the stock has fallen from its offering
price of $14 in August to $8.9375 on Dec. 31 and $12.75 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Pilot suffer? Ms. Bronson said she thought it was left
behind in the rush to sexier Internet stocks. The fact that some
people have trouble understanding how its business works didn't
help, nor did the overshadowing of Pilot by a rival, Network
Associates, which garnered attention with a string of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Steelcase Inc., the office furniture company, is one of last
year's losers that has puzzled some IPO experts. The company went
public in February at $28 per class A share and rose to $38.375,
but closed on Friday at $16.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Killian figures that Steelcase is simply a good company that
went public at a bad time, when the cyclical demand for office
furniture had slowed. She likes the company's valuation, now at
less that 11 times next year's estimated earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said his firm is expanding its holdings in Rainbow
Rentals Inc., which leases furniture, appliances and computers.
Rainbow went public at $10 a share in June, finished the year at
$9.875, and closed Friday at the same price. He estimates that
earnings will grow 15 percent to 20 percent annually over the next
few years. The stock trades at just 13 times estimated 1999
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner's fund is also expanding its position in Rainbow
Rentals, as well as in Marinemax, a power boat retailer that trades
at under ten times estimates of 1999 earnings and has earnings
growth of 20 percent annually. ``With this bunch, you don't have to
buy any problem companies,'' he said.

EARLY SIGNS SHOW ISRAELI CAMPAIGNS MAY HIT A NEW LOW

By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ So far, tomatoes have been tossed, death threats
uttered and sensitive documents swiped during a nighttime heist.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's election season has just begun and already the
mean-spiritedness, mudslinging and dirty tricks have reached a low,
even by Israel's standards, which tend to make U.S. election
campaign high jinks look mild.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, police arrested a 26-year-old security officer
assigned to guard Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor
Party, after a Shin Bet government security agent overheard the man
saying that ``someone should murder all the do-gooder Ashkenizi
Jews, including Ehud Barak.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former army chief of staff
running for prime minister on a new centrist ticket, went on the
campaign trail in an outdoor Tel Aviv market and was pelted with
tomatoes _ and a chicken leg _ before being whisked to safety by
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, someone broke into the offices of a
Washington-based polling firm hired to advise Barak in what police
described as a ``sophisticated operation.'' Confidential records of
Barak's election strategies were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, politicians often go for the jugular. Since his
election, for instance, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
repeatedly been called a ``liar'' by his political foes. But this
campaign year, the polemic between candidates for prime minister _
and there are many at this early stage in the race _ seems to have
reached a new caliber of nastiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are very tense, the atmosphere is tense,''
said Shmuel Sandler, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan University
who specializes in domestic Israeli politics. ``The campaign is
already (being waged) on a very personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, verbal attacks fly between Netanyahu and Barak,
the two main contenders for prime minister, who castigate each
other for what each alleges is the other's soft approach in
dealings with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring reached its lowest point last week when Danny
Naveh, one of Netanyahu's closest aides, urged Barak to call up
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and promise that, if
elected, he would make sweeping concessions in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Naveh publicly announced Arafat's office
telephone number, which was then swamped with abusive calls from
right-wing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Barak to shoot back. No one, he
suggested, wanted to see Netanyahu re-elected more than Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, the Palestinian
organization responsible for most suicide bombings in Israel.
Netanyahu, after all, was the one who let Yassin out of prison,
Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts attribute at least some of the mudslinging to the
fact that both Netanyahu and Barak have retained U.S. campaign
advisers to help run their campaigns
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Finkelstein, a political consultant who specializes in
Republican candidates, is working with Netanyahu. One of his
campaign ads pictures Barak with the quote: ``If I were a
Palestinian, I would join a terrorist organization.'' Last year,
Barak made the comment during an interview in which he suggested
that he could empathize with the Palestinians' struggle for
independence. Commentators chastised him afterward for appearing to
condone Palestinian violence, and gleeful Netanyahu supporters
relished the thought of using the gaff in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of U.S. advisers of his own, including
Democratic consultant James Carville, Barak has counterattacked.
His newest campaign slogan capitalizes on the frustration felt by a
majority of Israelis at the slow pace of peace, for which
Netanyahu's right-wing constituents are blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak for everyone,'' the slogan reads. ``Netanyahu for the
extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   And at every turn, Barak has reminded Israelis of the dismal
state of the economy, which has slumped since Netanyahu came to
power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for example, Israel had a growth rate of just 2
percent. Today, both unemployment and inflation hover around 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say negative campaigning is a catchy way to keep the
public's attention. But some say it may not be the best strategy,
particularly for Barak if he is trying to appeal to working-class
swing voters by assailing Netanyahu's dismal economic record.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his case, I think it can boomerang,'' said Sandler, the
political analyst at Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of voters who usually vote for Netanyahu are usually
more lower class,'' Sandler said. ``They will identify with
Netanyahu and think, `Here are Israel's elites attacking our poor
prime minister.'''
</P>
<P>
   With little to distinguish candidates whose parties have become
increasingly close on core questions of ideology and peacemaking
with the Palestinians, Sandler and others say that personality,
more than anything else, will determine the election results.
</P>
<P>
   That, they say, means that the mudslinging is unlikely to end
until the election runoff June 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Israelis will have to endure what is shaping up
to be a raucous five-months of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   And Israel's security establishment will have to contend with
the specter of violence against candidates, a haunting prospect
less than four years after Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by an
ultranationalist Jew.
</P>
<P>
   The security guard who threatened Barak wasn't the only one so
far to issue a death threat against a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During the tomato-throwing melee in the market, someone followed
close behind Lipkin-Shahak, the former chief of staff running for
prime minister, muttering, ``The next bullet will be in your
head,'' according to a guard defending him.

   POULTRY _ Russia's currency crisis and Asia's economic woes
gnawed into U.S. poultry exports last year, probably reducing sales
for the first time since 1984, according to a report from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. With less meat going overseas and
production growing, U.S. wholesale chicken prices could fall this
year, the USDA said. Until last August, U.S. exports of young
chickens to Russia, its biggest customer, hummed along at about
75,000 metric tons a month. But on Aug. 17, the ruble collapsed.
U.S. poultry shipments to the struggling country fell sharply,
putting overall exports on track to fall 4% for the year, said the
USDA. (Scott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) FOR SATURDAY

   SOCOM-PLANT _ Southern Co. (SO) will construct a simple-cycle
combustion turbine peaking power plant in Georgia. The facility is
scheduled for commerical operation by the summer of 2000. In a
press release Friday, the company said it is evaluating Jackson
County as a possible plant site. Since the facility will be
committed to the wholesale market, it will not affect electric
rates for Georgia Power customers. At least five generating units,
generating about 400 megawatts, are scheduled for 2000. To supply
additional anticipated wholesale power demand, Southern Company
plans to build a total of about 16 generating units at the site
over the next three years. (Quinn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   JANUARYSLUMP _With the new year under way, many people have
returned to work only to find that halfway through January, they're
still trying to shake off the holiday doldrums. But some find it
harder to shake off than the extra weight they may have put on.
This slump is psychological, physical, and seasonal, industrial
psychologists say. Cold temperatures and shorter days, less
sullight, aren't helping. How do you get back into the swing of
things? No. 1, make sure you're in a job you like, experts say.

   THARPE-COLUMN _ Think you know a lot about sports? Then answer
this: Why do professional athletes generally earn more than farmers
and steelworkers? Before answering, you need to understand it's an
economic question that was asked in a recent survey of consumers by
the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank. (Tharpe, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-TAXES _ Interest is growing in a first-class way to save
for a college education and defer taxes on those investments.
Hundreds of thousands of families now pour their money into the
plans, turning over the investment decisions to others in return
for tax deferred earnings. The strategy has some risks, as does
anything in life. But it has some uncommonly attractive features,
too. Georgia does not have such a plan, but Peach State residents
can enroll in the plans sponsored by New York, New Hampshire,
Delaware and a handful of other states. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   BLACKS-ADVICE _ Ken Chenault, president of American Express and
arguably the highest ranking African American in corporate America,
had some special
</P>
<P>
   encouragement for students at Clark Atlanta last week. It's time
to quit worrying about the attitudes of racists and others who
stand in their way. The simple alternative, he said, to do your
best, associate with smart and ambitious people, regardless of race
and push hard to make contributions. (Holsendolph, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-WEB _ The good thing about the Internet also is the bad
thing, if you're a parent. There is information on almost any topic
you can name out there for the taking. So parents often face this
worry: Do I let my kids have full use of the Web and take a chance
that they'll run into adult material or violence or even strangers
who are dangerous? Or do I shield them from all that and take the
chance that they won't do as well at school as their friends who do
use the Internet. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). FOR
SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   MODEMS _ Is broadband the way? And what is it the way to? Cable
modems are the high-speed route to the Internet. In metro Atlanta,
MediaOne is especially loud in pushing this. What is it like to get
and use a MediaOne cable modem? A look at the modem and customer
service, etc. from MediaOne. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). FOR
SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   SAVINGS _ U.S. Savings Bonds, an old-fashioned investment, have
gone electronic. Although they pay rates of return below most
private investments, millions have been purchased over the years
because of their simplicity as an investment and because of their
Uncle Sam-guaranteed safety. But for many would-be investors in the
past, there was a problem: How to buy Savings Bonds. They could buy
them through a bank or broker, or through payroll deduction at
work. But about 120 million Americans worked for companies without
payroll deduction for the bonds. Last month, the U.S. Treasury
initiated the EasySaver Plan for Savings Bonds, which allows
investors to buy the bonds by authorizing the agency to deduct a
set amount each month from their checking account to pay for them.

<P>
   POULTRY _ Russia's currency crisis and Asia's economic woes
gnawed into U.S. poultry exports last year, probably reducing sales
for the first time since 1984, according to a report from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. With less meat going overseas and
production growing, U.S. wholesale chicken prices could fall this
year, the USDA said. Until last August, U.S. exports of young
chickens to Russia, its biggest customer, hummed along at about
75,000 metric tons a month. But on Aug. 17, the ruble collapsed.
U.S. poultry shipments to the struggling country fell sharply,
putting overall exports on track to fall 4% for the year, said the
USDA. (Scott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) FOR SATURDAY

   SOCOM-PLANT _ Southern Co. (SO) will construct a simple-cycle
combustion turbine peaking power plant in Georgia. The facility is
scheduled for commerical operation by the summer of 2000. In a
press release Friday, the company said it is evaluating Jackson
County as a possible plant site. Since the facility will be
committed to the wholesale market, it will not affect electric
rates for Georgia Power customers. At least five generating units,
generating about 400 megawatts, are scheduled for 2000. To supply
additional anticipated wholesale power demand, Southern Company
plans to build a total of about 16 generating units at the site
over the next three years. (Quinn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   JANUARYSLUMP _With the new year under way, many people have
returned to work only to find that halfway through January, they're
still trying to shake off the holiday doldrums. But some find it
harder to shake off than the extra weight they may have put on.
This slump is psychological, physical, and seasonal, industrial
psychologists say. Cold temperatures and shorter days, less
sullight, aren't helping. How do you get back into the swing of
things? No. 1, make sure you're in a job you like, experts say.
Story w/ tipbox on how to motivate yourself. What management can do

   THARPE-COLUMN _ Think you know a lot about sports? Then answer
this: Why do professional athletes generally earn more than farmers
and steelworkers? Before answering, you need to understand it's an
economic question that was asked in a recent survey of consumers by
the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank. (Tharpe, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-TAXES _ Interest is growing in a first-class way to save
for a college education and defer taxes on those investments.
Hundreds of thousands of families now pour their money into the
plans, turning over the investment decisions to others in return
for tax deferred earnings. The strategy has some risks, as does
anything in life. But it has some uncommonly attractive features,
too. Georgia does not have such a plan, but Peach State residents
can enroll in the plans sponsored by New York, New Hampshire,
Delaware and a handful of other states. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   BLACKS-ADVICE _ Ken Chenault, president of American Express and
arguably the highest ranking African American in corporate America,
had some special
</P>
<P>
   encouragement for students at Clark Atlanta last week. It's time
to quit worrying about the attitudes of racists and others who
stand in their way. The simple alternative, he said, to do your
best, associate with smart and ambitious people, regardless of race
and push hard to make contributions. (Holsendolph, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-WEB _ The good thing about the Internet also is the bad
thing, if you're a parent. There is information on almost any topic
you can name out there for the taking. So parents often face this
worry: Do I let my kids have full use of the Web and take a chance
that they'll run into adult material or violence or even strangers
who are dangerous? Or do I shield them from all that and take the
chance that they won't do as well at school as their friends who do
use the Internet. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). FOR
SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   MODEMS _ Is broadband the way? And what is it the way to? Cable
modems are the high-speed route to the Internet. In metro Atlanta,
MediaOne is especially loud in pushing this. What is it like to get
and use a MediaOne cable modem? A look at the modem and customer
service, etc. from MediaOne. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). FOR
SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   SAVINGS _ U.S. Savings Bonds, an old-fashioned investment, have
gone electronic. Although they pay rates of return below most
private investments, millions have been purchased over the years
because of their simplicity as an investment and because of their
Uncle Sam-guaranteed safety. But for many would-be investors in the
past, there was a problem: How to buy Savings Bonds. They could buy
them through a bank or broker, or through payroll deduction at
work. But about 120 million Americans worked for companies without
payroll deduction for the bonds. Last month, the U.S. Treasury
initiated the EasySaver Plan for Savings Bonds, which allows
investors to buy the bonds by authorizing the agency to deduct a
set amount each month from their checking account to pay for them.

   FBN-NFC-REEVES _ When Dan Reeves took the Falcons job two years
ago, he knew he would be coming back to his home state of Georgia.
But he didn't realize the true impact of ``home'' until he was
forced five weeks ago to undergo heart bypass surgery. Because of
the Falcons' success, Reeves had a good number of Georgians in his
corner. But his emotional press conference post-surgery galvanized
the entire state. Reeves said the experience changed his outlook
because he never could imagine how many Georgians genuinely cared.
As he uses all his postseason experience to prepare for the biggest
game in Falcons history, he's living an unusual love story.

   OLY-IOC-HISTORY _ Tracing how the system of the IOC awarding
Summer and Winter Games to bid cities got to the mess it's in
today. It wasn't always this way, with Los Angeles getting the '84
Summer Games almost by default because no other city wanted it. But
when LA showed cities can profit in many ways from the Games, the
floodgates opened and IOC members took advantage by profiting from
the new era. Atlanta played the game in the mid-1980s, with
southern hospitality that included plenty of gift-giving and
privileges. And apparently Salt Lake took it to unprecedented
heights with what would be considered bribes. It remains to be seen
if some of Salt Lake's predecessors also crossed the line. Story
will offer new details on how Atlanta played the game, such as
first-class airline tickets that members cahsed in, and point out
that Atlanta apparently is not the focus on any investigation yet.

He is a friend of former mayor Andy Young and has had relationships
with several people close to Young. He received a marketing deal
with ACOP for African products at the Games. Ganga was at the very
least a contact for an Atlanta company trying to do business in the
Congo, as a result of a relationship made during the bid process.
And he still has ties to Atlanta, with he and Shirley Franklin
having set up the non-profit USA/Africa Sports Development Fund in
Georgia which is supposed to raise money to train African athletes

   FBN-NFC-REEVES _ When Dan Reeves took the Falcons job two years
ago, he knew he would be coming back to his home state of Georgia.
But he didn't realize the true impact of ``home'' until he was
forced five weeks ago to undergo heart bypass surgery. Because of
the Falcons' success, Reeves had a good number of Georgians in his
corner. But his emotional press conference post-surgery galvanized
the entire state. Reeves said the experience changed his outlook
because he never could imagine how many Georgians genuinely cared.
As he uses all his postseason experience to prepare for the biggest

   OLY-IOC-HISTORY _ Tracing how the system of the IOC awarding
Summer and Winter Games to bid cities got to the mess it's in
today. It wasn't always this way, with Los Angeles getting the '84
Summer Games almost by default because no other city wanted it. But
when LA showed cities can profit in many ways from the Games, the
floodgates opened and IOC members took advantage by profiting from
the new era. Atlanta played the game in the mid-1980s, with
southern hospitality that included plenty of gift-giving and
privileges. And apparently Salt Lake took it to unprecedented
heights with what would be considered bribes. It remains to be seen
if some of Salt Lake's predecessors also crossed the line. Story
will offer new details on how Atlanta played the game, such as
first-class airline tickets that members cahsed in, and point out
that Atlanta apparently is not the focus on any investigation yet.

He is a friend of former mayor Andy Young and has had relationships

Congo, as a result of a relationship made during the bid process.
And he still has ties to Atlanta, with he and Shirley Franklin

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it was fitting that a tumultuous event in academia seemed
to turn on a metaphor. Shortly before the Modern Language
Association's annual meeting, Elaine Showalter, the president,
informed her charges _ full-time professors, part-time professors
and graduate students in English and foreign languages _ that they
were on a sinking ship, the Titanic to be precise. Now there is a
bitter dispute about the lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Showalter's assessment was based on the MLA's survey of the
nearly 2,200 graduate students who got their degrees in English,
foreign languages, comparative literature, linguistics and classics
in the 1996-97 academic year. Only 33 percent of those in English
found tenure-track jobs within a year of finishing. Those in
foreign languages and comparative literature had slightly better
luck (about 40 percent got tenure-track jobs), while those in
linguistics and classics did worse (30 percent). The figures are
not only very close to the survival rates on the Titanic, but also
to what graduate students in other humanities face.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions that Ph.D.s and graduate students are in rough
straits: Even the MLA predicts that fewer than half of the 8,000
graduate students finishing between 1996 and 2000 will land
full-time, tenure-track jobs within a year of getting their Ph.D.s.
The fight is over what constitutes a lifeboat: the corporate world
or organized labor?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Showalter, a professor at Princeton University who is a
free-lance journalist on the side, suggested that scholars should
stop sniveling and start jumping into any other fields that will
take them. She is particularly fond of business.
</P>
<P>
   But many professors and graduate students argue that the only
hope for drowning scholars is to organize. As Marc Bousquet, an
assistant professor of English at the University of Louisville,
once put it, the problem is not an overproduction of
graduate-student labor but an underproduction of full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hiring more full-time professors, universities are
exploiting cheap graduate-student labor and part-time workers. The
use of part-time faculty almost doubled between 1970 and 1993,
according to the U.S. Department of Education. Now 47 percent of
the teaching positions in higher education are part-time, said Cary
Nelson, author of ``Manifesto of a Tenured Radical.'' That isn't
good, he said, for the teachers or for their students.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening evening of the MLA convention, held at the San
Francisco Hilton this year, the rift was already evident. Ms.
Showalter had lined up many speakers for a multipart forum, called
``Nice Work,'' to help scholars get out of academia into
journalism, television, movie-making, speechwriting and business
(anything but teaching). At the same hour, the Graduate Student
Caucus held a session called ``Is Our Labor Academic?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The job crisis now is a political struggle, a Kulturkampf,''
said William Pannapacker, vice president of the Graduate Student
Caucus. Graduate students, he said, just keep publishing, teaching
and pathetically buying the schools' line that they aren't real
workers but apprentices, learning through teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apprenticeship model is bankrupt,'' he continued. Graduate
education has become nothing more than ``a vast trade school'' that
churns out cheap academic labor and regards the Ph.D. as a ``waste
product,'' he said. ``We have more to gain from rebelling than from
being good scholars.'' After all, he added, with a bit too much
incredulity in his voice, ``graduate students are now earning less
than manual laborers.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble, said Julie Schmid, a graduate student in
English at the University of Iowa and a union organizer, is that
scholars are still considered an elite. In truth, she suggested,
they do better as proletarians. As proof, she cited the case of the
University of Iowa's graduate students and research assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Before they unionized, they earned between $8,000 to $15,000 a
year for half-time work. (Different departments pay different
wages.) They were paying the university $2,400 in fees and $500 for
catastrophic medical insurance. There was no legally binding
process to address grievances. They were seasonal workers at the
mercy of the administrators' noblesse oblige. Meanwhile, they
assumed more and more of the work. As the undergraduate population
continued to rise, Schmid said, the university gave more of the
teaching (particularly the teaching of writing) to the graduate
students and part-time faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1996, Ms. Schmid said, they joined the United
Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, adding their name
to the growing list of universities whose graduate-student workers
are affiliated with unions: the University of Wisconsin at Madison;
the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor; the University of Oregon,
and the University of Kansas (all affiliated with the American
Federation of Teachers); Rutgers University (represented by the
American Association of University Professors); the State
University of New York (represented by the Communications Workers
of America), and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the
University of California (both affiliated with the United Auto
Workers).
</P>
<P>
   Now the University of Iowa is legally required to negotiate with
graduate-student teachers and research assistants, said Ms. Schmid.
They have a health care package that costs $11.33 a month and gives
them free visits to the doctor, referrals and drugs. They have
negotiated a salary minimum of $13,320 for half-time work and have
gotten raises for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The academy is no longer genteel, Nelson said, so academics
should stop believing their work is a ``sacred calling,'' stop
seeing ``their low salaries as a form of Christian devotion and the
student papers as eucharistic wafers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some part-time professors, he said, earn $15,000 a year at age
55. (Part-timers with Ph.D.s are the most exploited, earning about
a third of what graduate students get.) They need to wake up and
recognize that ``grading semiliterate papers'' is a job that
deserves a minimum wage. It is time for academics to end their
addiction to their sweatshops.

<P>
   No country anywhere challenges U.S. preeminence as the last
remaining superpower, crime and poverty are both in decline and
nearly eight years of economic expansion have hammered
unemployment, inflation and interest rates to their lowest levels
in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with those riches, moreover, Clinton has delivered the
first balanced federal budget since 1969, with surpluses from 1998
and 1999 on track to total more than $145 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background of achievement, Clinton can confidently
kick his agenda ahead, pointing to the unfinished work to be done
by an administration that boasts of its commitment to binding the
country together as one, of melding the disparate races, religions
and cultures that make up turn-of-the-millennium America.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the rhetoric of renaissance and reconciliation, however,
Clinton's speech carries a burdensome mission unique in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when faith in the institutions of American democracy
has been shaken by a scandal of his own making, Clinton must appear
before a body of lawmakers standing in judgment of his fitness to
serve. Somehow, he must remind a country bitterly divided over his
public and private conduct that this is, after all, a nation of
many united as one.
</P>
<P>
   It could well be the single greatest test of Clinton's political
career, a breathtaking high wire act balanced ever more
precariously on his signature ability to careen from trial to
tribulation and somehow manage to triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to muster up the courage to stand in front of what
now is obviously a very critical audience and appear to be in
charge,'' said Jeremy Paul, a professor at the University of
Connecticut school of law in Hartford. ''So far he's been great at
that. It's got to be increasingly difficult as the pressure
mounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Richard Nixon's State of the Union speech in 1974 has
a president given the annual address under the cloud of
impeachment. Nixon's formal impeachment hearings before the House
Judiciary Committee didn't actually begin until May of that year;
by August he had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's troubles over the Monica Lewinsky sex and deception
scandal have dogged him for a year. Indeed, his State of the Union
address last January came just one week after the scandal surfaced.
And it came just days after he wagged his finger, now infamously,
and vowed to the American public ''I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Monica Lewinsky'' _ a denial he would refute seven
months later.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton succeeded last year in changing the subject and
masking his deception, for the moment at least, with an
initiative-laden State of the Union speech, no similar prospect
presents itself this time.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the audience Tuesday night will be the 434
members of the House which approved the articles of impeachment
last month charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice
and the 100 Senators who now sit as jurors in his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's primary audience, however, won't be on Capitol Hill,
but gathered instead around their parlors, kitchen tables and
family rooms. As always, Clinton will be speaking to the American
people, some 60 million of whom are expected to watch his televised
speech or listen to it on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a year of scandal-related inquiry and partisan
attacks, Clinton has managed to retain the support of more than six
of every ten Americans. They consistently have told pollsters that
they elected him to manage the country's domestic, economic and
foreign affairs, not just to provide a moral model for themselves
and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to ignore his polls, Clinton has fed his addiction to
public approval with an event spotlighting his attention to one
bread and butter issue _ education, for instance, Social Security,
health care or crime almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's State of the Union message will amplify on those
themes and isn't likely to touch even remotely on the scandal that
threatens his office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the American people have heard about that quite
extensively over the last year,'' Clinton said last week when a
reporter asked whether he would address the impeachment proceedings
during Tuesday's speech. ''We have to deal with the problems of
America, the challenges of America, the opportunities of America,
and that's what I intend to do in the State of the Union speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of speeches and reports a president delivers
each year, only the State of the Union address is required by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It's far more than an annual report. In the television age, it
has become a reminder to the nation that American democracy is a
precision machine for reconciling the varied interests of diverse
communities represented by those in the House and Senate _ with the
broader requirements of the nation as a whole, as symbolized by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   That is the system that has borne this nation thus far through
good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond simply ticking off the shopworn totems of prosperity well
managed, Clinton has the opportunity, perhaps even the obligation,
on Tuesday to rally the nation around that system.
</P>
<P>
   He can, more importantly, offer assurances that, even after the
most politically divisive year in decades, the institutions of
American government remain sound and will survive whatever
impeachment outcome the Senate ordains.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he has to stress is that the government goes
on...whatever happens to him,'' said Wayne Fields, author of the
1996 book, ''Union of Words: a History of Presidential Eloquence.''
</P>
<P>
   If the great strength of American democracy is its reliance on
the consent of the governed, said Fields, it is the institutions
that secure that strength that must be upheld at all costs. It has
less to do, he said, with the political fortunes of those in
Congress or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of those players are that important,'' said Fields, an
English professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ''This
isn't ultimately about them.''

 UNDATED: their sweatshops. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next day, the academic addicts had their day. At a
depressing session called ``Degrees of Shame,'' graduate students,
part-time professors and assorted migrant academic workers who
string together jobs to make a living wage got up to tell their
grim tales, like people at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Gottfried, who has part-time jobs at Boston University (
$3,500 a course), Merrimack College ($2,140 a course) and
Assumption College ($3,000 a course), said she can barely make ends
meet and would lose her job at B.U. if she even mentioned the word
``union.'' Natania Rosenfeld told of her path from the Princeton
English department to a research archive in Philadelphia to the
Duke English department to Knox College, where she is now ``viewed
as damaged goods.'' John Regan, a part-time instructor in
Massachusetts, said that when the day-care workers he uses
discovered how little he made, they were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at one of Ms. Showalter's ``Nice Work'' forums, the
outlook was considerably sunnier. Susan Basalla, a consultant and
journalist who is still working on her Ph.D., described a graduate
student whose dissertation on midwives led her to become one. Ms.
Basalla, using a figure worthy of a metaphysical poet, called it
``the dissertation that gave birth to a midwife.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe midwifery is not your thing, she continued, but there are
other options that former graduate students have found: private
investigator, Hallmark greeting card writer, investment banker,
astrologer, host of a radio talk show, actor (David Duchovny of
``X-Files''), member of Sha-Na-Na, speechwriter for Donna Shalala,
caterer, book buyer for Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Cassuto provided backup by describing how he crossed
over from a life of studying Daniel Webster's rhetoric into an
exciting career in travel writing. Peter Brunette, a professor at
George Mason University, boasted mercilessly about how he parlayed
his book on Jacques Derrida and film theory into a side career as
an online movie reviewer, which gets him free airfare, free hotels,
free movies, free access to his favorite directors and the right to
``scarf up hors d'oeuvres'' at parties.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was time for the Marxist Literary Group's cash-bar
cocktail party. Laura Sullivan, a graduate student at the
University of Florida and the outgoing president of the Graduate
Student Caucus, fumed about Ms. Showalter's closing speech
recommending alternative careers. ``I didn't go $80,000 in debt to
do something else,'' Ms. Sullivan said. Ms. Showalter, she went on,
``is a professor at a prestigious university who would rather be a
journalist now. Well, we haven't gotten there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Where could one go to forget the sad lives of poor migrant
professors and downtrodden grad students trudging from college to
college with no office and no money?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the BBC's production of David Lodge's campus novel,
``Nice Work'' (1989), was running on an endless loop at the hotel.
In the movie, the feminist part-time professor, Robyn Penrose, and
the factory manager, Vic Wilcox, shadow each other in their
careers, learning to admire and pity each other. Somehow, though,
the movie wasn't quite working its magic.
</P>
<P>
   A question kept getting in the way: Why had the Modern Language
Association decided to show ``Nice Work''? Was it to cheer up the
miserable graduate students and Ph.D.s on the job market? To prove
that a person trained to be an English professor, like Lodge, could
just as easily become a novelist or filmmaker? To illustrate how
similar business and academic life really are? To give everyone a
merry little tune to hum: ``Nice work if you can get it''? (The
only problem was how to finish the lyric. There are two endings to
the phrase in the song. One goes ``Nice work if you can get and you
can get it if you try.'' The other is ``Nice work if you can get it
and if you get it, won't you tell me how?'')
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the movie's happy ending never came. Whoever taped it cut
off the last 10 minutes. ``If I had been the one who set this up, I
would be embarrassed,'' one man grumbled. A woman stood up and
tried to fill in the missing plot, but she was fuzzy on the
details, since she had read the book years ago. Everyone filed out
of the dark room.

SUN BELT RIGHT WINGERS WILL REAP THE WHIRLWIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baffled for a full year by what looked to me like the Republican
Party's suicidal drive to impeach President Clinton no matter what
the political cost, I may have stumbled over the explanation on
PBS.
</P>
<P>
   On yet another of those sober-sided talking-head shows _ can we
agree that Monica Lewinsky did more for, err, public-affairs
programming, than, say, Michael Jordan ever did for the NBA? _
there was a sensible-sounding conservative spokesman, David Brooks
of the Weekly Standard, which could be a yearly, for all I know,
right-wing publications not being my strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Brooks made a great deal of sense to me. ``This is a
Great Lost Cause,'' he enthused of the Republican drive to snuff
out the Clinton presidency. ``We fought for truth, for justice,''
he said. That notion was novel to me. This whole thing has looked
like a down-and-dirty political ambush from the word go, to me and
to most Americans. I could never buy the William Bennett Moral
Crusade; I always suspected that was a book tour con.
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks found what he gamely phrased ``a kernel of romance''
for Republicans in this yearlong dive into the cesspool of
semen-stained dresses, cigars in the wrong places, sneaky tapes of
a ditzy young intern by a repulsive Republican operative (can
anyone defend the taxpayers still paying $90,000 a year to Linda
Tripp for her no-show Pentagon job?), and the greasy pawing-over of
tapes, transcripts, appointment logs, Secret Service records, and
other detritus of the 60,000-page House impeachment probe.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks looked ahead to the Republican National Convention of
2000 and through the mist of the future, saw Henry Hyde, chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, being summoned to the podium to
accept the plaudits of a grateful party, with the crowd roaring for
Hyde and his fellow impeachers: ``They stood for principles against
the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha! Vote Republican: We're the party of moral superiority! I
get it! For the first time, it dawns on me: Maybe these people
really believe what they're saying. Why had that thought not
previously occurred? Maybe because I remember Trent Lott voting to
exonerate President Nixon in the last impeachment in which Lott
played a role. In 1974, he was a House Judiciary Committee member,
who took the choke and wouldn't vote to impeach Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because I remember Lott and a lot of other Southern white
politicians being on the wrong side of the civil rights war. When I
hear these syrupy southern voices comparing Paula Jones to civil
rights marchers who were firehosed in the south when Lott and his
lot (Helms, Thurmond, et al) were talking against black rights,
it's hard for me to credit the Sun Belt Ascendacy in the GOP with
their natural-born moral superiority. How come all these
Republicans who embrace Paula Jones were trashing Anita Hill?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I have a hard time with the Party of Moral Superiority
because I saw George Bush beat Mike Dukakis with those disgraceful
Willie Horton TV spots. Or is it because I see the Supreme Court as
a Republican-stacked partisan political body -- seven of nine
justices named by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because when I look at Chief Justice Rehnquist, in
his fancy robe with the gold slashes on each sleeve, ordered up
from his tailor after a Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan costume, that I cannot
forget how he was Richard Nixon's choice. Rehnquist and Lott:
Nixon's revenge?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's because I think Kenneth Starr's act, Whitewater,
Filegate, Travelgate, Vince Foster-gate and all the other partisan
investigations launched by the Republicans, were mostly political
sawdust kicked up by the GOP buzzsaw, and its media enbablers --
Wall Street Journal, Murdoch TV, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I spent hours listening to the Republican House ``managers'' --
``muggers'' would be more accurate -- and I heard Clinton compared
to a ``murderer,'' a ``robber,'' a deviser of ``character
assassination,'' a motorist who'd slaughter someone on the highway.
The Republican posse can't stay away from sex -- oral, venal,
casual, risky, stupid, thoughtless, incomplete, inconsequential,
whatever -- despite the verdict of the polls. The majority of
Americans understand what Clinton did, don't like it, and want him
rapped on both knuckles. and left to finish out his term.
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of Americans -- polls suggest about three out
of ten adults -- who believe Clinton unworthy of his office and
want him ejected. It's a free country. But the seven out of ten of
us who want him to finish out his term resent having the Clinton
presidency hijacked by a rump band of right-wing congressmen and
consultants who mounted a successful hostile takeover of the
corporate Republican Party beginning in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Belt right-wingers are firmly in the saddle. Unmasked as
a long-time adulturer himself, in this year of outing hypocritical
conservatives on affairs sexual, Hyde, 74, has pressed impeachment
with a zeal exceeding his opposition to abortion, if that is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   We do not yet know if, prior to writing the check for his
ex-wife's abortion, Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), one of Hyde's chief
lieutenants, consulted with his chairman. Other leaders of the
Get-Clinton Posse, such as Rep. Burton of Indiana (adultury) or
Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma (child out of wedlock before he found
the Lord and became the GOP's only black congressman and favorite
spokesman on family values) have plowed ahead despite the implied
hypocrisy of their zealotry. Nor is the sad example of Rep. Bob
Livingston, harried into exile even before his formal election as
speaker by his own sexual foraging outside matrimony, instructive
for the remaining GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   I deem it a foregone conslusion that the Republicans will lose
the House next year (six seats is all the Dems need) and I think
Lott's conduct of the impeachment trial could as well cost the GOP
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe that's the ``kernel of romance'' Brooks talked about.
I call it going over a cliff. I propose a slogan for my GOP friends
in the 2000 election: Vote Republican; we're better than you are!
Now, let's choose up sides, and have a street fight, and see where
that theme gets you.

   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ The House continues arguments with
a summary of the facts and a discussion of the law of perjury and
obstruction. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-STRATEGY (Washington) _ The House prosecutors appeared
close to asking the Senate to formally invite President Clinton to
testify in his impeachment trial. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: Skedded earlier as IMPEACH-RDP.)
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-RDP (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ Brazil abandons its
efforts to defend its currency, allowing it to float freely. At
last look, the real stood about 1.43 to the dollar, compared with
about 1.32 on Thursday. Its weakest point Friday morning was about
1.60 to the dollar. On Tuesday, the day before officials began
their brief effort to live with a wider trading band, the real was
quoted at 1.21 to the dollar. Brazilian stocks have shot up an
astonishing 33 percent, its second-best day ever. By Diana Jean
Schemo. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   STORM-BUFFALO (Buffalo) _ Even in a place that is proud to be
called the snow capital of America, enough is enough. Piles of snow
are so high in most places that houses and storefronts are barely
visible from the street. On Friday, Buffalo contended with its 14th
consecutive day of snow _ with levels approaching 60 inches and the
flakes still falling. ``Even people in Buffalo are getting pretty
sick of this snow,'' said Stacie Simmons, 31. ''At first I thought
it was great. But now, my nerves are wearing thin.'' By Ginger
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-JETS-PARCELLS (Undated) _ Coach Bill Parcells is used to
surpassing expectations when it comes to pulling a football team
from the ashes. He did it with the New York Giants; he did it with
the New England Patriots earlier this decade. But nothing in
Parcells' resume _ perhaps in no professional coaching resume _
compares with what Parcells has accomplished with the Jets. By Mike
Freeman. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   JAMA-SEXSURVEY (Undated) _ The American Medical Association
dismissed the editor of its leading journal, charging that he had
rushed through a paper on whether college students think oral sex
is ``having sex'' in order to influence President Clinton's
impeachment trial. The article, which will appear next week in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, describes an
eight-year-old study, which found that 59 percent of those surveyed
did not believe the act counted as sex. By Gina Kolata.

   IMPEACH-SENATE (Washington) _ In an opinion poll conducted last
month in 21 congressional districts around the country that tend to

spending time on a lengthy impeachment trial, Congress and the
president should focus on issues and legislation important to
average families.'' So it is not surprising that as the trial of
Clinton began in earnest this week, Republican senators bent over

   WASHINGTON _ In an opinion poll conducted last month in 21
congressional districts around the country that tend to swing
between Republicans and Democrats, three-quarters of those
questioned said they agreed with the proposition that ``instead of
spending time on a lengthy impeachment trial, Congress and the
president should focus on issues and legislation important to
average families.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that as the trial of President Clinton
began in earnest this week, Republican senators bent over backward
to make the point that they were also tending to the people's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, one senator after another trooped before the
television cameras to promise plans to deal with tax cuts, health
care, international trade, military pay, Social Security, crime,
drugs and a host of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairmen announced and announced again their schedules
for hearings on legislation. Party leaders described over and over
how the senators would, as long as the trial lasted, reserve the
mornings for dealing with national policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., chairman of the Senate Republican
Conference, borrowed one of Clinton's favorite words for what
Lyndon Johnson once sort of described as walking and chewing gum at
the same time. ``It's called compartmentalization,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what the Republican senators are doing outside the
impeachment trial is not much different from what they usually do
at this point in the legislative cycle: setting schedules and
agendas, planning hearings, organizing committees.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that this year, they are doing it so ostentatiously.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, they had long closed meetings on
policy issues and invited questions from reporters afterward, even
though few policy decisions had been made. (At the Tuesday meeting,
Linda DiVall, a Republican strategist and pollster, warned the
senators, as if a warning were needed, that it would be perilous
for them to focus exclusively on impeachment.)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, called a news conference to talk about such matters as
Y2K computer problems, missile defenses, education priorities and
Social Security, without ever saying exactly what he wanted to do
in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Eight senators had a news conference Friday morning about health
policy. Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the assistant Republican leader,
opened the session by saying: ``Good morning, everybody. First,
we're here to talk health care, not the impending business on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, has also assumed a stance of paying little
attention to the trial and concentrating on business as usual. On
Friday morning he spoke at the State Department at a conference on
``Reinventing Government in the Age of the Global Economy.'' Then
he flew to New York to outline for a Wall Street crowd his
proposals for tax incentives and loan guarantees to attract venture
capital to distressed areas. On Friday night he went to a
Democratic fund- raiser.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked at a photo session on Wednesday whether he
thought the impeachment charges against him were warranted _ the
first question the president had taken on the subject from a
reporter since the House voted for impeachment last month _ Clinton
replied: ``My opinion is that I should be doing my job for the
country and other people should be handling the defense and dealing
with this issue, and that's what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for presidents to be inaccessible to reporters
and to talk in public only about the topics that suit them. But it
is extraordinary for senators to duck the questions that reporters
want to talk about and to insist on speaking at length about other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what is happening this year. At Stevens' news
conference in the Appropriations Committee office, for instance, a
press aide was stationed at the door to make sure reporters knew
that ``he's not going to speak on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news workers hoping for the best, the senator had a
nest of seven microphones under his chin and five television
cameras taping him. Alas, the first question was about impeachment:
Would the trial impede work on the policy issues Stevens had come
to talk about?
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to use the mornings when we do not have impeachment
meetings so we can start our work and not be behind,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter pressed: Was he really capable of that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm capable of it,'' Stevens answered. ``I'm not sure I will
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he was asked about a budgetary matter, he said,
``The jury's still out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Stevens caught himself. ``I should say, `The Senate's still
out,''' he chuckled, sticking to the drill of the day, which calls
for one vocabulary for impeachment and another for the people's
business.

WHAT'S WEIGHING ON BUFFETT'S STOCK? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., N.Y.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of stock of Berkshire Hathaway vs S&AMP;P is being
sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17)  
 (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren E. Buffett, the investment sage, has often said he
welcomes market declines because they put some good-quality
merchandise ``on sale,'' letting him shop for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, it is the price of Buffett's own company,
Berkshire Hathaway, that has been reduced, and some people are
wondering why.
</P>
<P>
   It's not they think that Buffett, 68, the investment legend, has
lost his touch. But how to explain that Berkshire's class A shares
have lost more than 7 percent of their value, to $65,000, in just
the first two weeks of the year? And that they are down 22.6
percent from their all-time peak of $84,000 last June 22? (Class B
shares, which cost much less but give holders no voting rights and
are not convertible to A shares, have fallen at a similar pace, and
are now at $2,128.)
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, say those who follow Berkshire most closely. Yes,
two of its biggest holdings, Coca-Cola and Gillette, have suffered
from economic turmoil abroad. But this is the wrong way to look at
Berkshire, according to Robert Hagstrom, portfolio manager for Legg
Mason Focus Trust and a Buffett aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Berkshire is often misperceived by casual investors,
including the arbitragers who swarm to merger deals, as little more
than its huge portfolio of publicly traded stocks, concentrated _
at last report, which means the 1997 annual report _ in eight
issues. (In addition to Coke and Gillette, those are American
Express, Freddie Mac, Wells Fargo, Disney, Citigroup and Washington
Post.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not correct to analyze a closed-end investment
company,'' said Hagstrom, whose fund has 22 percent of its assets
invested in Berkshire. The main business of Berkshire is in
property and casualty insurance; the ``float'' generated by these
subsidiaries including Geico, the seventh-biggest auto insurer, is
then invested elsewhere _ in stocks and directly into other
Berkshire operating businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Investors say Berkshire's relative weakness is mostly a
temporary result of its $22 billion acquisition, announced last
summer of General Re, the giant reinsurance company.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, General Re stockholders did not jump at the
chance to become Buffett's investment partners by exchanging their
shares for those of Berkshire. That has led to some weakness in
Berkshire shares.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Russo, a partner at Gardner Investments in Lancaster,
Pa., which has long held sizable Berkshire stakes, said: ``The real
impact is from the massive rotation of owners. You're now asking
insurance investors to own a company that has a lot of other
things,'' including a portfolio of stocks now carrying high
price-earnings multiples and an increasingly large stable of other
interests ranging from candyand furniture to, more recently,
pilot-training and executive jets. In his view, the pressure on the
stock from the exodus of these owners is temporary.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity,
however, estimated that only about one-third of General Re holders
will wind up keeping Berkshire stock.
</P>
<P>
   Disenchantment spread when Standard &AMP; Poor's chose not to
include Berkshire in its 500-stock index, the widely used benchmark
whose components are must buys for index funds. Lack of liquidity
was seen as the reason _ expensive Berkshire shares do not trade
much _ though rumors persist that S&AMP;P may reconsider. A spokesman
for S&AMP;P declined comment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor weighing on Berkshire's price is softness in the
world reinsurance market as overcapacity forces down rates. But
Hagstrom, Russo and others regard the acquisition of General Re as
nothing short of a coup. General Re's huge size figures to add
flexibility to Berkshire's insurance operations as well as to throw
off huge amounts of cash that can be invested.
</P>
<P>
   Geico, which flirted with bankruptcy in the 1970s, is thriving
as never before. As a low-cost provider of insurance, it could
become the industry's second-biggest company, trailing only State
Farm, in five to seven years, according to Alice Schroeder, a Paine
Webber analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher C. Davis, portfolio manager of Davis New York
Venture fund and Selected American Shares, are how the insurance
properties are valued and what opportunities there are for
Berkshire to invest the float they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has long admired Buffett without owning Berkshire itself.
Now he counts himself a Berkshire bull and is keeping shares he has
received in exchange for General Re he stock.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Sosnoff, chief investment officer for Atalanta/Sosnoff
Capital, has reservations. He argued recently in Forbes magazine
that the collapse of world oil prices has significantly dimmed
Berkshire's prospects by threatening political disruption for Third
World producers and undermining their ability to buy Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett fans don't agree. ``He'll make more money for his
shareholders in a bad market,'' Davis said. ``In a high-flying
market he may have to bide his time.''

<P>
   If online retailers steamrolled their way into the spotlight
during the past holiday season, one thing is clear: They crushed a
few toes along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have long lamented the state of customer service on
line, but perhaps never as vociferously as in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Stories abound of vendors that shipped late, sent the wrong
product and then ignored complaints, or that required customers to
pay the cost of returning goods and then tacked on restocking
charges. And then there's the loathsome ``auto response''
electronic mail reply, with advice on everything but what the
customer asked about.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to sum up online customer service in a word, David
Cooperstein, senior analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet
consulting firm, responded: ``Pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites have the powerful advantage of making companies seem
accessible and easy to interact with. it's an appearance that all
kinds of companies, not just retailing, can have troubl living up
to.
</P>
<P>
   Brightware, an e-mail software company, reported Thursday that
it had tried contacting the 100 largest American public companies
by e-mail. Twenty-six either did not accept e-mail or made it so
difficult to find the e-mail forms on their Web sites that the
surveyors gave up trying. Of the remainder, only 15 responded
within three hours; 10 didn't reply at all.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Garelick of Somerville, Mass., knows the frustration of
unrequited e-mail. In early December he ordered the movie ``Out of
Sight'' on DVD from Bigstar Entertainment, an online movie
retailer. Between Dec. 28 and Dec. 30, Garelick sent e-mail to
Bigstar three times, asking why the movie hadn't arrived. ``I
would've been fine with an auto response,'' said Garelick, who
eventually received the disk in January. ``I just wanted an
assurance that they were at least working on it. From now on, I'm
not doing business on line with anyone who doesn't have a phone
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a number to call was small comfort to Duke Nguyen of
Cincinnati. Nguyen said he ordered three items from the Internet
site of Intuit in early December and then tried to change his order
by phone. ``Every time, after 20 or so minutes of waiting, I gave
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried faxing in his order change. but the original items were
delivered to him. ``Finally, I called and just put on my speaker
phone while I waited,'' he said. After an hour someone answered and
he was able to arrange a return. But then Intuit credited him for
less than the full value of the goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried using a new e-mail button on Intuit's Web site but got
an automated response suggesting, among other things, that he call
customer service. ``I'm computer-literate,'' Nguyen said. ``But
when it comes to service, these things scare the heck out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry leaders say problems often occur because
companies rush to get products and prices onto their Web sites
while underestimating the time and resources needed for customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   But David Levipsky, executive vice president of Bigstar, said
that wasn't the case with his site. The company had anticipated a
holiday rush by installing a ``very cutting-edge'' e-mail system,
he said, adding, ``So it's surprising to me that this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Intuit, Larry Wolfe, senior vice president for the
company's tax-software division, said the company does the best it
can. ``Often in December and January, there are times when people
wait longer than we'd like them to wait,'' he said. ``But we take
it very seriously, and we work very hard to keep call times down.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say poorly designed Web sites draw complaints. ``If a
site is designed well, most of the complaints don't happen,'' said
Cooperstein of Forrester, noting that many sites fail to offer
enough information so that customers can help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for consumers, analysts said, is that Internet
merchants are starting to learn two lessons: that ignoring e-mail
is the best way to turn customers into enemies, and that improving
Web sites is more cost-effective than dedicating battalions of
employees to answer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mail deluge everybody was worried about we looked at as
a total gift,'' said Matt Hyde, director for online sales at REI, a
retailer of outdoor goods. ``We've made hundreds of changes to our
site based on customer service data.''
</P>
<P>
   A result: The ratio of e-mails to orders at REI dropped sharply,
he said, and so did payroll costs for customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer uses a combination of software and employees to
respond to its 10,000 weekly e-mails, answering three-quarters of
them within a day, said Manish Mehta, a senior online support
manager for the company. Dell's Web site features a wide range of
self-service information, including detailed technical support
tips.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are becoming less tolerant of poor service from online
retailers. ``Consumer expectations have definitely grown, because
certain sites have set a high standard,'' said Jakob Nielsen, a
site design expert and publisher. ``Fair or unfair, other sites
have to live up to that standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so. But Kent Krueger, co-founder of the Sitstay GoOut
Store, said sites that are honest with consumers can weather
service problems. Sitstay, which sells specialty products to dog
owners, was the only Web site to get a five-star rating for
customer support among 500 rated in December by Bizrate, a market
research company that surveys online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started selling doormats with little Yorkies on them and
got a huge number of orders that we weren't prepared for,'' Krueger
said. ``So we got in touch with everyone and told them who we were,
what had happened, and we were working on it.'' As a result, he
said, no customers canceled orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, if you're honest and have a little fun, people
will have a good attitude,'' he added. ``But it could also be that
dog owners are just a different breed.''

LAWMAKERS TO FINALIZE AGAINST CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors will conclude the three-day
presentation of their case against President Clinton Saturday by
describing to the Senate why the president's conduct rises to an
impeachable offense under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The session is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. with Rep. Charles
Canady, R-Fla., outlining the basis for removing the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-word section of the Constitution says a president can be
ousted if convicted by the Senate of treason, bribery or other
``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady will be followed by Reps. Lindsay O. Graham, R-S.C., and
Steve Buyer, R-Ind. Wrapping up the arguments will be House
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Rep. James E. Rogan,
R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives had three days to make their case that
Clinton should be convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice
for trying to cover up his sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Clinton's lawyers begin
their defense on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canady, 44, is a Yale Law School graduate who chairs the House
Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution. He has shepherded some
of the most controversial initiatives on the Republican agenda
through his subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   They included legislation opposing same-sex marriages and a
measure banning a type of late-term abortion in which a doctor
partially delivers a fetus before terminating it. Canady also
fought unsuccessfully to repeal affirmative action laws and has
pushed for a Constitutional amendment to ban the burning of the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Canady is a staunch conservative known for his eloquence,
especially his anti-abortion speeches using graphic props. The son
of a onetime aide to the late Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, Canady
began his career as a Democrat in state politics but later switched
to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 43, a conservative who will outline why the president
should be removed from office, was chief prosecutor for the Air
Force in Europe from 1984 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know how David felt about Goliath,'' Graham said
this week, referring to the role he will play Saturday on the
Senate floor and the challenge in persuading 67 of the 100 senators
to convict Clinton. ``You just do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyer, 40, will focus on why the perjury charges against Clinton
amount to impeachable offenses under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A major in the Army Reserves and once a deputy to Indiana's
Attorney General, Buyer is a veteran of the Persian Gulf War who
has been a leader in Congress' study of health problems reported by
soldiers who were stationed there.
</P>
<P>
   To conclude the presentations by the House prosecutors, Rogan,
41, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor who at 33 was
California's youngest judge, will team with Hyde, 74, a lawyer and
13-term lawmaker known for his erudite speeches.

WARRING PARTIES IN SUDAN EXTEND CEASE-FIRE IN FAMINE AREA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The main warring parties in Sudan have agreed
to extend a cease-fire in the area of the country hardest hit last
year by famine, U.N. officials announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The current cease-fire expired on Friday and had been in place
since July in the southwest region of Bahr el Ghazal, where 100
people a day were dying in one feeding center at the famine's peak
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Eric Vraalsen, a U.N. envoy to Sudan, said that the Sudanese
government and the main rebel group, the Sudanese People's
Liberation Army, had agreed not to fight in the region for three
more months. The two sides could not agree on proposals to expand
the territory covered by the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   John Luk, a spokesman for the Sudanese People's Liberation Army,
said that the rebels had agreed to the cease-fire because of the
projected food shortages. Sudanese government officials in Khartoum
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Vraalsen said that the famine had receded as a result of the
flow of food and other aid into the region since the cease-fire
originally went into effect. But he added: ``We are not by any
means home safe. It's a very fragile situation. It's precarious.
People are just about to regain their strength. It's a situation
which might easily be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that southern Sudan would need food aid at least until
the harvest in October, and that the United Nations would soon ask
donors for $180 million to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aid organizations say that Arab militia members, whose presence
they say has preceded renewed fighting, are in the area guarding a
government train. Kerubino Kwanyin Bol, an unpredictable veteran of
the 15-year civil war between the Islamic government in the north
and the largely Christian and animist south, is also reported to
have returned to Bahr el Ghazal. He has switched allegiance from
the rebels to the government several times and is now reportedly
back with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Vraalsen said the Sudanese government had pledged to try to rein
in Bol but could make no absolute promises. ``They said they will
do their utmost,'' he said.

CABIN FUMES CAUSE DIVERSION TO USAIRWAYS FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Ind., Ill., Fla., Canada) (DW) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A USAirways flight from Baltimore to Chicago made
an emergency landing in Fort Wayne, Ind., Friday morning after a
report of fumes in the cabin. Six passengers were taken to a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the plane, a Boeing 737-200 with 93 people on board,
declared an emergency when the plane was flying about 25 miles
southeast of Fort Wayne at 31,000 feet, said Don Zochert, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which was on its way to O'Hare International Airport,
was directed by air traffic controllers to Fort Wayne, where it
landed without incident 13 minutes later, shortly after 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was met at the gate by paramedics, who examined 23
passengers and took six of them to Lutheran Hospital of Indiana. At
the hospital, Alice Robinson, a spokeswoman, said ``the general
complaint was chest pains and difficulty breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   William Shumann, a spokesman for the FAA in Washington, said
that the nature of the fumes and their location on the plane was
not clear but that ``it was the passengers who were taken to the
hospital, rather than the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency sent air safety investigators from South Bend, Ind.
USAirways, which normally flies only commuter planes into Fort
Wayne, also sent a maintenance crew.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, electrical fires and improperly packed hazardous
cargoes have caused fumes or smoke on planes in flight, sometimes
leading to crashes. After the crash of a Valujet DC-9 in the
Florida Everglades on May 11, 1996, killing all 110 people aboard,
the FAA intensified its efforts to regulate hazardous cargoes. The
crash of a Swissair MD-11 near Halifax, Nova Scotia, last Sept. 2,
when 229 on board were killed, has intensified concern about
in-flight fires.

JETS HOPE OFFENSIVE LINE SETS A WINNING PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y _ The season was only two weeks old and already
the Jets were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A 36-30 overtime loss at powerhouse San Francisco in the opener
was one thing. A 24-10 loss at home to the Baltimore Ravens was
quite another.
</P>
<P>
   The details were demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to grab the lead late in the first half, the Jets had a
first down at the Baltimore 3-yard line. Curtis Martin, just in
from the Patriots for megamoney, carried to the 1. And carried
three more times from the 1. And never got into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Not good. Not good for Martin. Not good for the Jets' rebuilt
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Not a good feeling at all, left guard Todd Burger was saying in
the Jets' locker room the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an offensive lineman and you're first and goal from the
1-yard line (the 3, actually) and you've got four shots to get it
in and you don't, you know, you don't even want to go to the
sideline,'' he said. ``You know what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   Want to bet the guys on the offensive line trudged, heads down,
to the sideline after that particular series?
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The Jets have bounced back to win 13 of their last 15
games, and last Sunday's playoff win over the Jaguars was their
seventh straight.
</P>
<P>
   As is always the case, Martin and Vinny Testaverde and Keyshawn
Johnson and Wayne Chrebet and others in the featured positions get
the fanfare. And Burger and center Kevin Mawae and Jumbo Elliott
and their mates up front help make it all possible.
</P>
<P>
   They helped make it possible for Martin to go for more than 100
yards in nine games, including last week's 124 on 36 carries
against the Jaguars. And for Testaverde to have time to throw for
29 touchdowns in the regular season and another against the
Jaguars. And for Johnson to catch 10 of those TDs, and the one last
week. In four of the last five games, they have protected
Testaverde so well that he has not been sacked.
</P>
<P>
   It's a group, anchored by Mawae, that has come together as the
season has progressed. A group that has come together out of
necessity, said the ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to; we had no choice,'' Mawae said. ``We're a bunch of
guys who had never played together and we've learned on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Start with Mawae, who came in from Seattle as an unrestricted
free agent. Add Burger, also a free agent, from Chicago. Rookie
Jason Fabini, a fourth-round pick out of Cincinnati, is the right
tackle and the biggest of them all at 6 feet 7 inches, 312 pounds.
Elliott, the left tackle, is in his 11th season and has come back
from the torn Achilles' tendon that knocked him out late last
season. Matt O'Dwyer is the guard opposite Burger.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped plenty that the unit has been intact all season.
No one has missed a start; rarely has anyone missed a snap.
</P>
<P>
   They get a kick out of blocking for Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Mawae said. ``It's fun to have a running back
like that. If we're blocking good or just halfway decent, we know
Curtis will go and make some plays. It makes our job a lot
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in the AFC Championship Game at Denver, they face their
toughest task yet. They must not only take on the Broncos defense
but the Broncos offense.
</P>
<P>
   If they can find Testaverde enough time to take advantage of the
Bronco secondary and they can help find Martin enough room to pick
up first downs, the Jets can not only score points, they can keep
Terrell Davis and the Bronco offense off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have the ball, we have to take advantage of the
opportunity and move down the field,'' Mawae said. ``And we can't
settle for field goals and 3 points. We've got to go out and score
7 points. That's the way you stay on top of a team like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It would help immensely if the offense can accomplish that chore
early.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have gotten on top of teams quickly all season _
they outscored opponents, 144-54, in the first period in the
regular season and jumped on the Dolphins, 14-0, last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to set the tone,'' Mawae said. ``The first chance
you have the ball, you've got to set the tone by going down and
scoring some points and letting them know you're for real and not
here to lay an egg or whatever. If you go out there and set the
tone early, they know they're going to be in for a dogfight.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for those short-yardage plays that gave the Jets some
problems early in the season? Granted, one playoff game does not a
season make, but last week Martin had two touchdowns. Both from the
1-yard line.

KING'S ELDEST SON HELPS FULFILL LEGACY WHILE SEEKING OWN IDENTITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 17)

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every pair of eyes followed his steps as he entered
the classroom. Before he had said a word, a dozen little hands were
straining toward the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   History was standing in their midst, and these pupils at
Manhattan's P.S. 11 were bursting with questions. They had done
their homework, and they all wanted to ask Martin Luther King III
about his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does it feel to be one of four children of a great
leader?'' asked Jack Froude, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's classmates chimed in: How had he felt when they threw his
daddy in jail? Did Martin Luther King Jr. and his children play and
have fun together? Was it true that 10-year-old Martin had
comforted his younger sister, Bernice, after their father was
assassinated?
</P>
<P>
   King, who seemed to relish talking to these children, responded
with fragments of stories remembered from his childhood: His
exhausted father's face lighting up when he came home and saw his
children; his father playing ball or swimming with the children;
his father placing the kids on top of the refrigerator and letting
them fall into his arms while their mother warned him to be
careful. The third-graders of Class 304 were enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III is very good at talking about his father.
He has been doing it all of his life.
</P>
<P>
   As the martyred civil rights leader's eldest son and the bearer
of his father's name, Martin King has carried a heavy burden of
expectation. People hear his name and they think of his father's
noble face, his father's majestic voice, his father's soaring
images of dreams and mountaintops and the glory of the coming of
the Lord. As the national celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday approaches, phrases from his speeches are evoked more and
more often, from school classrooms to corporate boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   At times, in the midst of all this, Martin King III seems to
have groped for an identity of his own. ``I honestly don't know yet
what that one major gift of mine is,'' he told an interviewer in
1991. ``I think I'm still searching for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 41, there are signs that King has found surer
footing.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he became president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, the civil rights organization founded by his
father and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy in 1957, the year Martin King
III was born.
</P>
<P>
   The SCLC he inherited hardly has the force that characterized
the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., or the 1963 March on
Washington. But King speaks confidently of his plans to revitalize
the organization, using tools like the Internet, voter registration
and political activism to address the economic and social problems
of African-Americans more than 30 years after his father's
generation of leaders cast off the yoke of Jim Crow.
</P>
<P>
   King said he knew that becoming president of an organization his
father started would invite still more generational comparisons.
His decision to take the job, and his comments on his role now,
suggest that he has resolved this quandary by proudly embracing his
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``it is tough. But the way that I view
it is that I am continuing (my father's) work and helping to
fulfill the legacy that he had _ I'm building on what he built in
this nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stopped and thought about this name that I carry that's
bigger than life, then I would become overwhelmed and not be able
to accomplish anything. The reason I'm able to accomplish something
is I know that there is so much work that is still unfulfilled, and
I want to see the day that he dreamed about, which now is part of
my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, King's appearance Wednesday at this New York school
illustrates his view of how the tactics in the struggle for justice
and equal opportunity have changed since the days of boycotts,
sit-ins and protest marches.
</P>
<P>
   He was here in his role as chairman of the Kindness and Justice
Challenge, a national program in which schoolchildren are
encouraged to perform acts of kindness (helping others) and justice
(standing up for righteous principles) for two weeks following the
King holiday. More than 1 million students are participating in the
program, which awards prizes to students who perform the most acts
of kindness and justice.
</P>
<P>
   King said the program is in keeping with his father's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to focus on children probably more than any
other area,'' he said. ``It's not the only area, but it's certainly
one of the primary areas, for they are the future leadership of our
nation, and the most important thing is that a strong, positive
foundation is developed.''
</P>
<P>
   King beamed as the students unveiled a mural of their drawings
depicting his father and illustrating the themes of peace and
justice. He led them in a solemn recitation of the ``kindness and
justice pledge.'' He applauded enthusiastically after they sang a
song, ``This Was a Man,'' about Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he submitted to a succession of interviews with local
television stations, then posed patiently for photos and signed
autographs for students, teachers and school staff members. Among
those who shook his hand was Anne Powers, the staff developer at
P.S. 11, who told King that she had watched his father speak at the
conclusion of the March on Washington when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very dramatic,'' she said. ``It made a lasting
impression on me.''
</P>
<P>
   For her schoolchildren, Powers said, meeting Martin King III and
hearing his words was a reminder that the spirit of struggle toward
high ideals is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were young, we felt like we really had the power to
change things,'' she said. ``To see that people are still doing
something is really important for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IN THE PATH OF HIS FATHER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III was born in Montgomery, Ala., but he grew
up in Atlanta and has spent much of his life there. He graduated
from Atlanta's Morehouse College _ his father's alma mater _ in
1979 with a degree in political science.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 he was elected to the Fulton County Commission in
Atlanta, the start of what many believed would be a long and
successful political career. He ran for commission chairman in 1993
but lost in a major upset, a defeat blamed in part on the
disclosure that he owed more than $200,000 in unpaid federal taxes,
interest and fines in connection with income from speaking
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has stayed busy on the speaking circuit _ an
Atlanta agent who handles his speaking engagements says King is her
sole client _ and in 1997 he co-founded an organization called
Americans United for Affirmative Action, a nonprofit group that
sought to counter efforts across the country to dismantle
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, 1997, he was named president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference in a unanimous vote of delegates
meeting in Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King's father
and grandfather had served as pastors. King replaced the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, who had headed the organization for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment put King, for the first time, in a position of
national prominence, and the inevitable comments about the younger
King taking on his father's mantle increased the pressure on him to
revive an organization that many felt had lost the vision and
passion of its early days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that the organization needed to look in a
different direction,'' said William Boone, an associate professor
of political science at Clark Atlanta University. ``For the last
several years, they have not been in the forefront'' of
African-American politics or social activism.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Boone said it is his sense that King has spent much of the past
year assessing and evaluating the SCLC's staff and programs, rather
than boldly launching new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been somewhat quiet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Historian David Garrow, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1987
biography of Martin Luther King Jr., said he has been surprised by
King's relatively low profile since he assumed the SCLC presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``One sees very little visible evidence of the SCLC doing
anything more or differently this past year than when Joe Lowery
was president,'' Garrow said.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when discrimination takes forms more subtle than cross
burnings, poll taxes and whites-only lunch counters, Garrow said,
many civil rights organizations are struggling to redefine their
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost inevitably less of a role for these
organizations to play than was the case when blacks were forcefully
excluded from American, and especially Southern, public life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, who worked as an SCLC staff
member for 20 years under King Jr. and Abernathy, offered a more
enthusiastic assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that Martin III is attempting to reinvigorate
the SCLC into a full-fledged civil rights organization, to organize
a youthful base that can provide the energy to sustain the
programs,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His real challenge will be to find the resources that will
keep the organization solvent, the staff and personnel to be
successful. He hasn't had enough time yet. But thus far, I like
what I'm hearing and I like what I'm seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   King said the SCLC is close to completing a strategic plan for
the year 2000, a plan that he said will chart the organization's
future direction and emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, King said, the SCLC, which does not have a site on
the Internet, will develop a strong Internet presence and take
other steps to ensure that its constituents participate in the
advance of computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, the organization is continuing its
traditional voter registration and education work, sponsoring
mentoring programs for at-risk young men and women, and developing
workshops with educators to discourage a practice called
``tracking'' _ the grouping of school students according to
perceived ability. The SCLC believes this practice harms poor
students and black students, King said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Youth has been a consistent theme in King's speeches as SCLC
president.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, at the University of Maryland, he lamented the
``dormant mentality'' of some of today's young people in the face
of terrible social problems. ``I think it is incumbent on students
to come together and come up with solutions to our problems that
plague us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While his speaking style tends to be simpler than his father's,
he is capable of rhetorical grandeur. Here's a sample from his
speech to a ``Million Youth March'' in Atlanta during the Labor Day
weekend, as reprinted in the SCLC's national magazine:
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look over the sea of faces that surround me, I am
inspired by the collective spirit of determination and purpose that
emanates throughout this gathering. I feel that tingling sense of
rejuvenation one gets when something great is about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing here with you right now, I feel the spirit of our
ancestors bonding with ours and bubbling up through the veins of
our collective body, showering us with the indelible strength of
love, hope and promise for a future that will not be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine Martin Luther King Jr. speaking those very
words.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RECREATING HIMSELF AS AN INDIVIDUAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The forces that shaped the lives of Martin King III and his
siblings are enshrined in Atlanta's black historic district, known
as ``sweet Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-block stretch of Auburn Avenue, not far from downtown,
includes the home where Martin Luther King Jr. was born; Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King Jr. and his father both preached and
where the first organizational meetings for the SCLC took place;
King's tomb, a marble crypt surrounded by a reflecting pool; and
the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, founded in 1968 by
King's widow, Coretta Scott King.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the King Center is a Visitors' Center
operated by the National Park Service with exhibits portraying
King's life and key events in the civil rights struggles of the
1950s and 1960s. King's deep, rich voice booms from television
monitors at each stop in the center.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks west down Auburn Avenue is the Hall of the Free and
Accepted Masons, built in 1940. It is in this nondescript building
that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference maintains its
national headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The SCLC office is no tourist attraction. A visitor enters a
closet-sized anteroom and is greeted by a receptionist seated
behind a glass window. Occasionally an employee emerges through a
side door from the offices within.
</P>
<P>
   From the origins reflected in Auburn Avenue's historic
buildings, the four King children have taken divergent paths.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda King, 43, is a Los Angeles-based actress. Dexter King,
37, is head of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change.
Bernice King, 35, is an Atlanta Baptist minister.
</P>
<P>
   The King family, long treated as Atlanta's royalty, has been the
subject of some controversy in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Atlanta and elsewhere expressed skepticism at the
family's stance that James Earl Ray, who died last year while
serving a 99-year sentence for assassinating King Jr., was in fact
innocent. Ray had confessed to shooting King to death in Memphis,
Tenn., but later recanted.
</P>
<P>
   While it was Dexter King who met with Ray in prison and who has
been most outspoken about the case, Martin King, too, has said he
believes Ray is innocent and that the killing was the outgrowth of
some larger conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The family's decision to sell the rights to King Jr.'s words and
likeness for commercial marketing purposes also has drawn criticism
from civil rights stalwarts who say the man belongs to history.
</P>
<P>
   For Martin King III, though, these disputes appear to be little
more than brief distractions as he remains intent on remolding the
SCLC _ and in a sense, remolding himself while accepting the
inevitable comparisons to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever really get away from it,'' said Atlanta
City Councilman Michael Bond, a longtime friend of the King family.
``I think people are always going to define him by his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond understands well. He is the son of Julian Bond, a veteran
civil rights organizer who is chairman of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   ``With myself and Marty _ well, Marty has it worse than all of
us,'' Bond said. ``His father is held in high esteem, and he's
always going to be defined by that by people.
</P>
<P>
   ``His challenge is going to be showing the world who he is as
Martin Luther King III. He's walking directly in the path of his
father, but he can continue his father's legacy and recreate
himself in the public mind as an individual.''

SOME PATTERNS CAST SHADOWS ON THE MERGER LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The CEOs of Lucent Technologies and Ascend
Communications appeared on CNBC's ``Squawk Box'' program Wednesday
morning to discuss their newly announced merger.
</P>
<P>
   The first question posed to the Ascend boss: ``Mr. Ejabat, how
does it feel to be out of a job?''
</P>
<P>
   Mory Ejabat gamely retorted, ``Well, I'm not out of a job yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the acquired rather than the acquirer, Ascend expects to
find the ``synergies'' and ``growth potential'' with Lucent that it
wouldn't have reached solo. But the fact remains, Ascend won't be
Ascend anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pattern reflected across the merger landscape. It's also
a pattern that some business researchers say does not bode well for
the long term _ for either the acquired or the acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grubb, a post-merger consultant, and Robert Lamb, a New York
University management professor, wrote this month in Across the
Board, The Conference Board's magazine, that most mergers fail to
deliver promised results.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as merging parties try to mesh cultures and systems,
the authors said, savvy nonmerging competitors grab market share
and become ``safe havens'' for escaping employees.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his Maryland office, Grubb said
the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler might be one that is being
done right. He said Daimler's pre-merger research and post-merger
efforts to ``cross-pollinate, to take the best from each,''
appeared sound.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the authors said, Compaq Computer Corp.'s
effort to digest Digital Equipment Corp. has not gone well for
Compaq. Dell Computer jumped to take market advantage, evidenced by
its new, highly visible television ad campaign, while Compaq and
DEC were in post-merger turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Dell was delighted at the Compaq merger,'' Grubb said.
``While Compaq and DEC were busy trying to figure out how to
integrate, Dell acted.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened after that merger? Compaq's second-quarter 1998
domestic growth rate was 11 percent. Dell's was 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other examples of mergers done right, said
Gerard Meiners, a Kansas City certified public accountant whose
company has been a part of mergers and who has advised other
companies in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The successful ones find that certain synergy,'' Meiners said.
``When a smaller company goes into a larger company, it often frees
the smaller people from getting bogged down in day-to-day operating
detail. When they're in the larger company, they can devote their
resources to what they are best cut out for.''
</P>
<P>
   Meiners said successful mergers sometimes eliminated the
competition that two parties waged against each other and reduced
costly overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better mergers are the ones where the people went into it
with an idea of how to work out personality problems and with an
idea of what to do down the road if it happens that the merger
doesn't work out,'' Meiners said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb said many studies, some dating to the 1950s, showed that
kind of pre-merger homework apparently wasn't done. The authors
contend that a majority of mergers end in financial disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the studies the authors cited:
</P>
<P>
   - The American Management Association, looking at 54 big mergers
in the late 1980s, found that, post-merger, 50 percent lost
productivity or profits or both.
</P>
<P>
   - A 1987 McKinsey &AMP; Co. study found that nearly 80 percent of
all mergers failed to recover the costs incurred in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   - A 1998 pre-merger study by Daimler found that 70 percent of
international mergers failed to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   - Investment bankers J.P. Morgan last year looked at 116
acquisitions and found no added value three years after the deals
were made.
</P>
<P>
   - Mark Sirower, a New York University professor, studied 168
mergers that took place between 1979 and 1990 and found that their
average returns declined 40 percent four years after the deal.
</P>
<P>
   - Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter in 1987
analyzed 3,788 acquisitions that occurred between 1950 and 1986 and
found that more than half of the acquired companies were later
divested.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the merger-day confidence of CEOs such as Lucent's
Richard McGinn, the ``coupled strength'' that appears promising at
the outset does not usually come through, Grubb asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the top talent in the acquired company begins an
immediate exodus, searching for positions with more autonomy. Such
talent depletion is under way at Bankers Trust Corp., Grubb said,
which has been melted into Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Those remaining in the ``melted'' company often are consumed
with fear and feelings of impotence when new ways of doing things
are dictated by their new parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People become numb, jaded, disbelieving,'' Lamb said in a
telephone interview from his office at the Stern Graduate School of
Business in New York. ``Often, they live not just through one
merger but another and then another. They are so fed up with being
bought and sold they are looking for exits.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors theorize that corporate performance slumps _ and
merger expectations aren't realized _ when the best executives,
especially at the acquired company, are lured away by fast-thinking
competitors and when many other employees feel out of control and
unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Ejabat gamely and honestly promises to help Ascend's
``transition'' into Lucent, broadband network competitors are
watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-merger integration is all-consuming,'' Grubb said.
``Combining firms temporarily lose their external vision, and if
their competitors are on the ball, their competitors can attack.
The merged operation is usually too busy integrating to launch a
counterattack.''

MEDICARE MOVE WOULD HURT MORE THAN HELP

<P>
   UNDATED: President Clinton's continuing bid to extend Medicare
coverage to those ages 55 to 64 is one of the most potentially
destructive economic policy initiatives ever pursued in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If this effort is successful, it not only will accelerate
Medicare's financial deterioration but also cause private-sector
cuts in health-care insurance coverage while undermining Social
Security's long-term outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal died in the last Congress, the
administration promises to renew its push to expand Medicare
coverage to those 55 to 64 not covered by health insurance. This
may sound compassionate, but its unintended consequences would be
harmful to many more Americans than would be helped by such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the announcement came even as the administration was
revealing plans to propose lower Medicare reimbursements for
hospitals. If both initiatives are successful, Medicare resources
will be diminished as many more millions are added to its
eligibility rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The administration estimates the cost of its Medicare expansion
at $1.4 billion over five years, but such numbers have no
credibility. Egregiously lowball spending estimates are part and
parcel of Medicare's history.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration seeks to help an estimated 3.2 million
55- to 64-year-olds without health coverage, the pool of new
beneficiaries is likely to be much larger. For smaller businesses,
it would be an incentive to end health-care coverage for employees
55 and older. Meantime, it would encourage more early retirements
among those who work until they're 65 because they couldn't afford
the health-care insurance premiums they'd have to pay until
becoming eligible for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   As work would become a less attractive option for those 55 to
64, their departure from the work force would mean fewer taxpayers
and more tax consumers. This, of course, would mean lower income
and increased outgo for Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The implication here is an earlier arrival than now forecast for
the financial crunch points facing Medicare and Social Security.
The only way to counter this would be to impose even higher Social
Security and Medicare taxes on the younger workers who already are
assured of being shortchanged by the system when they reach
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the continuing cutbacks in Medicare payouts would be a
form of rationing that Washington hopes nobody would recognize as
such. The administration, for instance, says payment reductions to
hospitals are justified by unacceptable profits in some cases, but
this isn't the point. As health-care providers are forced to accept
less for their services, they will respond with subtle rationing
programs of their own that will affect the quality of the services
that Medicare offers its beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Social Security and Medicare isn't so much
financial as it is demographic. With fewer workers supporting each
beneficiary with each passing year, the current level of benefits
becomes harder to sustain. Whatever Washington does to encourage
otherwise able-bodied Americans to quit working and paying taxes
will be all the more destructive to both Social Security and
Medicare.

BRAZIL ALLOWS REAL TO FREE FALL; MARKETS REASSURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brazil's currency lost 7 percent of its value Friday after the
government, relenting to pressures on the real, abandoned the fixed
exchange rate in place since 1994. But the widely anticipated move,
rather than shake up financial markets in Latin America, reassured
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovespa stock index, which fell to almost 5000 last week,
gained 30 percent and closed at 6576.71. Brazil led a region-wide
rally of stock markets, with Argentina's market up 12.64 percent.
Mexico's Bolsa rose 7.88 percent amid a surprise strengthening of
the peso.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in Latin America bolstered US stocks, with the Dow
Jones industrial average rising 2.25 percent and recovering most of
the losses caused the previous day from the Brazil shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders and economists are still uncertain about the
ultimate impact of devaluation on vulnerable economies in the
region. But they were hopeful after Friday's relatively good
outcome that it may escape the contagion that roared through Asian
currency markets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A $41.5 billion aid package granted in November by the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders helped contain the
damage, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets totally turned around. The Latin markets have
rallied unbelievably,'' said Jamie Coleman, senior currency analyst
for Thompson Global Markets in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government Friday abandoned the real's peg to the
US dollar and allowed it to float freely after an 8 percent
``minidevaluation'' on Wednesday had failed to calm currency
markets.
</P>
<P>
   After doing so, the real Friday fell to a low of 1.41 to the
dollar, but bounced back to 1.525 real for a 6.8 percent decline
for the day. (Prior to the initial devaluation, the real was pegged
at 1.21 to the dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   Henrique Meirelles, president of BankBoston Corp. and former
head of Brazil operations, applauded the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The danger would have been if devaluation had come ``too late,
if Brazil had run out of reserves,'' Meirelles said. ``They did it
soon enough, when Brazil still had reserves and the IMF lines
weren't used yet. That calmed the markets down.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have fled Brazil because of concerns the country would
not be able to finance a widening trade balance and budget deficit
_ 7.5 percent of gross domestic product _ at a time interest rates
were at extremely high levels.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's reserves plunged by $4.3 billion this week _ reserves
are now half of year-ago levels _ as the central bank fought to
defend the currency. The pressures became unbearable this month
after Itamar Franco, governor of Minas Gerais state, declared a
temporary moratorium on the state's debt to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation was controversial. One faction favored high rates to
attract dollars and keep the real strong and inflation low. Its
champions were the finance minister, Pedro Malan, and central bank
chief, Gustavo Franco, who resigned Wednesday. The other side
wanted to lower rates to spark the economy, at the risk of igniting
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of economic growth in 1998 for Brazil, the biggest
economy in Latin America, range from flat to a decline of as much
as a 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil isn't yet out of the woods, Coleman said. The behavior of
the real next week hinges on government decisions about the future
course of action in meetings with officials in Washington. The
International Monetary Fund, which had disbursed only a portion of
Brazil's rescue package, it would meet with Brazilian officials
before deciding on giving more money.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said that it is possible Brazil would establish a
currency board to monitor the real.
</P>
<P>
   A currency board ``could provide a good deal of short-run
stability in the region,'' Coleman said. If not, a free-floating
real will ``wax and wane the next few weeks as the markets figures
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil introduced the real in 1994 to contain inflation, which
soared at one point to 5000 percent. The currency has served as the
anchor of Brazil's economic recovery since then. Last year,
inflation was only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers purchasing power has just declined while companies
will be under pressure because the cost of their foreign debt has
just soared,'' said Walter Molano, head of research at BCP
Securities in Connecticut. ``This is not good for economic
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior IMF official speaking at a Harvard University forum
Friday expressed confidence that Brazil will achieve the fiscal
targets it agreed to when it accepted an IMF-led economic bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil will in fact achieve the targets agreed with the IMF
because they have put compensative measures in place,'' Stanley
Fischer, first deputy managing director at the IMF, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation was not a requirement of the IMF-led rescue plan.
The plan called for tax increases and spending cuts to slash the
country's $64 billion budget deficit by half this year. The full
slate of measures has yet to be approved by Brazil's Congress.

ONE HAND GRABBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 17, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great arguments of the Reagan years concerned the
relationship between taxing and spending in a democracy. If
Congress had the money, the argument went, members inevitably would
spend it in response to horse-trading among special interest groups
(their own and others). If they didn't have the revenues, they
couldn't start new programs or increase existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the Republican Party strategy for many years was to simply
divorce the topics: tax cuts without spending cuts were okay;
resulting deficits would hold spending in check. This was billed as
a fundamental reform designed to restrain the tendency of
government to expand. The proposition that deficits didn't matter
because they served a useful social purpose provided a peculiar
echo of Keynesian dogma of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Most people thought otherwise, business people in particular.
George Bush reversed the policy in 1990, raising taxes and cutting
spending in order to trim the deficit, and was defeated by the GOP
right wing for his trouble. An odd but effective coalition of Bill
Clinton and Newt Gingrich followed through and balanced the budget
in the mid-1990s. For the moment, at least, we are operating
according to the old conventional wisdom, which holds that in the
eighth year of an expansion, it makes sense to run a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Now the GOP is at it again. Its leaders have promised a big tax
cut next year _ as soon as they finish with President Clinton. The
issues, involving Social Security, are complex. The pork-ish,
election-year budget agreed upon by the president and Congress in
the autumn shows that the GOP has a point: a surplus does indeed
have a way of burning a hole in congressional pockets. On the other
hand, plenty of widely agreed-upon governmental programs are in
need of funds, beginning with Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   A simplified version of this drama played out earlier this month
at the meetings of the American Economic Association in New York
City _ a venue sufficiently similar yet different from Congress
that it casts some less obvious issues into sharp relief.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, here's what happened: Noting a surplus that had
grown to twice its usual level, Harvard professor and Hoover
Institution fellow Robert Barro, one of two vice presidents of the
association, moved to cut the dues, currently $78 a year for senior
members. By a margin of 16 to 1, he was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Ever mindful of the possibilities, Barro drew a moral from his
defeat _ ``Even economists can't wait to spend a surplus'' said the
headline _ in a column he writes regularly for Business Week.
``When the AEA had cash to spare,'' he wrote, ``its leaders vetoed
a `tax cut.' Congress will no doubt act the same way.'' He
concluded, ``This is a cause for despair. After all, if one cannot
trust a group of economists for fiscal restraint, then whom can one
trust?''
</P>
<P>
   (Barro, 54, is no shrinking violet. It was he who took a job at
Columbia University last year, then withdrew after its lavish terms
were disclosed. Fifteen years ago he quit the University of Chicago
after a colleague bested him in a contest for a coveted prize.)
</P>
<P>
   Take a closer look at the facts of the current case.
</P>
<P>
   The American Economic Association, dominated by research
economists and college teachers, is organized along scientific
lines, with a view to establishing consensus among its members over
the widest possible area. It had 20,874 members last year. As
befits a scientific organization, its tendency is elitist: its 17
officers are slated by a nominating committee; the person nominated
to be president runs unopposed, and a long-serving senior staffer
provides continuity, running a small but efficient office not in
Washington, D.C., but in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The AEA's main activity is to publish three scientific journals
(13 book-sized volumes annually in all). It holds a meeting every
year and organizes the job market for economists. Today its annual
budget is about $4 million. Its surplus has swelled in recent years
to about $8 million, or about twice its historic level, thanks
mainly to a rising stock market. (Until 20 years ago, when the
current treasurer took over, the association was chronically in
debt.)
</P>
<P>
   Major uncertainties face the association as electronic
publishing threatens to erode revenues from traditional
subscriptions to its journals. ``Most people belong because of the
journals,'' says D. Gale Johnson, a University of Chicago professor
who is president this year. ``If we couldn't charge for those, we'd
probably have half as many.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, what extravagance did the officers
contemplate? Here is Barro's summary:
</P>
<P>
   ``One person wanted to expand the size of the association's main
journal. Another wanted to fund a series of symposiums. Other ideas
for spending involved research of economic education, an expanded
study of the role of women in the economics profession, and
providing information over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Johnson of such proposals, ``They are not only not radical,
they were't approved.'' He added, ``The association does spend
money on some social programs _ a program for minority students,
for example _ but these things are mostly paid for by grants from
other organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   What's Barro's idea of a real plunge? The only one he mentions
happened years ago on Milton Friedman's watch. Barro says that
Friedman was worried that someone would want to spend a surplus on
some ``socially worthwhile purpose.'' So he started a new journal
to survey current research in all fields instead. Dues later rose
to match the increased spending, according to Barro.
</P>
<P>
   The last 30 years have seen an enormous change in some
economists' views of the state _ indeed, of organizations of all
sorts. Starting with ``public choice'' studies of various sorts of
``government failures'' _ analogous to the ``market failures'' that
had been much-studied for a hundred years _ these insights have
evolved into a searing skepticism directed at anyone interested in
collective action other than business.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry in this derby is ``The Grabbing Hand:
Government Pathologies and Their Cures,'' by two leading lights of
the new generation, Andrei Shleifer of Harvard University and
Robert Vishny of the University of Chicago. The authors of this
newly published collection of papers boldly distinguish between
old-fashioned ``invisible-hand'' economics, the familiar
laissez-faire vision of a minimalist state; ``helping-hand''
economics, a variant that seeks to correct market failures through
many sorts of intervention; and their new-fangled ``grabbing-hand''
economics, which ``typically looks for ways of limiting government
as opposed to expanding its scope.'' Barro is an aficionado of this
grabbing-hand school _ and a perfect example of what is wrong with
it. His column's withering skepticism of the motives of his fellow
officers leaves no room for discussion of the issues on their
merits: their costs and benefits. It attaches no significance to
the fact that the surplus hasn't been spent. And it glosses over
the myriad differences between Congress and the peer-selected
leadership of the AEA. What is gained from blurring the
distinction?
</P>
<P>
   Barro views himself as conservative. But there was nothing
conservative about his proposal to cut the dues. The men and women
who run the AEA these days are the conservatives. The only grabbing
hand at their meetings was Barro's.

DE KLERK UNLEASHES ANGER AT MANDELA IN AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ For years they were inextricably
linked, so much so that while they gingerly shared a government,
their images were routinely sold together in souvenir shops as
salt-and-pepper shakers.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, it was a difficult union.
</P>
<P>
   President Nelson Mandela and former President F.W. de Klerk
negotiated this country's peaceful transition from white
supremacist rule to democracy, then ruled for two years as
president and deputy president, often clasping hands to offer an
image of racial harmony. In 1993, they shared the Nobel Peace
Prize.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of silence about the relationship, de Klerk has
unleashed his anger at Mandela. His autobiography, which is to be
published in London on Tuesday, and an account of it that appeared
in a South African paper yesterday, reel with it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there were hints over the years that the two men did
not like each other much. In 1995 a photographer caught them in a
shouting match in a parking lot. But de Klerk never talked to
interviewers about his feelings toward Mandela, always joking that
he needed to save something for his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Those memoirs, called ``The Last Trek: A New Beginning,'' give
lengthy accounts of the bitter feuds that developed over everything
from politics to whether de Klerk's wife could renovate the
official residence they were assigned after the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela wrote his autobiography in 1994. It describes some of
the same events. But it was published when the two were still in
government together and was restrained in its treatment of de
Klerk.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the president, Parks Mankahlana, said Mandela
had not seen an advance copy of the book and therefore could not
comment on it. ``It would be very difficult anyhow,'' he said.
``This is biographical material and a lot of times it really has to
do with an impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankahlana said, however, that no humiliation was intended when
arrangements were made for housing the de Klerks after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Mail &AMP; Guardian, the South African weekly that
obtained a copy of the book, de Klerk's regard for Mandela began to
slip almost immediately after he ordered his release from jail in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, he wrote, ``failed completely to rise to the occasion''
on the day of his release and delivered a speech in Cape Town that
was ``evidently drafted by hard-line ideologues.''
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Mandela pledged that, until democracy arrived,
his African National Congress would continue the armed struggle,
which he had helped begin 30 years before as the founder of
Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the ANC's guerrilla
army.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in the peace talks that followed came the first major
blowup. De Klerk described fuming at Mandela for what he called
``one of the most vicious personal attacks on a political opponent
that most of those present'' _ at the Convention for a Democratic
South Africa _ had ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accused me of being the head of an illegitimate discredited
minority regime and of being incapable of upholding moral
standards,'' de Klerk wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he piled insult on insult, I found it difficult to control
my fury.'' He wrote that his first reaction ``was to walk to the
microphone and rip off the ANC's mask in the strongest possible
verbal counterattack.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote: ``Mandela spoke long enough to give me time to regain
control of myself'' and ``national interest demanded I should
transcend my own ego.''
</P>
<P>
   When the talks adjourned for Christmas, de Klerk writes that
Mandela shook his hand. ``I accepted Mandela's gesture as
gracefully as I could, but felt that there was no longer any
possibility of our ever again having a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remained that Mandela's vicious and unwarranted
attack created a rift between us that never again fully healed,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Prize ceremony did not improve their relationship.
According to de Klerk, Mandela began attacking him in interviews
even before de Klerk arrived in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently he was not pleased with the decision to include me
in the award,'' de Klerk wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship declined even further after de Klerk lost the
elections in 1994 and a decision had to be made about which
presidential home the de Klerks were to have. At first, Mandela was
expected to move into the Presidency, a house used for the
ceremonial state president under the apartheid government. The de
Klerks were told they could keep the house known as Libertas. But
then Mandela told him de Klerk he was under a lot of pressure to
take Libertas, as it was seen as the home of the head of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sooner had we become used to this idea than he informed us
that he was now under pressure from his senior colleagues to use
the Presidency for other purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The de Klerks were then given Overvaal, a house that had been
used by provincial administrators. The Department of Public Works
agreed that it need substantial refurbishing. But Mandela insisted
on seeing for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final humiliation that I had to endure in the saga of the
official residence was when President Mandela insisted on
personally inspecting Overvaal to satisfy himself that the
refurbishment was, indeed, necessary,'' de Klerk writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One winter Saturday morning he joined me and the public works
architect at Overvaal. Together we walked through the house while
the architect explained why a new fridge was needed here and
repainting and redecoration was needed there.''
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk said it was a matter of ``supreme indifference'' to him
which of the residences they occupied, but not to his wife at the
time, Marike. ``She was deeply distressed by all the chopping and
changing, which she interpreted as a calculated attempt by Mandela
himself to humiliate us.''
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk resigned from South Africa's coalition government in
1996, shortly after the country adopted a new constitution. For a
time, he tried to remake his National Party into a multiracial
organization, but with little success. He retired from politics in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk's book is to be published by MacMillan in England. The
publicity director for the book in South Africa, Adrienne Antonie,
said there were no plans at present to publish the book in the
United States.

AMA JOURNAL EDITOR FIRED FOR USING `HAVING SEX' ARTICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has fired its top-ranking
editor for publishing an article in which a substantial majority of
college students agreed with President Clinton's controversial
contention that oral-genital contact does not constitute ``having
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the article just as Clinton's Senate impeachment trial
is getting under way amounts to ``inappropriately and inexcusably
interjecting JAMA into a major political debate that has nothing to
do with science or medicine,'' AMA Executive Vice President E.
Ratcliffe Anderson said during a press conference Friday. ``This is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Journal of the American Medical Association
editor, Dr. George D. Lundberg, agreed that Friday's firing was all
about politics _ but they said it was the AMA's buttoned-down
leadership that was doing the politicking. ``I read it simply as
the AMA wanting the Republicans to do better than the Democrats,''
said Dr. Tom Delbanco, a professor at Harvard Medical School who
edits the monthly Clinical Crossroads series in JAMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it disgusting,'' Delbanco added.
</P>
<P>
   The JAMA article in question grew out of a 1991 survey of 599
students at an unnamed state university in the Midwest who were
asked 102 questions about their sexual behavior. This new paper
published for the first time the students' answers back then to
America's most hotly-debated question of the last 12 months: the
meaning of the expression ``had sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent of the students said that oral-genital
contact alone did not qualify as sex, which is the same stance
Clinton took during his grand jury testimony and offers the
strongest survey evidence yet that the president's seemingly
legalistic answer is consistent with at least a portion of popular
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the students agreed that penile-vaginal intercourse
constitutes having sex, 81 percent included penile-anal
intercourse, and 2 percent said ``deep kissing'' was enough to
qualify. Fifty-nine percent of the students were women, nearly
twice as many were Republicans as Democrats, and 78.5 percent
called themselves ``moderate to conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the timing of the study, however, and not its substance,
that generated Friday's firestorm of charges and countercharges.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said there was ``some acceleration'' of the normal
review process to get the article into next week's JAMA, which
ensured word of its impending release would get out to the press
this week. ``I don't question the material in there,'' he said.
``But I do very clearly question the judgment of publishing that
material right in the middle of the congressional proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Other AMA officials, however, said the 2 1/2 months it took to
get the piece into print was standard at JAMA, considered one of
the two or three leading medical-scientific publications in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Chicago, where he was recuperating from a
fall on the ice that broke his elbow, Lundberg, 65, declined to
comment on his firing or the way the sex study was handled. But the
study's authors insisted that the review at JAMA was the same as at
other journals where they have published findings from their
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The only speeding up this time was that the planned publication
date of Feb. 2 was moved up two weeks when it was found there was
room in the earlier edition, explained June Machover Reinisch, one
of the authors and director emerita of the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University,
which conducted the student survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they think Dr. Lundberg did, but there was
nothing unusual about the way our article was reviewed and
considered,'' she said, adding that while the article was inspired
by last year's uproar over Clinton's grand jury testimony, ``we
felt all that would likely blow over'' by the time it was published
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of the rival New England
Journal of Medicine, said that ``I would not have published such an
article _ not because of its political sensitivity but because it
sounds silly to me, it sounds trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she added, ``I find it hard to believe that George
Lundberg, a very successful editor of JAMA for 17 years, would be
fired for such a reason . . . George has really done a lot for
JAMA. He has put it on the map as far as I'm concerned. This is
unfortunate for both JAMA and the AMA.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever impact the article might have had otherwise, Friday's
high-profile firing of one of America's most highly-esteemed
editors put it at the center of debate in medical circles and
political ones. It even came up at a White House press briefing,
where Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to comment, saying it
``clearly is an internal matter for the AMA to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   While Anderson was apologizing for the way that ``JAMA has been
misused in the midst of the most important congressional debate of
this century,'' Delbanco suggested that Lundberg actually saved the
publication from a potential scandal. ``What would have happened to
the AMA if this article had been published two months after the
impeachment trial?'' the Harvard professor asked. ``There would
have been outrage over what would have in effect been suppression
of important evidence affecting public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned AMA watchers said last-minute efforts were made by
Lundberg's supporters to save his job, but they were doomed by the
conservative slate of doctors who run the organization, led by
Anderson, who took over last year. Those doctors reportedly have
been upset with Lundberg over a range of topics _ from the special
issue he ran in November on alternative medicine, to his trademark
independence, to this article on college students' views on sex
that they felt was timed to boost Clinton's case before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Friday that two senior editors will fill in
temporarily for Lundberg while an international search is made for
his successor. But William M. Walsh, Lundberg's attorney, said the
ex-editor ``is considering all of his options at this time,
including litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has about 290,000 members, or about 40 percent of US
doctors. Its journal goes worldwide as well as to all its members.

MEDICARE TO PAY HEALTH PLANS MORE FOR ILL PATIENTS, LESS FOR
HEALTHY ONES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare officials said Friday that they would pay
private health plans more for patients who are sick and less for
patients who are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique represents a major change in federal health
policy. It will penalize health maintenance organizations that
avoid sick people and reward those that enroll such patients.
</P>
<P>
   The change will be put into effect gradually over five years,
starting Jan. 1, 2000. Medicare officials said they would make the
change administratively, with authority they received from Congress
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that many HMOs had fattened their profits by
recruiting and enrolling healthy Medicare beneficiaries, a practice
known as risk selection or cherry picking. Dr. Robert Berenson,
director of Medicare's Center for Health Plans and Providers, said
that the new method of payment ``reduces the incentive for cherry
picking.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for people who are elderly or
disabled. Six million of its 39 million beneficiaries are in HMOs,
and 60,000 to 70,000 more enroll every month.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, HMOs could save money for Medicare. But many studies
have found that the government actually loses money because
Medicare HMO patients have tended to be healthier than the average
beneficiary for whom the standard federal payment was calculated.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs now receive a fixed payment for each beneficiary, adjusted
only for a few factors, like the beneficiary's age, sex and county
of residence _ but not for the patient's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays an average of $5,800 a year for each beneficiary
in an HMO. Under the new payment system, HMOs will receive extra
payments for beneficiaries who have been hospitalized in the prior
year for specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus runs from $1,910 a year for a patient with breast
cancer to $26,464 for a person with AIDS. The extra payment would
be $4,666 for heart attack, $5,969 for colon cancer, $8,474 for
stroke, $12,435 for lung cancer and $13,547 for ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Payments for healthy Medicare beneficiaries could be reduced as
much as 20 percent. Berenson said that at least 90 percent of
Medicare HMOs would see their total payments cut, compared with
what they would otherwise have received.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials said the new method of payment would save
$200 million next year and a total of $11.2 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs denounced the changes, saying they would prompt more health
plans to pull out of Medicare. In the last four months, HMOs
dropped more than 400,000 Medicare patients because, they said,
federal payments were not keeping up with costs.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, said, ``The real losers in this fight will be Medicare
beneficiaries.'' The Health Insurance Association of America said
the decision to cut payments was ``a slap in the face to seniors,
and to congressional leaders who see HMOs as the future of
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   HMO executives deny that the organizations shun sick patients.
But they have had immense financial incentives to do so because
they can slash their costs if they avoid even a few of the sickest
patients. Government data show that 5 percent of elderly
beneficiaries account for more than 50 percent of all Medicare
spending on the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said
the new formula would make payments fairer and more accurate.
Medicare officials said it might encourage some HMOs to specialize
in caring for people with cancer or AIDS, because the government
would recognize the extra costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress cut $22 billion
from the projected growth of Medicare payments to HMOs over five
years. But none of those savings came from the changes announced
Friday by Dr. Shalala. Ms. Ignagni said Friday's action would
increase the total savings by 50 percent, beyond what Congress
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials said they would compute a ``risk score'' for
each Medicare patient in an HMO. Patients with serious illnesses
will have high scores, indicating that they will need more services
than the average patient.
</P>
<P>
   In computing these scores, the government will initially use
data on hospital admissions. But for the first four years, it will
not increase payments to HMOs to reflect the extra cost of services
provided in doctors' offices, hospital clinics or patients' homes,
by visiting nurses.
</P>
<P>
   HMO executives said that this omission could create a perverse
incentive for them to hospitalize patients to gain the extra
payments. Medicare officials said they had included safeguards to
discourage such abuse. HMOs have long prided themselves on treating
patients outside hospitals whenever possible.

FRAIL POPE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON ANOTHER MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is growing increasingly frail. He walks with difficulty, and
his speech is slurred. The Vatican halls echo with whispered
worries about his longevity.
</P>
<P>
   But as he approaches the new millennium, Pope John Paul II is
determined to continue doing what will mark him as one of history's
most influential pontiffs _ carrying the papal flag to all corners
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Embarking on his 85th trip, the peripatetic 78-year-old arrives
next Friday in Mexico. After five days there, he flies to St. Louis
to deliver his millennium message to the America's nearly 60
million Roman Catholics and meet privately with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after he visited Mexico in his first journey as
pope, John Paul returns to the nation with the second largest
number of Catholics in the world (88 million) to celebrate the
achievements of a pontificate that has been a watershed in the
church's nearly 2000-year history.
</P>
<P>
   This visit is more than a victory lap. On the eve of a new
millennium, John Paul is determined to keep the Roman Catholic
Church a vital, dominant institution in the world. The best way to
do that, he believes, is to maintain a visible, dynamic and
powerful papacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope arrives next week on a continent where the church
is struggling to minister to more Catholics with fewer priests.
This shortage is one reason the church is losing a steady flow of
believers to Protestant, especially Pentecostal, denominations.
Today, one out of 10 Latin Americans are Protestants. In the next
decade, some scholars believe, that figure could skyrocket to one
out of three.
</P>
<P>
   While it would be surprising if the pope addressed the issue
directly, he hopes on this trip to counter the inroads that the
Protestant churches have made among Catholics in Mexico and
throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to exhort the Catholic church in the
Americas to pay greater attention to the spiritual needs of the
faithful, while at the same time being a strong voice for political
and economic justice.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico and St. Louis, John Paul will stress themes that have
been hallmarks of his papacy: the perils of unbridled
individualism, consumerism, and capitalism, and the responsiblity
of the rich to tend to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the best antidote for the evils of the world are in the
Gospel and in the teachings of the church. It is his job to carry
that message to the world as long as he physically can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John Paul has changed the papacy forever,'' said
Joseph M. Incandela, chairman and associate professor of religious
studies at St. Mary College in Notre Dame, Ind. ``From now on the
world will expect traveling popes. John Paul has come to believe
that his duties as shepherd to his church are best served by having
a real physical presence with his people. I think he understands
the power of that presence.''
</P>
<P>
   He may no longer be the vibrant 58-year-old who electrified
millions of Mexicans with his charisma and boundless energy in
1979, but John Paul still looms larger than life for many
Catholics. He is a world figure who can still command huge
audiences and intense media attention wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who has a rather mystical notion of his role in
human history,'' said Tim Byrnes, associate professor of political
science at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. ``He apparently
believes that his pontificate is a special historic moment in human
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his pontificate, John Paul has positioned the Roman
Catholic Church against any forces that threaten individual
freedom, human dignity, and the common good. When he became pope,
the threat was communism.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe that John Paul played a key role in
toppling communism through the moral and material support he
provided the anti-communist movement in his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   With communism largely consigned to the history books, John Paul
believes that the Roman Catholic Church must now confront a
different challenge _ a Western culture that he believes is morally
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is no longer facing Communism,'' said the Rev.
Richard McBrien, a professor of theology at the University of Notre
Dame. ``The church is facing a new opponent _ secularism, the
denial of the sacred, the idea that you can do whatever you feel
like doing, and that you don't have any responsibility to others.
He thinks the church must present a strong united front against
these enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics contend that John Paul has driven a wedge between
the church hierarchy and the many rank and file Catholics,
especially in the United States and Europe, who disagree with many
of the church teachings on sexual morality and the role of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have in this pope is a return to an exaggerated view
of the papacy as a kind of absolute monarchy,'' McBrien said.
``It's as if the pope alone determines waht Catholics should
believe and how they should behave.''
</P>
<P>
   But his defenders say the pope is a courageous champion of
religious truths that run counter to the liberal views in vogue
among many Catholic theologians and liberal lay people. ``He
operates from Catholic social teaching, not from the fads or
ideologies of the day,'' said Robert D. Benne, professor of
religion and philosophy at Roanoke College in Salem, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's official purpose for traveling to Mexico is to give
his response to recommendations given him during the Synod of
Bishops Special Assembly for America, which was held at the Vatican
in late 1997. The synod was the first of of a series of regional
gatherings of bishops the pope has convened to prepare the church
for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   One of the paramount concerns of the bishops of North, Central
and South America is the widening gulf between the rich and poor, a
chasm exacerbated by global ecnomic policies and the staggering
foreign debt owed by so many Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of economic justice between the north and the
south has been a very strong theme of his papacy,'' said the Rev.
Thomas Reese, the editor of America magazine, a Jesuit publication
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the homily he delivered to the bishops of the Americas two
years ago, John Paul cited the missionaries who carried
Christianity to the Americas 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time of the new evangelization, a providential
occasion to lead the people of God in America to cross the
threshold of the third millennium with renewed hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a message John Paul is expected to repeat on his trip, he
told the prelates that they can ``contribute to spreading
throughout America that much desired civilization of love, which
places much value on the primacy of man and the promotion of human
dignity in all its dimensions, starting from the spiritual
dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the pope begins 1999 driven by an intense desire to
lead the world's 1 billion Catholics into the year 2000. ``The
turning of the millennium certainly seems to energize the pope,''
Benne said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul plans to trace Abraham's footsteps, starting in Iraq
later this year. And he yearns to hold a summit in Israel next year
with Jews and Muslims at Mount Sinai and to visit Bethlehem and
Nazareth.

VOLVO BUYS PART OF TRUCK MAKER, DENIES MOVE FORESHADOWS SALE OF CAR
DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- VOLVO-SCANIA- NYT  (rk) 
 By   ALAN COWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Volvo A.B., the Swedish maker of cars, buses and
trucks, purchased a 13 percent stake in a rival Swedish truck
manufacturer, Scania AB, Friday for 5.2 billion kronor ($666.5
million) and said it wanted to take over the entire company.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase by Volvo, which paid a 16 percent premium to
Scania's closing share price on Thursday, values all of Scania at
about $5.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's move, however, ran into opposition from the powerful
Wallenberg family, whose investment arm, Investor AB, controls 45.5
percent of Scania.
</P>
<P>
   Claes Dahlback, president and chief executive of Investor AB,
said in a statement, ``It is unfortunate that Volvo, with this
action, has made discussions that have been conducted so far more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Investor ``as the largest owner in Scania,
has been contacted by and has had discussions not only with Volvo
but also with other companies in the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention,'' he continued, ``is to find the best future
strategy for Scania, and thus also create value for Scania's
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Volvo said an acquisition would create Europe's biggest, and the
world's second-largest, maker of heavy trucks and buses, and it
denied that the move was a foreshadowing of a sale of its car
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not true,'' said a Volvo spokesman, Stefan Lorentzson,
commenting on speculation among analysts that Volvo, the smallest
of Europe's volume auto producers, was consolidating its
truck-building division as a precursor to selling its car division.
``We will not sell Volvo's car division,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the Ford Motor Co., Fiat SpA. of Italy, and
Volkswagen and BMW of Germany, among other companies, have been
mentioned as possible buyers of Volvo. The speculation comes as the
global auto industry consolidates to deal with problems of
overcapacity, soaring costs and fierce competition. After last
year's merger of Daimler-Benz of Germany and the Chrysler Corp.
there has been much discussion that other combinations would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Lorentzson of Volvo said Friday , ``We are in discussion with
lots of car makers,'' specifically mentioning Ford, Fiat and
Volkswagen. But he insisted that while Volvo sought to expand its
truck and heavy equipment manufacturing through ``acquisitions and
organic growth,'' it was only seeking a ``limited partnership'' for
its car manufacturing division.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures are similar in the truck industry, where margins
are generally higher than in cars, but where the prospect of
falling business investment in Europe is likely to squeeze
producers, pressing companies toward cost-saving consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Stockholm, Leif Johansson, Volvo's chief
executive, said: ``Mercedes has bought Freightliner in the U.S. and
is starting to cooperate with Nissan Diesel, and these moves have
triggered us into acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither we nor Scania can just stand at the sidelines and
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, Europe's seventh-largest car manufacturer, produced about
360,000 cars and 83,000 heavy trucks last year.
</P>
<P>
   The American depository receipts of Scania jumped more than 20
percent Friday, rising $4.625 to close at $27.125, while the ADRs
of Volvo fell 50 cents, to $27.75.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Several minutes after Jets coach Bill Parcells
had finished screaming at one of his players for dropping a pass at
training camp last summer, Aaron Glenn, a cornerback, figured it
was safe to approach. Glenn positioned himself next to the beefy
Jets coach and asked a simple question: What did Parcells think
about the coming season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lookit,'' said Parcells, using one of his favorite phrases,
``I ain't no five-year-plan man, I ain't no four-year-plan man, I'm
a win-right-now man. You know what? We're going to be special this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   His prediction surprised Glenn, but Parcells is used to
surpassing expectations when it comes to pulling a football team
from the ashes. He did it with the New York Giants, transforming a
beleaguered franchise into a two-time Super Bowl winner. He did it
with the New England Patriots, taking over a team that won only two
games in 1992 and leading it to the Super Bowl four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nothing in Parcells' resume compares with what he has
accomplished with the Jets. They won just one game out of 16 in
1996, then brought in Parcells and his Mr. Fix-it reputation. The
Jets went 9-7 last year, just missing the playoffs, and this season
were 12-4 and won their division championship for the first time in
three decades. On Sunday, they play the Denver Broncos with a trip
to Super Bowl XXXIII at stake.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets win, Parcells will have carried the Jets to
football's ultimate game after only two seasons, and become the
first to coach three different teams in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the challenge in football,'' Parcells, 57, said this
week. ``Hey, we might never have the opportunity to do this again.
You get this close, and you hope you can just keep it going
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In playing the role of master architect, there is definitely a
Parcells formula. He possesses organizational skills as strong as
any Fortune 500 executive. He has the unusual ability to
simultaneously relate with, and intimidate, his players. He owns an
arsenal of terror tactics that puts high-ranking members of the
team as well as members of the media _ the latter he sometimes
refers to as ``communists'' _ in line like children.
</P>
<P>
   Much like executives brought in to shake up struggling
corporations, Parcells' record of success and blunt approach create
the climate for change. Usually, soon after he storms into town,
there is a massive purge. Out with the old, and in with the coaches
and players who believe in him. Jets linebacker Bryan Cox calls
these people ``FOBs'' _ Friends of Bill's. What you don't want to
be is what Parcells calls a ``JAG'' _ Just Another Guy. A ``JAG''
is soon shown the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two types of people on a Bill Parcells team,''
linebacker Pepper Johnson said earlier this season, ``the people
who will follow him, and the people who won't. The people who won't
are usually gone before sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has always been a popular figure, especially in the New
York area. But his instant turnaround of the Jets has made him a
larger-than-life personality. His face is on national television
commercials, and his name fills sports-talk radio. He last coached
in New England two years ago, but he is still talked about in
Boston more than the current Patriots' coach, Pete Carroll, who has
wilted in Parcells' shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``To follow in the footsteps of Bill Parcells,'' said Minnesota
Vikings Coach Dennis Green, ``you have to be Sasquatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Parcells tries to manufacture an everyman image _ just a
blue-collar guy from Oradell, N.J., who still stops at his favorite
diners for chicken pot pie _ he is one of the richest coaches in
football, earning between $3 to $4 million a year. In fact, the
only thing comparable to his fat wallet is his outsized ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what makes him so successful is extreme
self-confidence,'' said Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell.
</P>
<P>
   He has the drive and will necessary to succeed in a brutal and
regimented profession, and he has continued despite health problems
that include four heart procedures in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season began, only Parcells thought a trip to the
Super Bowl this year was possible for the Jets. If one looks at the
Jets' recent history, it is easy to understand why he was alone in
his optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Jets tasted a championship was 30 years ago,
when Joe Namath fulfilled his prediction of a victory in Super Bowl
III. The Jets haven't been back to the title game since, and their
last playoff appearance was in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After the hiring of Rich Kotite in 1995, the Jets' octogenarian
owner, Leon Hess, proclaimed, ``I want to win, and I want to win
now.'' But Kotite was a disaster, infamous for his sloppy
practices. He was fired after two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Parcells, an old-fashioned, no-nonsense coach with a sharp
tongue and the face of a truck driver. Parcells was available
because of a bitter dispute with Patriots owner Robert Kraft over
the issue of control _ Parcells wanted all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells got it with the Jets. And the first thing he did upon
arriving in New York was make sure that only once voice spoke for
the organization _ his. Parcells stripped practically all power
from the team's president, Steve Gutman, who has been with the Jets
for over two decades. Then he surrounded himself with assistant
coaches and other loyalists with whom he has spent most of his
professional life, including his long-time friend and defensive
coordinator Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   No coach or member of Jets management is allowed to speak to
anyone in the media without the permission of Parcells _ there is
even a clause to this effect in the contract of at least one high
ranking team executive. A violation can mean a hefty fine. The
excessive control is done for a reason: Everyone is kept in line
behind one leader, Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're with him, he basically tells you what to do, when
to do it, and how to do it,'' said Dave Atkins, a tight ends coach
with the Minnesota Vikings who was an assistant under Parcells in
New England in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the restrictions, assistants are loyal because Parcells
pays them well and he always wins. But there is another reason:
fear. Many in the Jets are terrified of Parcells, from executives
to secretaries to people in the public relations department. Agents
say that when they are on the phone with Mike Tannenbaum, the Jets'
director of player contract negotiations, they can hear Parcells
screaming and cursing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is his main tenet,'' said Bob Kratch, a former offensive
lineman who played for Parcells with the Giants and Patriots. ``He
believes people perform better when they are afraid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While some of Parcells' tactics are considered ruthless, even
cruel, they are largely responsible for the team reaching this
critical, breathtaking stage. Also, because Parcells streamlined
the organization, it allowed him to make a number of key moves
without interference.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells lured running back Curtis Martin away from the Patriots
by signing him to a six-year, $36 million contract; in the process,
Parcells came perilously close to flouting the league rules
governing the salary cap, prompting the league to look into the
signing, but in the end Parcells got what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Next Parcells cut without remorse quarterback Neil O'Donnell,
dismissing the fact that the team had invested $25 million in him.
To replace O'Donnell, he signed free agent Vinny Testaverde, who'd
had a checkered career with several mediocre teams.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of the quarterback situation this season was
classic Parcells. After anointing the youthful Glenn Foley as the
starter, Parcells was forced by injury and Foley's ineffectiveness
to switch to Testaverde during the season, then left the starter's
job up in the air for several weeks. Normally, a quarterback
controversy is a disruptive force that can divide a team. Not when
Parcells is the coach. He defused it through the sheer force of his
personality: There was no quarterback controversy simply because he
said there wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Having cast his lot with Testaverde, Parcells put him in a
system that enabled him to succeed. Testaverde had been prone to
fourth-quarter mental meltdowns throughout his career, but Parcells
taught him to be a patient passer, utilizing his running backs and
tight ends as receivers and avoiding interceptions and fumbles. He
recognized that Testaverde got into trouble mostly when he tried to
run out of the pocket, so he provided the quarterback with more
outlets _ receivers and running backs with good hands _ as options
when he got in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With a versatile offense and the support of assistants that
included a former head coach, Dan Henning, as a quarterbacks coach,
Testaverde became the highest rated quarterback in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells performed a similar turnaround for Cox, a combustible
player who had been fined $146,000 by the NFL throughout his
nine-year career in Chicago and Miami because of violent outbursts
on the field. Cox has been generally well behaved and has even
become a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep going back to Stick Michael,'' Parcells said, speaking
of the former Yankees general manager. ``He used to say, `This
year, if you need a third baseman, you're going to get a third
baseman.' That was prophetic, some of the best advice I've ever
gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we needed a center, so we tried to get a center,''
said Parcells. ``It's not about getting a superstar here and there.
It's about putting a team together and structuring it so your needs
are met, not the public's need or the media's need.''
</P>
<P>
   But what puts Parcells above other coaches is how he extracts
the most from his players. Superstitious and routine driven, his
psychological ploys would fill a therapist's notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells does not believe in injuries. His players play hurt
because it is easier to endure the pain of a sore knee or elbow
than a Parcells glare or nasty remark. In the 1-15 season, Jets
players seemed to take up permanent residence on the injured list;
23 players missed a total of 130 games. This season, five players
have missed 15 games. Rookie right tackle Jason Fabini missed only
one play all season, and that was when he couldn't tie his shoelace
because of the cast on his broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before a crucial Monday night game against the
Patriots in October, Parcells stormed out of practice, pulling his
assistant coaches with him. The message was clear: he didn't like
how his team was performing. Since the outburst, the Jets have gone
11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before Christmas, Parcells thought Cox was getting
tired. So Parcells bought a gas can and put it inside Cox's locker
with a note that read ``Is there any gas left in your tank?'' Cox
suddenly had an extra skip in his step.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells will cut an out-of-shape player without warning on the
first day of training camp or call players cowards in front of the
entire team. If Parcells perceives a player as soft, he can be
ruthless. In New England, he denigrated the rookie receiver Terry
Glenn at a news conference by referring to Glenn as ``she'' _ an
incident that was severely criticized by those who felt the coach
had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Kratch said he admires Parcells, but added that ``he could be
the nastiest person you ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells constantly reminds his players and staff who is in
control. When he thought players were publicly talking too much
about each other's injuries, he threatened to fine the entire team
one week's pay. During a recent game, Belichick wanted to run the
defense one way, Parcells another. In front of coaches and players,
Parcells launched into a profanity-laced tirade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you got fired in Cleveland!'' Parcells yelled.
``You think you know everything! That's why you won't be a head
coach again!''
</P>
<P>
   But because Parcells is a winner, players and others in the Jets
endure his system, and many players are extremely loyal to him.
When Parcells addresses the team before games, his voice careening
through the locker room, players said they often believe he is
speaking only to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the man tells you there's cheese on the mountain,'' said
fullback Keith Byars, ``you better bring crackers.''

SPAIN'S FIRST- AND THIRD-LARGEST BANKS WILL COMBINE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ALAN GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Banco Santander, Spain's largest bank, said
Friday that it is buying Banco Central Hispano, the nation's
third-biggest bank, in a stock swap that is valued at $11.3 billion
and is expected to lift the merged bank into Europe's top 20 by
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Santander, which will provide three of its shares for every five
shares of Banco Central Hispano, said the new bank would be called
Banco Santander Central Hispano.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks insisted that the deal was a merger of equals, but
Santander chairman Emilio Botin, 64, said his shareholders would
control 64 percent of the new business, while Banco Central
Hispano's shareholders will have 36 percent after the deal is
completed in April.
</P>
<P>
   The combined bank will have assets of 239 billion euros, now
$277 billion. About a third of it is invested in Latin America,
controlling major banks in Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Brazil. The
new bank will have a small presence elsewhere in Europe but little
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is the first great banking
operation since the start of the euro,'' Botin said.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover continues a trend of consolidation in European
banking, which has mainly occurred within national boundaries.
Botin and Banco Central Hispano chairman Jose Maria Amusategui, 66,
will be co-chairmen until the latter retires in 2002, leaving Botin
in charge.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase, Santander will widen its lead in Spanish
banking, increasing its market share to about 20 percent. In the
early 1980s, it was among the smallest of the major Spanish banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that Botin was more aggressive than others in
launching new products and gaining market share,'' said Jose Luis
de Mora, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. ``I think he
will try to buy banks in Italy and France to create a pan-European
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Banco Central Hispano comes to the deal after cutting about
10,000 jobs, a third of its work force, since 1991, when it was
formed through the merger of Banco Central and Banco Hispano
Americano.
</P>
<P>
   The first big Spanish bank restructuring occurred in 1988 when
two financial institutions formed Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, still the
nation's second largest, with $152 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Bilbao welcomed Friday's takeover and brushed off
questions about whether it planned new alliances with the few
remaining major independent Spanish banks, including Argentaria and
Banco Popular. Santander executive vice president Ana Botin, 37,
who some analysts think is being groomed to replace her father, the
chairman, said of Friday's deal: ``There's never a perfect time. We
think this is the best it can get. BCH has an important industrial
base that Santander did not have.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bank will have 8,681 offices, mainly in Spain, and
106,500 employees, more than half abroad. An executive said no
decisions had yet been reached on job cuts.

LATIN STOCK MARKETS RALLY, BUT ANALYSTS ARE STILL CONCERNED
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Stock markets throughout Latin America
rebounded strongly Friday on hopes that Brazil's currency would not
tumble out of control. But analysts warned that several countries
in the region faced a period of extreme economic volatility, with
the likelihood of devaluations, rising interest rates and growing
unemployment through the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Brazilian stock market's spectacular 33.4 percent
rise Friday, Argentina's stock market rose 12.3 percent, while
Mexican stocks climbed 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a consensus has emerged among Latin American and
Wall Street economists that the region is facing a year of flat
growth, rising unemployment, disappointing corporate earnings and
sliding government tax receipts. Pressure on currencies throughout
the region _ particularly in Mexico, Venezuela, Peru, Chile and
Colombia _ are mounting, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   As the largest market in Latin America, Brazil's weaker currency
is bound to put competitive pressure on its regional trading
partners. Those pressures will only grow as the Brazilian
devaluation helps to drive down the international prices of
commodities crucial to Latin America's economic health _ namely
oil, grains, paper goods, and metals like copper and tin _ as most
economists expect.
</P>
<P>
   In oil-dependent Ecuador, for example, interbank interest rates
this week soared to 140 percent while the central bank spent $90
million in a desperate and probably vain attempt to defend its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   A report by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell this week forecast ``a
sharp deterioration in the outlook for economic growth in Latin
America.'' From a projection of 3.5 percent growth for all of Latin
America made six months ago, the investment banking firm now
projects a negative 0.1 percent growth rate for the region this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But while the economic picture is far from healthy, economists
and government officials say that Latin America is not poised for
the kind of economic and political shocks that have shaken Asia in
the last year. Latin America's economies are not as dependent on
foreign trade as, say, Japan or Thailand, and the shocks from
Brazil's sliding currency have not come with the same suddenness as
the Asian financial contagion of late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And while Argentina came under the most pressure from stock
selling by international investors earlier in the week, analysts
said its banks and government were in good shape to withstand the
Brazilian shock waves largely because the peso was pegged
one-to-one to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's stability, economists noted, is tied to the fact
that only 8 percent of its economy is based on foreign trade and
because President Carlos Saul Menem is committed to keeping the
peso pegged one-to-one to the dollar. That policy diminishes the
possibility of a return to the days of hyperinflation and galloping
devaluations. Underscoring the success of his monetary policy,
Menem on Friday called on all of Latin America to establish a
common currency based on the dollar. The suggestion received no
immediate support around the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reasons to hope things will settle down and we are
close to bottoming out,'' said Raul Elizalde, head of fixed income
research at Santander Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to paint too rosy a picture,'' said Donald
Hoskins, the manager of U.S. Trust's Excelsior Latin America fund,
``but there is relief that Brazil is not going to try the
impossible task of defending a partial devaluation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Charles Clough, an influential stock analyst at
Merrill Lynch, told institutional investors in a conference call
Friday that the rebound in the Latin American markets signaled a
good opportunity to sell Latin stocks and move money into Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent views reflect the uncertainty of how far the
Brazilian real will fall in the coming days and months, and whether
Brasilia will be able to slowly decrease interest rates to spawn
higher growth rates in the months ahead. Should Brazil be able to
stabilize its currency quickly, analysts say, its consumers will be
able to resume buying Argentine automobiles and Chilean wines and
the regional economy will resume the steady growth of the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts agreed that the fallout of Brazil's crisis
would vary widely around the region.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela escaped much of the stock market turbulence of the
last week. But it is the country attracting the most concern of
economists and stock market analysts largely because of the low
price of oil, which is responsible for up to half of the
government's revenues. President-elect Hugo Chavez, a populist who
led a failed coup in 1992, is still an unknown quantity and most
analysts say he will be faced with an almost immediate economic
crisis when he is inaugurated next month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the bolivar, Venezuela's currency, may be
overvalued by as much as 50 percent, making a devaluation likely in
the coming months. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell predicts the bolivar,
now 570 to the dollar, will slide to almost 900 to the dollar by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's central bank reserves, used for paying interest on
the debt and cushioning the debt, are down to $10 billion from $17
billion a year ago. Interest rates have climbed to 35 percent from
15 percent at the end of 1997, and economists predict they will
climb to more than 40 percent by the end of the year, forcing the
country into a deep recession.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential trouble spot is Mexico, where Jane Heap, Latin
American strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, predicted, ``you
will see volatility in the peso.'' Mexico's currency in the last
week alone has seesawed between 8 and 11 to the dollar, putting
added pressure on its stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   In economic terms, analysts said, the peso's shakiness is likely
to generate increased inflation, which in turn will bring down real
wages. The government has been trying to lower interest rates below
30 percent, but now most economists think they will go higher.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists feel that Argentina looks best able to weather
the crisis, even though it is currently attracting the most concern
of international investors because Brazil represents 30 percent of
its foreign trade. Argentina's automobile industry will be hard hit
in the coming year, but the country is expected to easily find
other foreign markets for its beef and agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Brazil or Mexico or Venezuela where a confidence crisis
means that people sell assets or withdraw money from banks in order
to buy dollars,'' said Joaquin Cottani, chief Latin American
economist at Lehman Brothers, ``the government in Argentina is calm
and it has reason to be so.'' While Argentina's Merval stock market
index has gone on a wild ride the last three days, Argentines have
not moved assets out of their banks, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most economists believe Argentina is heading into
a recession because of the downturn in Brazil. Merrill Lynch, for
instance, has lowered its 1999 gross domestic product forecast this
week from positive 2.1 percent to negative 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row, Argentine officials Friday denied
any intention to budge from their currency peg to the dollar or
from any other free-market policy. ``Argentina has competitiveness
beyond Brazil,'' said Economy Minister Roque Fernandez, who added
that new grain markets could be found with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean officials in recent
days have made strong statements denying any intentions to devalue
their currencies abruptly, and so far their currency markets have
remained largely stable. Still, analysts predicted that interest
rates would rise in all three countries as the governments
struggled to defend against speculators.

`NUREMBERG' WEB SITE TRIAL INTENSIFIES ABORTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ No one directly threatened Dr. Robert Crist.
But his name appears on a ``wanted'' poster, complete with a $500
reward.
</P>
<P>
   No one took a shot at him. But his name is included on an
Internet Web site called ``The Nuremberg Files,'' beneath drawings
of dripping blood and mangled fetuses. The names of some other
doctors who perform abortions are shaded in gray; they are the ones
who were wounded by antiabortion zealots. Those killed have been
crossed off.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Missouri doctor who performs abortions took the
witness stand in federal court this week, he wore the same
bulletproof vest he wears to social gatherings, a clear sign of the
threat he feels from the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Together with three other doctors, a Portland-area chapter of
Planned Parenthood, and another clinic, Crist is suing a dozen of
the more militant opponents to abortion. The multimillion-dollar
lawsuit charges that the Web site and a ``Deadly Dozen'' poster
unveiled in 1995 constitute illegal threats.
</P>
<P>
   The men and woman on trial counter that theirs is a
constitutionally protected expression of opinion, intended only as
political protest.
</P>
<P>
   The eight jurors in the civil case will have to decide which is
more important, the right to work free of intimidation or the right
to free speech. Activists on both sides of the abortion issue call
the line fine, even blurry.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, the verdict could have implications
for abortion providers and antiabortion activists nationwide.
Although the parameters of abortion protest are already being
tested in other courtrooms, the case is the first unrelated to a
direct threat or confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, a decision for the doctors could have a
severe chilling effect on political debate on important issues,''
said David Fidanque, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Portland. ``On the other hand, the First
Amendment should not be used as a shield to terrorize people.
Finding the line between the two is not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   US District Court Judge Robert E. Jones earlier found that the
poster and Web site _ which labels the 200-plus doctors listed as
``baby butchers'' and features some home addresses, car license
plate numbers, and relatives' names _ contained no explicit
threats. But the jury can consider whether a reasonable person
would have felt threatened in the overall atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, at least six doctors who performed abortions
and abortion clinic workers have been wounded or murdered. Unlike
the more mainstream antiabortion movement, the defendants refused
to condemn the violence and, instead, some of them hailed the
murders as justifiable homicide. The ``Deadly Dozen'' list was
released just weeks after John Salvi shot and killed two clinic
workers in Brookline, Mass. Clinics around the country have been
bombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take those words in this context, the jury could very
well find that they were intended to incite violence,'' said Bonnie
Jones, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in
New York. ``It's a very different question than just asking whether
these acts did incite violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants insist that inciting violence was not their
intent. Among them are the American Coalition of Life Advocates
(ACLA), an umbrella organization for several antiabortion groups,
and Bruce Evan Murch, a former Northeast director of ACLA and
leader of the Christian Pro-Life Action Network who lives in the
Springfield, Mass., area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opinions? Yes, sometimes harsh,'' defense attorney Chris
Ferrara said during opening statements. ``But no violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The abortion providers say the fear of violence forced them to
file suit under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,
which makes inciting violence against them or their patients
illegal. The suit seeks as much as $200 million and an injunction
to prevent similar future conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more mainstream antiabortion groups have shunned the
defendants. They say they do not condone violence against anyone or
the sort of ugliness apparent in the ``Nuremberg Files,'' which
purports to collect information in the event the doctors are ever
brought to trial for their ``crimes against humanity,'' as the
Nazis were after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   However, some also say they are troubled by the free-speech
implications of the case. One concern is that the next trial could
be about the legality of phrases commonly used by abortion
opponents, such as ``murderers.'' They wonder whether the next
court challenge will be against the signs protesters carry outside
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there is no free-speech right to incite murder,''
said William Cotter, president of Operation Rescue Boston, an
antiabortion group. ``(But) if this case is lost, it will give fuel
to different arguments about prior restraint, the kinds of signs we
can carry, whether we can even identify an abortionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is that a victory for the clinics and doctors
would drive the most radical antiabortion activists further
underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find their views morally reprehensible but legally viable,''
said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, an abortion opponent who heads the
Christian Defense Coalition in Washington, D.C. ``The hard-core
prolife people are not going to be deterred by paying civil
damages. The loss of this case will just send a message to them
that there is no hope in the printed word, no hope in free
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney went on to say that he rejected the ``fire in the
theater'' analogy that some abortion-rights advocates have used to
justify restraints on speech. For instance, the Web site _ an
electronic version of information that the defendants have
collected since 1996 and whose creator is not named in the lawsuit
_ contains no specific instructions to murder doctors or bomb
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pictures are one thing. This is far more opaque,'' said Rodney
Smolla, a First Amendment specialist and law professor at the
University of Richmond in Virginia. ``You start getting down to the
details, where the doctors live, what kind of car they drive. Some
of it could be hard for the defendants to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in court, Portland defendant Andrew Burnett broke
down in tears as he explained that killing an abortion provider to
save an unborn life might be justified. He also conceded that the
``Dirty Dozen'' poster could be taken as intimidation. ``If I was
an abortionist,'' he said, ``I would be afraid.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Likened to Martin Luther King and doused with praise
for the economy's strength, President Clinton was celebrated on
Wall Street Friday at a conference of minority and white
businessmen while, back in Washington, House prosecutors assailed
him for a second day before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ya done good, William Jefferson Clinton,'' said Susan Taylor,
editor of Essence Magazine. She advised him to ``be gentle with
yourself'' because ``only God is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grasso, president of the New York Stock Exchange, told
Clinton that King was surely smiling down on the gathering. ``He's
recognizing what you've done for this country,'' he said, as he
described how Clinton's presidency had benefited ``my little corner
of southern Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who organized the conference to
promote diversity on Wall Street, told the president that the only
people with ``clean uniforms'' were those who lacked the confidence
of their coaches to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who play have stains on their uniforms,'' he said, as
the crowd, gathered in Windows on the World at the top of the World
Trade Center, responded with cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said they learned only at the last minute that
Jackson had arranged for the series of eight testimonials before
Clinton spoke. The president sat solemnly, growing red in the face,
as speaker after speaker touted his achievements in a session that
combined the whooping of a revival with the statistics-spouting of
a shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally stepped to the lectern, Clinton observed that
such nice compliments were usually paid at funerals. Breaking into
a grin, he jabbed a hand in front of him and added, ``And I don't
think we're there yet!'' The crowd rose in a clamorous ovation.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, it was another day of the brutal juxtapositions
that have come to define his presidency, as the House prosecutors
attacked him for corroding his office while, in speeches in New
York and Washington, he spoke of his hopes for renewing faith in
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging, ruminative address, the president spoke
Friday morning to a conference at the State Department on making
government more efficient, saying that ``this is about, in my
judgment, the preservation of the vitality of democracy.'' He
added: ``To the extent that people do not believe their
representatives will handle their money for public purposes the way
they themselves would, democracy is itself diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who flew up to New York Friday morning after his flight
Thursday was postponed because of icy weather, returned to
Washington after the conference for a fund-raiser Friday night on
behalf of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, the day was another opportunity to
demonstrate that neither sleet nor snow nor prosecution in the
Senate would stay Clinton from his duties. But such strategy aside,
the president was plainly enjoying himself. He clearly relished the
praise as well as the opportunities to tout before appreciative
audiences the sorts of issues _ government reform and economic
development _ that have been hallmarks of his quarter-century
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Senate trial was never far from sight. One of the
participants in the Wall Street conference was Lanny Davis, the
former White House strategist and spokesman, now a lawyer in
private practice who still informally advises the president.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Clinton arrived, Davis, illuminated by a
television light, stood at the back of the jammed, low-ceilinged
hall, declaring of the House prosecution: ``Been there, done that,
there's nothing new in this whole thing.'' His name tag identified
him as attending the conference on behalf of Motel 6, a client.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the businessmen, several Congressmen, including Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority leader, attended the
conference. Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice-presidential
candidate, was seated before the lectern as Clinton spoke. When the
president said, ``I always liked him,'' Kemp shot back, ``I like
you too, President.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's predicament was much on the minds of those in
the room. An appreciative murmur rippled through, for example, when
Ms. Taylor said that because of Clinton's ``bravery'' in hiring
women and minorities, ``some hardened hearts are bent on punishing
you.'' She continued, ``We black women, we just want to say thank
you, thank you for including us, and not demonizing our men.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to King and Clinton, Dr. Emma Chappell, president of
United Bank of Philadelphia, said they shared a love of justice and
civil rights. ``Tragically, one was assassinated and one is now
persecuted,'' she said. King would have just turned 70.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&AMP;T, did not refer to the
president's travails, but he also did not stint his praise of
Clinton's economic stewardship. ``You had the courage to get it
started,'' he said, adding that everyone was then able to take the
greatest ``economic ride in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also compared the president to King. ``What you are
about as a public-policy leader represents the fulfillment of his
dream,'' he said. Then he likened him to Babe Ruth, noting that
Ruth was remembered for his home runs rather than his numerous
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, what is your box score?'' he asked.
``That's how God judges us.''

SENATE LEADERS WEIGH INVITING CLINTON TO TESTIFY AT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican leaders said Friday they may
invite President Clinton to testify at his Senate impeachment trial
to defend against charges of covering up a sexual relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   John Cwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said the proposal was ``an idea that appears to be
percolating'' within the ranks of Senate Republicans. The aide said
no decision had been made to invite Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Clinton appearing, Lott replied: ``That's up to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the influential chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Clinton ``ought to be invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said Clinton's testimony would be
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether an invitation will be issued, but I
really think it's up to the president and if he wants to testify,
there's no question that he would be permitted to do so,'' Kyl
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Democrats also said they were open to the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who headed the Senate Judiciary
Committee before Democrats lost control of the Senate in 1994, said
he was ``prepared to hear arguments'' about issuing an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His appearance or nonappearance, if specifically requested by
a majority of the Senate in the form of a subpoena, would in fact
be a political judgment for him to make _ whether or not resisting
coming would in fact impact on the votes in the Senate,'' Biden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Biden added: ``If 100 senators stood up and said, `We want the
president,' then (the) political dynamic changes.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors pressed senators for a second day to permit
witnesses, including Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., urged senators to invite Lewinsky,
Clinton confidante Vernon Jordan and presidential secretary Betty
Currie. Their testimony would help the Senate resolve questions
about who was telling the truth, McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of the House prosecution team,
said a Senate appearance by Clinton would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would certainly provide an opportunity for something that
has not yet happened in this entire proceeding _ a thorough and
sifting cross examination of the president,'' Barr told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead
House prosecutor, had suggested inviting Clinton to testify as the
Senate trial opened.
</P>
<P>
   A mere invitation to Clinton could pose a potential no-win
situation for the embattled president. If he testified before the
Senate, he might repeat the evasive legalisms that have angered
senators already.
</P>
<P>
   But if he refuses, Americans across the country might conclude
that he has something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart did not immediately
rule out the possibility that Clinton might testify. Lockhart
attributed Senate consideration of an invitation to a
Republican-sponsored public opinion survey showing the strategy ``a
winner'' for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House was willing to forego witnesses to
speed the trial to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The question over Clinton's testimony arose as House prosecutors
appeared to win support from some Senate Democrats on the
politically explosive question of opening the Senate trial to
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said he had ``an open mind,'' adding: ``I am suspending
(judgment) on whether or not the House needs it or whether the
president's refutation is sufficient in the record that was
submitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said his ``mind is totally open
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said House prosecutors' presentation had
``certainly re-ignited the witness debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, Clinton's defense lawyer, said House prosecutors
were seeking witnesses in order to ``expand and extend'' the
proceeding to build a stronger case.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they might call their own defense
witnesses, including special prosecutor Kenneth Starr; former White
House secretary Linda Tripp; and New York book agent Lucianne
Goldberg.

<P>
   Partisan edginess crept into Senate deliberations Friday. Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, rose to his feet in an unscripted moment to
interrupt Barr's presentation and startle his silent Senate
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin demanded that House prosecutors stop referring to
senators as ``jurors.'' Barr's prepared presentation included six
references to senators as ``jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said the senators were not mere jurors but rather should
weigh evidence in the case as well as ``the public good'' before
reaching any decision about removing the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist agreed with Harkin and directed
House prosecutors to cease any reference to senators as ``jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called Rehnquist's ruling ``a very
unexpected and surprising victory.'' Reaching a decision to remove
a president with a two-thirds vote requires senators to ``look at
the good of the country and the politics of all this,'' Boxer said.

<P>
   For the first time during the Senate trial, House prosecutors
gave a hint of the sexually lurid detail that underlies allegations
that Clinton misrepresented his sexual relationship with Lewinsky
to special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and lawyers for Paula Jones, a
former Arkansas state employee who sued Clinton in a civil sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones case was settled earlier this week when Clinton paid
her $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, presenting the House case, said Clinton ``lied to the
grand jury and committed perjury'' by denying a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky. Lewinsky's sworn testimony describes nine incidents
in which Clinton kissed or touched her breasts and four incidents
in which the president sexually aroused the genitalia of the White
House subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense team begins presenting the president's defense
next Tuesday _ just hours before Clinton is scheduled to deliver
his annual, nationally televised State of the Union address.

WARRING PARTIES IN SUDAN EXTEND CEASE-FIRE IN FAMINE AREA  
(DW)

<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa _ Here on Soweto's only cricket ground,
contemplative political discussion is possible. There are so few
fans that each crack of the bat is audible. So, in fact, is each
gentle thump of the ball on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the nearly empty clubhouse agrees with Sports
Minister Steve Tshwete's plan for giving more blacks a shot at
top-level cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Tseladimitlwa, chairman of the Soweto Cricket Club, says
all of his guys would refuse to be put onto the national team for
one game now that South Africa has whomped the West Indies four
times in their five-match series. The last match began Friday, and
like all international cricket matches it is scheduled to last five
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an insult to be chosen because of your race now,''
he said. ``You want to be part of a winning squad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sonny Boy Letshele, a spin bowler on the club's top team,
answers before he has been told the chairman's opinion. ``Sure, I'd
play,'' he said. ``With pleasure. The one thing you need is an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't he be intimidated, being nudged up to international
level so young?
</P>
<P>
   He gives one of those half-shy, half-crooked grins that are
tolerable only on 17-year-old boy wonders. ``I can bowl to those
guys,'' he said, mentioning a national star he had struck out in a
practice game.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, cricket has overtaken rugby as a center of
racial controversy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is affirmative action, as it is in so many arenas of
South African life. But also at issue is sporting prowess, which
many people here care more about than they do about law school
admissions or civil service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they can smell a 5-0 series victory _ something not
done at the international cricket level since the West Indies did
it twice to England in the mid-1980s _ even nonwhite cricket
officials who are dedicated to affirmative action start jiggling
their feet nervously when Tshwete's proposal to darken the lineup
is raised. For 3-2, one could stand on principle. But 5-nil _ hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is cricket, in which gentlemen break for lunch
and tea, not commercials, while Tshwete is a former rugby player.
Still flush with his victory over the white rugby establishment,
whose president he forced to resign, he is still playing by rugby's
boot-to-the-head rules.
</P>
<P>
   He has threatened boycotts, refused to cheer for the team and
even drafted legislation that would create racial quotas and jail
people who violated a rule about registering with a proposed sports
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Rugby was an easy target for him. From Wales to Australia, with
the exception of New Zealand Maoris, the game is played almost
exclusively by whites. There was one nonwhite player, Chester
Williams, on the South African team that won the World Cup in 1995,
but there has not been another since.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the high potentate of rugby here, Louis Luyt, boasted that
he ``bowed only to God'' and had his lawyers grill President Nelson
Mandela for two long, humiliating days on the stand for ordering an
inquiry into racism and corruption in the sport. Sponsors backed
away, unions threatened to disrupt games and Luyt finally quit.
</P>
<P>
   But cricket, which blacks played for 100 years on their own
teams before the white and black leagues merged in 1991, has fallen
all over itself to please Tshwete.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Bacher, the head of the United Cricket Board, has issued
statements saying all-white teams are no longer acceptable. The
national team has had four nonwhites in the last three years: Paul
Adams, Roger Telemachus, Makhaya Ntini and Herschelle Gibbs. All
but Ntini are light-skinned ``coloreds,'' so black Africans do not
really identify with them.
</P>
<P>
   The board imposed quotas on the 11 top-tier teams, saying 22 of
their 121 players next year must be nonwhite. It also created a
committee that can reject the selectors' choices for the national
team if there are too few blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Tshwete says this is still too little too late.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly poignant now because the visiting
squad is the West Indians, the greatest nonwhite power in the
history of the game, and some say the world's greatest cricketers,
period. The West Indies team is loved by black players here for
beating white teams around the world during the height of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Against it, South Africa initially fielded an all-white team.
Shocking even themselves, the South Africans are absolutely mauling
the West Indians, whose captain, Brian Lara, one of the world's
best batsmen, is having a dismal tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're still role models for a lot of black South
African young cricketers,'' Lara said in a radio interview after a
disappointing loss in the fourth five-day match. ``They look
forward to seeing good cricket from the West Indies, and that's
what we're not doing at present.''
</P>
<P>
   The national selectors said South Africa's top 11 players of the
moment just happened to be white. Many officials ``were disgusted
when Makhaya Ntini wasn't selected,'' said Imtiaz Patel, director
of professional cricket for the United Cricket Board. Ntini
excelled when the team toured England, but the selectors felt he
had since ``lost form.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches say the problem is not the national selectors, but
provincial ones, who do not let enough black cricketers up to the
level where the national selectors see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not racism as such,'' said Niels Momberg, a Soweto coach.
``But they're older players, and it's difficult for them to shift
their mind-sets,'' he added, referring to the selectors. ``They
think blacks started playing only in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Tshwete comes from Xhosa territory, where English mission
schools spread the sport 150 years ago and there are many
frustrated players. Some say they are not picked because of racism;
some blame the way nonwhite cricket deteriorated in the 1970s
because it was taken over by activists using sports to fight
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches were no longer coaching us, because they were
involved in politics,'' lamented Patel, who, as an ethnic Indian
played nonwhite cricket. The son of a white friend goes to a
private school, and ``he played 60 matches last season,'' he said.
``In the 1980s I played four or five a season. A whole generation
of cricketers was put on the back burner.''
</P>
<P>
   But some officials also think Tshwete is making a fuss only
because he is worried about his job. A presidential commission has
suggested that the Sports Ministry be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very tricky,'' Patel said when asked how he would
feel about letting a lot of not-quite-top-tier black players play
into the last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd love to see it'' he said. ``But it's a
difficult balancing act to fast-track people without compromising
excellence. Maybe to a layman it seems purely academic, but beating
someone 5-0 _ whew! That is a great, great, great achievement.''

WHEN CONSIDERING TEXAS BUDGET SURPLUS, REMEMBER THE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Austin are aglow with the thought of how to spend a
record $5.6 billion surplus that the state is expected to enjoy
because of a robust economy. Early indications are that education
will be a top priority, with 75 percent of the new money available
going to public and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can't swing a Louis Vitton briefcase in the
hallways of the Capitol these days without hitting a lobbyist with
a hand out, looking to help legislators decide where the other 25
percent of the new money should go.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush appears committed to providing the tax cuts
that he promised during his re-election campaign. On the stump,
Bush thought the state might have as much as a $6.3 billion budget
surplus, and he told voters he wanted to cut property taxes by $2
billion, trim sales taxes by $400 million and give businesses a tax
break to the tune of $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   But figures released this week by Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander may put a kink in the governor's plans. Her estimate shows
a surplus of $5.6 billion, with more than half of that money going
to maintain existing services and programs. That leaves $2.5
billion for legislators to play with _ less than what Bush hoped to
provide in tax cuts, without even mentioning the $1.6 billion he
pledged to spend on public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As a property-tax-paying homeowner, I'd like a tax break as much
as the next property-tax-paying homeowner. But if this session's
``rebate'' is anywhere near as paltry as the one we witnessed the
last time around _ about $140 a year for two years _ I'd rather see
the money go somewhere that it can have long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have started out on the right foot by pledging more
dollars for education. Why not extend that thinking to make 1999
the Year of the Child in the Texas Legislature?
</P>
<P>
   Just last week the state's Department of Regulatory Services
issued a disturbing report showing that deaths from child abuse
increased 71 percent in 1998 and that almost four of every 10
children who died had been victims of prior abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Those local numbers are a microcosm of a sickening national
trend. Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse released a study this week showing that the number of abused
or neglected children has more than doubled in the last decade,
from 1.4 million in 1986 to more than 3 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's difficult to write legislation that can change the
heart or the mind of a child abuser, the state can take certain
steps to address part of the problem: a lack of staff workers to
investigate the cases. Too many of the deaths resulted in homes
where prior contact with Child Protective Services had been made.
Inadequate personnel to closely follow cases is unquestionably a
contributing factor in those deaths.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Toby Goodman plans to carry a bill that will add CPS
caseworkers and provide better training and pay. It deserves
support from the full Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Another area that directly affects child welfare is the state's
child-support computer system, which, according to media reports
last week, is not Y2K-compliant. Dallas is already witnessing
problems that can occur when the computer system responsible for
sending out thousands of checks goes south. About 5,000 Dallas
County parents have gone without their child-support checks this
month because of a problem with a month-old county computer system.
Multiply that by 254 _ the number of counties in Texas _ and
there's a potential for a widespread panic if the state's system
isn't ready to handle the year change to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first priorities of this Legislature must be
emergency funding, if that's what it takes, to get the state's
child-support computer system Y2K-proof.
</P>
<P>
   Even if legislators committed themselves to focusing only on
initiatives that directly affect the lives of Texas' children,
there would not be enough money in the surplus to address all the
needs. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't try. They've made a
good start with a commitment to education. As they examine and
debate the proposals that will come before them in the next 137
days, let's hope children stay first in their thoughts.

SUBARU'S FORESTER OUTPERFORMS ITS SUV COMPETITORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Subaru, the little Japanese automaker best known in the Snow
Belt for its go any where, any time, all-wheel-drive cars, made its
first bid for sport-utility-vehicle customers three years ago with
the Legacy Outback, a beefed-up version of the compact Legacy
station wagon made to look like an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   That popular offering, whose TV ads featured the star of
``Crocodile Dundee,'' was followed by an Impreza Outback, an SUV
station wagon based on the subcompact Impreza wagon. It, too, has
sold well.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Subaru added the Forester, an even beefier
sport-utility model based on the Impreza wagon platform. The
Forester is taller and more SUV-like than the Outback, which looks
more like a beefy station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Forester looks a lot like the new crop of
mini-SUVs, such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Suzuki Vitara
(and its clone, the four-door Chevrolet Tracker).
</P>
<P>
   The Forester, like the CR-V and RAV4, is built on a car chassis
rather than a truck chassis. The CR-V is a Honda Civic underneath,
and the RAV4 is built on the chassis of the previous generation of
the Toyota Celica.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forester is much more powerful than any of its mini-SUV
competitors, because for 1999, Subaru has installed a new
2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine that cranks out a respectable 165
horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque. With the Forester's light
weight _ 3,100 pounds _ this engine makes the vehicle drive like a
sports coupe. The RAV4 has just 127 horsepower, and the CR-V just
146 hp.
</P>
<P>
   True four-wheel-drive fans won't like the Forester's
all-wheel-drive system because there is no low range for serious
off-roading and hill-climbing. Even so, with its relatively high
ground clearance and relatively effective all-wheel drive, the
Forester performs well in mild to moderate off-road situations.
It's certainly more suited to off-road use than either the CR-V or
RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Forester's major advantages over truck-based
mini-SUVs like the Kia Sportage and Vitara/Tracker models is its
carlike ride and handling, which is especially nice for long
highway trips. Besides the speedy performance, the Forester handles
more like a sports coupe than any of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Forester seats up to five adults rather comfortably, too,
although not nearly as comfortably as the Kia, which is much more
roomy inside. But I found the Forester roomier than the RAV4 or
CR-V.
</P>
<P>
   Price is the biggest drawback in the Forester. There are three
trim levels _ base, L and S. Our test car, the top-of-the-line S
model, starts at $22,495 (plus $495 transportation) with five-speed
manual transmission, but the price quickly climbs when options are
added. The four-speed automatic transmission adds $800 alone. With
leather seats and all the other extras, the Forester quickly
becomes as expensive as a midsize SUV such as the Ford Explorer or
Isuzu Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a base model with no power windows or door locks and
no automatic transmission for $18,695 plus transportation. And the
midlevel L model starts at $19,995 plus transportation. But our S
model, which didn't have the leather interior, listed for $24,810 _
quite high for a mini-SUV. Extras besides the automatic
transmission included keyless entry ($225), premium audio system
with compact-disc player ($1,025), minus a package discount of
$230.
</P>
<P>
   All Subarus sold in the United States come with all-wheel drive,
so that doesn't cost extra even on the cheaper versions. With
automatic transmissions, the all-wheel-drive system sends power to
the front wheels most of the time but can transfer up to 40 percent
of the power to the rear wheels when the front wheels begin to
slip. With manual transmission, the Forester's power mostly goes to
the rear wheels, shifting to the front when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features on our Forester included dual front air bags,
four-wheel antilock brakes, side-impact door beams and child-safety
locks for the rear doors.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the base price of our S model were air-conditioning,
AM/FM/cassette stereo, power windows and door locks, dual heated
power mirrors, heated front seats, windshield wiper de-icers,
cruise control, 16-inch alloy wheels, roof luggage rack,
split-fold-down and reclining rear seat, removeable washable cargo
tray, and even a full-size spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is among the best of class: 21 miles per gallon in
the city and 26 on the highway. The tank holds 15.9 gallons of
gasoline.
</P>

<P>
   At A Glance
</P>
<P>
   1999 Subaru Forester S wagon
</P>
<P>
   The Package: Subcompact, five-door, five-passenger,

</P>
<P>
   Highlights: More powerful engine for 1999, with a zippy 165
horsepower; roomy, with excellent ride and handling for a
mini-sport-utility; nice styling.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: Way overpriced when all the options are added.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Millionare.com helping Great Gatsby's make way for millennium
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man who started the Robb Report, an upscale
catalog that caters to the affluent, is buying the Great Gatsby's
Auction Gallery, an Atlanta landmark of the eclectic.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Rusty'' White, president and chief executive officer of
Millionaire.com, hopes to create a Web auction aimed at the rich
and famous. The site, http://www.millionaire.com, would feature
live Internet auctions, which is something the owners of Great
Gatsby's had been hoping to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, which is expected to close Feb. 13, were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   The Gatsby's Chamblee facility on Peachtree Industrial Boulevard
includes a 100,000-square-foot auction building, three art
galleries and an antique automobile showroom. The company had $14
million in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time to develop the electronic commerce
ourselves. There are two of us here and we have our hands full,''
said Ted Tzavaras who, with Bob Slack, owns Great Gatsby's. ``But,
you've got to change. You've got to embrace the next generation of
technology. You have to take the opportunity with e-commerce or its
going to blow by you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tzavaras said Great Gatsby's will still hold three yearly
auctions in front of a live audience at its Peachtree Industrial
location. The largest of those auctions will be held Feb. 12-14.
</P>
<P>
   Great Gatsby's auctions more than 11,000 items a year, items
that have ranged from a John Lennon guitar to 6-foot-high elephant
tusk lamps owned by the Woolworth family of five-and-dime fame.
</P>
<P>
   The average auction price is between $5,000 and $6,000. Its Web
site, at http://www.gatsbys.com, currently lets customers see
pictures of items available for auction, but there is no provision
for online buying.
</P>
<P>
   Tzavaras and Slack held their first auction at the Peachtree
Industrial site in 1984. The company employs 26 people.
</P>
<P>
   By summer, Millionaire.com plans to have daily Internet auctions
with live audio and video. The company was formed in July to buy
Millionaire magazine, which it did in October, said Mark Smith,
managing director of Stonebridge Capital Partners, a Pittsburgh
group that was an original investor.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire.com went public in December. Shares of
Millionaire.com are traded on the over-the-counter bulletin board
under the symbol MLRE. The company's stock closed Friday at $13.75,
down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   White formed the Robb Report in 1967 while in college. The
magazine grew from a three-ring bindered collection of Rolls Royces
for sale, to a glossy full-color magazine. White sold it in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying Millionaire magazine, White dealt upscale
antiques. He has an auction house in Bluffton, S.C., across the
Intercoastal Waterway from Hilton Head. Millionaire.com blends
White's previous careers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Millionaire.com will be a portal for the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the Millionaire.com logo or umbrella or brand can be
applied in many, many ways in the future,'' he said. ``As we
develop the site, (we will) use it as an introduction to the
various services.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Meehan, an Internet analyst with the market research
firm the Gartner Group, said the Millionaire.com site sounds like
an interesting idea, but not a true Internet portal. Portals often
offer links to many other sites and search engines.

 &HT;    Export forecast foggy, but poultry producers upbeat
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After exporting 300,000 metric tons of poultry last
year, Georgia producers believe they will weather an overall
decline in U.S. exports of the products.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about exports and food safety will be among topics
discussed next week when the Tucker-based U.S. Poultry and Egg
Association holds its annual International Poultry Exposition in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Final figures, available in February, will show U.S. 1998
broiler exports at 4.5 billion pounds, down from 4.7 billion pounds
in 1997, the Department of Agriculture said. The slowdown could
easily extend into 1999. Exports this year will slip to 4.3 billion
pounds, the USDA predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With less meat going overseas and production growing, U.S.
wholesale chicken prices could fall this year, the USDA said. But
Georgia producers aren't convinced the situation is dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I really agree with that,'' Doug Cagle,
chairman of Atlanta-based Cagle's Inc., said of the government
outlook. Cagle's, the nation's seventh-largest poultry producer,
believes exports from Georgia will hold their own before the year
is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic based on the growth. I don't know if we'll get
the growth we have had, but I do expect us to export about as many
pounds (of poultry),'' Cagle said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Abit Massey, executive director of the Georgia
Poultry Foundation, 300,000 metric tons of poultry were shipped out
of Georgia during the first 10 months of last year. Massey expects
a leveling off of exports, with a resurgence later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that does not happen, Massey said, the popularity of
poultry among Americans will keep the industry vital.
</P>
<P>
   There is no system in place to measure how much poultry from
Georgia is finding its way to dinner tables in Russia and Asia.
Georgia, however, is No. 1 in the amount of cash sales and pounds
of meat produced nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The total cash value of poultry and eggs in the state was $2.7
billion last year, up from $2.6 billion the year before. In volume,
6 billion pounds of chicken, 5.7 million pounds of turkey and 2.9
billion pounds of eggs were produced last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still ahead of the game, but whether or not we will
finish ahead or below 1997 we will not know for about 45 days. We
are going to finish the year close to the same level we had in
1997, and that's considerable because of economic crisis is Asia
and the crash of the (Russian) ruble in August,'' said Jim Sumner,
president of the USA Poultry and Ag Export Council in Stone
Mountain. ``For the first 10 months of 1998, the figures we have
available now, we exported 1.8 million metric tons of chickens,
compared with 1.75 million metric tons during the same period in
1997. We've been exporting to Russia as much as 80,000 metric tons
per tons per month, for about 40 percent of the export. For the
month of September (last year), we exported 900 tons. In October,
we were back up to 22,000 tons. We don't have November numbers, but
I anticipate 30,000 tons. ``Exports have been the real shot in the
arm for the poultry industry these past eight or nine years. We've
seen some tremendous growth at an average of 20 percent per year,''
Sumner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, we exported about 5 percent of our U.S. broiler
production. By 1997, that had grown to over 18 percent of our U.S.
production, and our production is increasing every year.

 &HT;    Southern Co. plans for hottest days
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. will build a $100 million natural
gas-fueled electric power plant in Jackson County to supply
electricity for its growing wholesale business.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said Friday that the so-called peaking plant would be
used only in times of high electricity demand, such as the hottest
summer days, and be capable of generating 400 megawatts of power
when completed in the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified out-of-state utility has already agreed to
purchase the plant's electricity. To supply anticipated additional
wholesale power demand, Southern said it plans to expand the power
plant complex to a total of 1,200 megawatts of capacity during the
next few years. That would boost the total price tag to $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said the plant would be owned and operated by Georgia
Power Co. but would not affect its customers' rates. Georgia Power
is Southern's largest subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The project is part of a move by Southern and other wholesale
power suppliers to build power plants around the country to meet
growing demand for electricity in deregulated wholesale markets.
</P>
<P>
   Southern won Wisconsin Public Service Commission approval this
week to build a 300-megawatt, natural gas-fueled power plant in
Winnebago County to supply power to Wisconsin Electric, a Milwaukee
utility.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast is a prime area for new power plants because of
its population growth, and the Southern project is one of three
peaking plants on the drawing boards for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, Ala.-based Sonat Inc. and California-based Calpine
Corp. are building a $235 million peaking plant in Cataula, Ga.,
near Columbus, that will sell electricity to Georgia Power and
other utilities. Texas-based Tenaska Inc. has announced plans to
build another peaking plant in Herd County.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Texas-based Enron Corp. plans to spend $315
million to build four gas-fired peaking plants in Mississippi and
Tennessee.

 &HT;    No splash, Ford beefs up Ranger
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Its brash big brother, the F-150, may get the hype and
media attention, but the Ford Ranger pickup quietly continues to
stretch its utility with a four-door option that's definitely on
the cutting edge. Equipment levels also move up a notch, as does
the opportunity for bad jokes because the '99 Ranger lands without
making a Splash (that sporty option has been dropped).
</P>
<P>
   It's quite another matter, though, when the Ranger, with its
easy-switching four-wheel drive system, is put through its off-road
potential. Splash away _ the Ranger has enough power for serious
slogging, although probably not enough to fully satisfy younger
buyers obsessed with jacked-up horsepower and bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Both four-speed and five-speed automatics are offered for about
$1,100, but the five-speed manual is smooth enough to be acceptable
and enables drivers to make the most of the four- and six-cylinder
engines. The test Supercab 4X4's standard anti-lock braking was
equally dependable and visibility was fine, but the seats _ like
the ride _ aren't going to please everyone. Some more padding,
please.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the enthusiast magazines and cost-conscious consumer
guides note, the basic equipment, pricing and option availability
earn ``best buy'' and ``recommended'' checkmarks for the Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   The jalapeno green 4X4 Supercab test truck was visually striking
_ other fanciful color names include ``wedgewood blue'' and
``harvest gold'' _ and came with a price tag totaling $21,405
before the addition of taxes, tag fees, etc. The Ranger line starts
at $11,785 for the XL model and tops out at a base of $19,375 for
the Supercab 4X4 XLT. The XL and XLT trim levels come with 6- or
7-foot cargo beds and wheelbases of 111.6 inches, 117.5 inches or
125.7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Ford wisely uses its 119-hp, 2.5-liter
four-cylinder engine only in the base Ranger. Its EPA ratings of 22
mpg city and 27 mpg highway are reasonably attractive, but the
150-hp 3.0-liter V-6 (17 and 23 mpg) and 160-hp 4.0-liter V-6 (17
and 21 mpg) make more sense in most applications.
</P>
<P>
   In commuter or unloaded situations, the Supercab 4X4 with the
3.0-liter V-6 had enough torque (185 pounds-feet) to move out
satisfactorily. Given a load weighing about half of its 1,500-pound
maximum rating, however, the 3,800-pound Ranger seemed to yearn for
the 4.0-liter V-6 with its 225 pounds-feet of torque. The cargo
weight did settle the Ranger's occasionally bouncy ride, however.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether it was carrying cargo or people, the
Ranger Supercab's really pleasing features were the extra doors _
yes, they do swing to the rear, the handles are mounted on the
front edge and the front doors do have to be open to use them _ and
the rotary switch-anytime control for two-wheel, four-wheel low and
four-wheel high drive.
</P>
<P>
   Like the B-Series pickups Ford builds for Mazda, the Ranger has
compact instrumentation, drink holders of several sizes, storage
spaces and major controls that simplify operation. Weak points
include the kids-only jump seats _ no surprise there _ and cabin
noise because of less-than-perfect aerodynamics and insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Maneuverability, too, is an asset, and what pleases Ford
executives is the way the Ranger moves out of showrooms. After
selling 298,796 units in '97, Ford logged 328,136 sales in '98,
proving the Ranger's changes reflect what consumers want.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Ford Ranger 4X4 Supercab XLT compact pickup
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $21,405 (includes discounts not always
available, base price: $19,375)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags with switchable passenger's,
power anti-lock brakes with front discs and rear drums, side-impact
beams, height-adjustable shoulder belts
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 3.0 liter V-6 engine (150 horsepower); five-speed
manual overdrive transmission with electric switch for two- and
four-wheel drive modes
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: air conditioning, $805; two rear doors,
$660; cloth sport bucket seats, $360; 3.73 ratio limited-slip rear
axle, $270; upgraded AM/FM stereo with CD/cassette players, $230

 &HT;    Brazil floats currency, initiating rally
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Inverstors cheered Brazil's decision Friday to stop
defending its currency with a buying rally that sent major stock
market averages up as much as 3 percent, recapturing much of their
losses over four previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
   News that Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan and central
bank chief Francisco Lopes would meet with U.S. officials this
weekend buoyed markets in both countries by reinforcing the idea
that the United States is taking Brazil's situation seriously,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Bovespa index rallied more than 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average,
which had plunged 228.63 points in Thursday's selloff, rebounded by
219.62 points to close back above 9,300.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow fell 3 percent from its all-time high of
9,643.32 on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rally was broad enough to push the Nasdaq composite up
by 3.1 percent and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks by 1.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors interpreted Brazil's decision to let its
currency float as a step toward revising its economy and, at the
same time, stalling the spread of currency devaluations to other
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the benefit of letting Brazil's currency, the
real, trade freely in currency markets would more than compensate
for costs to that nation's economy, such as higher domestic prices.
A cheaper real will boost Brazil's exports by making its products
more competitive in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also rose in currency markets on expectations that
Brazil's move would boost its economic recovery. The dollar moved
up against the new European euro for the first time in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of U.S. financial and other consumer stocks that had
plunged on earlier news of Brazil's devaluation led the rally.
Among them were Xerox, Gillette and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola. Other
groups, including computer shares, automakers and brokerage houses,
also recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rally also ended, temporarily at least, the flight to
safety that had pushed Treasury bond prices higher earlier in the
week. The yield on the 30-year Treasury moved up as a result of the
lower bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were still worried about the significance of this
week's selloff in the stock market, suggesting that it could happen
again as long as share prices trade at such high valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Arnold Kaufman said the market's
recent decline could have been worse, given Brazil's crisis on top
of the combination of huge share price gains, record high stock
valuations, Internet speculation and even the start of President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaufman said investor confidence is still strong and,
``despite the pullback, the market's underlying upward trend
remains intact.

WILLIAMS ISN'T READY   TO CONCEDE ANYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette joked that
his mother won't let him in her house because he failed to re-sign
Mo Vaughn, a feisty Jimy Williams made a vow faintly reminiscent of
Dick Williams's long-ago pledge that his soon-to-be Impossible
Dreamers would win more games than they would lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to cancel the season,'' Williams, giving extra
emphasis to each syllable, told the $100-a-plate guests at the
annual Boston Baseball Writers' Dinner Thursday. ``We're going to
go play.''
</P>
<P>
   This after the manager said it was ``impossible'' to replace
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace the man,'' Williams said. ``Impossible. The
organization tried to replace the stats, but that didn't work out,
either. Dan and I flew all over the country, but Albert Belle and
Bernie Williams just didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are we supposed to do? Create one? Trade for one?
</P>
<P>
   Absent those choices, the Red Sox will carry on with what they
have, Williams said. ``I like our team,'' he said. ``Nope, it's not
Mo Vaughn. He's not here. But we've got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams talked about the team's new pitching additions, Mark
Portugal and Pat Rapp, flavoring his comments with refreshing
candor. ``How good are they?'' he said. ``Hell, I don't know. We
signed them, so they've got a chance to be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance on paper,'' Williams added sarcastically.
``What do you do with paper? You flush it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox players on the dais, including Pedro Martinez and
Nomar Garciaparra, clearly enjoyed Williams's remarks. Martinez,
next at the podium to receive his award as the team's Pitcher of
the Year, joked that he should have spoken before Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, whose arrival at the dinner was delayed because his
flight from Florida was held up by Thursday's storm, told the
gathering they now had a better idea of ``the kind of person
(Williams) is. He livens things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to play for him,'' Garciaparra said. ``He's
always so positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra also made his feelings for Vaughn known. ``I love
the guy,'' he said. ``He's a tremendous role model. But we will
have a positive attitude in spring training. We're not sitting
around, throwing our hands up in the air, saying, `What are we
going to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, now with the Anaheim Angels after leaving Boston as a
free agent, was due to be honored as New England Player of the Year
but did not come to pick up his award.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette claimed that when he went to Vaughn's charity event
last October, a middle-aged woman called out, imploring him to sign
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, that was my mom,'' said Duquette, though it remained
unclear whether he was refusing to let the facts get in the way of
a good story. ``She told me not to come home for the holidays. She
still hasn't let me back in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Mom, but we're going to do what we can to replace Mo
Vaughn.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' three arbitration-eligible players were expected to
file by Friday night's deadline. Outfielder Damon Buford, pinch
hitter Midre Cummings, and pitcher John Wasdin all were expected to
file. Buford was paid $460,000 last season, Cummings $250,000, and
Wasdin $227,500. The team and players will submit salary figures,
and arbitration hearings will be held next month if they cannot
reach agreement independently . . . Dennis Eckersley, honored with
a lifetime achievement award, was accorded several standing
ovations and ended his acceptance speech in tears. ``What a ride,
man,'' the recently retired pitcher said. ``I've got to tell you.
It hasn't hit me yet, but it will. I have so much passion for this
game, I can't believe it's over.'' . . . Duquette said the Sox have
invited Eckersley to remain with the organization. He did not say
in what capacity, but it is believed the Sox would like Eckersley
to serve as a uniformed instructor in spring training. Eckersley is
interested in broadcasting and reportedly has talked with the A's
about a position . . . Bret Saberhagen received two awards at the
dinner, including the Tony Conigliaro Award for courage.
Saberhagen's agent, Dennis Gilbert, is a former Sox farmhand who
was close to the Conigliaro family. Tony C was godfather to
Gilbert's daughter. Duquette called Saberhagen's comeback ``the
project that defined the team last year.'' . . . Clark Booth, the
night's master of ceremonies, alluded to the target affixed on
Duquette's back as only he can. Listing Duquette's predecessors as
general manager, Booth said that what links them to the current
officeholder was ``they all got skewered on the gridiron of public
opinion.''

TWO WHO TOOK THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is all just cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Boudreau and Steve Walters did not play a major role in the
Patriots' disappointing season, yet the two assistant coaches took
the fall for the incompetence of those above them.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the team, Bob and Jonathan Kraft, installed Bobby
Grier as player personnel director because in their eyes, he had
the most important ingredient for the job.
</P>
<P>
   He would do what they wanted him to do.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it works with the Patriots in the quagmire that
Foxboro Stadium has become in the two years since Bill Parcells
left town.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts, who really don't know much about football but have
become self-styled gurus the last five years, pose questions to
Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Grier is smart enough to know that those questions are really
suggestions and that they should be relayed to head coach Pete
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll gets the word and passes it down the line to the
assistant coaches, who, even though they might not agree, are
expected to get with the program. If they fight it or question it,
they may well be looking for another job at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1997 season, Carroll met with his assistants.
There was a lot of media speculation at the time that offensive
coordinator Larry Kennan might be let go. Kennan reportedly told
Carroll, ``I keep hearing I'm going to be fired. What's the
story?'' Carroll assured him that no one on the staff would be
fired. When asked by another member of the staff if he were calling
the shots on the coaches' jobs, Carroll said he was.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Kennan was out as offensive coordinator and two
new coaches arrived, Ernie Zampese and Jack Reilly from the Dallas
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Both were let go when Chan Gailey became head coach of the
Cowboys because he wanted to be his own offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese and Reilly had two years left on their contracts that
owner Jerry Jones, a good friend of the Krafts, would have to pay
if they didn't get another job.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, I am told by reliable people in Dallas, split the bill
with the Krafts. He would pay for one season if Kraft paid for the
other. Deal. Kennan was demoted and later resigned when he learned
in an unusual way that a contract extension for an additional year
would not be honored.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had to notify Kennan by a certain date if they were
going to cut his pay or fail to extend the contract. The date was
on a Sunday. Kennan and his wife came home that night and found a
letter stuck to the front door notifying him that the additional
year would not be offered. He had been in the office two days
before, but no one had the guts to tell him to his face. Kennan
decided he no longer wanted to be around the Patriots and worked
out a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason to fire Larry Kennan. The Patriots'
offensive numbers this year were no different than a year ago. And
unless they go out and get players who can play, not draft choices
who can't, their offensive numbers next year will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll didn't have the courage to stand up for Kennan. He
didn't have the guts to stand up for Boudreau or Walters. The
Krafts can maintain their coaching budget because they get a free
year with the two former Cowboy coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The last two drafts, by Grier's own admission, have not been
good. During this time, Grier _ with advice from above, of course _
hasn't done a great job in free agency. Last year he lost Curtis
Martin, Keith Byars, Sam Gash, and Dave Meggett and got Tony Carter
to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the draft, he used the compensation pick for Martin to take
Robert Edwards. Edwards and Tony Simmons are the only two of the 17
players he has drafted over two years who have contributed anything
of note.
</P>
<P>
   Two bad drafts. Nothing in free agency last year. Three
assistant coaches gone. What are they supposed to do for players,
invent them?
</P>
<P>
   Grier said everyone in the organization is being evaluated,
including himself. I'd like to see what grade he gets from the
Krafts. If he keeps going the way he has, he'll end up as the next
head coach of the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Krafts purchased the New England franchise
in Major League Soccer. They started even with every other team.
Over three years, the Revolution have produced the worst record in
the league and fired two head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The sport doesn't matter: If the team fails, get out the
cosmetics and try to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at Sunday's NFC and AFC title games by a couple of
coaches who well know the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars head coach Tom Coughlin, who played against both the
Broncos and Jets this season, assesses the AFC game: ``It looks as
though Denver is back on track. They hit a few bumps in the road
late in the season, but I watched their game with Miami and they
were back on their game. They did to Miami running what they did to
us in the very same game a year ago. I look for Denver to blitz a
lot and gamble on defense. (Linebacker) Bill Romanowski will be the
leader of that stuff. They have so much confidence in their offense
scoring a lot of points, they let their defense gamble big-time.
They'll have a few things ready from their defensive side that the
Jet offense hasn't seen yet, and they'll be putting pressure on
Vinny (Testaverde) all day long. It isn't easy to pressure him. He
gets rid of the ball in a hurry and he has been very active.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the game is the running of Terrell Davis. He is a
special running back. He is playing as well as anyone in the game.
You cannot stop him with seven men in the box (close to the line of
scrimmage). You must commit the eighth man, and when you do, this
is when (John) Elway comes after you. Offensively, they want to
jump on you right away. They will come out with a scripted offense
of 15 plays (designed by head coach Mike Shanahan) and try to build
a quick lead. Then they can start to gamble on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into Denver, you have to think about scoring 30
points to win. When we went to New York last week, I told our
offense the same thing the night before the game: `We are going to
need to score 30 points to have a shot at winning.' The Jets'
offense is playing at a very high level. Denver will be tough to
run against. For the Jets to win this game, I think they have to
get a few turnovers. A team has to make big plays to beat the
Broncos in Denver. They are a terrific team, and that is a tough
place to play. The crowd makes the communication very difficult
between the center and the quarterback. The wind can be a major
factor in that stadium for them. Elway is so used to it, and his
arm is so strong, he can just throw the ball through the wind. The
Jets are playing well. They haven't been making many mistakes. But
this is a very difficult challenge, to beat this Denver team on its
home field in a playoff game.''
</P>
<P>
   Zavan Yaralian, the highly respected New Orleans defensive
coordinator who faced Atlanta twice and saw the Saints lose a close
game in Minnesota in November, dissects the NFC matchup: ``I have
great respect for the Minnesota offense. It's the best in football
right now in my opinion. But if there is a team that can beat
Minnesota, it is Atlanta. They match up very well against
Minnesota. Atlanta will move the ball against them. Minnesota is
not that great on defense, and they have some players hurt. Atlanta
must move the ball on the ground and control the clock to win. To
slow down Minnesota on offense, you have to keep the ball away from
them with your own offense. Atlanta can do this because they have a
good offensive line and Jamal Anderson is a tough, resilient runner
who gets upfield and keeps making first downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, Atlanta has the right mix to play the Minnesota
offense. They are one of the few teams in the league that can
create pressure on the passer with a four-man rush. Most teams have
to use linebackers or defensive backs as part of the rush. Atlanta
does not. This will be a very important battle. The Minnesota
offensive line might be the best in the league. If Atlanta's front
four can have a good day and put pressure on (Randall) Cunningham,
they have a heck of a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side, Chris Chandler cannot turn the ball over.
He does a good job, but he does turn it over. Chandler could have a
big day. Minnesota will have to commit an eighth man (safety) to
come up and stop the running of Anderson, and when that happens,
Chandler can hurt them deep. Atlanta has good speed on the outside
with (Terance) Mathis and (Tony) Martin. I like their matchups with
the Viking cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota's offense carries the team. They've been building up
big leads, and the other team has to forget about the run game and
keep throwing. Minnesota's defense is much better when it just has
to play the pass. It is quick but not big. You can bang them around
on the run, but they can get after the passer with their speed. I
look for Atlanta to roll the coverage (defensively) toward (Randy)
Moss all day. Double him as much as they can. Stay out of
one-on-ones with Moss and Cris Carter. Make them beat you by
throwing to the tight end (Andrew Glover) or the running backs.
Robert Smith is very quick. He wants to get to the outside.
Defensively, you want to keep him between the tackles. He is always
looking to cut back and make the big run. You have to play him for
that. If Chandler doesn't get hurt, Atlanta can pressure
Cunningham. This is going to be a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has seen it happen many times before and went through it a
couple of times himself. Bill Parcells knows better than most that
being a head coach in the National Football League, though exciting
and rewarding when you win, also takes a heavy personal toll, as
illustrated this week by the resignation of Marty Schottenheimer in
Kansas City and the near resignation of Jimmy Johnson in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me read you something I always keep around someplace
close,'' Parcells said. ``It's a story called `The Coaches.' I
don't know who wrote it. I got it out of a coaches' book years ago,
and I liked it so much, I got it laminated.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't have the space here to use all of it, but here are a
couple of pertinent paragraphs:
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach has nowhere to hide. He cannot just let the job go
for a while or do a bad job and assume no one will notice, as most
of us can. He cannot satisfy everyone. Seldom can he even satisfy
very many. Rarely can he even satisfy himself. If he wins once, he
must win the next time, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They plot victories, suffer defeats, endure criticism from
within and without. They neglect their families, travel endlessly,
and live alone in a spotlight surrounded by others. Theirs may be
the worst profession _ unreasonably demanding and insecure and full
of unrelenting pressures. Why do they put up with it? Why do they
do it? Having seen them hired and hailed as geniuses at gaudy
party-like press conferences and having seen them fired with pat
phrases such as `fool' or `incompetent,' I have wondered about
them. Having seen them exult in victory and depressed by defeat, I
have sympathized with them. Having seen some broken by the job and
others die from it, one is moved to admire them and hope that
someday the world will learn to understand them.''

PROTESTING FARMERS CLASH WITH POLICE IN SOUTHERN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ Thousands of farmers demonstrating against local
officials clashed with hundreds of police officers in a small town
in southern China last week, the latest and perhaps largest in a
series of farmer and worker protests that have sprung up around
China in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The main battle, on Jan. 8 in Hunan province, left one farmer
dead and dozens injured after the police tried to disperse the
crowd with clubs and tear gas, said the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China, a human rights group in
Hong Kong. The account was independently confirmed by local
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Daolin Township, just outside the provincial capital,
Changsha, were protesting what they considered to be excessive and
arbitrary taxes levied by local officials. In rural China,
appointed local officials are notorious for imposing arbitrary
taxes _ school fees, building fees, land-use fees, licensing fees _
and people often have little practical recourse but to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches Chinese government leaders have railed
against corruption in general and specifically against the tax
burden on farmers, which they see as a source of discontent and a
grave threat to social stability. President Jiang Zemin has
recently stressed the importance of maintaining order at all costs
as the country faces an economic slowdown as well as a year of
important anniversaries, including the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China and the 10th anniversary
of the Tiananmen Square killings.
</P>
<P>
   Government television stations and newspapers have highly
publicized corruption trials and cautionary tales of officials gone
bad. Still, corrupt practices continue.
</P>
<P>
   Like other recent protests scattered across China, the
demonstration in Daolin focused on local issues. While the world
criticizes China's recent crackdown on human rights and political
dissent, protesters in China have focused on other issues: a
factory that had defaulted on pension payments, an investment
company that had bilked shareholders, the greed of a corrupt local
official, and _ as in Daolin _ arbitrary taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The incident in Daolin Township, with a population of about
50,000, centered on the activities of a group created by local
farmers late last year called the Society for Reducing Taxes and
Saving the Nation, said an employee of a local radio station who
spoke by telephone but would not give his name. The group was
presumably not officially registered with the local government as
is technically required of all organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8, the local public security bureau tried to disband the
group and detain the organizers, sparking the protests. The
reported number of demonstrators has gone up an down this week,
although firsthand details of the confrontation are scarce because
Chinese news organizations do not normally report on such protests
and foreign journalists are not permitted near them.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station employee said that when the police moved in on
Jan. 8 at the height of the protest, about 10,000 protesters were
involved; the Hong Kong Human Rights Group placed the number at
3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer who was killed was hit with an exploding tear gas
canister and bled to death before help arrived. While the human
rights group placed the number of injuries at about 100, the radio
station employee said it was unlikely to be that high. He noted
that crowds were large in part because it is mid-winter and the
people in the rural area ``don't have much work on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The information center in Hong Kong said a second demonstration
occurred the next day and was put down by 500 soldiers. It said
that three smaller protests have taken place since in front of the
provincial government office to demand that the victims receive
compensation. It said the family of the farmer who died had
received about $7,500, equivalent to about five years' wages in
that part of China.

TIME TO PUT UP OR SHUT UP

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Now the hard part comes for Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   All the talking and the cursing are over now. So are the conning
and the conniving and the Three Faces of Eve routine that has
become so tedious to watch. Now it's time to fight again, so we
will see what is left of him.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Tyson is not entering the ring at the MGM Grand
Garden Saturday night to face King Kong, or even Don King, but the
opponent matters less this time than he does. What Francois Botha
can do beyond survive an early assault is of little import. The
issue is, what can Mike Tyson do if called upon to face himself?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since long before he became the youngest
heavyweight champion in boxing history, Tyson will walk into an
arena that is nearly a third empty. He will walk in with his
promoters privately admitting they fear this pay-per-view fight
could not only do less than the 1.1 million buys originally
projected but less than 800,000, which one TV executve predicted
would mean ``it's over for Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of those concerns was that Friday in New York,
Cablevision representatives were calling customers asking if they
wanted to buy the fight. In Los Angeles, they were fearing ``a
disaster,'' according to another cable executive. In the midst of
this shifting ground stands a man on a shaky foundation who knows
what his performance will mean to his future.
</P>
<P>
   If he fails to take Botha out early, as most expect he will, it
could be over for him, because the longer this fight goes, the
likelier it is that he implodes. And if he does, it will have
little or nothing to do with Botha, because this night is all about
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   His shaky self-image, his doubts about himself that his handlers
whisper about at midnight but refuse to acknowledge in the full
light of day, his private fears are what he is combating this time,
not Francois Botha.
</P>
<P>
   But which Tyson will come to fight them? Which one will walk up
those three steps and into the ring? Will it be the one who
dominated the heavyweight division 12 years ago or the one who was
twice destroyed by Evander Holyfield two years ago? Which one will
box?
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield believes in himself and his ability 100 percent,''
said Tommy Brooks, Hoylfield's former assistant trainer and Tyson's
new chief second. ``Mike doesn't. That's what I'm working on. Any
time you have two ass-kickings like that (from Holyfield), you
don't forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a human being. I'm not a psychologist. I'm just a fight
trainer. From all indications, he wants to fight. I know he's ready
to fight. He wants this fight bad for me, for himself, and for the
world. Mike wants to be Numero Uno (again).''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but Botha's manager, Panama Lewis, vows to ``make
him taste the leather,'' and will Tyson still want it enough after
that? No one can know that until it happens _ if it happens. But if
it does, which Tyson emerges then? The warrior Brooks says is still
inside him or the confused and beaten punching bag he turned into
in the later rounds of the first Holyfield fight and continued to
be in the rematch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a guy starts getting in shape and starts getting more
confidence in his ability, it all works out,'' Brooks said. ``But
sure, he could revert back (to his recent one-punch-at-a-time
style). This guy can make me look like a million bucks or he can
make me look like a piece of crap. I'm guessing like everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That, like his apparent dwindling popularity among paying
customers, never used to be the case. You never had to guess about
Mike Tyson on fight night. He was home then, money in the bank, a
concussion waiting to be delivered, a sure thing in a town where
nothing is sure but that the house always wins.
</P>
<P>
   Now nothing is sure, although in the opinion of veteran trainer
Lou Duva, ``one spectacular knockout and he's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but is Tyson still the man to deliver that? Does he
even want to? And can he stand up if, by chance, Botha fights back
just enough to jog his memory to a night 19 months ago when he was
staring at defeat for the second straight time and chose to take
the coward's way out, biting Holyfield until referee Mills Lane
agreed to let him out of the beating by disqualifying him?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Botha (39-1, 1 no-contest, 24 knockouts) may be
incapable of taking Tyson (45-3, 39 KOs) to the place where he is
tested, but if he does, even Brooks seems unsure what will happen.
If he is unsure, what is his fighter feeling?
</P>
<P>
   Botha was the International Boxing Federation heavyweight
champion for a month before losing the title he won from Axel
Schulz in 1995 after testing positive for steroids. He showed a
toughness few thought he had when he was stopped in the 12th round
by Michael Moorer and might have won the title back had he pushed
himself harder. But Botha was nearly 10 pounds lighter then (224 to
today's 233) and lacks the hand speed to match Tyson's and the
quickness afoot or punching power to frustrate or stun him early.
Or so it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest reincarnation of Mike Tyson is not about the
opponent, so none of that may matter, because this is a fight that
will be decided by only one man. Tommy Brooks's man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does 60 percent of what we worked on, it will be a
foregone fight (conclusion),'' Brooks said. ``What would disappoint
me is if he doesn't do anything that we worked on in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, what used to be easy for Mike Tyson will be hard.
Taking that long walk back into the same arena where he lost his
titles, his dignity, and two fights in a row will be hard.
</P>
<P>
   Walking up those three short steps to meet Botha will be hard.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest of all will be walking out to keep fighting if he
doesn't get rid of Botha in a round or two or three, because after
that, he will not be fighting Francois Botha anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson will be fighting himself, and that's an opponent he
hasn't been able to conquer yet.

&HT;        SPECTER VOWS SILENCE AS JUROR, AFTER TALKING IT UP ON TV
BEFORE TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 15, -- Sen. Arlen Specter, who appeared on
dozens of national television talk shows in recent weeks to discuss
President Clinton's impeachment trial, issued an unexpected
statement today: He would have no more to say.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing his previous willingness to speak on the topic,
Specter said: ``Now that I am serving as a juror with the
impeachment trial underway, I do not intend to make any further
public statements.''
</P>
<P>
   He had become one of the Senate's many unofficial spokesmen on
countless radio broadcasts and Sunday television news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after he was sworn in for his fourth term Jan. 6,
Specter was heading off to CNN's Washington D.C. bureau to appear
on ``Crossfire''. A few days later he swore to be an impartial
juror in the Clinton trial -- and part of that oath required the
senators to remain silent, ``on pain of imprisonment.''
</P>
<P>
   Most senators, Specter included, took that to mean they should
remain silent while on the Senate floor during the actual trial.
Like many senators, Specter has spoken freely about the case during
trial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   What silenced the man who appeared on CNN's Larry King Live and
Crossfire, NBC's Meet the Press, and CBS's Face the Nation via
satelite from London to talk about the trial? It's not clear.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, John Ullyot, did not return phone calls seeking
comment.

RAZIL ALLOWS REAL TO FREE FALL; MARKETS REASSURED

<P>
   Brazil's currency lost 7 percent of its value Friday after the
government, relenting to pressures on the real, abandoned the fixed
exchange rate in place since 1994. But the widely anticipated move,
rather than shake up financial markets in Latin America, reassured
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovespa stock index, which fell to almost 5000 last week,
gained 30 percent and closed at 6576.71. Brazil led a region-wide
rally of stock markets, with Argentina's market up 12.64 percent.
Mexico's Bolsa rose 7.88 percent amid a surprise strengthening of
the peso.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in Latin America bolstered US stocks, with the Dow
Jones industrial average rising 2.25 percent and recovering most of
the losses caused the previous day from the Brazil shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders and economists are still uncertain about the
ultimate impact of devaluation on vulnerable economies in the
region. But they were hopeful after Friday's relatively good
outcome that it may escape the contagion that roared through Asian
currency markets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A $41.5 billion aid package granted in November by the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders helped contain the
damage, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets totally turned around. The Latin markets have
rallied unbelievably,'' said Jamie Coleman, senior currency analyst
for Thompson Global Markets in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government Friday abandoned the real's peg to the
US dollar and allowed it to float freely after an 8 percent
``minidevaluation'' on Wednesday had failed to calm currency
markets.
</P>
<P>
   After doing so, the real Friday fell to a low of 1.41 to the
dollar, but bounced back to 1.525 real for a 6.8 percent decline
for the day. (Prior to the initial devaluation, the real was pegged
at 1.21 to the dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   Henrique Meirelles, president of BankBoston Corp. and former
head of Brazil operations, applauded the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The danger would have been if devaluation had come ``too late,
if Brazil had run out of reserves,'' Meirelles said. ``They did it
soon enough, when Brazil still had reserves and the IMF lines
weren't used yet. That calmed the markets down.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have fled Brazil because of concerns the country would
not be able to finance a widening trade balance and budget deficit
_ 7.5 percent of gross domestic product _ at a time interest rates
were at extremely high levels.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's reserves plunged by $4.3 billion this week _ reserves
are now half of year-ago levels _ as the central bank fought to
defend the currency. The pressures became unbearable this month
after Itamar Franco, governor of Minas Gerais state, declared a
temporary moratorium on the state's debt to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation was controversial. One faction favored high rates to
attract dollars and keep the real strong and inflation low. Its
champions were the finance minister, Pedro Malan, and central bank
chief, Gustavo Franco, who resigned Wednesday. The other side
wanted to lower rates to spark the economy, at the risk of igniting
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of economic growth in 1998 for Brazil, the biggest
economy in Latin America, range from flat to a decline of as much
as a 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil isn't yet out of the woods, Coleman said. The behavior of
the real next week hinges on government decisions about the future
course of action in meetings with officials in Washington. The
International Monetary Fund, which had disbursed only a portion of
Brazil's rescue package, it would meet with Brazilian officials
before deciding on giving more money.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said that it is possible Brazil would establish a
currency board to monitor the real.
</P>
<P>
   A currency board ``could provide a good deal of short-run
stability in the region,'' Coleman said. If not, a free-floating
real will ``wax and wane the next few weeks as the markets figures
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil introduced the real in 1994 to contain inflation, which
soared at one point to 5000 percent. The currency has served as the
anchor of Brazil's economic recovery since then. Last year,
inflation was only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers purchasing power has just declined while companies
will be under pressure because the cost of their foreign debt has
just soared,'' said Walter Molano, head of research at BCP
Securities in Connecticut. ``This is not good for economic
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior IMF official speaking at a Harvard University forum
Friday expressed confidence that Brazil will achieve the fiscal
targets it agreed to when it accepted an IMF-led economic bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil will in fact achieve the targets agreed with the IMF
because they have put compensative measures in place,'' Stanley
Fischer, first deputy managing director at the IMF, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation was not a requirement of the IMF-led rescue plan.
The plan called for tax increases and spending cuts to slash the
country's $64 billion budget deficit by half this year. The full
slate of measures has yet to be approved by Brazil's Congress.

W.R. GRACE PAID FINE _ 10 YEARS LATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid an aggressive public relations offensive to
counter its portrayal in the film ``A Civil Action,'' W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co. had to pause this week to explain an embarrassing glitch: the
multinational firm did not pay its fine in the related criminal
case for 10 years _ just as cameras for the Hollywood production
were rolling in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A Grace spokeswoman confirmed to the Globe that the $10,000 fine
was paid in 1998, a decade after the corporation pleaded guilty to
one count of a two-count criminal indictment charging that it lied
to the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose role in the famous Woburn pollution case is
getting national attention because of the release of the box office
hit, could not explain the delay in paying the fine, which was
levied by the US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation of Grace's late payment has rubbed salt in
the wounds of those in the Woburn community who are convinced that
the firm's pollution led to the cancer-related deaths of seven
children and one adult.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders and families of the victims note that Grace has
refused to acknowledge its role in the pollution of the city's
drinking water. They said the delay of payment of the fine confirms
to them the company's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of their arrogance and their refusal to
aceept responsibility,'' said Carol Donovan, the Democratic state
representative who represents Woburn. ``They just don't want to
accept any responsibility for anything they have done.'' Anne
Anderson, whose son Jimmy died of leukemia in 1981, said she is not
surprised at Grace's having let a decade pass before paying the
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would it surprise me?'' said Anderson, who spearheaded the
case that led to the lawsuits against Grace and Beatrice Foods.
``They have never wanted to admit guilt or any degree of
culpability. What they consider right and wrong in their eyes, I
will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney R. Robert Popeo, who defended Grace in the
criminal case, said the corporation had ``acted responsibly with
respect to this matter.'' He said the delay in payment was an
oversight by prosecutors, the court, and the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the oversight was called to the company's attention the
fine was paid promptly thereafter,'' said Popeo, who is
representing General Electric in a pollution case in Pittsfield.
Federal and state environmental agencies say GE is guilty of having
polluted its property and the Housatonic River with chemical PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Jane McGuinness, director of communications for W.R. Grace, said
the company was ``equally surprised'' the fine had not been paid
earlier. She noted the fine is dwarfed by the ``millions of
dollars'' the firm is paying for cleaning up its property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would have not been purposefully remiss on the
$10,000 fine,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   As ``A Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall,
climbs to the top of the box office charts, Grace has mounted a
strong public relations offensive to counter the allegations raised
in the case. The charges had lain dormant until the best-selling
book by the same name appeared several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it used the experience to revamp its
environmental policies. ``Grace has spent 12 years applying lessons
learned from these earlier mistakes and restoring the community's
confidence and trust,'' the company reports on its Internet site,
which was designed to deal with the publicity generated by the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The families' lawsuit identified Grace and Beatrice Foods as
owners of property near the wells where there were huge toxic waste
dumps. After an 80-day trial in 1986, a jury concluded Beatrice was
not responsible for the pollution and the case against the firm was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury did find that Grace was potentially culpable. The
corporation, however, settled with the families before the start of
the new trial that Judge Walter J. Skinner had ordered, paying them
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case that received far less attention, Grace
pleaded guilty to one count of a two-count criminal indictment
brought by the US attorney's office that accused the company of
lying to the EPA about the amount of potentially toxic chemicals it
had purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's plea in May 1988 _ meant that it conceded prosecutors
had enough evidence for conviction if the case had gone to trial,
but still maintained it was innocent of the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the plea, the firm was admitting to its undereporting of the
amount the chemical acetone that was purchased by its Woburn plant.
</P>
<P>
   It was another chemical cited in a separate section of the
indictment, trichloroethylene, that seeped into Woburn's drinking
water. But while prosecutors had charged that Grace lied to the EPA
when it told the agency in 1982 it had only purchased one drum of
the chemical, the company did not concede that point when the case
was settled.

A CONGA LINE FROM RIO TO CAFE WHA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Brazil)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 17)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID KIRBY  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a doleful Monday night, so cold even the tourists
were hibernating, a faint tropical beat cut through the wind in
Greenwich Village. The rhythm led around a corner, down some stairs
and smack into Carnaval in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Monday is Brazil Night at Cafe Wha. In a cozy basement, beneath
ceilings strung with Christmas lights, arms waved, hips swayed,
bedroom eyes flirted and waitresses carried rounds of caipirinhas,
the Brazilian cocktail of ice, lime, sugar and the national
firewater, cachaca.
</P>
<P>
   After the first chords from the nine-piece band Brazilian Beat,
the place erupted into a gyrating party. Inevitably, tabletops
became dance floors. Not even a group of well-groomed Italian
tourists could match the smooth undulations of the dexterous
Brazilians, who made up the majority of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many Brazilians have moved to New York,'' said Marianne
Ebert, a singer with the Brazilian Beat. ``Eventually, they end up
at Cafe Wha. When I went to Brazil for Christmas, everyone knew
everyone on the plane. It was a huge party. Like high school in the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the warm and sexy crowd are part of a wave of talented
young Brazilians who can't seem to get to New York fast enough.
Musicians, artists, promoters, filmmakers, designers, restaurateurs
and boutique owners have all flocked to the city in recent years.
Its Brazilian presence has blossomed like an Amazon orchid.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the city's Brazilian culture was pretty much
limited to the club S.O.B.'s, where Astrud Gilberto sang about that
``Girl From Ipanema,'' and Little Brazil, a restaurant, where the
most sizzling offering was often feijoada, Brazil's national stew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, a pipeline from Brazil to Manhattan of creative
and ambitious young people has added a more authentic flavor to the
city's cultural mix. In 1995, the Zagat guide listed four Brazilian
restaurants in New York. Now, there are 17. They range from in
spots like Cafe Colonial to upscale churrascarias like Plataforma,
a shrine to meat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cafe Wha, there are at least six bars in
Manhattan featuring Brazilian parties, including weekend afternoons
at Coffee Shop and Saturdays at the Zinc Bar. A Web site that keeps
track of the action includes information on Lambateria NY, a dance
school; photographs of Brazilian parties like Bahian Music Mondays
at the Elbow Room , and for the homesick, a virtual tour of Rio's
Sugar Loaf Mountain: www.inergy.com/sambagirl.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle of young, creative people began earlier this decade,
a result of financial self-confidence in one of the world's largest
economies. (It is uncertain how the devaluation of Brazil's
currency last week, which sent economic jitters around the world,
will affect emigration, but one possibility is that talent could
continue leaving Brazil.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical of this generation of hip emigres are the Lee sisters
from Sao Paulo, a triumvirate of Brazilian fashion, food and music.
They have Korean surnames, Amazon-Indian first names, Portuguese
accents, expensive cell phones and Manhattan addresses. Jupira Lee,
a restaurateur, arrived in 1988. A year later, she was followed by
her sisters, Iara, a record producer and film director, and
Jussara, a clothing designer.
</P>
<P>
   The three spoke over strong coffee and cigarettes at Casa, a
spare Brazilian eatery that Jupira opened four months ago on
Bedford Street. Primitive portraits by Geova Rodriguez, another
Brazilian living in New York, decorate the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Their native Sao Paulo ``is a city of attitude _ it's all about
money, just like here,'' Jupira said, adding, ``So, understanding
New Yorkers is not hard for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Iara agreed that Sao Paulo is much like New York, except for the
chill, both literally and figuratively. ``What we miss is the
social warmth,'' Iara said. ``It's the complaint you hear most from
Brazilians here, the lack of warmth. At least at first, New York is
cold. But that's the price you pay.''

 NEW YORK: you pay.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lee sisters roll their eyes at stereotypes of their country.
``We are more than just parrots and Carmen Miranda, you know,''
Jupira said. ``People always come in and ask for avocado stuffed
with shrimp. We don't eat that in Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   What they do eat, she said, is Brazilian stroganoff and
pan-fried pollack in coconut milk, two of Casa's specialties.
``It's all home cooking,'' Jupira said. ``It's all about Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   Capairinhas, one stereotype the sisters do embrace. They enjoy
initiating New Yorkers into the ritual of the powerful sugary green
drink at parties. They gave one for Casa's opening, and for the
1996 premiere of ``Synthetic Pleasures,'' an independent film
directed by Iara.
</P>
<P>
   Iara, who is married to George Gund III, an arts patron and
owner of the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League, also
started a record label in 1997, named Caipirinha Music. Her next
film, based on a 19th-century Brazilian novel, will be shot on
location in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   The costume designer for her films is often her sister.
Jussara's current collection, inspired by Bahia, the predominately
African region of Brazil, features skirts that wrap around the body
and gauzy fabrics in earthy tones. The designs are surprisingly
demure. ``I want my clothes to convey the sensuality of Brazil,''
she said. ``But not that overtly sexy thing, with tight leather and
little cut-outs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jussara now has more competition from home. Last year, Tufi
Deuk, a Sao Paulo designer whom Vogue magazine has called the
``Calvin Klein of Brazil,'' expanded in New York. He has opened a
showroom, and his line is available at Language, a boutique that
carries unusual clothing and housewares from around the world and
that has a gallery in back for artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Latins who share the ethos of the American dream, only
with a different flair,'' Deuk said. ``There is certainly a degree
of nostalgia and glamour associated with Brazil that just feels so
right at the moment _ an exoticism and sense of style that is based
on familiarity. Brazil can be seductive that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such familiarity can be an obstacle for Brazilians trying to
adjust to New York's frostier social clime. ``New York went against
my natural being for the first six months,'' said Lipe Medeiros, a
co-owner of Language. ``I had to learn not to be Brazilian to get
by.'' Medeiros said that meant not looking people in the eye, and
holding himself back from making faces at cute babies in the
subway, which he once did, causing the mother to scream.
</P>
<P>
   Medeiros is a Paulista, as Sao Paulo residents are known, who
designs furniture from scaffolding equipment and sells it in the
store, which he runs with his wife, Ana Abdul, a painter from
Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Medeiros worries that he is assimilating too much. ``When I
went to Sao Paulo, I looked completely like a gringo, with baseball
cap and all,'' he said. ``Everyone tried to speak English to me.''
</P>
<P>
   One language spoken fluently in both New York and Brazil is
music. New York is where bossa nova landed 40 years ago. With the
current nostalgia for 1950s cocktail culture, the smooth Brazilian
lounge rhythms are again popular.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Alves, a promoter, began Brazil Night at Cafe Wha two and
a half years ago. ``It became an instant success,'' he said. ``They
even know about Cafe Wha in Rio.'' He now has a New York-area
mailing list of 18,000 people, about 80 percent of whom he says are
from Brazil. Alves, 37, brings live Brazilian music to New York,
and next month plans to start TBB magazine, a monthly roundup of
Brazilian culture.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of Brazilian musicians includes Bebel
Gilberto, who has performed at Lincoln Center, at the Bottom Line
and at Cafe Wha. A soft-spoken, black-haired woman, she is cutting
an eclectic album that mixes Brazilian acoustics with techno and
other modern influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is a bit conservative with its music,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't have the courage to do what I do here.'' Ms. Gilberto
comes from a venerable Brazilian musical family; her father, Joao
Gilberto, is a singer who was once married to Astrud Gilberto.
``I'm the stepdaughter from Ipanema,'' she said. ``When I'm there,
I feel a lot of pressure to carry out that tradition. It's too much
baggage. But in New York, I feel free.''

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Stock markets throughout Latin America
rebounded strongly Friday on hopes that Brazil's currency would not
tumble out of control. But analysts warned that several countries
in the region faced a period of extreme economic volatility, with
the likelihood of devaluations, rising interest rates and growing
unemployment through the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Brazilian stock market's spectacular 33.4 percent
rise Friday, Argentina's stock market rose 12.3 percent, while
Mexican stocks climbed 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a consensus has emerged among Latin American and
Wall Street economists that the region is facing a year of flat
growth, rising unemployment, disappointing corporate earnings and
sliding government tax receipts. Pressure on currencies throughout
the region _ particularly in Mexico, Venezuela, Peru, Chile and
Colombia _ are mounting, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   As the largest market in Latin America, Brazil's weaker currency
is bound to put competitive pressure on its regional trading
partners. Those pressures will only grow as the Brazilian
devaluation helps to drive down the international prices of
commodities crucial to Latin America's economic health _ namely
oil, grains, paper goods, and metals like copper and tin _ as most
economists expect.
</P>
<P>
   In oil-dependent Ecuador, for example, interbank interest rates
this week soared to 140 percent while the central bank spent $90
million in a desperate and probably vain attempt to defend its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   A report by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell this week forecast ``a
sharp deterioration in the outlook for economic growth in Latin
America.'' From a projection of 3.5 percent growth for all of Latin
America made six months ago, the investment banking firm now
projects a negative 0.1 percent growth rate for the region this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But while the economic picture is far from healthy, economists
and government officials say that Latin America is not poised for
the kind of economic and political shocks that have shaken Asia in
the last year. Latin America's economies are not as dependent on
foreign trade as, say, Japan or Thailand, and the shocks from
Brazil's sliding currency have not come with the same suddenness as
the Asian financial contagion of late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And while Argentina came under the most pressure from stock
selling by international investors earlier in the week, analysts
said its banks and government were in good shape to withstand the
Brazilian shock waves largely because the peso was pegged
one-to-one to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's stability, economists noted, is tied to the fact
that only 8 percent of its economy is based on foreign trade and
because President Carlos Saul Menem is committed to keeping the
peso pegged one-to-one to the dollar. That policy diminishes the
possibility of a return to the days of hyperinflation and galloping
devaluations. Underscoring the success of his monetary policy,
Menem on Friday called on all of Latin America to establish a
common currency based on the dollar. The suggestion received no
immediate support around the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reasons to hope things will settle down and we are
close to bottoming out,'' said Raul Elizalde, head of fixed income
research at Santander Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to paint too rosy a picture,'' said Donald
Hoskins, the manager of U.S. Trust's Excelsior Latin America fund,
``but there is relief that Brazil is not going to try the
impossible task of defending a partial devaluation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Charles Clough, an influential stock analyst at
Merrill Lynch, told institutional investors in a conference call
Friday that the rebound in the Latin American markets signaled a
good opportunity to sell Latin stocks and move money into Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent views reflect the uncertainty of how far the
Brazilian real will fall in the coming days and months, and whether
Brasilia will be able to slowly decrease interest rates to spawn
higher growth rates in the months ahead. Should Brazil be able to
stabilize its currency quickly, analysts say, its consumers will be
able to resume buying Argentine automobiles and Chilean wines and
the regional economy will resume the steady growth of the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts agreed that the fallout of Brazil's crisis
would vary widely around the region.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela escaped much of the stock market turbulence of the
last week. But it is the country attracting the most concern of
economists and stock market analysts largely because of the low
price of oil, which is responsible for up to half of the
government's revenues. President-elect Hugo Chavez, a populist who
led a failed coup in 1992, is still an unknown quantity and most
analysts say he will be faced with an almost immediate economic
crisis when he is inaugurated next month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the bolivar, Venezuela's currency, may be
overvalued by as much as 50 percent, making a devaluation likely in
the coming months. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell predicts the bolivar,
now 570 to the dollar, will slide to almost 900 to the dollar by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's central bank reserves, used for paying interest on
the debt and cushioning the debt, are down to $10 billion from $17
billion a year ago. Interest rates have climbed to 35 percent from
15 percent at the end of 1997, and economists predict they will
climb to more than 40 percent by the end of the year, forcing the
country into a deep recession.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential trouble spot is Mexico, where Jane Heap, Latin
American strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, predicted, ``you
will see volatility in the peso.'' Mexico's currency in the last
week alone has seesawed between 8 and 11 to the dollar, putting
added pressure on its stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   In economic terms, analysts said, the peso's shakiness is likely
to generate increased inflation, which in turn will bring down real
wages. The government has been trying to lower interest rates below
30 percent, but now most economists think they will go higher.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists feel that Argentina looks best able to weather
the crisis, even though it is currently attracting the most concern
of international investors because Brazil represents 30 percent of
its foreign trade. Argentina's automobile industry will be hard hit
in the coming year, but the country is expected to easily find
other foreign markets for its beef and agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Brazil or Mexico or Venezuela where a confidence crisis
means that people sell assets or withdraw money from banks in order
to buy dollars,'' said Joaquin Cottani, chief Latin American
economist at Lehman Brothers, ``the government in Argentina is calm
and it has reason to be so.'' While Argentina's Merval stock market
index has gone on a wild ride the last three days, Argentines have
not moved assets out of their banks, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most economists believe Argentina is heading into
a recession because of the downturn in Brazil. Merrill Lynch, for
instance, has lowered its 1999 gross domestic product forecast this
week from positive 2.1 percent to negative 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row, Argentine officials Friday denied
any intention to budge from their currency peg to the dollar or
from any other free-market policy. ``Argentina has competitiveness
beyond Brazil,'' said Economy Minister Roque Fernandez, who added
that new grain markets could be found with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean officials in recent
days have made strong statements denying any intentions to devalue
their currencies abruptly, and so far their currency markets have
remained largely stable. Still, analysts predicted that interest
rates would rise in all three countries as the governments
struggled to defend against speculators.

HOUSE MANAGERS MAY ASK SENATE TO INVITE CLINTON TO TESTIFY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a growing consensus among the House
prosecutors to ask the Senate to invite President Clinton to
testify in his impeachment trial, prosecutors and their aides said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., favors that approach as a way of
pressuring Clinton to testify, and none of the 12 other prosecutors
opposes the idea. But Hyde wants to discuss the proposal one more
time with his colleagues, perhaps after oral arguments on Saturday,
before making the request to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately denounced the growing sentiment
among the House prosecutors, and some Senate Republicans, to
strong-arm the president to defend himself in person in his
impeachment trial, calling it a partisan trap designed to embarrass
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've oftentimes in this process shifted quickly from judicial
to political, and I think that may be the case here,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The Republicans have just taken a
poll on this, and this is a winner, they think, for them.''
</P>
<P>
   House managers hope to call about half a dozen witnesses,
including Monica Lewinsky; Betty Currie, the president's secretary,
and Vernon Jordan, the president's long-time confidant. But the
prosecutors, eyeing a new Time-CNN poll that found that 66 percent
of those surveyed want Clinton to testify, are hoping to force him
to so or face political embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he really is innocent, he should come down to the Senate,
he should testify, he should present his case,'' said Rep. James
Rogan, R-Calif., one of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., wrapped up his oral argument to
senators Friday with a plea to call witnesses, including Clinton:
``Invite the president to come and judge everybody's credibility
for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts in Congress said it was an open question as to
whether the Senate could legally compel Clinton's testimony. There
is no precedent for compelling the testimony from anyone subject to
impeachment. President Andrew Johnson did not testify at his Senate
trial in 1868, but he was never subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   The more salient issue is whether Senate Republicans want to
risk extending the invitation, knowing full well that Clinton would
almost certainly refuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans sympathetic to the House managers so far are
avoiding any direct confrontation with the White House on Clinton's
possible appearance. ``I'd like to see him testify, but he's not
going to be compelled,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the
Republican whip.

IMF CRITICIZED FOR POLICIES ON RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Prominent Russian figures lashed out at the
International Monetary Fund Friday for prescribing what they called
the wrong medicine for curing the country's fiscal ills, but they
forcefully urged the agency to resume lending to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A senior IMF official brushed aside the attacks, making clear
that Russia must either bow to the agency's demands for greater
fiscal austerity or do without a key loan package.
</P>
<P>
   Urging higher tax collection and a host of other difficult
measures, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said
there was a straight and narrow path for Moscow _ and that it was
paved with more revenue and less spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any other way of doing it, unfortunately,''
Fischer told a Harvard University conference on foreign investment
in Russia. ``Russia is bound by those same simple rules of
economics and arithmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based IMF, in a humiliating retreat, suspended a
$22.6 billion loan package to Moscow in August as the government
devalued the ruble and suspended billions of dollars in debt
payments. The crisis, which plunged the country into fresh economic
and political turmoil, came just one month after the IMF had
granted Russia a $4.5 billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, and some Western economists and leaders, have
argued the IMF cripples the sick emerging markets it aids by
demanding innappropriately tight spending amid Depression-like
conditions. In Russia's case, critics say, the measures stifled
recovery and growth and ignored systemic features, such as a web of
nonpayments among companies and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely obvious the IMF didn't take into account the
specificity of Russia, our particularities and our psychology,''
said Andrei Kokoshin, vice president of the Academy of Sciences and
former head of the policy-making Security Council. ``They used a
formula. There is even greater reason today to doubt the IMF's
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kokoshin, an influential player in Moscow, said the IMF should
dispense the next loan installment immediately and help Moscow win
approval for a rescheduling and perhaps write-off of around $100
billion in Soviet-era debts.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, the reformist ex-prime minister who now heads a
presidential council on local government, urged the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been very critical of the recipes of international
financial institutions, especially the IMF,'' said Nemtsov, who is
more influential in the West than in Russia. ``It would be a much
wiser policy on the part of the IMF to provide Russia with
additional loans as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia desperately needs money to help meet interest payments on
government debt due this year. But a collapse in commodity prices _
Russia is a big oil exporter _ and an exodus of foreign investors
have left Moscow with depleted coffers.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, parliamentary deputies have outlined a 1999
federal budget that counts on about $5.5 billion from foreign
governments, the World Bank, and the IMF, with $4.3 billion of the
total coming from the latter. From that budget, Russian deputy
economics minister Vladimir Kossov said, there could be no further
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF argues that its one-size-fits-all economic formulas
reflect fundamental macroeconomic principles. Russia is a mess, it
says, because it has never been able to muster the political will
to enact tough reforms, including enterprise restructuring,
bankruptcy measures, and tax crackdowns on powerful firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need and will stay engaged in Russia,'' said Fischer, who
held talks with First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, head of
econominc policy, in Washington's main airport Thursday night as
the two waited for an icestorm to subside. ``There is no intention
to withdraw from Russia.''

MARKET INSIGHT: ACROSS EUROLAND, ECHOES OF A DEVALUATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 17) 
(bl) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year began so brightly for Europe. After years of dreaming,
scheming and compromise, a flip of the switch on Jan. 1 transformed
Continental Europe into Euroland: one market, one central bank, one
currency.
</P>
<P>
   It has not taken long for reality to reassert itself. The
resumption of Brazil's financial and economic crisis has, at least
for now, reinforced the notion that Europe is no greater than the
sum of its parts. Some of those parts, it is noted, are vulnerable
if Brazil's troubles deepen and spread.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Howdle, head of European equity strategy for Salomon Smith
Barney in London, took some time last week to share his views on
where Continental markets are headed and why.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's not much of a surprise that U.S. markets don't like
what's happening in Brazil. But European markets are also reacting
badly. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brazil is an early reminder that this is going to be a tough
year for the economy, underscoring the likelihood that this will be
the weakest year for global growth since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   German markets have been hit quite hard by Brazil, not only
because of the loan exposure of German banks, but also because a
number of their big industrial companies do a lot of business
there. Portugal has some exposure in Brazil. But the country with
the biggest and broadest exposure to Latin America is Spain.
Spanish banks and utility companies are getting beaten up right
now, which may throw off some buying opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Generally speaking, what is your outlook for European stock
markets?
</P>
<P>
   A: Essentially, equity markets are caught between a difficult
real economic environment and a favorable interest-rate
environment. By the end of the year, we think cheap money will have
prevailed over recession and deflation fears. But it will be bumpy.
We will have positive returns on equities, but not on the scale of
the last four years, when they have been rising at more than 20
percent a year. This year we think stocks in the euro zone will
rise about 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is the money going to come from to fuel stocks? What
stocks are investors likely to be buying?
</P>
<P>
   A: The mamas and papas of Europe have a ton of money in bank
deposits, but not much in equity mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   For every 12 euros they have on bank deposit, they have 4 in a
mutual fund. And only 1 of those 4 is in an equity mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Until three or four years ago, retail investors didn't trust
equities. But since 1996, flows into equity mutual funds have
increased sevenfold, to $80 billion. But that is a small amount of
the personal savings pool.
</P>
<P>
   As far as where the money will be invested, we think there is
going to be a lot of buying concentrated in the largest, most
liquid stocks, issues like Royal Dutch/Shell, DaimlerChrysler,
Deutsche Telekom, Nokia, ING and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't European pension funds underinvested in equities as
well?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the past, the asset allocation of pension funds has been
much lighter in stocks than comparable institutions in the U.S.
Continental pension funds, insurance companies and the like have
only 20 to 30 percent of their assets in stocks. In the States, the
equivalent institutions would have closer to 60 percent of total
assets in equities.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the difference is that returns on bonds or cash
in Europe were traditionally much higher than equities. But with
interest rates down, they won't be able to meet target growth rates
if they are relying on returns of 2 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the big institutions were to increase their equity exposure
from 20 to 30 percent of their assets to 50 percent, that would
represent a shift of $2 trillion. Right now, the market
capitalization of the entire euro market is just under $4 trillion.
They can't move that much money all at once, but it is a huge
potential reservoir of demand.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of markets, which ones do you like the best right
now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the smaller markets on the fringe of Europe _
Finland, Ireland and Portugal _ have the potential for the biggest
gains. I think this because those economies are not going to be
slowing down as rapidly as Germany, for example. And those small
markets have traditionally traded at a discount to the bigger
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have effectively been merged into one market, when
portfolio managers line up all the banks, for example, and look for
the cheapest ones, they may find them in these peripheral
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which sectors of the European market do you like?
</P>
<P>
   A: To get through this year, it is best to stick to a narrow
group. Concentrate on banks, financial service companies and
secular growth sectors like media, telecommunications and
technology. In many ways this will be a rerun of 1998, with the
exception of the consumer sectors. They worked last year, but I
don't think they will in 1999.

   Switching to New Jobs, But Endangering Savings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A core tenet of this era of layoffs and diminished corporate
loyalty is that workers must manage their careers aggressively,
moving from company to company as they deem necessary. Indeed,
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, the outplacement firm based in
Chicago, reports that baby boomers _ the dominant age group in the
work force _ have taken that idea to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Its quarterly job-search statistics show that an increasing
number of boomers in the middle of their careers have already made
several job switches. In 1991, 23 percent of job seekers with a
median age of 43 had worked for four or more companies. By 1997,
some 41 percent of job seekers, with a median age of 45, reported
working at four or more places. The trend held through the first
three quarters of 1998, Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger said job-hopping boomers might be overlooking one
costly down side in particular: Multiple moves limit the amounts
they can build up in employer-run retirement savings programs, like
401(k)s. The biggest risk is for workers who take lump-sum cash
distributions from pensions or 401(k) plans before turning 59{.
</P>
<P>
   If they fail to transfer the money to another plan or roll it
over into an IRA within 60 days, they can lose more than 50 percent
of those savings to income taxes and penalties for early
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger cites data from the Employee Benefit Research
Institute in Washington, showing that 60 percent of job-changers
who took distributions from plans in 1996 failed to meet the 60-day
deadline for rollovers, thus forfeiting a substantial portion of
their savings to the government. &QL;

COMMENTARY: LARRY FLYNT STONED
</HEADLINE>
 (also see FLYNT-BARR-REVIEW, which will move Saturday morning) 
(bl) 
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We didn't need Larry Flynt to tell us that Bob Barr is a
hypocrite. The Georgia congressman's sleazy marital history was
already public back in '96 when he had the gall to champion an
absurd bill called the Defense of Marriage Act _ which that other
proud defender of marriage, Bill Clinton, then signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   But we may need Larry Flynt anyway _ not to expose any
impeachment manager's sex life but simply because his very presence
exposes the disingenuousness of everybody else, conservative and
liberal, Republican and Democrat, press and public, who inhabits
the epic Bosch canvas that is Monicagate. In the land of the pious
hypocrite, the honest pornographer is king.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in which the president repeatedly told us he didn't
have sex with that woman, and his antagonists repeatedly told us
that their case ``is not about sex,'' and the media constantly
lamented how horribly sad they were to be covering this sex-driven,
albeit lucrative, story, Flynt's candor is downright refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, he refers to himself as a ``smut publisher'' who
wants ``to sell (his) magazine,'' not a public-minded seeker of
truth. He openly declares his partisanship (``I love Clinton. He's
a great president.'') and eagerly declares his hope to have ``the
effect of derailing the impeachment process.'' The Hustler editor
who serves as Flynt's collaborator in tracking down congressional
trysts unabashedly describes their enterprise as ``vandalism,'' not
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost too delicious to watch Flynt throw his
higher-minded colleagues in the news business into conniptions.
Washington's bloviator-in-chief, David Broder, brooded on PBS about
how ``the mainstream press'' is now having its agenda set by ``the
bottom-feeders in our business'' _ and yet he works for the paper
(The Washington Post) that first asked the adultery question to a
presidential candidate (Gary Hart) and is a regular on ``Meet the
Press,'' the first mainstream Sunday gabfest that made a panelist
out of Matt Drudge, the Clinton-haters' answer to Flynt (though not
as factually accurate).
</P>
<P>
   Flynt's antics have similarly prompted many mainstream TV news
outlets _ CNBC, ABC's ``20/20,'' CNN, ``CBS This Morning'' _ to
demonstrate yet again that, for all their pious declarations to the
contrary, the scandals they care most about are those with sex.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual allegations about Barr have received far more play
than the revelations of his involvement with a white supremacist
organization _ much as TV pursued Monica rather than Clinton
fund-raising and wag-the-dog scandals, and largely ignored Henry
Hyde's S&AMP;L shenanigans and Dan Burton's campaign-finance chicanery
to air their sexual histories instead.
</P>
<P>
   The viewing audience, which tells pollsters it's had enough sex,
exercises its own hypocrisy by rewarding Flynt's appearance on
``Rivera Live'' with the show's highest rating since the O.J. civil
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The other hypocrites unmasked by Flynt's pranks could fill a
Cabinet department. It's hard to stop laughing when Dick Morris,
who sucked prostitutes' toes while on the White House payroll,
decries Flynt for ``degrading American politics.'' Jerry Falwell, a
past Flynt legal foe, now goes on TV to condemn his old adversary's
tactics _ never mind that Falwell himself marketed a video accusing
the president of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative politicians and publications that happily feasted
on a tabloid's purchase of Gennifer Flowers' revelations and the
recent Drudge-spread hoax about an illegitimate Clinton son are now
fuming about Flynt. Liberals and feminists who vehemently attacked
a Hollywood film for ostensibly sanitizing the Hustler publisher's
odious depiction of women are curiously silent about his pursuit of
Barr &AMP; Co. As for the president, his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, says
that his boss wants Flynt to ``cease and desist.'' Oh, puh-leeze!
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt is a bull in the china shop of false pieties, empty
pretensions and sexual sermonizing that have brought us to this low
moment in American history. On Thursday, alas, he checked into a
Los Angeles hospital with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The networks that have been broadcasting soap operas rather than
the Senate trial that their anchors keep calling ``historic'' can
only pray that Flynt, who has it in his power to make impeachment
must-see TV again, gets well soon.

<P>
   If you are a worker 50 or older with a big income, or a young
worker with a bright future, Bill Roth has a valuable proposal for
you. Everyone else may want to hold onto their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., who brought us the spousal
Individual Retirement Account in 1976, the everyman IRA in 1981
and, last year, the Roth IRA, wants to create a Roth 401(k) and,
for nonprofit-group and government workers, a Roth 403(b).
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after his Roth IRA, workers would contribute after-tax
dollars today, but those contributions and any gains would be
tax-free at withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   He would also increase the retirement savings limits. The
$10,000 annual limit on 401(k) savings would rise to a total of
$15,000 for both traditional and the proposed Roth 401(k) plans.
And if you are 50 or older you could save 50 percent more, or
$22,500, divvying up the money between traditional and Roth 401(k)
plans.
</P>
<P>
   IRA accounts of all kinds would have a $5,000 limit ($7,500 for
older workers), up from $2,000. And if existing income caps on IRAs
are eliminated, it would mean that workers could save $20,000
annually in a combination of 401(k) and IRA plans ($30,000 for
workers 50 and older), with money split between traditional and
Roth plans any way the worker chooses.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, who are not saving the maximum allowed now, his
plan may make little difference. And it could also present a
disadvantage because most people expect to have a lower income in
retirement: In a Roth plan one would be paying taxes at a high rate
today to avoid lower taxes in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But for workers who because of high incomes, thriftiness or both
are saving the maximum and want to save more, the plans would be a
bonanza. A worker in the top tax bracket who is 50 today and saves
the $10,000 maximum this year in a 401(k) and $20,000 in a taxable
investment and earns a 10 percent pretax return, would have
$74,120, after taxes, to spend at age 65. Under Roth's plan the
worker could spend $125,317, all untaxed, or 69 percent more
money. &QL;

   A Buyout King Looks Ahead &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been wondering whether there is too much cash
flowing into leveraged buyout funds these days, but Thomas H. Lee,
known for his buyouts of Snapple, General Nutrition, Raytheon and
TRW, answered an emphatic no to that question last week at a New
York City breakfast meeting for buyout enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   By the calculation of Lee, president of the Boston-based Thomas
H. Lee Co., private equity funds hold about $60 billion, up from
about $50 billion in 1998 and $30 billion about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   While that seems a hefty amount, Lee points out that the deals
being done these days are only moderately leveraged _ in the range
of 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 times cash, on average _ versus those of a
decade ago, when junk bonds ruled and 10-to-1 leverage ratios were
common.
</P>
<P>
   That means that leveraged-buyout funds have about $180 billion
to $200 billion in purchasing power, or less than 2 percent of the
$11 trillion market capitalization of the Wilshire 5000, a broad
stock index.
</P>
<P>
   What themes does Lee, whose company recently raised its largest
buyout fund, a $3.45 billion pool, see arising this year? He is
paying lots of attention these days to how companies that deal
directly with consumers use technology and the Internet to expand.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the euro is here, Lee, 54, isn't ruling out doing
international deals in his medium-size company niche, as long as a
strong local partner is in place.

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bidding Adieu to a Century &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium draws to a close, so is time short for
Twentieth Century, the former name of the Kansas City, Mo.-based
American Century Investments and a moniker that still graces many
of its funds. The company plans to drop Twentieth Century from all
its fund names in March. The Benham name, which graces some of its
other funds, will vanish, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the American Century-Twentieth Century Ultra fund will
become American Century Ultra, while American Century-Benham GNMA
will be renamed American Century GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the real 20th Century approaching, ``it's
probably as good a time as any to drop Twentieth Century and retire
it for good,'' said a spokesman, Chris Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're essentially knocking 16 characters out of the name,'' he
said, making the fund names easier to retrieve on Internet sites
and to read in newspaper listings.

AMA JOURNAL EDITOR DISMISSED OVER SEX SURVEY ARTICLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association dismissed the editor of its
leading journal on Friday, charging that he had rushed through a
paper on whether college students think oral sex is ``having sex''
in order to influence President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the executive vice president of
the American Medical Association, said the incident, which sparked
a firestorm of protest in the community of medical journalists,
followed what he said was a steady erosion of his faith in the
editor, Dr. George D. Lundberg. Although Anderson would not be
specific, others said that Lundberg had nettled many in the medical
community over the years when he published controversial articles.
</P>
<P>
   The paper that proved to be Lundberg's downfall was by Dr. June
Machover Reinisch, the former director of the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at the University of
Indiana in Bloomington, Ind. In it, she concluded that in an
eight-year-old survey of college students, 59 percent said that
oral sex did not constitute ``having sex.'' It will appear in the
Jan. 20 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said in a statement that he had dismissed Lundberg
because by publishing Dr. Reinisch's article now, Lundberg ``has
threatened the historic tradition and integrity of the Journal of
the American Medical Association by inappropriately and inexcusably
interjecting JAMA into a major political debate that has nothing to
do with science or medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Anderson said that ``there was an
acceleration of the timing'' in the publication of the paper. He
added: ``I happen to believe that Dr. Lundberg was focused on
sensationalism here, not science. It grieves me greatly that that
magnificent journal that should be about science and medicine has
been used to extract political leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Anderson also said that ``over time, however,
I have lost confidence and trust in Dr. Lundberg's ability to
preserve that high level of trust and credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, reached at his home, where he is recovering from a
broken elbow, said he could not comment other than to say that
Anderson called him at 8:15 a.m. on Friday and told him he was no
longer editor of the journal. ``My attorney has me under wraps,''
Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The journal, under Lundberg's 17-year term as editor, has taken
strong positions on subjects like the dangers of tobacco and the
public health threat posed by violence. It has also published
articles that made some in the medical community wince. These
included a recent series of articles on alternative medicine; a
paper claiming, with what some said was weak evidence, that eating
fish slashes the risk of sudden death from heart disease; a paper
by an 11-year-old girl who reported that therapeutic touch was a
sham, and an anonymous essay by a doctor who told of how he took it
upon himself to kill a cancer patient to relieve her suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it was more or less inevitable that Lundberg would
lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me,'' said Dr. Richard Smith, the editor of
the British Medical Journal, who emphasized that he admires and
supports Lundberg. ``I had almost been waiting for it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The current paper, by Dr. Reinisch, was different from other
controversial articles, however, because it was not even a new
study. The paper made it clear that the survey's main conclusions
were published previously; the oral sex part was, apparently,
leftover data.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reinisch could not be reached for comment, but she told The
Washington Times on Thursday that she had thought of submitting a
paper on the oral sex findings to a journal last year, but then
changed her mind because, she said, she thought the Clinton sex
scandal ``would only last two weeks or so,'' whereas ``it usually
takes six months to a year to get scientific papers published.''
When the oral sex issue did not go away, Dr. Reinisch said, she
decided it would be ``irresponsible'' not to publish her data. So
she sent a paper to the Journal of the American Medical Association
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the paper has a certain news value now that it would
not have had if it were published before or after the Clinton sex
scandal, medical experts said. But the question remains, Why did
Lundberg decide to publish it? It typically takes six weeks to six
months from the time an article is submitted until it is published,
according to a staff member at the American Medical Association.

</P>
<P>
   Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University
who is a member of the editorial board at the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said he could think of two reasons.
Both tied into the impeachment hearings
</P>
<P>
   ``One is that he has a genuine belief that this is the most
important political decision in this century and every bit of
evidence on it should be published,'' Dr. Reinhardt said. The
other, he said, is that the subject is suddenly of news value. And
the journal, likes others, he added, ``loves being noticed in the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that it was his decision to dismiss Lundberg and
that he had made it despite an outcry from his own editorial board.
One member of that board, Dr. Jack D. Barchas of Cornell University
Medical College, said he and others called Anderson to try to stop
him from removing Lundberg. ``We were begging him to reconsider,''
Barchas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us feel anger, outrage, and a sense of betrayal by the
decision,'' Barchas said. Lundberg, he added, ``has been fearless
in publishing papers, even controversial papers, based on the best
tradition of science and the best tradition of peer review.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine, which is the chief competitor of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said her journal would never have
published the sex survey paper because ``it is trivial _ who cares
what a bunch of college students say'' about whether oral sex is
sex, she said. ``It also is irrelevant to the Clinton case,'' she
added. ``He wasn't asked the question in that context.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, Lundberg's decision to publish the paper ``is not
a reason to fire an editor who's been there 17 years and by almost
anyone's estimation has put a small society that no one took
seriously on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said his office has been deluged by callers
expressing support.
</P>
<P>
   One was Robert W. Seligson, who is the executive vice president
and chief executive of the North Carolina Medical Society.
Anderson, he said in a telephone interview, ``was careful and
decisive in doing the right thing.'' He said he has the utmost
confidence in Anderson who is ``very knowledgeable about the issues
and doesn't shoot from the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry L. Greene II, who is the executive vice president of
the Massachusetts Medical Society, also supported Anderson. He said
it is a publisher's role ``to take action,'' if he feels the
journal's integrity is threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (THE REST IS OPTIONAL)
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, in England, expressed dismay at the furor over the
sex paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the whole of the United States is going
mad with this impeachment thing,'' he said. ``There's something
crazy about the society.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Smith added, when Lundberg finally was dismissed, ``it's
probably no accident that this was about sex.''

MARE'S WORTH $1 MILLION MORE AFTER WINNING BREEDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much does winning a Breeders' Cup race increase the value of
a thoroughbred? In the case of the 6-year-old mare Escena, the
answer is $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the $2 million Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill
Downs Nov. 7 brought $3.25 million at auction Tuesday, a record for
a broodmare at the Keeneland January Sale. The daughter of
Strawberry Road won three Grade I races last year and is likely to
win the Eclipse Award as top handicap mare when the winners are
announced Feb. 16. Escena, who was consigned for sale by Lane's End
Farm, was purchased by bloodstock agent Reynolds Bell on behalf of
Guy Snowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a hell of a price,'' said Bell. ``I think,
before the Breeders' Cup, she was valued at about $2.5 million.
After the Breeders' Cup, I figured she was at $3.5 million. She was
a great racemare and I think she'll make a great broodmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for a broodmare at the sale was the $3
million paid for Lucky Lucky Lucky in 1986, and she was in foal to
Northern Dancer. Escena won the Distaff by a scant nose. It was an
inch that was worth a cool million.

<P>
   The heroes of last year's Triple Crown _ Real Quiet, who won the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and Victory Gallop, who captured the
Belmont Stakes _ may meet in the New Orleans Handicap at Fair
Grounds March 7. Real Quiet who has not raced since losing the
Belmont by a nose June 6, worked 5 furlongs in :59 3/5 at Santa
Anita Monday, and trainer Bob Baffert indicated he may take him to
Cajun country. Meanwhile, trainer Elliott Walden wants to give
Victory Gallop, who was fourth in the $5.12 million Breeders' Cup
Classic, one race before taking him to Dubai for the $4 million
World Cup March 28. There he will likely face defending champion
Silver Charm, also trained by Baffert, and the New Orleans Handicap
could be the spot for Victory Gallop's prep race . . . Jersey Girl,
undefeated in seven starts in 1998, has returned to training at
Gulfstream Park after recovering from a fractured right knee. Now
age 4, Jersey Girl has not raced since winning the Test Stakes at
Saratoga Aug. 1. ``Any time you have a horse of this stature, the
important thing is to take it slow,'' said trainer Todd Pletcher.
``Right now we need to make sure that she progresses well. But
we're quite confident. We might be looking at a February or March
return to breezing.'' Jersey Girl, a daughter of Belong to Me,
garnered strong consideration for the Eclipse Award as best
3-year-old filly but will likely finish behind Banshee Breeze, who
was second to Escena in the Breeders' Cup Distaff . . . Tactical
Cat, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, is recovering from a leg fracture
suffered while winning the Del Mar Futurity Dec. 12. ``The horse
will come back 100 percent,'' said Lukas. ``We'll probably just
wait for the Travers. He'll definitley be back.'' . . .. Mike
Smith, who fractured two vertebrae in a spill at Saratoga Aug. 31,
will return to racing Feb. 1. ``The doctors have released me to
ride,'' said Smith. ``I'm feeling good, but to be honest, I really
won't be able to tell much more until I start getting on some
horses.''

</P>
<P>
   It's never too soon

<P>
   Saratoga is accepting reservations for this year's 36-day
meeting, which runs from July 28-Sept. 6, with Tuesdays dark.
Clubhouse seats are $6, while grandstand seats are $4, and all
trackside seating is done by mail order. Tickets may be purchased
in four plans. Plan A requires purchase of the same number of
tickets for every racing day; Plan B requires purchase of the same
number of tickets for six consecutive racing days; Plan C requires
purchase of the same number of tickets for all of the meet's
three-day weekends; and Plan D covers all other requests. Make
checks payable to the New York Racing Association and mail to
Saratoga Reserved Seats, P.O. Box 030257, Elmont, N.Y. 11003 . . .
The Ontario government last month granted slot machines to Woodbine
in Toronto and Mohawk Raceway, the area harness track. It took the
Ontario Jockey Club 2 1/2 years of lobbying to gain the right to
offer slots. The racing industry will receive 20 percent of machine
revenue, split evenly between the horsemen and the tracks. The
machines could be in Mohawk by May and in Woodbine by the fall.
Extensive renovations will be made to both tracks in order to
accommodate the machines, the number of which has yet to be
determined. Woodbine, which hosted the Breeders' Cup in 1996, is
already a first-class track, and when the slots come, the purses
should soar . . . The Breeders' Cup will be at Gulfstream this year
and most probably Santa Anita in 2000. Making a strong bid for 2001
will be a new player, Sam Houston Race Park. Houston is the
nation's fourth-largest city, and the track has been doing well.
``We have the ability to expand to the needs of the Breeders' Cup
in hosting horse racing's biggest day,'' said Bob Bork, general
manager of Sam Houston. ``We are a relatively new horse racing
market, and this would be an excellent chance for the horse racing
industry to showcase the excitement of the world's greatest races
to a market that is hungry for this event and gain new fans.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Given the gravity of the occasion and everything on
the line, an observer might reasonably expect an attention to
detail that is, well, unimpeachable.
</P>
<P>
   But a certain sloppiness has infected the Senate trial of
President Clinton, at least when it comes to spelling.
</P>
<P>
   The first big mistake came on the very first day, when senators
signed their oaths to be impartial with pens that scrambled the
letters in the country's name, and in a rather ominous fashion at
that. These were the ``Untied States'' that the senators would be
serving and safeguarding as they weighed the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president's highly paid, vastly skilled lawyers churned
out a trial memorandum for the Senate early this week that bobbled
their boss' surname, dropping a consonant. The cover page read,
``Re the Impeachment of William Jefferson Cinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Thursday, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of the 13
Republican congressmen acting as prosecutors in the Senate trial,
took a pointer and turned toward an intricate chart with one
glaring mistake. The first word of its title was misspelled, so
that what Hutchinson was referring to was a ``Calender of Job
Search Activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's a spelling gremlin loose somewhere around the
U.S. Capitol. Or perhaps events are hurtling forward with too much
speed and passion to accommodate such niceties as linguistic
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a flurry of activity,'' explained Christopher
Battle, a spokesman for Hutchinson. ``The charts did not arrive
until practically moments before the presentation. We were back
there behind the Senate chamber unpacking them even as the
congressman was preparing to go on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said in an interview Friday that Hutchinson and his staff
members noticed the error but decided it was not important enough
to ditch the chart altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``He smiled and blew it off,'' Battle said of Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   But Battle said that other hastily produced charts for other
congressmen came back from printing companies so riddled with
errors that they were unusable. He spotted one, he said, that
listed the punishments for a crime called ``bulgary.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said he had fielded only a few calls Friday from people
who noticed the chart error. By contrast, John DeCrosta, a
spokesman for the Senate president pro tempore, Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., said he got scores of calls last week about the
botched pens, even though the writing instruments came from the
Senate secretary's office.
</P>
<P>
   DeCrosta conceded to being mystified by all the misspellings
afoot. ``They are certainly not indicative of the character or
caliber of the men and women in the Senate,'' he said.

NAOMI MITCHISON ,  AUTHOR AND FEMINIST REBEL , DIES AT 101 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Scotland, Spain, Greece)   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Naomi Mitchison, author of more than 70 books, bohemian
free thinker and feminist long before the term was coined, died on
Monday at her home on the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland. She was 101.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects and genres of her novels, biographies, poems,
memoirs, short stories, political tracts, book reviews and magazine
articles ranged over the successive enthusiasms of her life:
ancient Greece, socialism, genetics, science fiction, space,
fascism in Spain, home rule for Scotland and independence movements
in Africa, where she became the honorary mother of a tribe in
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   Her personal life drew as much attention as her work, from
shocking contemporary convention in the 1920s by declaring her
marriage an open one to her championing of birth control in the
1930s to her continual fights with publishers who insisted on
removing explicit references to sex from her books.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel against social restrictions on women from her youth, she
had a tendency to lash out physically at men to prove her point,
once throwing a half-plucked partridge at the Labor Party leader
Hugh Gaitskill and on another occasion bopping a dinner guest over
the head because he asked the woman seated next to him to fetch his
dinner from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Married for 54 years and the mother of seven children, she was
asked on her 90th birthday if she had any regrets. ``Yes,'' she
said, ``all the men I never slept with. Imagine!''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Margaret Haldane was born in Edinburgh in 1897 and brought
up in Oxford as a member of a privileged family that produced a
number of patrician politicians and noted scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Taught alternately at a private school in Oxford and at home by
a governess, she had a precocious interest from earliest youth in
being a more active participant in life than the conventions of an
upper-class girl's upbringing in Britain allowed. She assisted a
brother and the young Aldous Huxley as they performed experiments
on guinea pigs on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916 she married Gilbert Richard (Dick) Mitchison, a lawyer
who was a Labor member of Parliament from 1945 to 1964, when he
joined the House of Lords. She never used the title she gained,
Lady Mitchison, preferring to be known by her nickname, Nou.
</P>
<P>
   She told friends that she was disappointed by her introduction
to sex, complaining that it was ``so unlike Swinburne.'' In 1925
she and her husband both subscribed to the idea of an open
marriage, in keeping with her statement that marriage amounted to
``domestic prostitution'' and ownership of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be fairly obvious to everyone who considers it that
there is something profoundly wrong with the sexual life of people
in general and particularly perhaps of married people,'' she said.

<P>
   She wrote her first book in 1923, and her early writing met with
critical success while causing scandal with its emphasis on
subjects like rape, infanticide, lesbianism and abortion. In 1931
she became a literary force in Britain with the publication of
``The Corn King and the Spring Queen,'' a fantasy set in Scythia in
200 B.C. with a story based on an act of incest.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote less effectively on socialism, an interest she
developed from her husband's involvement in Fabian Society politics
and her observation of the victims of the Depression. She remained
an activist the rest of her life, running unsuccessfully for
Parliament herself in 1935 and then serving on a number of boards
and councils representing Highland and island communities in
Scotland until her 90's, when she was, in her words, ``booted out
on grounds of age.''
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1930s she held forth at Carradale, her 300-acre
farm on the Mull of Kintyre in Argyllshire, riveting diffuse
collections of writers, Labor politicians, African visitors,
academics, scientists, local fishermen and hunters, children and
grandchildren. She was not distracted from writing by all the
people in her drawing room, and she once said she felt most
creative when pregnant. The title of a 1985 memoir was ``Among You
Taking Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1970; she is survived by three sons, two
daughters, 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   She was a commanding presence in her own salon, speaking with a
mystical authority that her fellow author and friend, Elizabeth
Longford, likened to ``what I imagine to be the kind of voice
possessed by a Celtic prophetess reading the runes.''
</P>
<P>
   At a British Council party in the early 1960s she befriended an
African student who invited her to Botswana for his investiture as
chief of the Bakgatla tribe. She was later named ``honorary
mother'' of the tribe and traveled there often into her 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years she changed her hobby listing in Who's Who from
``keeping up with the family'' to ``surviving so far'' to ``burning
rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   Her keen pursuit of new subjects continued into her last years.
``Dying is quite the most interesting thing that is going to happen
to me now,'' she recently said. ``I often wake up in the night and
wonder if it's starting. I would really like to take notes.''

W.R. GRACE PAID FINE _ 10 YEARS LATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid an aggressive public relations offensive to
counter its portrayal in the film ``A Civil Action,'' W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co. had to pause this week to explain an embarrassing glitch: the
multinational firm did not pay its fine in the related criminal
case for 10 years _ just as cameras for the Hollywood production
were rolling in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A Grace spokeswoman confirmed to the Globe that the $10,000 fine
was paid in 1998, a decade after the corporation pleaded guilty to
one count of a two-count criminal indictment charging that it lied
to the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose role in the famous Woburn pollution case is
getting national attention because of the release of the box office
hit, could not explain the delay in paying the fine, which was
levied by the US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation of Grace's late payment has rubbed salt in
the wounds of those in the Woburn community who are convinced that
the firm's pollution led to the cancer-related deaths of seven
children and one adult.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders and families of the victims note that Grace has
refused to acknowledge its role in the pollution of the city's
drinking water. They said the delay of payment of the fine confirms
to them the company's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of their arrogance and their refusal to
aceept responsibility,'' said Carol Donovan, the Democratic state
representative who represents Woburn. ``They just don't want to
accept any responsibility for anything they have done.'' Anne
Anderson, whose son Jimmy died of leukemia in 1981, said she is not
surprised at Grace's having let a decade pass before paying the
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would it surprise me?'' said Anderson, who spearheaded the
case that led to the lawsuits against Grace and Beatrice Foods.
``They have never wanted to admit guilt or any degree of
culpability. What they consider right and wrong in their eyes, I
will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney R. Robert Popeo, who defended Grace in the
criminal case, said the corporation had ``acted responsibly with
respect to this matter.'' He said the delay in payment was an
oversight by prosecutors, the court, and the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the oversight was called to the company's attention the
fine was paid promptly thereafter,'' said Popeo, who is
representing General Electric in a pollution case in Pittsfield.
Federal and state environmental agencies say GE is guilty of having
polluted its property and the Housatonic River with chemical PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Jane McGuinness, director of communications for W.R. Grace, said
the company was ``equally surprised'' the fine had not been paid
earlier. She noted the fine is dwarfed by the ``millions of
dollars'' the firm is paying for cleaning up its property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would have not been purposefully remiss on the
$10,000 fine,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   As ``A Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall,
climbs to the top of the box office charts, Grace has mounted a
strong public relations offensive to counter the allegations raised
in the case. The charges had lain dormant until the best-selling
book by the same name appeared several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it used the experience to revamp its
environmental policies. ``Grace has spent 12 years applying lessons
learned from these earlier mistakes and restoring the community's
confidence and trust,'' the company reports on its Internet site,
which was designed to deal with the publicity generated by the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The families' lawsuit identified Grace and Beatrice Foods as
owners of property near the wells where there were huge toxic waste
dumps. After an 80-day trial in 1986, a jury concluded Beatrice was
not responsible for the pollution and the case against the firm was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury did find that Grace was potentially culpable. The
corporation, however, settled with the families before the start of
the new trial that Judge Walter J. Skinner had ordered, paying them
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case that received far less attention, Grace
pleaded guilty to one count of a two-count criminal indictment
brought by the US attorney's office that accused the company of
lying to the EPA about the amount of potentially toxic chemicals it
had purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's plea in May 1988 _ meant that it conceded prosecutors
had enough evidence for conviction if the case had gone to trial,
but still maintained it was innocent of the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the plea, the firm was admitting to its undereporting of the
amount the chemical acetone that was purchased by its Woburn plant.
</P>
<P>
   It was another chemical cited in a separate section of the
indictment, trichloroethylene, that seeped into Woburn's drinking
water. But while prosecutors had charged that Grace lied to the EPA
when it told the agency in 1982 it had only purchased one drum of
the chemical, the company did not concede that point when the case
was settled.

CLINTON TO OFFER AT LEAST ONE CLEAR MESSAGE IN STATE OF UNION
SPEECH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 17) 
 
By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaking before his prosecutors and his jurors,
President Clinton will give a State of the Union address Tuesday
before a joint session of Congress that lays out his agenda for the
year and presents one clear message: He's here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill may be in a tizzy over the historic impeachment
trial in the Senate, but President Clinton intends to show a
nationally televised audience that the White House is conducting
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this address may serve as a road map for a
post-scandal Washington with Clinton, however wounded by the
impeachment process, determined to complete what would be the final
24 months of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to do is continue to work on the problems
that people in this country care about and the politics will take
care of itself,'' said Doug Sosnik, the president's senior policy
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   According to White House officials, Clinton will outline
proposals for the United States' aging population, improving
education, strengthening families, fighting crime, enhancing
military readiness, making the nation more racially inclusive and
expanding economic opportunities, including a possible increase in
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   He is also expected to again state his opposition to a
broad-based tax cut until Congress deals with Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will stand before a joint session of Congress and a
nationally televised audience as the nation's second impeached
president, Clinton likely will not dwell on his own predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The president's annual address to Congress falls on the very day
that his legal team begins its presentation to the 100-member
Senate on why House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
do not merit removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The speech comes just days before the first anniversary of the
revelation that independent counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating
allegations that the president lied under oath and tried to cover
up an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton gave the State of the Union address six days
after the scandal became public Jan. 21. Although some members
urged Clinton to delay the speech, it helped quiet initial calls
for his resignation and sparked public support for him despite
unresolved questions about the affair and investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was considerable suspense (a year ago) about what might
or might not happen,'' one White House official said. ``Now, we
know what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pushing for Clinton's removal from office concede
they lack the 67 Senate votes needed to oust him. The likelihood
that the Senate, with 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats, will muster
the two-thirds vote _ even if House prosecutors get to call
witnesses such as Lewinsky _ seems dim at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, two-term presidents suffer from fading influence
in their final two years in office. Clinton will be further hobbled
by his impeachment, even if the Senate trial ends with his
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to counter that weakness, administration officials said
the president in his speech Tuesday will propose an agenda that
focuses ``on doing the people's business,'' a theme the White House
has harped on throughout the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to hear what we will do to change their lives, not
ours,'' said one White House official.
</P>
<P>
   However optimistic and forward-looking Clinton's remarks may be,
many experts say the Senate trial and aftermath of impeachment will
leave his presidency severely weakened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be the great proposer, but he really doesn't have the
leverage to do more than tinker at the edges of policy,'' said Earl
Black, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will continue to be extremely energetic. He won't be like
Ronald Reagan in his last two years, but I don't see how that is
accompanied by any political power to achieve great things,'' Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Holsworth, a political science professor at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond, noted that Clinton's biggest
legislative achievements so far have come because he was able to
form coalitions with Republicans and moderate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Clinton will be beholden to liberal Democrats in
the House who have fought his impeachment, Holsworth suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there's a greater pressure within the
Republican Party not to give him credit for anything and not to
work so closely with him in order to argue that there's a definite
need for a change in 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosnik argues that Clinton and the Democrats are the only
ones with an agenda and that Republicans eventually will be forced
to make legislative concessions. He noted in 1996 that Republicans
made deals with the White House on minimum wage increases, welfare
reform and health care changes to have some accomplishments to show
voters during the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a tremendous amount of pressure on the
Republican Party to demonstrate to the American public that they
care about something other than getting the president,'' Sosnik
said. ``The political marketplace is going to force them to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rozell, a political science professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, recalled how Clinton's 1998 State of the Union speech
resuscitated his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he'll be able to repeat that feat, but he
certainly has the political skills to give a boffo performance''
Rozell said. He suggested Clinton also will have a ``significant
policy legacy'' despite the mark of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's all about the survival of his presidency and
somehow trying to re-establish some credibility as a leader and
doing those things doesn't leave a lot of time left for this
president to actually achieve other things,'' Rozell said. ``The
clock is ticking pretty fast here on this second term.''

IMPEACHMENT JURY MUST CONSIDER VOTERS, SCHOLARS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The politicians deciding President Clinton's fate
repeat the argument like a mantra: It's not our job to care whether
he was twice elected by the American people or that he remains
popular. If he committed high crimes, the Constitution mandates
that we complete the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our founders bequeathed to us a nation of laws _ not of polls,
not of focus groups, and not of talk-show habitues,'' explained
Representative James Rogan, a California Republican, in his opening
arguments to the Senate this week.
</P>
<P>
   As grave and compelling as that reasoning may sound, however,
legal scholars and historians believe it is off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, they said Friday that the framers of the
Constitution intended for members of Congress to take voters'
sentiments into account when deliberating the fate of a president.
And several suggested that Republicans, in particular, may have
undercut their case by seeming to disregard people's views toward
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, by leaving the phrase `high crimes and
misdemeanors' deliberately vague, the framers wanted our elected
representatives to take into account what's good for the country,''
said Michael Les Benedict, a historian at Ohio State University and
author of a book about President Andrew Johnson's impeachment
trial. ``And, of course, that has to include the desires of the
people who elected them.''
</P>
<P>
   William Van Alstyne, a Duke University law professor and harsh
critic of the president, agreed. ``I don't have any question that
it's constitutionally allowable and appropriate for the public
attitude to be considered. That doesn't mean, after due
consideration, that they can't decide to oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Alstyne and others said Clinton's critics could have helped
their cause by acknowledging his wide support, then explaining that
countervailing legal and constitutional considerations outweighed
that single factor. Americans are often willing to give their
legislators leeway on major issues of disagreement, the analysts
said, but only if they perceive the politicians' positions as
principled and well-considered rather than political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes people as arrogant when they hear the House members
or the senators say we don't care what the people think,'' said
Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University Law
School. He added that voters also grow cynical because ``they don't
believe any politician doesn't really care ... even if it's only
about their individual pockets of constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those interviewed Friday based their judgments about
constitutional intent on the fact that impeachment powers were
granted to the legislative branch, not the judicial. They said that
decision showed the framers did not want the process to be
conducted by appointed judges, but by politicians elected by _ and
therefore answerable to _ the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they decided the president has clearly set out to mislead
the people, then they can't trust him and he should go, but you
can't make that judgment without listening to the people,'' said
Lawrence Sager, a professor at New York University Law School.
Sager added that he believed lawmakers are ``wrongheaded'' when
they portray removal by impeachment as a ``punishment'' for crimes
committed in office. If that were so, he said, the open possibility
of subsequent criminal proceedings would constitute double
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The drafters of the Constitution, according to the scholars,
included an overtly political dimension in the impeachment process
so voter-sensitive lawmakers would keep the standard for removal
from office extremely high, lest they endanger their own careers.
``They wanted to be very sure that the upsetting of the outcome of
an election wouldn't be something the Senate would do lightly,''
said Richard Parker, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, director of the Eisenhower Center for American
Studies at the University of New Orleans, said the framers didn't
foresee the advent of an adversarial two-party system _ but they
still imposed a two-thirds-vote standard for removal from office
``to prevent a legislative coup d'etat.''
</P>
<P>
   None of those interviewed suggested that voter opinion should be
a senator's paramount concern in deciding how to vote on evicting
Clinton from the White House. Moreover, they all acknowledged that
politicians, particularly when dealing with sensitive issues, walk
a precarious line between acting as representatives and leaders for
their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all asserted that those constituents should be a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I checked, when they remove a president, they
don't remove their own votes but yours and mine,'' said Akhil Amar,
a constitutional specialist at Yale Law School. He said a primary
reason the founding fathers made it easier to impeach a judge than
a president by setting lower standards was that legislators approve
thousands of appointments to the federal bench _ so removing judges
is a follow-up to their own action _ while voters install their
sole president.
</P>
<P>
   Van Alstyne differed on this point, saying he believed the
Constitution's authors were motivated primarily by a distrust of
the judicary when they gave impeachment powers to Congress.
Nevertheless, he agreed that their intent was for public opinion to
be considered.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Bork, the conservative former federal judge,
asserted that the senators should entirely ignore public-opinion
polls ``and follow the law.'' Bork, now a resident scholar the
Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, said doing
otherwise would empower demagogues _ he counted Clinton as one _
who seemingly can lure followers regardless of their own behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if there were armed mobs in the streets ... ready to
tear everything apart, you might want to consider that as a matter
of prudence,'' said Bork. ``But we're nowhere near that point
now.''

SENATORS GET SOME BUSINESS DONE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten minutes before the impeachment trial of
President Clinton resumed Friday, Senate Minority Leader Thomas A.
Daschle and Senator Edward M. Kennedy convened a sudden news
conference to address the ``matter of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know you are dying to ask questions about the Patients Bill
of Rights,'' Daschle said, ``so we are making ourselves
available.''
</P>
<P>
   The laughs quickly subsided. So, too, did curiosity about the
state of health-care legislation. Within minutes, there were
questions about the impeachment trial, whether witnesses would be
called, whether the senators were surprised by opening arguments in
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle and Kennedy pressed on with health care, attacking
the substance of a Republican proposal announced hours earlier in
front of an equally disinterested crowd. And although it made a
strange counterpoint to the day's events, their focus made one
thing clear: Impeachment is not as laborious and all-consuming as
some have made it seem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the obvious distraction, both parties have
nearly completed their agendas for the coming session of Congress,
holding committee meetings and conferences to decide which bills to
file next week. No legislation has been passed; none ever is before
the president's State of the Union address, which is scheduled for
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But, taking a cue from the president, several senators Friday
seemed to be stepping up their efforts to focus on governing, even
as they swore they were solemnly focusing on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all like variety,'' said Senator Mike DeWine, an
Ohio Republican.
</P>
<P>
   During two meetings over the last week, aides said Republicans
spent at least three hours hammering out an agenda and a list of
priorities: Social Security, education, tax cuts, missile defense
and health care. Friday, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
assistant majority leader, unveiled the GOP plan to reintroduce a
Patients Bill of Rights in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, which is similar to one that stalled
in the Senate last year _ the self-employed would be able to deduct
100 percent of their health-care costs immediately, rather than
gradually, he said. It would also expand medical savings accounts
and guarantee access to emergency rooms, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that the Democrats will join us in a bipartisan
effort,'' Nickles said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican news conference, Kennedy and Daschle
quickly convened their own. Saying he was ``deeply disappointed''
that the Republicans chose to reintroduce a bill so similar to the
one Democrats objected to last year, Daschle said that under the
new GOP proposal, two-thirds of patients using health maintenance
organizations would still be unable to appeal decisions made by
bureaucratic forces or demand that a doctor be a part of all
aspects of their care.
</P>
<P>
   Next Tuesday, before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist arrives
from the Supreme Court to resume the impeachment trial at 1 p.m.,
senators will convene that morning to introduce their top 10 bills.
Each party will have one hour to describe its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Democratic agenda is expected to mirror the last,
with an emphasis on education, health care, Social Security and the
minimum wage. Daschle and Kennedy are expected to introduce two
pieces of legislation together, one on education, which would seek
to improve the quality of teacher training, and another on health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to move ahead on the country's business,'' Kennedy
said. But, he added, ``until impeachment is settled, we're
effectively stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans vigorously disagreed, saying they had
accomplished more than they would have under normal circumstances.
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, said the Senate is
``probably further ahead this Congress than we have been in the
past because we've been here all through January.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, impromptu policy discussions broke out in the Senate
chamber during the 15-minute breaks in the impeachment trial. At
one break, DeWine stopped Senator George Voinovich, newly elected
to the other Ohio seat, to talk about a steel bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had at least three conversations about specific bills on the
Senate floor,'' DeWine said. ``I think when the trial is over,
people will be very glad to get back to doing the normal business,
but the normal business is going on now, too.''

W.R. GRACE PAID FINE _ 10 YEARS LATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid an aggressive public relations offensive to
counter its portrayal in the film ``A Civil Action,'' W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co. had to pause this week to explain an embarrassing glitch: the
multinational firm did not pay its fine in the related criminal
case for 10 years _ just as cameras for the Hollywood production
were rolling in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A Grace spokeswoman confirmed to the Globe that the $10,000 fine
was paid in 1998, a decade after the corporation pleaded guilty to
one count of a two-count criminal indictment charging that it lied
to the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose role in the famous Woburn pollution case is
getting national attention because of the release of the box office
hit, could not explain the delay in paying the fine, which was
levied by the US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation of Grace's late payment has rubbed salt in
the wounds of those in the Woburn community who are convinced that
the firm's pollution led to the cancer-related deaths of seven
children and one adult.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders and families of the victims note that Grace has
refused to acknowledge its role in the pollution of the city's
drinking water. They said the delay of payment of the fine confirms
to them the company's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of their arrogance and their refusal to
aceept responsibility,'' said Carol Donovan, the Democratic state
representative who represents Woburn. ``They just don't want to
accept any responsibility for anything they have done.'' Anne
Anderson, whose son Jimmy died of leukemia in 1981, said she is not
surprised at Grace's having let a decade pass before paying the
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would it surprise me?'' said Anderson, who spearheaded the
case that led to the lawsuits against Grace and Beatrice Foods.
``They have never wanted to admit guilt or any degree of
culpability. What they consider right and wrong in their eyes, I
will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney R. Robert Popeo, who defended Grace in the
criminal case, said the corporation had ``acted responsibly with
respect to this matter.'' He said the delay in payment was an
oversight by prosecutors, the court, and the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the oversight was called to the company's attention the
fine was paid promptly thereafter,'' said Popeo, who is
representing General Electric in a pollution case in Pittsfield.
Federal and state environmental agencies say GE is guilty of having
polluted its property and the Housatonic River with chemical PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Jane McGuinness, director of communications for W.R. Grace, said
the company was ``equally surprised'' the fine had not been paid
earlier. She noted the fine is dwarfed by the ``millions of
dollars'' the firm is paying for cleaning up its property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would have not been purposefully remiss on the
$10,000 fine,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   As ``A Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall,
climbs to the top of the box office charts, Grace has mounted a
strong public relations offensive to counter the allegations raised
in the case. The charges had lain dormant until the best-selling
book by the same name appeared several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it used the experience to revamp its
environmental policies. ``Grace has spent 12 years applying lessons
learned from these earlier mistakes and restoring the community's
confidence and trust,'' the company reports on its Internet site,
which was designed to deal with the publicity generated by the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The families' lawsuit identified Grace and Beatrice Foods as
owners of property near the wells where there were huge toxic waste
dumps. After an 80-day trial in 1986, a jury concluded Beatrice was
not responsible for the pollution and the case against the firm was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury did find that Grace was potentially culpable. The
corporation, however, settled with the families before the start of
the new trial that Judge Walter J. Skinner had ordered, paying them
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case that received far less attention, Grace
pleaded guilty to one count of a two-count criminal indictment
brought by the US attorney's office that accused the company of
lying to the EPA about the amount of potentially toxic chemicals it
had purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's plea in May 1988 _ meant that it conceded prosecutors
had enough evidence for conviction if the case had gone to trial,
but still maintained it was innocent of the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the plea, the firm was admitting to its undereporting of the
amount the chemical acetone that was purchased by its Woburn plant.
</P>
<P>
   It was another chemical cited in a separate section of the
indictment, trichloroethylene, that seeped into Woburn's drinking
water. But while prosecutors had charged that Grace lied to the EPA
when it told the agency in 1982 it had only purchased one drum of
the chemical, the company did not concede that point when the case
was settled.

IN FIRST BOUT SINCE HIS SUSPENSION WAS LIFTED, TYSON FIGHTS FOR HIS
FUTURE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Francois Botha said he had been thinking about Mike
Tyson a lot in the last four months. He did not say whether those
thoughts included any deep concerns over his own personal safety
once the two meet in the ring here at the MGM Grand on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But during the weigh-in on Thursday, with both fighters stripped
down to their black briefs, Botha, who outweighed Tyson by 10
pounds, was struck with a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is not so big,'' Botha said.
</P>
<P>
   But is he still bad?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question will determine the boxing future of
the 32-year-old Tyson (45-3), who will earn $10 million for his
first fight since his boxing license was revoked for biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during their title bout on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   People can see for themselves just how much Tyson has left on
pay per view at $49.95 a pop. An undertone of morbid curiosity
pervades this bout. If Tyson struggles to get past Botha (39-1), a
former International Boxing Federation champion and a huge
underdog, then his future will be even murkier. Many people
probably will tune in to see if Tyson will self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why the festive, frenzied fan atmosphere at the
MGM Grand that normally surrounds a Tyson bout has been lacking.
Ticket sales have been slow, and some local sports book operators
have complained that the betting on this contest is lower than
usual for a Tyson fight.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is trying to maintain his intimidation factor. A few weeks
ago, when he was asked what he expected Botha to do once Tyson
charged at him at the opening bell, Tyson said, ``Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Here on Wednesday, Tyson was asked whether he stuck by that
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implicitly,'' he said with a snarl.
</P>
<P>
   The greater subtext of this fight is whether Tyson will maintain
his cool in the ring. He went through a battery of mental
competency tests by psychologists and psychiatrists from
Massachusetts General Hospital before he could regain his boxing
license from the Nevada State Athletic Commission. The gist of
their findings was that while Tyson was mentally fit to box, there
was no way to predict his behavior in the ring, particularly if he
was provoked.
</P>
<P>
   If he can get out of the first round without getting knocked
out, Botha plans on provoking Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always talk to my opponents in the ring, trying to get them
to make a mistake,'' Botha said. ``I'll talk to him. I can't say
what I'm going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha, 30, the grandson of a wealthy cattle rancher, was born in
South Africa and immigrated to the United States in 1990. He calls
himself ``The White Buffalo'' and has a straight-ahead style that
will make him easy for Tyson to find.
</P>
<P>
   He also is capable of taking a great deal of punishment. In the
only loss of his career, Michael Moorer punched him so much in the
12th round that the referee stopped the bout. But Botha did not go
down under the barrage of punches.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Brooks, Tyson's new trainer, was Holyfield's co-trainer
for both of Tyson's losses to Holyfield. He has been working with
Tyson to make him a better boxer, eliminating the mistakes that
Holyfield took advantage of in his two victories. He wants Tyson to
throw more combinations, move his head more, become less of a
target. Brooks has also been trying to get inside Tyson's head to
make sure that Botha will not be able to do it during the bout.
Brooks does not believe Tyson will snap again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about Mike's psyche,'' Brooks said. ``Either
you get it or you don't get it.''

EVEN IN BUFFALO, 14 DAYS OF SNOW SEEMS A BIT MUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Even in a city is that is proud to be called the
snow capital of America, where residents say they feel joyful when
the first white blanket forms over Lake Erie, enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mounds of snow are so high here that storefronts and homes are
barely visible from the street. Talk radio has become the means of
communication for people trapped in their homes _ some of them for
nearly a week _ and in need of a snowplow. Despite it all, the mail
did get delivered. Of course, on the east and west sides of town
that meant carriers parked their trucks at a passable intersection
and blaring their horns, alerting residents to run out and collect
their letters.
</P>
<P>
   So while much of the Northeast coped with freezing rain, slush,
sleet and eventually sunshine on Friday, this city of 300,000
contended with its 14th consecutive day of snow _ with total
accumulations approaching 60 inches _ and flakes still falling
throughout the day, though expected to cease on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people in Buffalo are getting pretty sick of this snow,''
said Stacie Simmons, as she undertook what has become a two-hour
ritual of shoveling her driveway. ``At first I thought it was
great,'' she said, referring to the snow. ``But now, my nerves are
wearing thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have declared a state of emergency for much of the
metropolitan area, and driving bans have been imposed so that
government plows can work to keep major streets and highways clear.
Keeping food in stock on store shelves has become increasingly
difficult, and keeping shovels and snowblowers in hardware stores
has been impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the sight of snowplow operators like David
Giambia, exhausted after long stretches of pushing mountains of
snow, are the only ray of sunshine they have seen all month. He
said teams of people like him are working around the clock, but
with at least five inches of snow falling from one day to the next,
sometimes their work seems futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not look as bad as a flood out here, but if you live on
one of these small streets, this is a real disaster,'' he said,
after taking a break from his work on the west side of town.
``There are people who haven't been able to get out of their homes
for days. They can't go to work. Their kids can't go to school.
Their roofs are caving in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Blizzard of 1977 has snow caused such widespread
panic in Buffalo, where people expect high accumulations in
January. The National Weather Service reported that 59.5 inches of
snow had fallen on Buffalo in the last two weeks _ the highest
two-week total in history and the third highest total ever for an
entire January.
</P>
<P>
   People here said that while the 1977 storm _ which raged for
four days and left 29 people dead _ caused more physical damage,
the current snowfall has caused more strains on city services
because it has gone on, without stopping, for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy fire commissioner, John Sniderhan, said city
officials would be requesting federal disaster relief to help the
city pay for the costs of the effort, an estimated $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the city's snow removal team _ about 80 people
with 15 plows and 30 dump trucks _ some 160 members of the National
Guard and five plow teams from Erie County have been enlisted to
help remove snow. Inmates from minimum security prisons from
throughout the area have been assigned to uncover more than 8,000
city fire hydrants and storm drains.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of drivers from the city engineering office have also been
working to clear snow from sidewalks and crosswalks, and Sniderhan
said, the city bought 1,000 extra shovels for volunteer
organizations including the Boy Scouts and Americorps workers to
help wherever necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logistical nightmare,'' Sniderhan said. ``But with all
these people, we have been able to keep the city open. Most cities
would have been paralyzed by all this snow. But our city is up and
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from the considerable traffic on most city streets and
the open signs at many businesses around town, it appeared that
Buffalo had found a way to function even though buried under five
feet of snow. Officials said that no city agencies, except the
schools, had been closed during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in The Buffalo News summed up the city's
attitude. ``Buffalo weather?'' the editorial concluded. ``Hey deal
with it.''

 BUFFALO, N.Y.: with it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than surrendering to the unremitting snow, many
residents, like Dottie and Bob Flynn, strap on their snow boots,
layer on the clothes and work several back-breaking hours a day to
keep their own piece of property clear.
</P>
<P>
   The piles of snow on each side of their driveway are taller than
both of them. About 11 a.m. _ when radio stations reported that the
temperature was about 13 degrees with a windchill that made it feel
like minus 8 _ the couple huffed and groaned as they tried to hoist
more snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' Mrs. Flynn, 58, said, peering out from under the
brim of a baseball cap that was covered by her hood. ``I don't want
to play this game anymore. But it's what you have to do so that you
don't get stuck inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, 62, annoyed that city plows had not traversed his street
in days, said: ``I think the best idea would be to get a whole
bunch of politicians out here talking. The whole block would be
melted in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers at hardware strores around the area said they had no
shovels or snow blowers left in stock. At Home Depot in north
Buffalo, clerks said they sold 33 snowblowers on Thursday in eight
minutes. And the day before they had received a small shipment of
shovels. All were sold in less than half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks at the Wilson Farms convenience store in west Buffalo
said they can hardly keep enough milk, eggs, cheese and bread in
the store. Another big seller, they said, are TV dinners, that went
on sale last week for 99 cents apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man came in and bought 40 TV dinners,'' said Kelly Hunter,
a cashier at the store. ``People want to be ready in case the snow
gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Many food pantries in the area have been forced to close because
volunteers have been stuck at home. Sister Mary Johnice, at St.
Adalbert's on the east side of town, got tired of turning people
away.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers could not reach her church, she said, because the
streets and the church parking lot had not been plowed.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Sister Johnice and two other nuns at the parish
started shoveling the area themselves. On Friday, a dozen others
had joined them, mostly people in the neighborhood who were
inspired by the sight of the nuns struggling against Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a mission to us,'' said Sister Johnice, all of 5
feet tall. ``I decided that I wouldn't ask for help. But I knew if
people saw us cleaning, they would join us.''
</P>
<P>
   News about the snow has made the front page of the daily
newspaper every day for the last two weeks. And it is just about
the only topic of conversation on talk radio, day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Bob from Riverside, complained that they had
not seen a plow in a week. ``I don't think they have any game plan
to deal with this,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Julie of suburban Kenmore, complained about too
many plows. ``They keep me awake all night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some just said they had found ways to forget about the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stay home with a couple of beers,'' said another
listener.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, for the first time in weeks, the main news
on the radio was that the snow would end on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cutler, a spokesman for Mayor Anthony Masiello, said,
``It's like a light at the end of a long, dark tunnel.''

REPUBLICAN DONORS SAY PARTY'S REAL MESSAGE HAS BEEN OBSCURED 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Many of the Republican Party's most
influential financial backers have castigated the party's chairman
and congressional leadership at closed-door meetings here in the
past few days, warning that they were sacrificing voters by failing
to articulate a clear message while focusing on scandal and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The views on the impeachment of President Clinton are not
uniform. Some of the biggest donors told their party chairman on
Thursday night that the impeachment trial had to be brought to an
end. But a more common view was that Republicans in Congress have
an obligation to see impeachment through. The mistake has been
allowing their battle with Clinton to drown out all other issues,
the contributors said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans clearly have been hearing this last message.
They have been going to extra lengths the last few days to
demonstrate that they can carry out the government's work while
conducting the trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the resort meetings of big donors here, several participants
said in interviews that they had confronted Jim Nicholson, chairman
of the Republican National Committee, and other officials about
their distress over how the party fared in the November elections.
They said they had cited polls showing that the party's public
approval ratings have dipped steadily as the impeachment
proceedings against President Clinton go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember scribbling in my notes, `Do something!''' said
Scott E. Luellen, president of a technology company in Falls
Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a disconnect in the RNC right now about what we say
and what we do on a host of issues,'' Luellen said. ``We need
leaders. Most of the comments were aimed at Mr. Nicholson _ he was
at times defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, who faces a challenge to his re-election as party
chairman next week but is expected to win, declined to acknowledge
the serious concerns. Speaking on Friday about a meeting with
Republican Eagles, a group of big donors, he said: ``We had a good
candid discussion. But it was categorically positive. We are going
to have better message discipline about taxes, about improving our
national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mel Sembler, the Republican finance chairman, who was on a
panel with Nicholson, acknowledged that donors were not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of complaints that we talked a good game but
we didn't perform,'' Sembler said. ``They said: `Where were these
tax cuts that we were talking about? Where are all those issues
that we talked about? We're supposed to be doing things _ not just
talking about them. What happened to this tax cut? The House passed
a tax cut, it went over to the Senate, and it just sat there.
Nothing happened. We not only have to craft messages; we have to
execute them.'''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at the luxurious Breakers Hotel of more than 100
members of the Republican Eagles _ those who donate at least
$15,000 to the party every year _ was a reward for their generosity
and an opportunity for contributors to mix with prominent
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   After the Eagles session, Nicholson attended a meeting here of
even larger donors: members of Team 100, who have given at least
$100,000. Some of them said they had cornered Nicholson at an event
on Thursday night and warned that the party was making a mistake in
prolonging the impeachment issue because it appealed only to
already committed supporters.
</P>
<P>
   And at a closed-door meeting of Team 100 on Friday, donors said
they had expressed concerns to Nicholson that were similar to those
voiced by the Eagles the day before. ``There is a worry that we may
allow ourselves to be portrayed as the impeachment party,'' said
one participant in the Team 100 meeting, speaking on condition of
anonymity. But, he said, most of the discussion was centered on one
question: ``What is the congressional agenda? What are you going to
do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   The donors are a critical constituency of the Republican Party.
While no one overtly threatened to withhold support, the unspoken
message at the meetings of the Eagles and Team 100 was that the
party had better shape up or they could begin holding back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope there's not a lot of apathy out there _ I hope
they haven't given up,'' said Ted Welch, a veteran party
fund-raiser who traveled here. ``But there's concern among the
donors that the approval rating of Republicans in Congress has gone
down dramatically over the last few months and that since 1994 we
have lost ground. We can't afford to lose more ground. Republicans
are very concerned about that possibility.''

 WASHINGTON: that possibility.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While some Team 100 members expressed concern about the
impeachment matter, participants said members of the Eagles did not
specifically mention the party's handling of impeachment at their
meeting with Nicholson. Several said they were resigned to the fact
that Republican lawmakers had a duty to move forward with the
trial, regardless of the impact on the party.
</P>
<P>
   Sembler said that before the election, the party ``test-marketed
the impeachment issue to see if it would motivate our contributors
_ it did not.'' He added, ``Our base is interested in issues like
cutting taxes, improving education and reducing crime and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the consensus of many contributors here was that the
party had a powerful message on cutting taxes, improving the
military and reducing the size of the government, but had failed to
convey it to the public. The participants in the meetings here
singled out Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader,
and other party leaders in Congress for not pressing forward with
an aggressive agenda. There were no lawmakers from Washington at
the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``More could have been done this last session,'' said Donald T.
Branning, an Eagle who founded an electronics manufacturing company
in Gilbert, S.C. ``It's disappointing that more legislation wasn't
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Branning said that while Senate Republicans ``have to do the
right thing'' and carry out the impeachment trial, he expressed
worry that it could drag out at the expense of the party. ``It
should be an expeditious process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Brunelli, an Eagle who is a lobbyist in Washington, said
that if the party's low standing in the polls ``truly reflects the
American people, then I'm very discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't think it's the lack of a message. It's a
lack of communicating that message to grass-roots America. It
really is adjusting to governing. We don't want to speak at people;
we need to speak to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to become too glum about his party, Brunelli said: ``I
don't think it's a dark day for Republicans. It's time to stand up
for what we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   No contributor interviewed here expressed delight that the
Republican Party is at all mixed up in the impeachment matter. ``Do
you know anybody who enjoys what we're going through?'' Brunelli
asked. ``I hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who attended a meeting of Team 100 on Friday,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said several donors expressed
deep concern about the party's direction. ``You lose five or six
races and everybody wants to get under the hood,'' he said.
``Everybody recognizes that with impeachment you just don't turn it
off. But they are concerned that it defines the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sembler, who made his fortune building shopping centers, and
several other business executives here likened the private meeting
he had with Eagles to that of stockholders standing up to their
corporate board. ``These are our investors, these are our
stockholders,'' he said, adding that they asked him and Nicholson,
``What are we going to do to improve our performance?''
</P>
<P>
   Some contributors were not satisfied with the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a shareholders meeting,'' Luellen said. ``The
participants were reporting some quarterly losses. But the
leadership seemed to focus on their accomplishments instead of all
the things that aren't going well. In business, that's how you
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   David A. Bardes, an estate planner in Vero Beach, Fla., said:
``Some asked tough questions. But they're entitled to. It's no more
contentious than the Democrats talking to Clinton about what he has
done to them.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fidgeting anxiously, neck-rolling, eye-rubbing,
stretching and straining in the debating chamber, the senator
resembled a driver on the midnight leg of a transcontinental
automobile trip with the radio playing odd scraps of information
about a woman named Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment prosecutor at the lectern was talking about the
woman ``showing her underwear,'' and he was quoting a statement _
``Monica came on to me'' _ attributed to the president of the
United States. Still, the senator quietly seemed to be laboring for
attentiveness.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Sen. Charles Grassley's self-ministrations seemed
to work: The Iowa Republican removed his eyeglasses to rub his eyes
and gaze at the ceiling, more in weariness than wonder. He twisted
tautly. He pushed tensely against the back of his ornate Senate
chair and even switched to another. And he came round, as
refreshed, it seemed, as any ordinary American caught in a long
siege of more mundane jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   Back in control at the listener's wheel, Grassley alertly
continued his way down the impeachment road, wending through the
fourth hour of the second day's latest recounting of the
repetitious narrative of the case for removing President Clinton
from office.
</P>
<P>
   The senator was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long and tedious and arduous,'' Sen. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., admitted beyond the chamber of his jury duty of listening
in long hours of self-silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In there, I just kept thinking it's rather byzantine,'' Dorgan
continued. ``We're here in the Senate, you can hear a pin drop,
every senator's in his seat, we have these long presentations about
very personal matters. You know, I'm a Lutheran Norwegian, and we'd
sooner cut off our arms than talk about these things in public.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the first day of the trial, Sen. Frank Lautenberg was asked
by reporters about his ``historical'' role as juror.
``Hysterical?'' the New Jersey Democrat responded lightly, smiling
and pantomiming a theatrical yawn that played widely on television
news. Friday he was more wary of his gestures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I stepped over the line because I kind of faked a
yawn,'' Lautenberg said, pausing in the Capitol pedestrian tunnel
below the Senate. ``I was talking about the number of hours sitting
in the seat, not the process or the responsibility, not at all. You
know, seven hours of sitting in one place, not talking, is a
disease that senators don't take lightly to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scene at the trial remained one of great patience more then
fresh sensation until an unexpected moment late in the day when a
senator dared to utter the very first objection of the proceeding
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, objected to the use of the term
``jurors'' being applied to the senators, because their role as an
impeachment court is far more complex and powerful. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, an authoritative writer on the history of
impeachment, instantly agreed as chairman of the proceedings. To
the astonishment of onlookers, the chief justice corrected the
floor prosecutor, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a politician who privately
rankles Democrats for having been the first and most dedicated
member of the Republicans' pro-impeachment faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tryers,'' not ``jurors,'' was settled upon as more
appropriate. But the larger issue left hanging in the air was
whether the contretemps might loosen up the trial still further
with more initiatives to be attempted from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to box us in,'' Harkin said later of the
Republican prosecutors, telling reporters that the public should
not be misled into thinking that the Constitution does not allot
far more ``expansive'' impeachment powers to the Senate involving
the national interest, and not merely the factual case against
Clinton. But some Republicans clearly sensed a partisan thrust in
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Through the day, the president's lawyers busily jotted small
yellow notes to one another as the House Republican prosecutors
continued to pound Clinton _ forms of the verb ``to lie'' were used
55 times in just the first hour of accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lindsey, the president's closest political confidant and
White House adviser, sat listening at the counsel table, stonily
attentive as a poker player. He showed no outward reaction,
twirling a pen slowly, as one prosecutor stepped up Republican
pleas that the Senate invite Clinton himself to come and enliven
the place.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial session, the senators' sheer joy in talking was
on display at a news conference over health care legislation. Eight
Republicans indulged their temporary freedom to speak out at
length.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expanding freedom and empowering families,'' declared
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, obviously happy to be out beyond the
strictures of the trial, free to be heard once more.

IMF, UNITED STATES OFFICIALS WARN BRAZIL TO KEEP ITS ECONOMIC
PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having given up on defending the value of its
currency at least temporarily, Brazil got a muted but clear warning
from the International Monetary Fund and the United States Friday
that failure to act quickly on pledges to bolster its financial
condition through spending cuts and tax increases would lead to a
downward economic spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Two top Brazilian officials, Pedro Malan, the finance minister,
and Francisco Lopes, the central bank governor, were flying to
Washington Friday night for meetings on Saturday at the IMF and on
Sunday at the U.S. Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although the collapse of Brazil's effort to prop up the currency
revealed the depth of the country's economic and political
problems, it also came as something of a relief to policy makers,
who had increasingly come to view the attempt as futile and a waste
of the country's dwindling foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday night, the IMF called the decision ``a
wise move to stop the loss of reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing
director at the IMF, said he still expected Brazil to meet the
fiscal targets it agreed to as part of the $41.5 billion
international aid package negotiated last fall. Brazil's failure so
far to enact the politically painful measures needed to reduce its
huge budget deficit led to rapidly mounting pressure on the
currency, the real, and to Friday's decision to let market forces
set the currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said it was ``very early to be drawing any firm
conclusions'' about how Brazil should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer suggested, though, that IMF officials would discuss with
the Brazilians whether they should continue allowing the currency
to float or whether they should attempt to stabilize its value
through intervention in the foreign exchange market or by
establishing a new trading range that the government could try to
enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions on exchange rate systems, on how to make them more
flexible and when, is high on the agenda,'' Fischer told a
conference at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials said they would disclose their plans for the
currency on Monday, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said
Friday night that the government would continue to defend the
currency's value and believed that it would be able to reduce
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters in New York, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said it was unlikely that there would be any new aid pledged
to Brazil this weekend. The solution to Brazil's problems, Rubin
said, ``lies in Brazil itself, in putting together an effective
fiscal program and an effective foreign exchange regime.''
</P>
<P>
   But economists said it was an open question whether Brazil could
restore enough confidence in the financial markets to avert a long
economic slide. They said the country would probably have to keep
extremely high interest rates in place to keep the currency from
free fall, ultimately leading to a choice between a painful
recession or dropping rates and allowing inflation to surge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from a number of countries said they remained
concerned about the possibility of Brazil's troubles dragging down
neighboring countries, including Argentina, and ultimately having
an effect around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled search for a response to Brazil's problems and to
the broader issue of containing the financial turmoil that has
swept around the world for the last year and a half prompted a new
initiative Friday from Germany, France and Japan that is likely to
exacerbate tensions between those countries and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, French and Japanese
officials called for a new international system to limit the
volatility of currencies. The nations provided few details of how
such a system would work, but backed the creation of ``an
exchange-rate regime among major currencies which would reduce
excessive volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has always viewed attempts to control
currency fluctuations with skepticism, if not hostility, and
economists said it was hard to understand why Germany, France and
Japan would call for such a system in the immediate aftermath of
Brazil's failure to control its exchange rate. And American
officials said the focus should be on Brazil's efforts to improve
the soundness of its basic economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Ferguson, a Federal Reserve governor, said it was ``now
even more important that Brazil move as quickly as possible to
implement a clearly sustainable fiscal position and regain the
confidence of international markets and investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank said in a statement that President Cardoso ``has
consistently shown his commitment to implementing Brazil's reform
package,'' but noted that further aid to Brazil was dependent on
the changes actually being enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International,
said the crisis of the last few days created an opportunity for
Brazil to get back on track solving its underlying economic
problems, particularly its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of urgency in Brazil began to evaporate after the
agreement was signed with the IMF last year because there was a
feeling that things were looking better,'' Hormats said. ``The
question now is whether Brazil can use the greater sense of urgency
created by the events of the past few days to move more boldly on
measures to reduce the fiscal deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormats said the experience in Indonesia last year suggested
that it might be futile for Brazil to re-establish an exchange rate
target for the currency until after it had proven to the markets
that it was serious about dealing with its fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
   For the IMF and the United States, Hormats said, one of the most
difficult decisions will be whether to continue providing money to
Brazil if it does not fully comply with the requirements of its
agreement with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they provide the money without Brazil having complied with
the measures, then they take the pressure off again,'' Hormats
said. On the other hand, he said, the fund does not want to repeat
its experience with Russia last year, when a breakdown of Russia's
economic plan led the IMF to cut off assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will avoid at all costs a Russian situation,''
Hormats said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are divided over Brazil's prospects. Desmond
Lachman, an emerging markets research analyst for Salomon Smith
Barney and a former IMF official, said Brazil had an opportunity
now to run its economy with a more realistic exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do what the IMF is telling them to do on the budget
and restore people's confidence, they can bring interest rates down
and not go through a crushing recession,'' Lachman said.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Calvo, the director of the Center for International
Economics at the University of Maryland, said he was very
pessimistic about Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus has shifted from a balance of payments crisis to an
inflation crisis, from an international crisis to a domestic
crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the inflation that a weaker currency creates, the IMF
will probably insist that Brazil keep interest rates high, he said.
But high rates will push the economy toward recession, creating
intense political pressure to reduce rates, he said, a move that
would allow inflation to flare up as the currency falls again and
import prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been the story in Brazil,'' Calvo said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For eight years in Sacramento, Pete Wilson had to
look no farther than the big portrait of Ronald Reagan in his
office to dream of what the future might hold for a Republican
governor of California. Now, in his second week as a private
citizen, Wilson has begun sharing an office suite here with the
former president himself, but the dream remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   As he unpacks boxes and pictures from his tumultuous tenure at
the helm of the nation's most populous state, Wilson is looking
both backward and forward. He is celebrating, explaining and
defending his record _ including a presidential bid that died
aborning three years ago _ and considering one more run for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The table stakes are very high,'' Wilson said of the newly
compressed primary election calendar and the $15 million to $25
million that he says would be needed to run a credible campaign. He
has formed a political committee to advocate his policy ideas but
makes clear that he will run only if he can raise the money. He
plans a foreseeable future of private breakfast soundings and
fund-raising phone calls, and promises a decision by ``late spring
or early summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 65, who was barred by law from seeking a third term, has
already had quite a ride. He has won four statewide elections since
1982 and built a reputation as one of the shrewdest politicians
that California ever produced. He has endured the biggest budget
deficit and enjoyed the biggest budget surplus in the state's
history, and persevered through a punishing recession and a plague
of natural disasters to preside over a booming economic recovery
that in the last three years has seen California create more new
jobs than New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois combined.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also left a trail of controversy and divisiveness
with his support for ballot measures to curtail social services for
illegal immigrants and end state affirmative action programs, and
with his breaking a 1994 re-election promise not to run for
president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Republicans lost the governorship by a landslide,
and their minority in the Legislature shrank to the point where
California is now the nation's most Democratic state except Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as a prospective presidential candidate whose principal
draw is his electoral appeal in California, where a giant pile of
delegates will now be chosen early in the nominating process,
Wilson faces a painful paradox: He left office with the highest job
approval rating of his tenure, but more than 6 in 10 California
voters say they would not be inclined to support him for President.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of his term, he was finally getting some credit
_ and quite a bit of it _ for the outstanding performance of the
economy in 1998,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director of the
Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research
group. ``But assuming that is going to carry over into national
leadership is another matter altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the latest survey by Baldassare's organization shows
Wilson supported by just 5 percent of likely voters in a statewide
presidential straw poll, one-quarter the level of Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson swats away those poll numbers, saying with typical
asperity, ``Well, a lot of them have been told for a long time that
I'm not popular,'' and noting that his ratings on leaving office
were comparable to those Reagan had after eight years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wilson has been hurt by a willingness _ sometimes even a
seeming eagerness _ to take combative stands. His support for
abortion rights and gay rights, which has given him a moderate
coloration useful to any national candidate, has made him a pariah
among many of the conservative activists who dominate the
Republican primary process. His willingness to raise taxes to help
close a crushing budget deficit when he took office in 1991
infuriated anti-tax crusaders while earning him little credit from
liberals, because he insisted on cutting spending by a like amount.
</P>
<P>
   That battle, Wilson says, taught him ``that there are people
who, when faced with certain options, were not capable of
exercising any, and legislators can get away with that, but chief
executives cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst recession since the Great Depression severely
curtailed Wilson's ability to deliver on the notion of ``preventive
government'' that he initially campaigned on. He battled
relentlessly with the state's public employee unions, and only in
the last three years was he able to begin to restore spending for
education, reducing class sizes in the early grades and forcing an
annual student test through the Legislature _ accomplishments on
which his Democratic successor, Gray Davis, is unabashedly
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets no credit for the good things he did for the state;
he's got a legitimate gripe there,'' said Tony Quinn, a moderate
Republican analyst in Sacramento. ``But he picked all these
unnecessary fights.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fight most damaging to Wilson was his support for
Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure curtailing health,
education and other social services for illegal immigrants. It
passed overwhelmingly but has since been tied up in court, and a
Wilson television advertisement with the slogan ``They keep
coming'' roused the state's growing Hispanic population to register
and vote Democratic in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is defiantly unrepentant about his stand, which he says
grew out of a huge drain that illegal immigrants were causing in
the state budget. He accuses his political opponents of demagoguery
and derides Republican critics as ``weak sisters in our party who
make the mistake of letting the other side define the game and the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no `inflammatory rhetoric,''' Wilson said. `` `They
keep coming'? That's a statement of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats have effectively used the issue not only
against Wilson but also against Republicans throughout the state,
and the crowd at Davis' inauguration last week responded with a
thunderous standing ovation when he promised to ``ring down the
curtain on the politics of division.'' Wilson and his wife, Gayle,
alone among the dignitaries on the dais, remained seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were a little tasteless, to be honest,'' Wilson
said of his successor's digs. ``But was I surprised? No. I mean,
that was an audience that was hungry. That was a very partisan
audience. They've been waiting for 16 years.'' Then, in a dig of
his own, at the last Democratic governor, the quixotic Jerry Brown,
he added, ``They've been waiting for longer than that, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's last presidential campaign collapsed after throat
surgery left him unable to speak for nearly four months and he had
trouble raising money. He acknowledges his decision to run as the
one real regret of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't run last time,'' one longtime former aide said,
``they'd be talking about Wilson and Bush as the two powerhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the fund-raising necessary for a presidential
campaign was ``an enormous chore,'' and predicted that the
Republican field would be limited because of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Thomas, who was Wilson's press secretary when he was
mayor of San Diego two decades ago, and in his first, failed
campaign for governor in 1978, said, ``It's very difficult for me
to believe that he will just go quietly into the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare, the pollster, agreed. ``I think it's too early to
count him out,'' he said. ``People have counted him out before,
especially in 1994, and he's somebody who knows how to put together
a campaign to win. That's something the Republicans desperately
need. But he still has an awful lot to overcome to convince those
voters who know him the best _ Californians _ that he's
presidential material.''

AN IMPROVED DEFENSE LABORS IN OBSCURITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ Begin a conversation about why the
Minnesota Vikings have been so dominant this season and the
dialogue will almost always start with their offense. The Vikings
have Randall Cunningham, Randy Moss, Cris Carter and a slew of
other dangerous weapons, and they set a National Football League
record by scoring 556 points.
</P>
<P>
   Begin a conversation about why the Vikings could lose to the
Atlanta Falcons in the National Football Conference championship
game on Sunday and it will almost always start with their defense.
The Vikings have John Randle, Dwayne Rudd, Robert Griffith and
other reliable players, but their defense is not nearly as talented
as their incredible offense. Actually, it is not even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the offense has provided cover for us,'' Minnesota
Coach Dennis Green said. ``If offense provides cover for us, we'll
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy has worked wondrously because the Vikings
have won 16 of 17 games and are one victory from the Super Bowl.
But the Falcons (15-2) are the best team that the Vikings have
played, and they have Jamal Anderson, the sort of running back who
can eat yards and chew up the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping Jamal is where it starts,'' said Orlando Thomas, a
safety for the Vikings. ``That's what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota's 27-24 loss to Tampa Bay on Nov. 1, the Buccaneers
rushed for 246 yards and possessed the football for seven minutes
longer than the Vikings. That is a critical statistic because the
best way to halt the Vikings is by stranding their offense on the
sideline. While this strategy seemed like the approach for
attacking the Vikings, it never worked after Tampa Bay's triumph in
the eighth game because Minnesota is so adept at rumbling to early
leads that teams must resort to passing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Green was asked if the Tampa Bay game provided a
plan for throttling the Vikings, he quickly said, ``I don't think
it's the blueprint at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is one place to start. The Falcons will use Anderson
to attack a defense that ranked 13th in the NFL, which is a
dramatic improvement from last season when the Minnesota defense
was 29th. The Vikings were better against the rush (11th in the
league) than against the pass (19th), but that could be because
opponents had to throw.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Vikings are 9-0 at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have a competent defense with Randle, an All-Pro who
has 10{ sacks and is more effective against the pass; Griffith, who
played strong safety, free safety, nickel back and linebacker while
intercepting two of Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer's passes last
week; Rudd, a linebacker who was second on the team with 113
tackles, and Jimmy Hitchcock, a cornerback who was second in the
NFC with seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense, which is giving up nearly 19 points a game,
happens to be obscured by an offense that averages 35 points a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that our offense is so good, we're overshadowed by
it,'' Thomas said. ``In a sense, I guess it does motivate us. We
have a good defense and everybody wants to do well. I guess we
don't feel bad because we know we have one of the best offenses
ever put together. It's hard for it to be equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it might be impossible, even though Green said,
``Inside the room, no one gets more credit than the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested to Dixon Edwards that the way to beat the
Vikings was to challenge their defense and simply outgun them, the
Minnesota linebacker was incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, is that what they say?'' Edwards said. ``It's the first
time I've ever heard that. I guess that would be motivating for me.
I don't think we've been playing bad. I'd like to know what makes
someone think they can say that specifically.''
</P>
<P>
   Green played down the possibility that the defense could prevent
the Vikings from advancing to the Super Bowl. The coach noted that
that Vikings have not permitted a point in the first quarter in 10
of their 17 games. The Vikings will need more of the same against
the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undersized,'' Green said. ``When you're undersized, you
have to bring a certain attitude with you because people who line
up think they're better because they're bigger and stronger. So you
have to bring an attitude that you're going to be quicker and
stronger. Since we're going to punch each other in the mouth, I'm
going to punch first.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, scarcely a decade after Africa's great
independence wave had begun, many of the continent's new political
creations already had begun to resemble disasters. With no ready
answers to their problems, many African leaders struck upon a new
strategy for explaining their failings to impatient populations
while simultaneously drawing more outside aid: blaming the European
colonizers for Africa's seemingly intractable difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   But if this approach was at least temporarily successful in many
cases, the increasing stridency of the claims made against the
West, set against the backdrop of the growing despotism of the new
leaders, quickly backfired, as both foreign sympathy and assistance
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades or so, conventional wisdom largely
rejected African assertions of outside responsibility for the
continent's problems, and many in the West argued, often with a
growing vehemence of their own, that Africa's bad leaders were
primarily to blame rather than any European legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing years of this century, though, historians,
political scientists and other students of African affairs have
begun a searching re-examination of the continent's recent past.
Increasingly they have concluded that many of its most persistent
curses _ from the plague of ethnic hatred widely known as tribalism
to endemic official corruption _ have powerful roots that are at
least partly traceable to European subjugation and rule.
</P>
<P>
   Among the writings that helped forge this reconsideration are
works like ``Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the
Legacy of Late Colonialism,'' by the Ugandan scholar Mahmood
Mamdani. Mamdani's 1996 book draws extensively on colonial records
to show how Europeans administered their new subjects through a
deliberately authoritarian form of indirect rule _ for which the
author coined the term ``decentralized despotism'' _ that greatly
reinforced or even created notions of ethnicity, helping set the
stage for the tribal conflict that wracks the continent today.
</P>
<P>
   Another work, Basil Davidson's ``Black Man's Burden: Africa and
the Curse of the Nation-State,'' depicts the European process of
decolonization in Africa as one of hasty, even offhand
decision-making filled with a disdain for Africans and their
history and an unquestioning arrogance that assumed that the
political structures of the West were appropriate for Africans even
when they had been given no preparation for making them work.
</P>
<P>
   In these and other scholarly works, African specialists have
made the point that the example left by European rule was one of
politics by sheer domination and not democracy. Then, as is so
often the case now, African states were run with little thought to
the benefit of their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no country in Africa today displays the consequences of
Europe's African past as harshly as Congo, where the
three-decade-old Mobutu dictatorship was violently overthrown in
1997, only to be followed by a bumbling new authoritarian figure,
Laurent Kabila, and more recently by a succession of new rebellions
that are tearing his vast country apart.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before suddenly granting independence in 1960, amid a
wave of simultaneous African independence ceremonies, Belgian
colonial planners still spoke dreamily of holding onto their
possession _ a country 77 times as large as their own _ for decades
more.
</P>
<P>
   At independence in 1960, Congo entered the modern era, nominally
at least, with only a few score high school graduates and less than
500 miles of paved road. The country's first university had been
created by the Belgians only six years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colonial history of the Congo has inclined that country in
a more tragic direction than even most other African countries,''
said Zine Magubane, a South African professor of sociology and
African studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana. ``The
Belgians had no interest in establishing any sort of permanency or
any true state. The country was instead run by a series of
companies that had a free hand at pillaging the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Other African scholars place an emphasis even further back, on
the last decades of the 19th century, when Europe's imperial powers
divided up the continent and defined the borders that remain today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you had before the imposition of this great iron grid of
colonialism was an extraordinarily variegated network of
cultures,'' said Rene Lemarchand, a professor emeritus of the
University of Florida at Gainesville and a lifelong student of
Africa. ``That certainly included some rather extensive and
elaborate kingdoms _ take the case of Ashanti, of Buganda, of Kongo
or of the Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the iron grid was removed,'' he continued, ``what
resurfaced were residues of traditional systems, and in many cases
pre-colonial antagonisms resurfaced.''
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, many Africanists say, colonial subjugation
brutally ended Africa's sovereign evolution toward modern
nation-states, a gradual process of conquest and agglomeration that
has occurred throughout history around the world.

BELL SPURNS AIRTOUCH, WHICH ACCEPTS BRITISH BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprise announcement, Bell Atlantic Corp. Friday dropped
out of the bidding for AirTouch Communications Inc., prompting
AirTouch to accept an offer from Vodafone Group Plc.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, the largest cellular telephone company in the United
Kingdom, is buying San Francisco-based AirTouch for its Euorpean
wireless investements and extensive US operations. The combination
will enable it to create the world's largest wireless company with
a phone network that covers most of Europe and a significant
portion of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which reportedly made a $43 billion bid for
AirTouch in late December, was expected to raise its offer to
counter Vodafone's $54 billion bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News had quoted James Cullen, president of Bell
Atlantic's telecommunications unit, as saying that the phone
company might make a higher offer for AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to pay exactly the right price, a fair price to
AirTouch, a fair price to shareholders, and beat Vodafone by $1,''
Cullen said in a Bloomberg television interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic spokesman said Cullen's comments were based on
negotiations between the company and Airtouch on Thursday. He added
that the negotiations broke off early Friday night. The spokesman
declined to elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic issued a terse statement Friday saying
``discussions with AirTouch Communications relating to as possible
business combination have ended.'' AirTouch is the nation's second
largest wireless carrier after AT&AMP;T Corp. and has extensive
cellular phone investments in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The regional phone company, which operates in 13 states, had
agressively sought to buy AirTouch to create a coast-to-coast
wireless communications network and better compete against AT&AMP;T,
Sprint PCS and Nextel Communications, all national players in the
cellular phone market.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquistion came at a time when Bell Atlantic is
awaiting state and federal regulators to approve its nearly $53
billion acquistion of GTE Corp., the nation's largest independent
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big disappointment,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta
telecommunicatioins analyst. ``Not only is it sad that Bell
Atlantic won't have their national wireless network like they want
and need, but the US wireless market place won't benefit from the
increased competition if Bell Atlantic went head-to-head with AT&AMP;T
wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Altantic's decision to abandon acquisition talks came after
the stock market closed Friday. AirTouch shares rose 4 5/16 to 83
1/8, while Bell Atlantic fell 7/16 to 53 3/8. Vodaphone's American
despositary receipts rose 1 7/16 to 176.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bell Atlantic's effort to acquire Airtouch got a
boost after the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated that
Bell Atlantic could use a tax-free accounting method when making
acquistions. But it was unclear Friday night whether the company
ever increased its initial bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years from now, looking back, I think they (Bell Atlantic)
will be sorry they let this go,'' Kagan said.

UNDATED: the world. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Americas, native populations were exterminated by
arriving Europeans or saw their cultures marginalized by the makers
of new states. In India and many other parts of Asia, conquering
Europeans imposed their new colonial order on states that already
had begun to coalesce to one degree or another around an idea of
national identity.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, meanwhile, Europeans carved out new frontiers as a
function of the existing power balance among themselves, giving an
occasional nod to natural features of the continent like broad
rivers but almost never paying heed to the chosen identities of
Africans themselves or to the political systems already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The example I like to think of is if an African imperial army
had marched into Europe in the Middle Ages and required Germany,
France and England to live together by force of arms,'' said Makau
wa Mutua, a Kenyan scholar who teaches law at the State University
at Buffalo. ``It would have unleashed untold mayhem, and not to
excuse the villainies of Africa's subsequent leaders, that is
precisely what happened when Europe did this to Africa in the span
of 30 years by destroying Africa's existing political structures,
some of them powerful and far-ranging kingdoms, and imposing its
own borders, religions and administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In cataloguing and later registering their African subjects,
Europeans everywhere reinforced and sometimes completely invented
ethnic distinctions that Africans themselves had hitherto managed
with far greater suppleness.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case of this now is that of the Hutu and Tutsi
who predominate in Rwanda and Burundi and are a small minority in
Congo. For centuries the two groups had coexisted peaceably,
marrying, sharing a language and a king. When Belgium imposed its
administration, however, it glorified the minority Tutsi peoples
for their supposedly more European features, creating a de facto
ethnic underclass of the majority Hutu and sowing the seeds of the
cycles of mass killings that have afflicted the two groups since.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, almost every time the Europeans created a state,
ethnic groups or previously existing African polities were split by
the new borders, undermining the new states' claims to legitimacy
in the eyes of their inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging African nations' first brush with legitimacy came
with the independence movements that swept the continent in the
1950s. But in the case of Congo, as with many other countries, the
nationalism of the leader who best channeled pro-independence
sentiment, Patrice Lumumba, quickly was seen as a threat by Belgium
and by a Cold War-driven United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries worked to undermine and ultimately overthrow
Lumumba, who was subsequently assassinated under murky
circumstances. The man they helped replace him with was Mobutu Sese
Seko, the dictator who ruinously ruled over Africa's third largest
country with strong Western backing for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   For most of that period Mobutu loomed over his country and over
the continent's affairs. The West had decided that Zaire, as he
renamed his country, with its borders with nine other African
countries, was of strategic importance. Acting on behalf of his
foreign sponsors, Mobutu intervened freely in his neighbors'
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, however, Western interest in
propping up Mobutu, Western interest in Africa generally,
evaporated. It was then, through the collapse of Mobutu and the
crumbling of a dozen or more countries that the myth of the modern
African state began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   For Mobutu the end came quickly at the hands of Kabila, long an
obscure and inconsequential rebel leader who this time had the
critical backing of Rwanda and Uganda, two neighbors that decided
to pursue their own security interests in Congo aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Shorn of foreign assistance, the Mobutu government, a creation
of the West, could not pay its civil servants, equip its army or
even move its ill-disciplined troops from one part of the country
to another when war came.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congo, which owed its definition and preservation to the
outside world, is being dismembered by its neighbors while the West
averts its suddenly disinterested gaze.
</P>
<P>
   The first to feast on Central Africa's largest piece of real
estate have been Uganda and Rwanda, two of Africa's Western
favorites now.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of these two nations, which already have
carved out large spheres of interest for themselves in the
country's eastern regions, other neighbors, some less favored by
the West, aggressively are asserting their interests too.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe and Angola, Congo's southern neighbors, have rushed to
Kabila's defense, invoking the principle of territorial integrity
as they position themselves to profit from the country's immense
mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``States which are more stable and can project more economic or
military power are going to interfere more readily in the affairs
of their neighbors,'' Mutua said.
</P>
<P>
   A century after Europe created the edifice of African
nation-states, many observers of the continent's affairs say they
foresee a potentially perilous period in which the structure
progressively crumbles, with no one quite sure what to expect next.

 &HT;    Tyson's psyche still in question
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It's not so much a 10-round fight as it is the
continuation of a miniseries. As Mike Tyson prepares for his second
comeback from an unscheduled intermission in his career, he owes
the federal government $13 million in back taxes, is the plaintiff
in a $100 million lawsuit against promoter Don King, the defendent
in a $110 million lawsuit by King and will be sentenced in three
weeks for violating parole by punching two motorists on a Maryland
highway.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, as Showtime executive Jay Larkin cracked this week
when Tyson let off a string of expletives in interviews, ``At least
he's getting in print.''
</P>
<P>
   No question, Tyson continues his lifelong relationship with
headline writers. But less certain is his future in boxing. When he
meets Francois Botha tonight at the MGM Grand, it will be his first
fight since losing his license for making a Real Meal of Evander
Holyfield in June of 1997. He is 32 years old, 28 months removed
from his last win (first-round TKO over Bruce Seldon) and is
employing his third trainer in as many fights (former Holyfield
aide Tommy Brooks).
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't get in the way of beating Botha. Tyson is a 7-1
favorite. Botha may rate above Peter McNeeley on the scale of Tyson
comeback opponents, but the most notable win on his 39-1 record is
a disputed decision over German Axel Schulz for the vacant IBF
title that was stripped from George Foreman in 1995. Soon after the
fight, Botha was stripped of the belt when he tested positive for
steroids, which he had been suspected of using since ballooning
from 208 pounds to 229 between fights in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Botha weighed in at a soft 233 pounds for this fight but claims
to have logged over 100 rounds in sparring and has shown little
fear of Tyson. His trainer, Panama Lewis, believes the timing is
right to send Tyson into boxing oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson says, 'If I'm right, I can do this,''' Lewis said. ``Yes
_ if. But he's not hungry any more. He's filthy rich. I don't care
how much money they say he owes the government. If he has a
contract for this fight, he's rich. He's not going to listen to
what a trainer tells him. He tells a trainer what to do. He says he
is hungry. But (poor) condition beats ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's official purse for the fight is $10 million. He made $60
million for the two bouts against Holyfield. But Showtime also will
kick in a share of pay-per-view revenue to get Tyson to nearly $17
million, which will help him clear up most of his debts.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been questions about Tyson's confidence and box
office appeal. From a boxing standpoint, even Brooks admits he is
uncertain about his fighter's psyche after consecutive losses to
Holyfield. ``Any time you get two (butt)-kickings, you never forget
that,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   As a gate attraction, Tyson is expected to fight in a
near-half-empty 16,000-seat arena he previously has sold out.
(Promoters still project a crowd of 12,000.) The bigger test is
pay-per-view buys. If Tyson can come close to a million buys, it
will be a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson still views himself as boxing's top act, concluding:
``People hate me more than anybody else, so they want to see me in
demise. ... They think I'm either a superstar or a freak. I don't
blame them.''

 &HT;    Stopping Vikings' air show
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eugene Robinson couldn't sleep Friday, so he crawled
out of bed at about 5:15 a.m. and popped a tape in the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a horror film.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the Falcons free safety, was watching the Minnesota
Vikings passing attack, which led the NFL this season with 4,492
yards and 41 touchdowns. It's one of the reasons the Atlanta
defensive backs have been working overtime this week to prepare for
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons (15-2) are going to beat the Vikings (16-1) in
the NFC Championship Game in the Metrodome, Atlanta must slow
Minnesota's passing attack. Period.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy, but Robinson and cornerback Ray Buchanan _
two of the Falcons' five Pro Bowl players _ might have the most
daunting responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings rookie wide receiver Randy Moss caught 69 passes for
1,323 yards and 17 touchdowns, and receiver Cris Carter caught 78
passes for 1,011 yards and 12 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan will match up on whichever receiver is the more likely
deep threat on a given play.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a 14-year veteran who played in the last two Super
Bowls with the Green Bay Packers, is the quarterback of the
secondary. He changes coverages and must make sure teammates are in
the right places.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons also have to worry about other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching (Minnesota quarterback) Randall Cunningham (who
led the league with a 106.0 passer rating) make one impromptu play
after another,'' Robinson said. ``It's not planned, but next thing
you know it's seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling my guys, 'When he scrambles, if you think
you're on your man, get one step closer.' This guy will throw a
ball in any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta defensive backs almost always talk among themselves,
especially Robinson and Buchanan, who eat lunch together almost
every day at a restaurant just across I-85 from team headquarters
in Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   This week, they've been talking even more.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Atlanta began installing its base defense, which
will be used when Minnesota has two wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the season, Buchanan has been on the opposing team's
best receiver. He'll guard both Moss and Carter, lining up more on
the Falcons right than left. Second-year man Michael Booker will be
on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably going to get a piece of both of them,'' said
Buchanan, who had seven regular-season interceptions, second-most
in the NFC. ``When we're at lunch, or something, we talk about how
we can beat these guys down, or match up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday, we were working on how to handle when they send
somebody in motion or have multiple receivers on one side. I'm not
going to give away secrets, though.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Falcons secondary worked on nickel and dime
defenses for when the Vikings add receivers to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the situations when Robinson makes the most changes in
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on personnel, situations, down-and-distance, what I
see the receivers setting up to do,'' he said. ``I'll let a man
know if he's playing man-to man, zone deep third, zone short, zone
press _ who's going to follow motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I'm tapping a hand or hitting a leg or tapping a
helmet _ it's a signal to tell him to do something different than
what he might have done.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Falcons worked on passing situations inside their
20-yard-line.
</P>
<P>
   Most people consider Moss the bigger deep threat, but at 6 feet
4, he has an advantage over the 5-9 Buchanan and the 6-2 Booker.
Because of that, the Falcons will mix coverages more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vikings have just two wideouts, Buchanan will play
man-to-man defense on his receiver, and the Falcons will play zone
on the other side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   They'll try to disguise some coverages before switching.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he and his teammates will not back down from the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have respect for people, but we have faith in
ourselves and each other,'' he said. ``Cris is definitely better
off the line; he's just been in the league longer. But Randy is an
outstanding athlete, a fast, big guy who can run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there (on the field), everything you've been taught
through the season, through your career, your gift, that's when it
all comes into play. Coaches can't coach certain things that happen
out on the field. You've just got to be an athlete and don't beat
yourself (mentally).''

 &HT;    The monster that Billick built
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the second floor of the Minnesota Vikings complex
is the office of the obsessive computer nerd who has designed the
most lethal passing game in the NFL. The desk of coordinator Brian
Billick is littered with flow charts, printouts, a pile of tendency
breakdowns and a copy of the 26-page resume he presented Cleveland
president Carmen Policy before interviewing for the Browns coaching
job three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, however, the clutter comprises pass-route
diagrams.
</P>
<P>
   Billick, the hottest assistant in the league, is a doodler
extraordinaire. And if the Vikings defeat the Falcons in the NFC
Championship Game, the main reason probably will have been
Billick's stack of legal pads filled with squiggles, lines and
arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the Vikings so tough,'' former Green Bay defensive
coordinator Fritz Shurmur said, ``is that they've formulated a
great blueprint to coincide with great talent.''
</P>
<P>
   That blueprint will be used against Atlanta Sunday, and the
percentages are that it will have success against a Falcons
secondary that remains suspect, despite improvement this season.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are frightening by themselves. The Vikings topped
the league with 44 completions of 25 or more yards, led by rookie
wideout Randy Moss with 19. Minnesota ranked second in average
yards per attempt (8.43) and average yards per completion (13.7)
and surrendered the fourth-fewest sacks (25). The Vikings dropped
just 19 passes all season, third-fewest in the NFL. Their 40
touchdown passes averaged 26.9 yards in length and eight exceeded
50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Attach the faces of Moss and cohorts Cris Carter, Jake Reed and
Andrew Glover to the statistics, and it's obvious that Billick has
created a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Moss, Carter and Reed would have been a prolific
tandem. But the Vikings have in Moss a receiver who combines size
and superior hands with the rare ability to outrun the ball, no
matter how far it is thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Billick has lengthened the pass routes by a few yards, a subtle
alteration that plays to the deep-ball strength of quarterback
Randall Cunningham. Instead of running his trademark ``dig'' or
comeback pass routes at 12 yards, Carter, one of the most
technically proficient receivers in league history, now runs them
at 14.
</P>
<P>
   And because of Carter's toughness across the middle and the
ability of tight end Glover in the seams, the Vikings stretch a
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking to get the best physical matchups possible but
also to find your big weak spot and exploit it,'' Dallas defensive
coordinator Dave Campo said. Campo's defense surrendered four
touchdown passes of more than 50 yards in a Thanksgiving Day
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Because Reed has back and hamstring injuries, Minnesota reduced
the number of three-wideout sets. If the Vikings return to three
wide receivers, the Falcons will counter the same way they did
against San Francisco's, by staying in a ``base'' look with another
corner replacing strong safety William White.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons probably won't shadow Moss with Ray Buchanan but
will play Buchanan man to man against one wideout. Free safety
Eugene Robinson then can roll to Michael Booker's side and help the
second-year pro with double coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Booker has the size to hang with Moss, but even after nearly two
full seasons, Booker can't compensate for a tardy turn-and-go that
makes him a prime target for the deep pass. Carter always works
from the slot in three-wide receiver sets, and his craftiness gives
him a large advantage over any Atlanta nickel back.

 &HT;    `Rip it up' Moss totals defenses
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER PARK, Minn. _ You look at Randy Moss and you see a
stringbean with long arms and a perpetual expression of
indifference on his unshaven face. He doesn't seem to like the
media much. In fact, he seems cranky, even after another
performance that has to make the 19 teams that passed over him in
the NFL draft queasy. All Dandy Randy seems to enjoy is the sight
of the football in flight, in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he doesn't look like a stringbean at all. Randy Moss looks
like an albatross, a towering presence over a helpless defensive
back. And after he floats over the competition and hauls in a
substantial gain, all that crankiness moves aside, like plowed
snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rip it up,'' Moss said on TV last month, with ``it'' being the
NFL. That was his goal. And after a Pro Bowl season for the Vikings
rookie, it is safe to say the league has been ripped up.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than Moss going into the NFC Championship Game with 69
receptions for 1,313 yards and an NFL-best 17 touchdowns. It's how
he's done it, against whom and when: two touchdowns against Green
Bay on Monday Night Football; eight catches, 153 yards and another
score against the Packers in the rematch; scores of 51, 56 and 56
yards against Dallas on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Moss is not some illusion created by late-night highlights or
marketing creativeness. A 6-foot-4, 211-pound No. 21 draft pick
from Marshall, he did it in prime time; he's the real thing. And,
make no mistake, he's someone to be dealt with by the Falcons
Sunday in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about who wants it more and (is) hungry enough to get
there,'' Moss said. ``I'm sort of flattered by the whole situation,
and we have to take advantage of it. As a whole team, we can raise
our level. We hopefully have two games left, and (people) can see
how explosive we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss insists he is not excited about making the clubs that
shunned him regret it and says he holds no animosity toward a media
that dwelled on his off-field troubles in college. But when asked
how he's been dealt with by the same media during this
record-breaking season, he said: ``I think before the draft, they
talked about me negatively and now that I am up here, they want to
(change).''
</P>
<P>
   That statement clearly indicates Moss relishes the fact that
he's disproved the critics. It's almost as evident that the events
of the past have soured Moss, made him ambivalent about dealing
with the media. But people do not get to see the true Randy Moss,
his teammates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a normal 21-year-old kid,'' said Pro Bowl receiver
Cris Carter, who's been Moss' mentor. ``Loud, funny, quick-witted.
He says some things and you wonder, 'Did he say that?' It's not
like I'm always 'The Mentor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but no doubt Carter's guile has been one of the
reasons Moss has, indeed, ripped it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cris has been a mentor,'' tight end Andrew Glover said. ``He's
shown Randy how to be a true professional. And he's done it by
example. He didn't have to tell him everything. He's shown him by
the way he handles himself, takes care of his body, the
professional attitude. And by the results, you can tell it's paid
off.

SENATORS ARE MORE THAN JURORS, REHNQUIST RULES 
</HEADLINE>

 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, interrupted Rep. Bob
Barr's monologue on the Senate floor Friday with an objection about
his repeated use of the word ``jurors,'' he was expressing more
than just a simple annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   In a calculated fashion, Harkin was underscoring a fundamental
Democratic argument: Senators are not there simply to digest the
facts of the case, but also to consider the national interest. The
more appropriate word to describe the 100 senators is ``judges,''
Harkin said. And judges make all sorts of decisions, some of them
touching on witnesses, for example, or on the public good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular jurors are not supposed to know each other,'' Harkin
said on the floor. ``Not so here. Regular jurors do not decide what
evidence should be heard or the standards of evidence, nor do they
decide on witnesses or what witnesses shall be called. Not so here.
Regular jurors do not decide when a trial is to be ended. Not so
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, ruling on the trial's first
objection, sustained the point, saying, ``The chair is of the view
that the senator from Iowa's objection is well taken, that the
Senate is not simply a jury. It is a court in this case. And
therefore counsel should refrain from referring to senators as
jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Harkin said the ruling ``undermined their case for
witnesses because we are not jurors. We are judges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How does this affect the nation?'' he asked. ``As Alexander
Hamilton said _ we are judges, and judges can take into account a
lot of things other than the facts and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt exchange, the first to shatter the senators' silence,
came toward the end of a long day, when Barr, who wanted to impeach
Clinton even before the Lewinsky scandal hit the newspapers,
referred repeatedly to the senators as ``jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``upset'' Harkin, he said, and he rose to object,
citing the Constitution and the Federalist Papers. It was not a
spur of the moment, objection. He had contemplated doing this very
thing at some point in the trial and had even prepared by
researching Rehnquist's views on the matter. ``I had every reason
to believe he would rule favorably upon that objection,'' Harkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repeated use of that word by Barr brought it home to me
that the House managers meant to leave that impression with us and
with the public, that that solely is the role,'' Harkin said. ``I
felt at that point that I had to object.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Barr, R-Ga., switched to calling the senators
``triers of fact and law,'' and said later that he felt right at
home, as a former prosecutor, hearing a cry of ``objection.''

PARTISAN SPLIT ON WITNESS ISSUE HARDENS IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ky., Alaska, Utah, Ore., Mass., Iowa, Ga.)  (See also IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-STRATEGY, IMPEACH-CLINTON,

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No matter how much senators say they want to avoid
it, the partisan split over witnesses appears to be hardening each
day that the House managers present their case against President
Clinton, with a near party-line vote in favor of taking more
testimony looking ever more likely.
</P>
<P>
   In their appearances before the Senate, the House managers have
refined their wish list of witnesses to a kind of prosecutorial
mantra, constantly repeating the names of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon
Jordan Jr. and the White House aides Betty Currie, John Podesta and
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., even finished his appearance before
the Senate Friday with a call for the ultimate witness. ``Invite
the president to come,'' he said, ``and judge everybody's
credibility for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Senate Republicans themselves had been divided over
the issue, with some powerful figures fearful of sullying the
dignity of the Senate with tawdry testimony. But three prominent
Republican senators who had been wary of calling the principals in
the case against the president _ Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Ted
Stevens of Alaska and Robert Bennett of Utah _ now say they are
inclined to support at least depositions, which would come before
any in-person testimony to all 100 senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved from being one of the most skeptical in the
conference, to leaning in that direction,'' McConnell said Friday,
speaking of deposing witnesses. He said the House prosecutors'
ability to skate around the questions of sex in their opening-day
presentations had calmed his fears of a sordid spectacle in the
well of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said, ``I think a convincing case has been made on
behalf of the House that we cannot have a full and complete trial
unless witnesses come.''
</P>
<P>
   While a few Democrats, like Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and Ron
Wyden of Oregon, said they had not made up their minds on
witnesses, most Democrats, if anything, seemed even more set
against them than before.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who had helped to write a
bipartisan agreement on trial procedures last week that pulled the
Senate back from partisan confrontation, on Friday dismissed the
need for witnesses. ``I don't think at the start of this yesterday
there were five senators who understood that Monica Lewinsky had
had 22 individual meetings where she responded to questions under
oath,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the witness question ``may be very well'' decided on a
party-line vote. He said sentiment against witnesses was growing
among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And when Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, startled the Senate Friday by
rising and objecting to repeated references by Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., to senators as ``jurors,'' Democrats said he was emphasizing
the right of senators to deviate from normal trial procedures, like
calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that as a senator sitting on a trial on impeachment,
we can take into account not just the facts and the law but the
public good,'' Harkin said after the Senate recessed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early in the proceedings and the president's lawyers
have not yet had the chance to make their case. That means
sentiment could shift once again next week when the White House
presents its defense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it is also the case that under the bipartisan Senate
agreement struck last week, the question of whether to depose
witnesses can be decided by a simple majority of 51 votes, which
means that the 55 Republicans could decide the issue if they stay
unified.
</P>
<P>
   If the partisan division is in some ways a display of simple
party loyalty, it also reflects a fundamental difference in how the
two parties are approaching the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   For many Republicans the question is whether the evidence is
hard enough to support the House's charges that Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice in his efforts to cover up his
extramarital relationship with a White House intern. ``It's not too
much to ask that your highest elected officials lead felony-free
lives'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith noted that in contrast to his view that the charges
warrant conviction if proved, many Democrats believe that even if
the charges are true they do not rise to the level that the
Constitution sets for a president's removal from office. That makes
it less important for Democrats to hear witnesses and clarify
questions of fact. ``So we're partly like trains passing each other
in the night,'' Smith said of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kennedy said Friday that the senators should be
considering first whether the facts ``rise to the standard of an
impeachable offense as outlined by the Founding Fathers.'' He said
he had agreed with historians who had told the House that they did
not.

COURT RULES HINCKLEY CAN MAKE SUPERVISED DAY TRIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Hinckley , who wounded President Ronald Reagan
and three other men in 1981, can make supervised day trips from the
mental hospital where he has been confined for 17 years, a federal
appeals court ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 ruling by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia was applauded by Hinckley's lawyer, Barry
Levine. ``This is the system working,'' Levine said. ``He's not a
prisoner; he's a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said that his client had made tremendous progress at St.
Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, and that he was no longer a
danger to society. The lawyer noted that Hinckley's trips were to
be supervised, of limited duration and in the company of relatives
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma A. Lewis, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia,
said she had not decided whether to appeal, adding, ``The public
should understand that today's court decision does not allow
Hinckley to come and go when he pleases.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley, 43, has been at St. Elizabeths since 1982, when he was
acquitted by reason of insanity of the March 30, 1981, shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling hinged on a narrow technical question: whether
the proposed visits should be classified as ``conditional
releases'' requiring court approval beforehand, or supervised
passes that the hospital may grant without court approval.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, doctors said Hinckley could have a dinner with
friends and relatives at a private home. The U.S. attorney's office
moved to block that outing, calling it a ``conditional release,''
and a lower court agreed.

USOC TAKES MORE DETAILED LOOK AT BID  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 8:30 last Sunday night in Colorado Springs, the phone rang
at the home of Dick Schultz, the executive director of the U.S.
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On the line was Alfredo La Mont, the USOC's director of
international relations. He wanted to drop by.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a problem,'' Schultz recalled La Mont saying.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bribery scandal in Salt Lake City erupted in
mid-December, Schultz had ordered an internal review of USOC
behavior during the pursuit of the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want any surprises,'' Schultz said. ``I wanted to get
everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   La Mont, 49, was interviewed by a lawyer on Monday and
acknowledged that while he was a USOC official, he had also been
engaged in a business relationship with the Salt Lake City bid
committee through its president, Tom Welch, according to the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, investigators described the
work y/Thursday as a kind of intelligence operation to learn about
the attitude toward Salt Lake City's bid of Olympic officials in
Central and South America. While the work was apparently done from
La Mont's home, ``It was clear it was a violation of our ethics
standards and was a conflict of interest,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   La Mont was first placed on administrative leave, and then
Thursday, he resigned, becoming the first USOC official drawn into
the Salt Lake City scandal. Information about his activities was
forwarded to investigations being conducted by a USOC ethics panel
and by the United States Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Schultz said it did not appear at this
point that La Mont had attempted to buy votes of members of the
International Olympic Committee or that USOC funds were involved.
But the fact that a USOC official was having simultaneous business
dealings with the Salt Lake City bid committee was embarrassing,
Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   La Mont's resignation added yet another piece to the puzzle of
Salt Lake City's acknowledged attempt to secure the Winter Games by
focusing on swing votes from Africa and Latin America and by
providing cash payments, tuition aid and lavish gifts.
</P>
<P>
   A person who identified himself at La Mont's home as his son
said that his father was not speaking to reporters. Calls to Welch
seeking comment were not returned. Schultz said he could not
provide details of La Mont's relationship with Salt Lake City
because the matter had been turned over to two investigative
panels.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the
intelligence-gathering operation, stressing that records were
scarce and that many details remained sketchy and unverifiable at
this point. It is not clear when the business arrangement began or
ended, investigators said, adding that it may have lasted from
three to 18 months. Investigators also said it was not yet known
whether the deal began in 1989 when Salt Lake City was bidding on
the 1998 Winter Games, or whether the deal began after 1991, when
the city began seeking the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investigators, La Mont said that the Salt Lake
City bid committee had a contract with a company in Mexico to
gather information on the attitudes, ``positive and negative,'' of
Olympic officials in Central and South America toward Salt Lake's
efforts to secure the Winter Games. Bid cities often compile
dossiers regarding such things as personal preferences, family
members and even clothing sizes of Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   La Mont said that the owner of the company _ described by one
investigator as a printing company _ was a friend of his and that
he had been a conduit between the friend and the Salt Lake City bid
committee, according to investigators. Salt Lake City wanted a
middleman because officials were afraid that cash or checks sent
through the mail to Mexico might be stolen, investigators said they
were told.
</P>
<P>
   La Mont said he was paid about $2,000 a month by check, which he
cashed and distributed to his friend as payment for information on
Olympic officials, investigators said. The investigators said they
had not been able to verify whether La Mont distributed all the
money he received or whether he had kept any or all of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in French and Spanish, La Mont came to the USOC in 1984
after serving as protocol officer at the Summer Olympics in Los
Angeles. He handled much of the USOC's communications with Olympic
committees from other countries, aided American sports federations
in seeking international competitions and helped administer a joint
program with the IOC in which athletes from developing nations
trained in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   La Mont was born in Mexico City, studied business administration
and attended law school there and worked as a Mexican Olympic
Committee administrator. He was an associate of Mario Vasquez Rana,
a powerful IOC member from Mexico and, according to his resume, La
Mont has founded companies that import wine and surgical equipment
to Mexico and export medical and electronic equipment to Central
and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying IOC members, trying to persuade them to vote for Salt
Lake City, was part of La Mont's legitimate duties as the USOC's
director of international relations. He stepped over the line, the
USOC said, when he also went into business with Salt Lake's bid
committee.

entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Jan. 17,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   THIN-RED-LINE-FILM (Undated) _ The Thin Red Line'' is a very odd
movie. I think it one of the pinnacles of American filmmaking in
the 1990s, but I can also appreciate the objections leveled against
it by other film critics who were baffled, irritated or chagrined
by this three-hour challenge. By Phillip Lopate.(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   1,000-MOONS-INTERNET (Undated) _ ``1,000 Moons,'' is a
five-minute digital short designed for the Internet and one of four
movies now being screened at a site called The Bit Screen
(www.TheBitScreen.com). It's hazardous to make statements about who
is or isn't doing what on the Web, but it would appear that the
site is, if not unique, then most unusual. The movies aren't
intended for showing on the theater screen or on video. Films like
``1,000 Moons'' are conceived and created to arrive by modem and be
shown solely on a computer screen. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   EIFMAN-BALLET (Undated) _ At supper in his studio in St.
Petersburg or at lunch in a New York restaurant, Boris Eifman, 52,
is all good-humored gallantry. It isn't until the Russian
choreographer reveals his life story that one understands how a
surface calm harbors the emotional intensity that blazes through
his ballets. Not every choreographer has been housed in an
underground pit during a harsh early childhood in Siberia or had
all his father's relatives killed by the Germans during World War
II. Nor have most choreographers, at least in the West, had to
invent themselves within the closed society of the Soviet era. And
rare is the choreographer who, like Eifman, has never been a
professional dancer. Yet a passion for creating dances has consumed
Eifman since he was 13 and passionate dancing is synonymous with
the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg, which opens a two-week season
Tuesday night at City Center. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-LANE-THEATER (Undated) _ Producers are not going to tell
you what they really think of George P. Lane: that they dislike
him, that they believe he is too demanding, that they dread his
phone calls. That is because Lane represents just about every hot
young playwright and director in the theater business these days,
not to mention a crop of blue-chip actors. So producers need him.
They basically can't live without him. By Robin Pogrebin. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby's reviews `Far East';
`Phedre' and `Britannicus.' (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   RICHTER-MUSIC (Undated) _ In 1957 the Russian pianist Sviatoslav
Richter made friends with the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould at a
concert in Moscow. And now Bruno Monsaingeon, a Canadian film
director who collaborated on projects with Gould, has issued a
documentary, ``Richter: The Enigma,'' which will open the Lincoln
Center series ``Great Pianists of the 20th Century'' on Friday
evening at the Walter Reade Theater in Manhattan. By John Russell.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ARRON-CARNEGIE-HALL (New York) _ Give a determined evolution a
little time, and it can look like a revolution. ``She completely
transformed the institution,'' the once revolutionary composer and
conductor Pierre Boulez said last week of Judith Arron, who was no
one's idea of a revolutionary, and her achievement at Carnegie
Hall. She became executive director in 1988 and played a central
role in planning for the hall's extensive centenary celebration in
1991. Now a dream of her own has come to fruition with the recent
announcement of plans for a small but versatile third performance
stage in the historic Carnegie building, replacing a movie theater
under the main auditorium. But Ms. Arron died last month, at 56,
after a long battle with cancer, and the announcement brought added
news: although the new hall will be named for Arthur and Judy
Zankel, its prime donors, the performance space itself will be
called the Judith Arron Auditorium. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   DUKE-ELLINGTON-MUSIC (Undated) _ Most musicians making their
Carnegie Hall debut don't open with ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
But this was no ordinary debut. On Jan. 23, 1943, Duke Ellington
and his orchestra played to a capacity crowd in a benefit concert
for the Russian War Relief fund. Ellington was riding high. At 43
he was one of the leading exponents of swing, the exuberant style
of jazz then reaching the crest of its popularity. His music was
known throughout the world. Thousands bought his recordings,
listened to his radio broadcasts, danced to his rhythms and
romanced to his songs. That evening at Carnegie Hall, though,
Ellington chose to play more than ``Mood Indigo,'' ``Don't Get
Around Much Anymore'' and the hits his fans expected. He also made
it clear that he expected serious recognition as a composer. By
Mark Tucker. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DUKE-ELLINGTON (Undated) _ What a world to step into, if you
were inquisitive. And at the beginning of the 1920s, Duke
Ellington, touched by genius and ambition, prepared by education
and class privilege, walked into the 20th century. When he arrived
in New York in 1923, it was the present and future cultural capital
of the world. He began playing in what were known as black and
tans, joints that catered to black and white audiences, and in
1927, just a year after his first wobbly recordings under his own
name, he fell into the job that changed American cultural history.
By Peter Watrous. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ELLINGTON-RECORDINGS (Undated) _ In April, RCA will issue ``The
Duke Ellington Centennial Edition: The Complete RCA Victor
Recordings 1924-1973,'' a 24-CD set, and for the rest of the year
the label will slowly issue the music from that set in triple-CD
bunches. By June, Columbia will have reintroduced spruced-up
versions of six albums, including the film-score album ``Anatomy of
a Murder'' and the Shakespeare-inspired ``Such Sweet Thunder,'' as
well as a three-CD overview. By Ben Ratliff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   MARISSIAUX-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ One of the rare discovery in
photography festivals this year was a Belgin pictorialist named
Gustave Marissiaux, who was widely show in Belgian, Paris, Berlin
and Itlay in the first decade or so of this century, then large
forgotten even in his own country until a 1997 retrospective at the
Musee de la Photographie in Charleroi. A show during the Mois at
the Wallonie-Bruxelles Center in Paris closed on Nov. 26, but a
beautifully illustrated and well-researched catalogue, ``Gustave
Marissiaux: La Possibilite de l'Art,'' by Marc-Emmanuel Melon, has
been published by the Charleroi museum. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   SAYS-YOU-RADIO (Undated) _ ``Says You!'' _ a low-budget,
independently produced half-hour quiz show reminiscent of the
old-time radio series ``Information Please'' and the long-running
BBC series ``My Word'' _ seems to have a good chance to join the
quirky listener-supported National Public Radio pantheon that
includes ``Car Talk,'' ``This American Life'' and ``A Prairie Home
Companion.'' Recorded over Sunday brunch in various Boston-area
hotel banquet rooms, ``Says You!'' is now broadcast on more than 60
public radio stations nationwide. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-THIS-LIFE (London) _ ``This Life,'' a television drama made
an inauspicious debut three years ago in Britain but went on to
become one of the most talked-about, and passionately watched,
shows in years. The series, which ended abruptly after two seasons
when the producers (but not the audience) decided that it had run
its course, has until recently been absent from American
television, its heavy use of nudity, racy language and sex having
all but assured that no network would go near it. But BBC America,
a station devoted to BBC programming that appears on TCI digital
cable and on two separate satellite systems, has brought ``This
Life'' across the ocean, leaving in the sex and some of the nudity
but excising the rudest four-letter words. The first 11 episodes,
from the first season, went on the air beginning in November; the
11th will be broadcast on Saturday at the beginning of a night
devoted entirely to ``This Life.'' By Sarah Lyall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   RORSTRAND-PORCELAIN-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The New York
entrepreneur, Robert Schreiber, collection of 150 Art Nouveau
Rorstrand vases, bowls and jardinieres is described by experts as
the largest and most important anywhere. A selection of 86 pieces
is now on view in ``Rorstrand: Swedish Art Nouveau Porcelain From
the Schreiber Collection,'' an exhibition at the American Craft
Museum in Manhattan, through May 23. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

PROSECUTION TEAM PUSHES FOR LEWINSKY TO TESTIFY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors urged the Senate on Friday to
allow ``face-to-face'' testimony from Monica Lewinsky in the
impeachment trial of President Clinton, as they resumed their
argument that he should be removed from office for covering up his
affair with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing their case on the second day of the historic
proceeding, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., focused on what he
described as a well-choreographed ``scheme'' by the president ``to
lie and obstruct justice'' in an attempt to keep his affair with
Lewinsky from becoming evidence in a sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Citing grand jury testimony from Lewinsky, McCollum said there
was no doubt that Clinton lied about the relationship and created a
series of ``falsehoods'' to hide it. He contended that Clinton
knowingly influenced and manipulated the testimony of his aides and
friends so they would tell a cover story when they were called
before a federal grand jury investigating the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record is so clear on this that if you have any
significant doubt about Monica Lewinsky's credibility ... you
should have us bring her in here and examine her face to face and
judge her credibility yourself,'' McCollum told the 100 senators.
</P>
<P>
   He urged them to ``invite the president to come'' to the Senate
chamber as well, so his credibility could be measured against
Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, the senators, who have been described as ``jurors''
in only the second presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history,
listened quietly from their seats.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day's arguments neared an end, Iowa Democrat Tom
Harkin became the first senator to break the silence.
</P>
<P>
   He rose to state his objection to prosecutors referring to
senators as ``jurors.'' Harkin argued that the senators were
serving as judge and jury and would decide the case not only on
facts and the law, but a variety of other considerations, including
possibly the will of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution, Harkin said, meant for the
Senate to be ``expansive,'' in deliberating the impeachment of a
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are charged not just with facts and law but also what's in
the public good, and what's the general welfare of the people of
this country in deciding on impeachment cases,'' Harkin told
reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   The objection drew a complaint from Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who
insisted that Harkin had no right to interrupt unless he was making
a motion of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist, who is
presiding in the Senate, seemed uncertain about what his response
should be. But he quickly recovered, noting that Harkin's objection
was ``well taken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is not simply a jury, but a court,'' he said,
agreeing that the senators' role in the impeachment trial is
unique. He ordered prosecutors to refrain from referring to them as
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's objection came near the end of a presentation by Rep.
Bob Barr, R-Ga., who was arguing that the charges against Clinton
do rise to impeachable offenses and meet the Constitutional
requirement of high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Barr heeded the Rehnquist order and continued with his remarks,
this time referring to the senators as ``triers of fact'' instead
of jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The interruption may have been insignificant, but it injected a
note of partisan rancor into the previously circumspect trial.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of those divisions may become clear late next week
when senators are likely to rule on motions to allow witnesses to
testify. Most of the 55 Republicans are expected to support the
motions, while most of the 45 Democrats have indicated they will
oppose them.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate put off a decision last week on witnesses until after
the House prosecution team, made up of 13 Republicans, and
Clinton's seven-member White House legal team have completed their
presentations. But a growing number of Republicans have indicated
in recent days more willingness to hear from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A simple majority of 51 senators would be needed to approve a
motion to allow witnesses. With the Democrats in the minority, it
seems likely that some of the key players in the scandal could be
called to the Senate floor to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, won't be one of them, his spokesman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart called the desire by
House prosecutors to question Clinton and other witnesses
``obsessive'' because it represents ``a fundamental weakness in
their case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe their case is strong enough so they are
trying to expand it and open up new areas,'' Lockhart told
reporters aboard Air Force One during a trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also warned that if witnesses are called, the trial
could be delayed indefinitely because of deposition and discovery
motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in this country believes the time to bring
this effort to a close is soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats also indicated Friday that they will oppose any
attempt to bring Clinton before the Senate. ``I think it's a
non-issue,'' said Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who has
noted that Clinton cannot be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved two articles of impeachment against the
president last month charging him with perjury and obstruction of
justice. But it will be up to senators to determine whether the
charges require his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote is necessary for conviction. If 67 senators
agree, the 42nd president would become the first to be removed from
office by impeachment proceedings. The only other president ever
impeached _ Andrew Johnson in 1868 _ was acquitted by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of Friday's argument in the Senate was taken up with
technical explanations of the statutes the House believes Clinton
violated. After detailed recitations about which acts violated
which laws, Barr closed the presentation by contending the
president's conduct met the constitutional ground for removal _
``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as members of both houses of Congress have been convicted
and removed from office for perjury and obstruction, and just as
federal judges have been removed ... so, sadly, should this
president,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that if Clinton is not held accountable, ``a gaping
wound'' will be left in the nation's legal system that will
``poison'' future generations.``
</P>
<P>
   The president has not been watching the Senate proceeding. But
aides aid he has been getting briefings his attorneys. In an
appearance on Wall Street on Friday, Clinton was welcomed with some
high praise that he said reminded him of ``the sort of thing people
say for your funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're there yet,'' he added, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors are scheduled to wrap up their presentation
when the trial resumes at 10 a.m. EST Saturday . Clinton's lawyers
will begin to present their defense at 1 p.m. EST Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week, the U.S. stock market looked a lot like
the weather in New England, as described famously by Mark Twain:
exceedingly changeable.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when it was clear that Brazil was going to devalue
its currency, U.S. stocks shrugged; the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 0.4 percent. The next day, investors decided that the
devaluation had grave consequences for American companies, and the
S&AMP;P fell almost 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when the currency was allowed to float completely _
the thing investors had feared most _ stocks cheered, with the S&AMP;P
rising 31.07 points.
</P>
<P>
   An up-and-down stock market is nothing new, of course. But the
extremes in mood seem to be rising. And the gyrations last week
were especially puzzling because investors had been aware of
potential problems in Brazil since August.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Kerschner, chief strategist at Paine Webber, said the
week's wild ride was to be expected, given the market's 34 percent
gain since October. ``When you have a fully valued market, by
definition it is vulnerable to sentiment swings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But another, intriguing explanation was offered by Baruch Lev, a
professor of accounting at the Stern School of Business at New York
University. Lev thinks that volatility has risen because investors
are increasingly uninformed about their holdings, thanks largely to
huge writeoffs and other accounting practices that muddy financial
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know less about the fundamentals of the company you
own, then every piece of external information _ Brazil or Russia _
has a huge effect,'' he said. ``If you know a lot, you can really
assess that all these shocks from the outside are not really that
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lev has data to back up his view. In a study published last
year, Lev and a colleague, Paul Zarowin, studied key financial
figures _ earnings, cash flows and book values _ at 5,000 companies
and analyzed the data's association with changes in those
companies' stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The academics found that over the last 20 years, the correlation
has fallen markedly. ``This was a controlled experiment,'' Lev
said. ``We looked at the role that earnings played in investors'
decisions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and you see this role
is decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors still punish companies for missing analysts'
estimates. Eastman Kodak shares fell 10.4 percent on Thursday, for
example, on disappointing fourth-quarter results. But Lev reckons
that investors assign about half the relevance to earnings that
they did 20 years ago. Now, when they make their decisions,
investors rely instead on information that is less quantitative and
even less reliable.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon helps explain how the most ephemeral piece of
news _ that a company plans to hawk its wares on the World Wide
Web, for instance _ results in an immediate pop in the stock. But
the trend also means that external events that may have no bearing
on the affected companies will continue to rock equities.
</P>
<P>
   Even investors who do their homework and analyze financial data
will not be spared volatility in their stocks. But at least they
will have an idea of what they own. Meantime, ladies and gents,
buckle up.

RUSSIA PROPOSES NEW SYSTEM FOR MONITORING IRAQI ARMS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Russia, which is opposing any revival of the
present arms inspection system in Iraq, Friday gave the Security
Council a detailed blueprint for a new monitoring apparatus having
much less independence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative here quickly rejected the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth proposal this week as nations lay out their
positions and try to influence others. The bargaining could turn
into a long debate if the Security Council is to reach a common
position.
</P>
<P>
   Plans from France and now Russia outlining new inspection
systems start from premise that the oil embargo imposed after
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 would end. On Thursday
Canada also presented a plan that it hoped would bridge gaps
between the positions.
</P>
<P>
   The hastily assembled American plan would keep the current
inspection system, but would allow the unlimited sales of Iraqi
oil, provided that the revenues went solely to buy civilian goods
to alleviate the strains of eight years of sanctions. The Clinton
administration said it would look favorably on requests by Baghdad
to buy more spare parts to upgrade its dilapidated oil industry.
With world oil prices low, Iraq has not been meeting even its
current ceilings on production and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Iraq rejected the American proposals, which members of
Congress say were made hurriedly and without consultation with
legislators. In Baghdad, the commerce minister, Mohammed Mehdi
Saleh, said Iraq would accept ``nothing less than a total lifting
of the embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Official Iraqi newspapers repeated the government's call for an
end to the no-flight zones that the United States, Britain and
France have imposed over large areas of northern and southern Iraq.
Furthermore, Iraqi leaders continued their denunciations of Arab
leaders critical of President Hussein and renewed vague threats
against Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi threat to rescind its recognition of the territorial
integrity of Kuwait, repeated most recently by Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, is being taken seriously by the United States,
which hears warnings similar to those that preceded Iraq's 1990
invasion. ``This is a very provocative thing for the Iraqis to have
said,'' Peter Burleigh, the American representative on the Council,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. response to the Russian proposal was negative on
several counts. American diplomats say any arms control system in
Iraq cannot afford to be politicized in the U.N. bureaucracy and
must remain technically competent and maintain freedom of action
within Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The representative of France, Alain Dejammet, said Friday that
the reality of the situation was that the present U.N. Special
Commission for disarming Iraq was never going to go back, and that
while the Security Council was paralyzed over the issue, nothing
was being done to monitor Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the Russian proposal is the creation of a
monitoring center ``within the framework of the U.N. Secretariat.''
Since 1991, inspections of Iraq's reputed biological, chemical and
missile programs have been carried out by the Special Commission, a
body of independent experts set up by the Security Council and
answerable to its member nations. Only the Iraqi nuclear program
has been monitored by an established U.N. body, the International
Atomic Energy Agency, in cooperation with the commission, known as
Unscom.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's plan begins with the sending of a assessment mission
made up of representatives of the 15 members of the Security
Council and international technical experts. Its task would be to
work out with Iraq how to resume cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Unscom would have no standing with the new team, except to
provide some ``purely technical support'' through individual
experts taking part as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian plan, all past weapons files would be closed,
allowing the oil embargo to be ended and a long-term monitoring
system to be installed or activated.
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring center would be established in Baghdad, supplanting
the Unscom base there. It would house an export-import control
group, which would watch for Iraqi efforts to import ``dual use''
equipment that may look civilian but could find its way into arms
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats doubt that the United States will be able to hold back
a tide in the Security Council against the existing systems set up
to curb Saddam. The United States can veto any proposed resolutions
indefinitely, but would prefer not to.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats are still talking about rebuilding the
fragile Council unity against Iraq that was shattered by allied air
strikes in December. The United States could be in the embarrassing
position of seeing its military action, however successful on the
ground, lead to a diplomatic victory by Iraq.

BRONCOS DEFENDERS ACKNOWLEDGE JETS PRESENT PROBLEMS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ For Tyrone Braxton, it's Wayne Chrebet
drifting behind the linebackers and staking out the middle of the
field. For Ray Crockett, it's about matching his swift moves and
finesse against Keyshawn Johnson's towering strength. For Neil
Smith, the key is burying Curtis Martin before he pops through the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos' defenders are articulate about the threats
they face against the Jets in Sunday's American Football Conference
championship game. But they are more defensive about their unit,
which for much of the season did not play like the defending Super
Bowl champion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers say that the Broncos finished with the National
Football League's 11th-rated defense and that they were the
league's third-best run stoppers. But they did allow the
second-most yards through the air, 228 a game, and finished 26th in
the league against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, meanwhile, will bring the NFL's fourth-most-potent
offense to Denver, and a tricked-up passing scheme that allowed
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, Chrebet, Johnson and others to go
airborne for 239 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Broncos worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only statistic I look at is 15-2,'' Crockett, the left
cornerback, said, pointing to his team's record. ``When you've won
games, 38-16, and 30-7, you're going to give up more passing yards.
You can give up more and still control what their offense does. We
can't get hung up on those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos did indeed win nine of their games by double-digit
margins and saw a variety of two-minute offenses and desperation
passing attacks in the later stages of most games. But there are
other numbers that illustrate how the Denver defense struggled
throughout the year. Last season, the Broncos were the top defense
in third-down efficiency. This season, they were 21st.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously haven't played consistently or as well as our
offense,'' said defensive tackle Mike Lodish, who is trying to get
to a record sixth Super Bowl after playing in four with the Buffalo
Bills and last year with Denver. ``Last year, we had a late-season
surge that carried us. I think people are catching up to us and
learning how to attack. But there's no doubt here that we can, and
will, step up and play at the level we're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the Broncos held the Dolphins to 14 rushing yards
on 13 carries and forced two interceptions, and Smith returned a
fumble 79 yards for a touchdown. Most impressive was that Miami was
able to convert on only 2 of 10 third-down attempts in Denver's
38-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronco defenders acknowledge that the Jets pose a variety of
problems. On Wednesday, strong safety Braxton became one of the few
in the league to accord Chrebet the kind of respect he has craved.
He compared Chrebet to Steve Largent, the former Seattle Seahawks
Braxton called ``one of the greatest receivers of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts pressure on the defense, he gets behind the
linebackers and then he's terrific after the catch,'' Braxton said
of Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   And Crockett, who is 5 feet 10 inches, explained the chess game
he intended to play with the 6-3 Johnson so he would not be
outmuscled by the Jets' receiver. He also conceded it would be a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be smarter; you can't go after him all the time
because he'll out-body you,'' Crockett said. ``He's really taken
his mental game up another level. When he first came in the league,
he was so unsure of himself. He'd be running his routes while he
was looking at coverages. Now you can tell that he knows what he
sees at the line of scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith said he believes the Broncos' defensive line can
give the secondary an easier go of it by bottling up Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is tough,'' Smith, a defensive end, said of the Jets'
running back. ``He sets off their play action. We need to minimize
him because he can really open up the game.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Broncos expect to be confused by the Jets assistant
coach Dan Henning's complicated and potentially explosive schemes.
Lodish said that Greg Robinson, the Broncos' defensive coordinator
who held the same post for the Jets in 1994, has installed wrinkles
to attack the empty sets, two tight ends and whatever else the Jets
bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt they are a very good team,'' Lodish said. ``But so
are we. We've been in these games before, and we know what we're
doing. The numbers don't always show that.'' &QL;

HOUSE PROSECUTORS PAINT CLINTON AS LIAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors asserted Friday that Monica
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony was far more credible than
President Clinton's, and one of them told senators sitting in
judgment in the impeachment trial that ``it's the president who is
not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot
believe the president or accept the argument of his lawyers,'' said
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., opening the second of three days of
arguments by House managers. The Senate must decide which to
believe, he said, adding: ``If you have any significant doubt about
Monica Lewinsky's credibility or testimony, you should have us
bring her in here and let us examine her face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   As it had on Thursday, the question of calling witnesses, with
most Republicans in favor and most Democrats opposed, wound its way
through the day's proceedings. The issue will not be decided until
the week after next, but several Republican senators who said they
had doubted the wisdom of witnesses said they were changing their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, the main speaker Friday, delved into sexually explicit
material to support his contentions, something no one had done
previously during the trial. He cited sworn testimony by Clinton to
the effect that he had never kissed or fondled her breasts or
touched her genitalia, and sworn testimony by Ms. Lewinsky that he
had done so repeatedly, as well as corroboration by friends who
said she told them at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Ms. Lewinsky, the lawyer Vernon Jordan and others,
McCollum said: ``Time and again, the president says one thing and
they say something entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida lawmaker's approach dramatized one of the dilemmas
that Republicans face. Some of their strongest evidence in support
of the perjury article involves precisely the sort of material that
caused much of the public to sour on the presentation of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the proceedings of the House
Judiciary Committee. Without going into it, and questioning
witnesses whose testimony conflicts, their case is weakened; going
into it with live witnesses runs the risk of alienating voters
further with a spectacle reminiscent of the Clarence Thomas
confirmation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who filed the first impeachment resolution
in the House in November 1998, concluded for the Republicans with
typically vivid language that produced a chilling moment of
television. As he urged the Senate to ``strike down these insidious
cancers that eat at the heart of our system of government,'' CNN
showed Clinton, returning from a trip to New York, stepping from
his helicopter and calling to his dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Barr also prompted the first brief clash of the trial. Several
times, he referred to the senators as ``jurors,'' which prompted
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to rise to his feet and insist that the
Senate was sitting as a court, not as a jury. Until then, the
senators had sat mute, except for Majority Leader Trent Lott, who
spoke exclusively about housekeeping details. Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist, issuing his first ruling from the chair, said that
Harkin's ``objection is well taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly petty intervention had a large political point,
Democratic senators said. Harkin, who has backed Clinton as
fiercely as Barr has attacked him, told colleagues he was worried
that the word ``jurors'' would lead the public to conclude that the
Senate's job was merely to find Clinton guilty or not guilty,
whereas in his view they also needed to decide whether the
president's crimes, in any, constituted impeachable offenses, and
whether removing Clinton from office would serve the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, a mild-looking man who wears aviator glasses, is known
in the House as a detail man of unflagging persistence. Those
qualities were on display Friday as he extensively examined Ms.
Lewinsky's Aug. 6, 1998, grand jury testimony, now one of the most
familiar items in the case. It was then that she said, as the White
House never tires of pointing out, ``No one asked or encouraged me
to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   She was testifying about a late-night telephone conversation
with Clinton on Dec. 17, 1997. McCollum made two points: One, that
the entire sentence at issue was, ``No one asked or encouraged me
to lie, but no one discouraged me, either.'' Two, that Ms. Lewinsky
later said, ``I knew what he meant.'' Pressed, she added that she
knew that as ``we had on every other occasion and every other
instance of this relationship, we would deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum then asked: ``Can there be any doubt that the president
was suggesting that she file an affidavit that contains lies and
falsehoods?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Republicans presented ended with rhetorical
questions like that. Much else involved phrases like ``not
plausible,'' ``not reasonable,'' ``logical common sense says no,''
``you may infer,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a former CIA analyst and former prosecutor, was at pains
to insist, perhaps because of this, that circumstantial evidence
was not to be denigrated, no matter what commentators or the
president's lawyers might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a principle of long and consistent standing in every
federal court in our land, and I suspect in every state court in
our land,'' he said, ``that circumstantial evidence is not to be
and shall not be afforded any less weight than direct evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That question of the weight of the evidence also preoccupied
McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that not all the many details of the case meshed, he
admonished the senators: ``Never lose sight of the totality of this
scheme to lie and obstruct justice. Never lose sight of the big
picture. Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a whole, he insisted, ``the weight of the evidence in
this case is very great; it's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no direct White House rebuttal of any of this.
That will begin Tuesday, the very day when Clinton, in another of
the bizarre juxtapositions in which this case has abounded, goes up
to Capitol Hill to deliver the seventh State of the Union message
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presentation Friday was not well-organized, with
speakers crossing each other's paths again and again. It sometimes
seemed that they had not read or heard each other's statements. For
example, Rep. Carl Cannon, R-Utah, used the same quotation from
Theodore Roosevelt in his opening Friday that Rep. F. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., had cited in his first words Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Barr heard criticism of this ``floating around in the ether out
there,'' he said, and entered a defense of ``not endless, not
pointless but appropriate repetition'' as a legitimate and
effective tool of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In his own argument, Barr devoted considerable time to the
events of Jan. 18, 1998, a Sunday, when Clinton talked with his
secretary, Betty Currie. He had testified the day before. He asked
her a series of questions _ in the form of ``false and misleading
accounts of events,'' Barr said _ and asking her to agree. In one
question, Clinton asked Mrs. Currie to agree that he had never been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky in or near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why did so, Clinton said he was ``trying to get the facts
down.'' But Barr contended that he was coaching her to support his
testimony, which he knew to be false. Often in white-collar
obstruction-of-justice cases, Barr continued, no one suggested to
anyone that they lie. He cited a 1953 case in the 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals in which Michael O'Keefe, a New Orleans real-estate man,
was convicted of obstruction for having tried to persuade a
colleague to testify falsely by falsely describing a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe never asked anyone to lie, Barr said. ``He didn't have
to. He was too smart for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, Barr declared, ``when one considers that
he had already testified, it was obviously too late to try to
recollect what the facts were.'' Barr added, ``in any event, Mrs.
Currie could not have told him what the true facts were because he
alone knew what they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Three prosecutors, or ``managers,'' to use the formal term, gave
little seminars on the law. One of them, Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio,
who explained what constituted perjury, said that one of the key
elements was whether a person lied knowingly or through accident or
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could not claim to have spoken out of ignorance in
testifying to the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter
because ``the president's own lawyer has acknowledged the care, the
intention, the will of the president to say exactly what he said.''
He was alluding to a statement by Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel, and he showed it on the special television screen set up
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff was clearly speaking about Clinton's deposition in the
Paula Jones civil case, not his grand jury testimony, which is a
subject of the impeachment article alleging perjury. The House of
Representatives rejected a separate impeachment article involved
perjury in the civil case.

<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ Until last year, Geoff Goodfellow was a
Silicon Valley Wunderkind, a pioneer in the field of wireless
electronic mail. Now, as a resident of the Czech Republic, he wakes
up each day and gazes from the balcony of his loft over a jumble of
rooftops at the Prague Castle on a nearby hill.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away from Silicon Valley, Goodfellow has become a
member of a small fraternity of engineers and entrepreneurs who
have dropped out and walked away from ground zero of the Internet
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Goodfellow's departure is an exception to the popular notion
that working in Silicon Valley, the world's high-technology
capital, is its own reward. He left with a darker vision of life
there and a disdain for the corrosive human effect of the region's
workaholic, dollar-obsessed culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Valley, it's all about power and money and work, work,
work, work, and this expectation among your peers that you're going
to do the next big thing,'' he said recently. ``Eventually I saw
that was a false god.''
</P>
<P>
   The different path taken by Goodfellow and a handful of others
who have left Silicon Valley is striking, because for the best and
the brightest, dropping out or even retiring early has become
increasingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   Making a huge fortune in a high-flying Internet or semiconductor
stock, which would be a life-changing event for most Americans, has
in Silicon Valley become merely an occasion for, say, buying a new
house or car and then transferring to a new start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   In this former agricultural region, it has become typical to
find ``serial entrepreneurs'' _ hardware engineers, scientists,
marketing managers and software programmers who often feel that
they work not for a given company but rather for Silicon Valley
Inc. Changing jobs has become as simple as turning into a new
driveway when you head for work.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these people, each successive job demands an intense
commitment that squeezes out any outside life, whether it is family
or recreation. Like the Apple Macintosh team of the 1980s whose
members wore T-shirts that read ``Working 90 hours a week and
loving it,'' many people who work here now wear this workaholism as
a badge of courage.
</P>
<P>
   The modern role models are those who have founded a string of
successful companies, like Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics
and Netscape Communications, or Federico Faggin, a former Intel
engineer, co-inventor of its first microprocessor chip and founder
of Zilog Corp. and Synaptics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Silicon Valley career goal has become graduating to
``corporate angel'' status _ wealthy enough to emulate the venture
capitalists who have long been the lifeblood of the Valley.
Entrepreneurs like Andreas Bechtolscheim, a co-founder of Sun
Microsystems who is now a computer designer at Cisco Systems, and
Mark Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, have become start-up
investors while keeping their day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To find the Valley's most celebrated dropout, by contrast, it is
necessary to reach back more than two decades. Robert J. Widlar, a
legendary chip designer at the National Semiconductor Corp., quit
and moved to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in the 1970s, saying he
``didn't like the water'' in Silicon Valley. His idyll was cut
short in 1991, when, at the age of 53, he died while jogging on a
Puerto Vallarta beach.
</P>
<P>
   It was Steven P. Jobs, a college dropout, who brought to Silicon
Valley the mantra that ``the journey is the reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Computer in 1976. After leaving
Apple in 1985, he founded Next Computer and almost simultaneously
bought Pixar, at the time an ailing supercomputer company.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Jobs had transformed Pixar into a digital
animation studio and became a billionaire overnight when he took it
public. Then, in late 1996, he returned to Apple as interim chief
executive and has orchestrated a stunning turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that, with technologies advancing at the headlong pace
known as Internet time, one accomplishment can often blur into the
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of Jean-Paul Sartre's observation that there
are no second acts in life, you realize that it simply doesn't
apply in Silicon Valley,'' said Fred Hoar, a longtime public
relations executive and a founder of the Band of Angels, a group of
independent private investors in the Valley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Following are the stories of three men whose second act was to
walk off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   For Goodfellow, 42, a tall, thin man with short blond hair, life
after Silicon Valley unfolds far from the world of endless business
meetings, late nights and 90-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, after discovering the Internet's predecessor,
called the Arpanet, Goodfellow asked for free access to the
computers of SRI International, the Menlo Park research center that
helped give birth to the Internet, and began spending time there,
helping to maintain the SRI computer systems. He became a computer
hacker, dropped out of high school, never to return, and in 1988,
from a spare bedroom in his Menlo Park apartment, started Radiomail
Corp. with the goal of providing nationwide wireless electronic
mail.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, after working first as chief executive and then as
chairman, and after a long struggle with his investors, Goodfellow
left Radiomail. Although his shares in the company had not made him
fabulously wealthy, he walked away with enough money to live well.
Working as a consultant, he immediately made plans to start several
new companies, each of which he thought could grow into new
industries related to music and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, while on vacation, Goodfellow, who is single,
made a brief stop in Prague that changed his life. It was, he said,
like meeting someone and knowing immediately that this was the
person he would marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have found the most beautiful and cultured city on
the planet, it changes your view of the world,'' he said. He
reflected on his life and work in Silicon Valley, and even though
he had a network of friends there, he sold his home and rented a
loft in a city he had visited for only a few days. ``I've arrived
in heaven,'' he said, ``and I didn't have to die first to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodfellow's disaffection with life in Silicon Valley had been
building for some time. In 1996 he moved to a loft in San Francisco
and began commuting to the Valley, spending his evenings
frequenting the city's fine restaurants and taking in the
underground music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Prague has changed his outlook on many things, he said.
``In the Valley there are these nervous battles for power and
money,'' he said. ``And the hype _ it is a culture that has no
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Goodfellow has totally abandoned his old world. He
typically wakes at 6 a.m. and shuffles to his portable computer. By
then it is 9 p.m. in Silicon Valley, and he catches up on
technology developments by way of e-mail and a complex set of
electronic tools that monitor the news services.
</P>
<P>
   He reads four newspapers each morning on the Internet and at
lunch catches up on two more, The International Herald Tribune and
The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   He left Silicon Valley a wealthy man, by Czech standards, and in
Prague he has become a full-time investor, with the booming U.S.
stock market making him richer. He returns home from lunch by 3:30
each afternoon to track before-hours U.S. trading and then uses the
World Wide Web to do research and to make investments until leaving
at 6 or 7 for dinner. Later each evening, he returns to monitor the
New York market close.
</P>
<P>
   He now calls Prague home, has a new set of mostly Czech friends
and says he is far more at peace with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can imagine life with zero hassles, zero bureaucracy
and zero conflict,'' he said, ``that's the environment I live in.''
</P>
<P>
   He still believes that ``the journey is the reward,'' but with a
twist. ``That was my goal,'' he said. ``But sometimes when you
start a journey your goal changes in midcourse and the currency in
the reward can change as well.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Steven Edelman is more philosophical than bitter about the
intense world he left behind six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Having succeeded in two eras of the personal-computer industry,
Edelman lives today in a forest in Beaverton, Ore., a suburb of
Portland. His decision to leave Silicon Valley, after founding and
successfully running a disk-drive and graphics company, was
prompted partly by a desire to get away from the urban bustle. But
in a sense, Edelman, 45, who once had a waist-length ponytail but
now favors short hair, jeans and T-shirts, was dropping out even
when he arrived in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman, a native of Long Island, graduated from Cornell and
then got into the personal-computer industry on the East Coast in
the mid-'70s, &UR;  &LR; when it was still a business for hobbyists. Just as
Steve Jobs had phoned David Packard, then chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard, to ask for parts for the original Apple computer,
Edelman called Faggin to ask him for a microprocessor chip to help
get him started.
</P>
<P>
   His first company, Ithaca Intersystems, sold an early
microcomputer and software. But the hobbyist era of computing was
soon over. As the industry started growing rapidly, Edelman,
fascinated by new design tools for developing ever more complex
semiconductor chips, moved to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With a small amount of savings to survive on, he spent his days
at the electrical engineering department at Stanford University,
often sitting in on courses on the design of advanced circuits. He
was there so often that Stanford officials mistook him for a junior
professor. After learning that he had no official ties to the
university, they tried to persuade him to become a graduate
student, but ultimately gave up and provided him an office and
access to a computer in exchange for the work he was doing in
designing chips.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1984, while he was involved in yet another design
project at Stanford, Apple introduced the Macintosh. ``I went to a
friend's house, and we took it apart,'' he said. ``I thought to
myself, `My God, this machine can be upgraded!'''
</P>
<P>
   AST Research Corp. already was thriving as a maker of peripheral
equipment for IBM-compatible personal computers, and Edelman knew
there would soon be a similar peripheral market related to the
Macintosh. He became a co-founder of Supermac Inc., and it grew
rapidly by selling components like expansion disks and graphics
adapters for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years the growth of Supermac made Edelman a
multimillionaire, but it also left him disenchanted about a world
that seemed to have much in common with the power and wealth of New
York and Los Angeles. For him the Valley seemed to be the new
Hollywood, full of stars and with its own pecking order that forced
people to play social games that didn't interest him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley had become the kind of place where if you
wanted to be somebody you had to be wildly successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Macintosh market began to lose ground to Windows and
Intel-based PC's, Edelman's company did not make the leap to the
PC-compatible market and began to shrink, eventually merging with
Radius Inc., another Silicon Valley company. He decided that it was
time to re-evaluate more than just his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people were making so much money I found myself
wondering how I was doing,'' he said. ``I began to wonder, `Is this
a good way to spend my life?'''
</P>
<P>
   His answer was no. So he and his wife, Hyun Suh, who is a
physician, moved to the forest near Portland.
</P>
<P>
   He now spends part of his days as an entrepreneurial investor,
freely discusses business ideas with callers and still does some
tinkering with computers. But he does not miss the rat race, or
what he sees as the Silicon Valley idea that your worth is measured
by the success of your last start-up. Instead, he has a life, with
time to rub shoulders with the nondigerati while engaging in
activities like hiking, water-skiing _ in a wetsuit, no matter the
season _ and white-water kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting away from the Valley,'' he said, ``gave me a fresh
appreciation of the fact that there are a lot of Americans who make
$22,000 a year and they're worth something.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   John Walker, founder of Autodesk Inc., the software publisher
based in San Rafael, Calif., has his roots in the first personal
computers. But eight years ago, he left the country because he had
decided that the prospect of starting another company ``wasn't
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A first-generation computer hacker, one who helped create the
personal-computer industry, Walker, 49, was co-founder of a
microcomputer business, Marinchip Systems, in the 1970s. But by
1981 an industry shakeout was under way and Marinchip was running
short of capital.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1982 he and a small group of programmer friends struck on
the idea of creating Autodesk Inc. Their flagship product, Autocad,
grew out a pooled investment of $60,000 and became a
general-purpose drafting and engineering program.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he became worried about his weight problem,
leading him to write a book called ``The Hacker's Diet: How to Lose
Weight and Hair Through Stress and Poor Nutrition.'' In the
introduction, he noted that he had gone from 215 pounds to 145.
Today he looks the part of the studious computer researcher, with
dark-framed glasses and a pale complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk blossomed into a multibillion-dollar enterprise, with
several thousand employees, and it still holds a commanding share
of the market for a variety of design tools used by engineers and
architects. Walker, though, remained involved in the day-to-day
management only through the company's first years, and readily
acknowledges now that he had no particular skill or interest in
managing such a large company. In 1986, a year after the company
went public, he stepped down as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, he also relinquished the role of chairman;
around that time, his Autodesk holdings were worth more than $30
million. In 1991 he left California and took up residence in
Switzerland with his wife, Roxie, and three dogs, two cats, a horse
and an undetermined number of goldfish. They live near Zurich in a
house adjoining a former hydraulics factory that he has converted
into an office-workshop, a rambling space that came with everything
from a generator that could power a small city to an
industrial-strength crane. ``Until you have a crane,'' he said
recently, ``you never knew that you needed one.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he tried to run a remote research and development
laboratory for Autodesk from his hydraulics castle, but an effort
to help the company enter the factory design and automation
software field fell short.
</P>
<P>
   As a prolific writer, and with a wide range of technical and
scientific interests, he has dabbled in a variety of projects. He
maintains a Web site (www.fourmilab.ch) that offers everything from
his history of Autodesk to his diet book (which he says has been
downloaded 4.6 million times) to an Internet telephone program
called Speak Freely that he wrote after the Internet took off.
</P>
<P>
   Walker keeps his connections to the original Silicon Valley
hacker community, returning for the annual Hackers Conference,
which is attended by some of the nation's best programmers.
</P>
<P>
   He also has engaged in a wide variety of personal projects,
including using the World Wide Web to test theories of
parapsychology. He is not a believer but takes a scientific
interest in this field, with one current test trying to determine
if humans sitting at computers connected to the Internet can
exchange messages through mere thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Like both Goodfellow and Edelman, he maintains that his distance
from the Valley has given him a freedom he would never have had
amid the intense competition there.
</P>
<P>
   Walker says he does not understand the passion that drives many
in the Valley to start over again and again, whether they are
successes or failures. He still remembers the struggle of starting
Autodesk in the early 1980s and being turned down, he says, by
every venture capitalist in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprises me, is the compulsiveness of it,'' he said. I
didn't find it enjoyable enough that I'd want to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   What about all those who keep coming back for more? The answer
may be that the Valley is an ego-driven place and that many imply
cannot tear themselves away.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul Saffo, an industry consultant at the Institute for the
Future, a research center in Menlo Park, put it: ``There is this
pressure to prove yourself over and over again in Silicon Valley.
People wonder, `Was it me or was it luck?'''

BRAZIL LETS ITS CURRENCY FLOAT; STOCK MARKET SOARS

<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Reeling from the unrelenting hemorrhage
of dollars from its foreign reserves, the Brazilian government
lifted exchange rate controls on Friday in a move that sent stock
markets soaring here and rising throughout Latin America and the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Friday that the Brazilian central bank would
allow market forces to determine the currency's value came 24 hours
after the bank had ruled out such a step, and it appeared to signal
conflict and disarray over economic policy at the top levels of
government. A senior official of the central bank, Claudio Mauch,
whose resignation was announced on Thursday, was back in charge on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were relieved that Brazil had abandoned _ at least
for a day _its policy of spending dollar reserves to defend its
currency, known as the real, from selling attacks by speculators
who had bet it would eventually fall in value. The real fell on
Friday, but its descent was not as sharp as had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's main stock index rose 33.4 percent on Friday after two
days of punishing losses, reflecting the sudden attractiveness of
Brazilian stocks that had fallen to bargain levels. The
reverberations of that turnaround were like a tonic on other
markets, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points,
or 2.4 percent, recovering losses of the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift is a significant blow to Brazil's established
policy of relying on a stable currency loosely pegged to the dollar
to cure Latin America's largest economy of its chronically high
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised speech to the nation late on Friday, Brazil's
president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said he had abandoned defense
of the currency only as a last resort. ``I could not let reserves
keep going out and leave Brazil undefended in order to take
precautions afterward,'' Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Brazil's finance minister, Pedro Malan, and its
new central bank president, Francisco Lopes, flew to Washington to
meet with officials of the International Monetary Fund, who had
grown skeptical at Brazil's effort on Wednesday to allow a small
and gradual devaluation without lifting exchange rate controls. The
IMF has been supporting Brazil with a $41.5 billion bailout package
from a variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's effort boomeranged badly, unnerving investors
who had bet on a stable currency. In an intensifying exodus of
dollars from Brazil, $1.8 billion left central bank coffers on
Thursday, shrinking foreign reserves to $31 billion from $75
billion last summer and forcing government officials here to change
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central bank of Brazil will not intervene in exchange
markets today,'' an announcement from the bank said on Friday,
adding that ``another communique in this respect will be released
Monday.'' Officials in Washington said that IMF officials would be
discussing Brazil's future monetary regime with officials this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of lifting exchange controls, the Brazilian real
fell to 1.60 to the dollar from 1.32, but it settled at 1.43 by
day's end. Though economists had estimated Brazil's currency was
overvalued by up to 30 percent, by the end of trading it became
clear that Brazil had managed to stanch the flight of dollars. The
real had recovered strength, closing down only 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little sense that any long-term equilibrium had
been found. ``I think we still have a messy time for two months or
so,'' said John Welch, chief economist for Latin America at
Paribas, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The move also had a healthy affect on Brazil's near term
interest rates, which had hit 71.65 percent on Thursday for
contracts maturing in February. That rate fell in half, to 36.11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m. here on Friday, just $173 million had left Brazil's
foreign reserves, which had lost more than $5 billion in the first
nine days of this year alone. Some analysts suggested that on
Monday the government would establish a new exchange rate based on
the free market value of the real established on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With investors breathing a continent-wide sigh of relief, the
Sao Paulo market, which has faced double digit losses for days,
began climbing. At day's end, the market registered its second
highest increase in a single day's trading, jumping 33.4 percent in
heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Markets rose throughout Latin America, going up 12.3 percent in
Argentina, 7.8 percent in Mexico and 5.6 percent in Peru. In
Germany, stocks were up 1.5 percent, while in Paris, the bourse
climbed 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's efforts to protect its economy from the turbulence
roiling emerging markets has been a continual preoccupation for
Washington and other industrial nations since last summer, when
Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on some foreign debt
payments. Representing more than half South America's population
and more than 40 percent of its economic output, Brazil was
considered the most likely candidate for ushering the troubles of
emerging markets to America's doorstep, by dragging down economies
throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government's earlier success in selling investors
on Brazil's commitment to ending hyperinflation and modernizing the
role of government, had encouraged foreign companies to increase
their stakes in Brazil throughout the four-year-old Cardoso
administration. In 1994, foreign direct investment in Brazil
totaled $2 billion. Now, it accounts for more than $36 billion,
thanks in part to aggressive privatization of state utility, mining
and telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is also considered the locomotive of Latin America, which
buys 20 percent of American exports. And it owes more than $228
billion in foreign debt, according to its letter of intent laying
out the terms of its bailout by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis emerged after the governor of Brazil's third
wealthiest state announced a moratorium on paying his state's debt
last week. That caused a wave of dissent among state governors and
undermined Brazil's ability to deliver deficit-cutting reforms and
ultimately, to pay its debts.

 WASHINGTON: Republican whip.  (Eds: First 420 words moved
earlier.) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I see no value in having the president come because I'm
confident that if he did come, he would simply repeat the same kind
of tortured evasions that he's had before, and then claim that
those were accurate statements,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also voiced skepticism:
``We'd have to look at why they want to invite him, what void would
be filled, and what questions would be cleared up.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Senate Democrats assailed the idea of even inviting the
president, as a form of coercion. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., warned
fellow Democrats at a party caucus Friday morning that such a step
would be a breach of the separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., accused the House managers and their
Senate sympathizers of ``witness baiting,'' and said any attempt to
force Clinton to appear would ``remove that last vestige of
American jurisprudence, which is you're innocent until proven
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats saw no harm in asking Clinton to tell his
side of the story. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said, ``It would be
appropriate for Congress to invite him. It's his decision to accept
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they persuade the Senate to invite the president, many
House prosecutors acknowledge he is not likely to accept. At least
the president is embarrassed, they say. ``I don't think it's
anything that's likely to happen, so I'm no going to lose any sleep
over it,'' said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president unexpectedly accepted an offer, House
prosecutors said they were eager to grill him on what they say was
his scheme to conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, whether
he told Ms. Currie to pick up gifts he gave Ms. Lewinsky, and other
disputed parts of the scandal. ``We want to cross-examine him,''
said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors may even ask the Senate to offer the
president a certain form of immunity from prosecution in exchange
for his testimony. Under the so-called ``use immunity,'' none of
what the president said to the Senate could be used against him by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, or any other federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could not use the excuse of future prosecution as a
reason not to testify, the managers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use immunity is one of the issues the Senate may face if it
chooses to seek the president's testimony, especially if the
president is worried about exposing himself to criminal
prosecution,'' said Nicole Nason, a Republican spokeswoman for the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   An immunity offer, however, is unlikely to draw out Clinton.
Senate Democrats said it would take a lot more than that for the
White House to change its mind on testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hearing a hue and cry from my colleagues thus far, `We
want the president,''' said Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del. ``If 100
senators stood up and said, `We want the president,' then his
political dynamic changes.''

EDITORIAL: THE WITNESS MIRAGE   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde and his House prosecution team are trying to sell the
Senate and the country on the notion that summoning Monica
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and other witnesses magically will seal the
case against Bill Clinton. This is impeachment snake oil.
</P>
<P>
   Calling witnesses will not make or break the case, but it will
prolong the trial for days, if not weeks, and turn it into a
bitterly partisan spectacle that can only damage the Senate and
anger the nation. Trent Lott, the majority leader, knows that and
recognizes that Republicans will pay the price. It is not too late
for him to plot a different course.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the House presentation this week was an unconvincing
argument for calling witnesses, possibly including Clinton himself.
Summon Ms. Currie, the House team suggested, and the Senate could
definitively establish whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice by
tampering with a witness. Bring in Ms. Lewinsky and the Senate
would recognize that Clinton committed perjury. The House
prosecutors even maintained that it would be irresponsible for the
Senate to reach a judgment on Clinton's fitness to serve as
President without hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The last is a particularly odd argument coming from the House
Republicans, who concluded that Clinton should be removed from
office without questioning any of the people they insist the Senate
see. The record reviewed by the House, now available to the Senate,
is voluminous and the facts in it are essentially uncontested. It
includes hundreds of hours of grand-jury testimony by the central
witnesses, including Ms. Currie and Ms. Lewinsky, and all the
evidence collected by Kenneth Starr's office in a nine-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine how the appearance of Ms. Lewinsky or Ms.
Currie could galvanize the Senate to convict Clinton. If she
testifies, Ms. Currie is not likely to sweep away the ambiguities
in her account and say Clinton, for whom she still works,
instructed her to lie. Ms. Lewinsky can only take the Senate where
most members say they do not want to go, namely through a detailed
reconstruction of her sexual encounters with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days the evidence against Clinton and the laws
in question were rehearsed before the Senate in numbing detail, and
will be summarized again Saturday. Once the White House makes its
defense next week, and senators question both parties, the Senate
will decide whether to call witnesses and whether to adjourn the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Both matters will be decided by a simple majority vote. Lott
should guide the Senate to end the trial and then work with both
parties to pass a stinging censure resolution. The just and
reasonable punishment of Clinton favored by most Americans is
within reach, if the Senate can resist the false promise of calling
witnesses.  &QL;

   The Furby: Hot Toy Turned Electro-Menace
</P>
<P>
   As the must-have, can't-find toy sensation of the 1998 holiday
season, the Furby, a vaguely owl-like stuffed critter with an
electronic voice, seemed to be a threat to nothing but the wallets
and emotional equilibrium of desperately shopping parents.
</P>
<P>
   Little did the world know: In a span of a few days last week,
Furbies were fingered as insidious menaces to both national
security and commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Made by the Tiger Electronics unit of Hasbro, the Furby speaks
in a mixture of incomprehensible ``Furbish'' and words it has
``learned'' by recording odd snippets of its owner's speech.
</P>
<P>
   This charming feature is what scares the National Security
Agency, prompting a ban on Furbies and anything else with built-in
recording capability at NSA headquarters at Fort Meade, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Furbies' electronic innards also landed the toys afoul of
American and Canadian aviation regulators. The Federal Aviation
Administration and Transport Canada both decided to forbid use of
Furbies during takeoffs and landings of commercial passenger
aircraft _ times when their little owners might most need the
comfort of a favorite plaything.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Like Gameboys, CD players and some other portable gadgets,
Furbies emit weak radio signals that can interfere with the
aircraft's own electronic gear.

 &HT;    Fast start equals good time for Auburn
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Usually, there are three sports seasons at
Auburn: football season, football recruiting season and spring
football practice. Don't look now, but The Loveliest Village on the
Plain has come down with a serious case of basketball fever. And
with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's 16-0 start is the second-best in school history, next
to the 19-0 start in 1959. As a result, the Tigers are No. 8, in
the Top 10 for the first time since Dec. 30, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Going into today's game with Florida, Auburn is one of only two
undefeated Division I teams in the country. No. 1 Connecticut
(14-0) is the other.
</P>
<P>
   After a disheartening 3-8 football season, with coach Terry
Bowden resigning in October, Auburn supporters have embraced this
basketball team with a passion normally reserved for fall Saturdays
in Jordan-Hare Stadium. The signs are everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   _ Today's game will be Auburn's third sellout in a row. Only a
handful of tickets remain for the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toomer's Corner is an Auburn landmark where students celebrate
a football victories. Last Wednesday, after Auburn's 74-59 win at
Mississippi, students rolled Toomer's Corner with toilet paper for
the third time in a row.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Auburn basketball team returned home at 11:45 p.m.
Wednesday to find a crowd of more than 250 people waiting for them
at the airport. The week before, about 150 turned out in a
25-degree temperature when the team returned from LSU.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sports Illustrated, which hadn't been on campus for a
basketball story since Charles Barkley terrorized the SEC in the
1980s, has an article on the Tigers in this week's edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun to see the people get really excited,'' junior
guard Daymeon Fishback said., ``We've finally created the kind of
atmosphere for basketball around here that we've always wanted.

 &HT;    Cremins hopes week off pays off
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a week off and trying to steady a shaky season,
Georgia Tech plays host to Wake Forest today, desperate to show it
isn't as bad as last Saturday's 75-56 home loss to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Cremins seems as puzzled as anyone about the Yellow
Jackets' wild fluctuations and has admitted to being embarrassed by
some performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely something wrong'' he said. ``We've got four
new starters and there's definitely a lack of experience, but it
was a lack of something else. I was really upset with the team. I
was disgusted. I don't think we respected Florida State the way we
should have. I'm part of that too, now. I've got to make sure
they're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   One positive for the Jackets has been Indiana transfer Jason
Collier. The 7-foot power forward sat out Tech's first six games
but has averaged 17.2 points and 5.9 rebounds in 10 games and
scored in double figures in all but one game. Even with a bleeding
ulcer and the loss of 18 pounds during a bout with the flu, his
play has been exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collier has a tendency to play at 110 mph instead of 100,''
Cremins said, ``and he's got to get better defensively, but he
realized he had to step up, and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Jackets' problems originate in the backcourt.
Freshman point guard Tony Akins has more turnovers than assists, 82
to 79. Junior shooting guard Jason Floyd has disappeared in big
games, scoring two points against Kentucky, six against Hofstra and
four against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough the last two years; we had two point guards
transfer out,'' Cremins said. ``I take a lot of responsibility for
that. Tony's our guy... We have no intentions of recruiting another
point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore center Alvin Jones has played well most of the season.
The 6-11 pivot player is averaging 11.3 points and 10.4 rebounds
and has 71 blocked shots in 16 games. Jones has 212 rejections,
which ranks second on the Jackets' career list behind John Salley's
231. Jones needs 28 more blocks to move into the top 10 on the
career ACC list. The ACC leader in blocks and rebounds also has
improved his offensive accuracy, hitting 21 of 30 field-goal
attempts in his past four games.

 &HT;    Life University looks to win its 100th consecutive home men's
basketball game
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time Life University lost a home game the
last-place Atlanta Falcons were coached by Jerry Glanville and no
one had heard of a college student named Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The date was Nov. 13, 1993 _ five seasons and 99 victories ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I still remember that loss,'' said Life coach Roger
Kaiser, thinking back to the 77-70 defeat by Georgetown, Ky. ``You
never want to lose at home. All coaches preach that. But you sure
don't expect to keep winning like this, either. Not game after
game, season after season.''
</P>
<P>
   Life goes for consecutive home victory No. 100 tonight, playing
Talladega College at 7:30. It should be a memorable night for the
Marietta school.
</P>
<P>
   Only two college teams have longer streaks than Life, which
didn't even have a basketball team until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky won a NCAA-record 129 consecutive home games from 1943
to Jan. 8, 1955. Georgia Tech, Kaiser's alma mater, snapped the
Wildcats' streak 59-58 on a shot by Joe Helms with 11 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Marymount College in Kansas won an NAIA-record 106 games in a
row, 1971 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Life players already are thinking about those records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can break the NAIA record this season,'' junior Chummy
Johnson of Conyers said. ``And we want to keep the streak going so
the younger guys can get Kentucky, too. Nobody beats us here.
That's the way all of us think.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Life rarely loses anywhere. The Running Eagles, who
won the NAIA championship in 1997, are 15-5 this season and 234-40
all-time in seven-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It is at home, though, where Life's record is phenomenal. The
team is 126-6, losing three times the first season, twice the
second and once early in the third. None of Life's current players
ever has lost a home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, it seems like destiny,'' senior Ron Glover of
Marietta said. ``It's almost as if we're not meant to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck, as well as skill, has a hand in any streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been games where you know you've been outplayed,
yet somehow you win,'' said Glover, the brother of Georgia Tech's
Dion Glover. ``Players have made some miracle shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Lewis, Life's all-time leading scorer, made last-second
shots several times to keep the streak alive the first few years.
But the real magic came last season:
</P>
<P>
   _ Demitrius Palmer banked in a long three-pointer at the buzzer
to tie nationally ranked Azusa Pacific, and Life went on to beat
the California school 106-100 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Antwon Hall swished in a three-pointer while falling out of
bounds in front of the Life bench to give the Eagles a 73-71
comeback win over Auburn-Montgomery in the NAIA Southeast Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you're never supposed to give up,'' Kaiser said
with a grin. ``But I'll admit there have been four or five times
where things sure didn't look real promising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been good through the years, but we've been real lucky,
too,'' said Lewis, a 1996 graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, who has won more than 600 games as a college coach at
West Georgia and Life, doesn't hesitate to use the streak for extra
motivation. After last season, every player received a shirt that
had ``87'' on the back. That was where the streak stood at the
time, and no words of explanation were needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we talk about before every game,'' Johnson
said. ``And if we're not playing well, we'll hear about it again
during the game. No one wants to be on the team that breaks the
streak. It would be hard to live down.''
</P>
<P>
   Life, No. 15 in the NAIA rankings, has had to battle injuries
and academic problems this season and lost leading scorer Marko
Wright after the first semester.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a losing record on the road, the Running Eagles have won
their 12 home games by an average of 30 points. The schedule is not
as tough as in past years, although Life has beaten nationally
ranked Georgia Southwestern and Berry at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams don't want to come in here and lose,'' Kaiser said.
``Some teams will play us at their place, but not here. I guess you
can't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn-Montomery has lost seven times at Life, twice when it
appeared it had the game won. There is no scheduled rematch this
season. ``That's no accident,'' coach Larry Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at the Eagles' Nest isn't a treat for anybody. Although
the 2,500-seat Sports Arena is rarely more than half full, the
noise level can make you wish your were at nearby Dobbins Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
   The Spinal Cords, a 20-member band, rock the gym at every
opportunity. The cheerleaders pound their megaphones against the
floor or the railings in front of the bleachers. Doc, maybe the
biggest eagle mascot in college sports, terrorizes opponent
players, especially during free throws. The DC Dancers perform at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Sid Williams, who founded Life as a chiropractic college
in 1974 and has orchestrated its growth into a diverse school of
more than 4,000 students, is almost always in a front-row seat at
midcourt, cheering on his team. He'll be there tonight, sitting
next to his wife, Nell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't missed a home game since we started until this year,
and that was only because I was laid up in Florida with a bad
knee,'' Williams said. ``I'm sure not going to miss this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Green placards with ``100'' on them have been printed, and fans
will be given confetti. The celebration is about to begin. Just one
more win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams come in here and talk big about ending the streak,''
Johnson said. ``But pretty soon you can see in their eyes that they
are intimidated. No one beats us. At least not at home.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Freshmen give Bulldogs important versatility
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Entering the season, the talk about Georgia's
basketball team centered around its five seniors and all-star
sophomore Jumaine Jones. But as the season progresses, the
Bulldogs' freshmen are an increasingly important factor.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia begins its most difficult stretch tonight against No.
24 Arkansas, the play of its first-year players might determine how
long the Bulldogs' season lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard D.A. Layne has emerged as Georgia's sixth man.
He's fifth on the team in scoring with an 8.8 average and has
scored in double figures six times, with a high of 18 in his first
game as a Bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two other late-arriving freshman have proved their
worth in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Edwards, a football signee who was unable to walk-on
until he academically qualified in late December, has played 19
minutes in Georgia's past two games, including final minutes of
Wednesday's 70-63 win over Vanderbilt. He scored eight against the
Commodores and three in a loss at Florida on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Fields, a 6-foot-3 swingman also failed to gain his
eligibility until late last month. Although his minutes have been
limited to nine in the past two games, he played 12 minutes and
scored 10 points on 4-of-4 shooting in a victory against
Mississippi State and played 14 minutes in the East Carolina
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not much unlike G.G. (Smith), Ray (Harrison) and
Michael (Chadwick) when they came in, in that they're getting good
experience behind a mostly senior team,'' Georgia coach Ron Jirsa
said. ``They all play the same positions, and each of them has been
able to come in and give us a lift when we needed one.''
</P>
<P>
   Layne's play should probably come as no surprise. He came to
Georgia after a highly decorated career at Wheeler High in Marietta
where he was a four-year starter and averaged 27 points as a
senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of seniors, so our job is to come in and try
not to let the team skip a beat,'' Layne said. ``When me, Terrence
and Shawn got here, our team changed drastically. I think it gives
us a boost in games and in practice, and everybody's working even
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if nothing else, the emergence of the freshmen has given
the Bulldogs depth, and that's something they'll need against
Arkansas. Arkansas also will be trying to avenge last season's
86-70 loss to the Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Georgia is a very good basketball team,
and they've always been a difficult team for us to play,'' said
coach Nolan Richardson, who's 7-4 against Georgia.

 &HT;    UT-UGA rivalry poised to heat up with Bulldogs' new hire
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a move sure to increase the intensity of an already
intense Georgia-Tennessee rivalry, Georgia coach Jim Donnan
announced on Friday that he had hired former Tennessee secondary
coach Kevin Ramsey as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kines, Georgia's defensive coordinator for the past four
years, becomes assistant head coach. Kines was criticized for some
of Georgia's defensive shortcomings last season.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said that Kines will be assigned a defensive position to
coach but that he has not made the decision yet, pending the
eventual hiring of another assistant. ``He'll continue working with
Kevin to help develop our defense,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second year in a row Donnan has plucked one of the
Volunteers' top assistant coaches from the staff of coach Phillip
Fulmer. Last January, Donnan hired awaye Rodney Garner, now the
Bulldogs recruiting coordinator and defensive-line coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be a part of a program that's on the rise,''
Ramsey, 37, said. ``This is not a situation where you're coming in
and trying to revamp and make things happen. These guys are on a
successful road. Up in Knoxville, we've seen (Georgia) on the rise
for the last three years. I'm just one of the pluses in a lot of
pluses that are going to equal success here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vols are hosting their biggest group of blue-chip prospects
this weekend in Knoxville. Ramsey was recruiting some of
Tennessee's top recruits, including four from the state of Georgia:
Carrollton wide receiver Reggie Brown, LaGrange running back Bruce
Thornton, Creekside defensive lineman Charles Roberson and Dunwoody
defensive lineman Jeff Womble.
</P>
<P>
   But Donnan insisted that Friday's move was not to blunt
Tennessee's recruiting momentum after its national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in this to get a recruiting edge; this is a
long-term move to help bolster our staff,'' Donnan said. ``Coaches
are going to move on when they have a chance to broaden their
professional base. There's never a good time for changes, as far as
the other schools that are involved. It always causes a little bit
of an uproar. (But) we've had two of our coaches heavily recruited
to leave our staff in the last week, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner turned down a lucrative offer to return to his alma mater
of Auburn, and linebackers coach Brad Lambert declined an
opportunity to become defensive coordinator at Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Kines declined after the news conference to elaborate on his new
appointment. During it, his comments were short and succinct.
``Anytime you make a change, it's for the better and the good of
the program,'' Kines said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said he wasn't necessarily bringing an aggressive,
all-out attacking defense to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is about bringing the tool box and being able to
bring out whatever you need when you need it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia still has one vacancy on its staff after former
offensive line and assistant head caoch Chris Scelfo left to become
head coach at Tulane and Mickey Matthews accepted the defensive
coordinator's position at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scelfo and Matthews were the fourth and fifth coaches,
respectively, to leave Donnan's staff to become either
coordinator's or NFL assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan attempted to hire his son, Todd Donnan, as an offensive
coach but that request was denied by UGA President Michael Adams,
who cited the University System of Georgia's nepotism policy.
Donnan made a written request to Adams asking to make an exception
in the case, but it was denied. Todd Donnan is a graduate assistant
on his father's staff, which is acceptable under university policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other state systems allow nepotism. Lou Holtz hired his son Skip
as offensive coordinator, Steve Spurrier Jr. worked with his father
at Florida before joining Bob Stoops at Oklahoma this year, Chris
Scelfo's brother Frank is coaching with him at Tulane, and Florida
State coach Bobby Bowden has almost always had a son coaching for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the president, and I'll abide by that,'' Donnan said
about Adam's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan would not speculate about how he plans to fill the
remaining position, which probably will be on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big decision because we've got an SEC freshman of the
year at quarterback (Quincy Carter),'' he said, ``and we've kind of
put all our eggs in his basket.''

GERMANY TO COMPENSATE AMERICAN SURVIVORS OF NAZI CAMPS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Germany Friday announced a
tentative agreement for the German government to compensate an
estimated 240 Americans who were imprisoned in Nazi concentration
camps.
</P>
<P>
   While terms of the agreement remained secret, lawyers for the
victims said they had been told that their clients would receive an
average of about $100,000, which would put the total value of the
settlement at $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   American officials would not confirm the figure but said Germany
had agreed to provide millions of dollars in restitution to the
Americans. Most are Jews who were trapped in Europe during World
War II or captured American soldiers, some of them also Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was the result of a second round of negotiations
between the State Department and the German government over the
issue. The earlier talks ended with a settlement in 1995 that
required Germany to provide about $2 million to 14 Americans who
had been identified as former prisoners in Nazi concentration
camps. At the time, the two countries agreed that the United States
would search for others who were American citizens when they were
imprisoned in the camps and who might also be entitled to German
restitution. American officials, speaking on the condition that
they not be identified, said the search turned up about 240 more
claimants.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not apply to camp survivors who became
American citizens after the war, but many of them were entitled to
compensation under other agreements with the German government.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Perles, a Washington lawyer who represents about 20 of
the claimants, said his clients and their families were ``generally
pleased'' with the agreement, which was first reported by USA
Today. ``Generally the State Department has done a good job here.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was concerned by reports that it could take
another six months for his clients to receive their compensation
checks. ``Most of these claimants are well into their 80s, and as
you can imagine, any further delay is an extraordinary hardship for
them and their families,'' he said. ``None of these people have
been told whether they are going to receive funds and in what
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, the German government said that under the
agreement, ``it is up to the discretion of the U.S. Government to
distribute the funds provided for under the global agreement as
well as to determine who, on an individual basis, is entitled to
receive them.'' Germany, it said, ``sees this agreement as a sign
of good will and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The German Parliament must still approve the settlement.
American officials said that the lawmakers were almost certain to
approve the pact, and that the vote was expected within a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The German government and German corporations have been under
increasing pressure to settle compensation claims by victims of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Germany's new Social Democratic government and
several large trans-Atlantic mergers, large German banks and
industrial conglomerates have struggled in recent weeks to devise a
broad plan to compensate Holocaust survivors and Poles, Russians
and other Europeans enslaved by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The corporations, from Deustche Bank to Siemens and
Daimler-Chrysler, are trying to free themselves from a flood of
American class-action suits alleging that they profited during
World War II by collaborating with the Nazis.

 &HT;    Tailback Davis is Denver's visionary
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ At the pop-a-shot machine in the middle of
the Denver Broncos lockerroom, tailback Terrell Davis paused ever
so slightly at the top of his release Friday morning before
launching the attempt that would doom linebacker John Mobley to
another defeat in the best-of-forever series between the two
players.
</P>
<P>
   When the shot clanged errantly off the back of the iron, even
Mobley appeared momentarily stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be,'' Mobley said, ``the first hole that `T.D.' has
missed all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos meet
the New York Jets in the AFC title game here, Mobley's point was
well-taken. The Jets' defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, has
spent the past week searching for ways to contain Davis. He'll
stack his linebackers and probably move strong safety Victor Scott
closer to the line.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is this: Give Davis, a former Georgia running
back, an inch and he'll take a Mile High Stadium jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   During a season in which Davis became the fourth player in
league history to rush for 2,000 yards, a legion of observers tried
to analyze his running style. The analysis: He runs with style and
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the great backs have great vision; it's a prerequisite for
the position,'' Denver guard Mark Schlereth said. ``But in (Davis')
case, he's gone beyond 20-20 (vision). It's like he has eyes in the
back of his head, on the side of his head, all over. He sees
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the case in last week's victory against
Miami. After dissecting video of the game, Jets linebackers coach
Al Groh concluded that Davis had found the most opportune hole on
20 of his 21 carries. According to the Jets' assistant, Davis
missed a seam on the left side on a second-quarter toss play.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those few instances when the Dolphins maintained
gap-control, Davis seemed to find a crease and burst into the Miami
secondary. But then, the Denver offensive line had such tremendous
surge that Davis was afforded the extra split-second to locate a
wide running lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game probably isn't the best example of running with
vision,'' Davis said. ``Our line was knocking Miami off the ball so
far, I was 3 or even 4 yards into the defense before the first
contact came. The cutback lanes were all there and I had lots of
time to look for them. Rarely did I go to the frontside of the
play. There were some plays where I had two or three (holes) to
choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 199-yard performance in just 2 1/2 quarters of
the Broncos' 38-3 romp. His career playoff average of 145.2 yards
is the best-ever among backs who have appeared in at least five NFL
postseason contests. The next closest is Hall of Famer John
Riggins, who averaged 110.7 yards in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wasn't making predictions about the matchup with the Jets
and cited their active linebackers as a source of concern. The New
York front seven played well last week against Jacksonville rookie
Fred Taylor, but Davis presents a bigger challenge.
</P>
<P>
   During a regular season in which he rushed for 2,008 yards,
Davis had four of the top 20 rushing totals in the league, each
time going for more than 160 yards. Only the Dolphins, who held
Davis to 29 yards on 16 attempts in a Dec. 21 victory in which
Denver coach Mike Shanahan used a scaled-down game plan, had a
modicum of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I do have the natural ability to just (gravitate) to
the hole,'' Davis said. ``I know the football term is `vision,' but
really it's more like a feel. It's more like seeing light and dark,
you know? There's a crack, because you can feel it's there, and you
run to it.

 &HT;    Addiction to sports tough to overcome
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Now repeat after me until you get it right: Michael
isn't gone, Michael isn't gone, Michael isn't gone.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Michael isn't gone.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you've learned by now that there is no such concept as
retirement for coaches and players, especially if they still can
fog up a mirror while staying pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, unless their names are Jim Brown, Al McGuire or Rocky
Marciano, they don't leave by choice. Some are fired. Others are
forced into exile by injury, senility or a power struggle with a
bigger ego. Most relinquish this true love of their life only
through death.
</P>
<P>
   Since that's settled, these premature eulogies for his Airness
can stop any hour. He's coming back. Yes, Michael Jordan is, and it
will be in the year 2000, maybe before.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan knows the truth, and that is during the short run of
these post-lockout days, we're heading for a brutal NBA season.
Patrick Ewing resembles many of his peers by looking puffier than
the Pillsbury Doughboy. The schedule also is a joke. I mean, who
wants to play back-to-back-to-back games in this grueling league
even if you're in shape?
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, if you're Jordan, and you're mightier than
commissioner David Stern, you stay away for a while to keep from
getting flattened by one of those Doughboys. You play golf for the
next few months, and then you wait for the howling masses to beg
for your return to save the game in exchange for even more
adulation and more pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the biggest thing: Jordan won't let Jordan quit dribbling
in his prime. I think Jordan has done this before.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, speaking of burying the living, in this mile-high city
that rises higher when you mention John Elway, they've already
begun an obituary for the guy. Again. Just last season, when the
Broncos raced to a Super Bowl victory, Elway said he was outta
here, and you know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Elway hasn't left. In fact, Elway was efficient enough to lead
the NFL's third most prolific offense.
</P>
<P>
   So despite all of the moaning throughout the Rockies about
Sunday's AFC Championship Game serving as Elway's last home
appearance after 16 seasons with the Broncos, he'll return for a
17th, 18th and beyond. Steve DeBerg is 178 years old, and he wants
another season with the Falcons, and Elway is at least as dandy as
DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is logical. After all, as has been the case forever,
the game is the most potent drug around for players and coaches.
That's why Jimmy Johnson used the same breath this week to say that
he was leaving and returning to the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson said he'll change his obsessive ways toward
football. He mentioned the recent death of his mother as a turning
point, especially since a game forced him to miss her wake.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson talked of delegating more responsibility to assistant
head coach Dave Wannstedt and enjoying life, and haven't we heard
this before from Dick Vermeil? Yep. He returned to coaching after a
lengthy layoff due to burnout, and he said he'd work less this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil hasn't. Johnson won't either.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Elway can't leave, and Jordan will return. That's the
way this addiction works.

 &HT;    Investigations angering residents
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ This is a place in bad need of a good
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of storm that would paralyze Atlanta. A snowfall so
deep it would enable Frost or Emerson to walk down Peachtree at
five in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has had sunshine and warm temperatures. Skiers are
avoiding rocks on the slopes of Alta and Snowbird and _ while they
pray for snow _ finding a city at odds with itself.
</P>
<P>
   The locals are arguing their options as four investigations
continue into allegations that Salt Lake City Olympic officials
went overboard with gifts and payments to International Olympic
Committee members who voted to conduct the 2002 Winter Games here.
This proud, conservative town is squinting beneath the glare of an
international spotlight, wondering whether hosting an Olympics is
the blessing it was promised to be.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Ted Shapiro was to enjoy his first day of skiing. He
had the bounce and constant smile that only skiers would know.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's going to rain but maybe some snow on the
mountains,'' he said. ``We hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Olympic scandal, he said, ``Oh, brother. It's
awful. I just held my breath and was really relieved that they
found nothing on Atlanta. ... I am surprised, but relieved. Whew!''
</P>
<P>
   As the Salt Lake Organizing Committee continues its work, which
Friday featured the announcement of a transitional organization
structure, many here are pausing to listen to once-derided local
critics and ask themselves if they really want the Games at all.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City is not paralyzed by the scandal but, rather,
angry about it. Very angry. Unlike in other American cities, the
presidential impeachment proceedings are background noise.
</P>
<P>
   Some city leaders say they think that they have been
marginalized by the SLOC and the IOC. They have contempt for both.
They don't intend to stay on the sideline. They would like to vote
it out of existence. If the Games do stay here _ and indications
are they will _ the naysayers want it on the city's terms, not on
arrangements and deals between the SLOC and the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The battle line being drawn by some local leaders now is
financial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Atlanta Olympics, the IOC no longer awards Games to
cities unless a government body agrees to take legal responsibility
for any financial shortfall. Utah made such an agreement, but the
governor said that the state cannot be held responsible for an
Olympics that is hosted by a city. Now, the buck apparently stops
with Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am saying it is time right now to tell the IOC that they
have the burden of paying any shortfalls,'' City Council member
Deeda Seed said. ``(Let's) renegotiate. They have equal
responsibility for the mess we are in now, and they either accept
that responsibility and indemnify the city or pack it.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz said, ``I have confidence that
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee will reach their (fund-raising)
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Seed and others have heard that for quite some time. They want
to hear it their way _ a commitment by the IOC to pay if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Seed points out Salt Lake City's entire operating budget is $400
million, while the SLOC is operating with a $1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $10 million shortfall for them would be minuscule,'' she
said. ``For us, that $10 million would be huge. But by their
records, they are $250 million or more short of their goal. That
kind of shortfall would be devastating to this city. We simply
could not afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the scandal has prompted some major sponsors to await
the results of the investigations, no major sponsor has pulled out.
SLOC did, however, push back a goal of reaching its budget by a
full year to Aug. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing growth
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake is deceptively small. Skiers and outdoor enthusiasts
from Atlanta, the Southeast and all over the world tend to think of
the city as larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's primarily because there are so many good-sized towns in
this county,'' said Russell Weeks, the city's public policy
analyst. ``Conversationally, people say Salt Lake's population is
around 200,000,'' Weeks said. ``But it's actually 172,800, and
that's with a recent growth spurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The city grew by some 20,000 in two years. That growth was
fueled by an economic boom that is slowing. But some city officials
see the flattened economy and the resultant drop in revenues as
something near a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Seed, in fact, says the economy, coupled with the Olympic
scandal and possible debt burden, constitutes ``the greatest crisis
perhaps in our city's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Thayne Robson, director of economic and business forecasting for
the business school at the University of Utah, agreed the economic
boom of the mid-'90s has slowed, but he said some people are
misreading the signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, '95 and '96, Utah was in the top one or two in the
nation in terms of economic growth. Right now, we may have slipped
to 11th, but we're still far ahead of the national average.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah's employment growth peaked at 6.2 percent in 1994 and
settled at 3 percent in 1997. The growth expected this year is 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there is a slowdown, and probably
more felt in Salt Lake City for the usual reasons,'' Robson said.
``It's a city with city problems. But there is more wealth and
business opportunities now than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Robson concludes opponents of the Olympics are overreacting to
the cooling of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just too much alarm,'' he said. ``The fact is, there is going
to be no shortfall, certainly not what they are talking about.
Certainly, some of the dishonesty is to be corrected. It is
appalling. But frankly, when the Games are here, the sponsors will
be, too, and nobody will be thinking about (the scandals).''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor DeeDee Corradini, who is leaving office after her term
expires and whose administration has been tainted by its own
scandals, said city planners need to think in more austere terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Seed said, ``but we have been lied to and
virtually ignored. We have problems that we have to address with
our present budget, and we have to draw the line. We can't be
responsible for the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   A lasting legacy
</P>
<P>
   Financial responsibility aside, many people here are looking at
the Olympics in terms of what's in it for the city. Not money or an
oval skating rink or a luge run, but a lasting legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we know that some of these facilities are going to be
used for decent and affordable housing after the Olympics?'' a
woman asked at a contentious public forum this week. ``Why isn't
some of this money being used to better the lives of the poor and
homeless?'' another shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pace, an Olympic critic and head of Utahans for
Responsible Spending, doesn't buy into the positive-spin answers to
these questions. He doesn't buy into the good of the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could fumigate the whole SLOC, and we'd have the same
thing all over again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, camera crews from around the world zoomed in on the
protest signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympics 2002. The Greatest Snowjob on Earth!''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Hilton, director of the Coalition of Religious
Communities, slammed the SLOC over her conclusion that the group
did not represent the Salt Lake populace accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the diversity? There are no low-income citizens (on
any) board. Why aren't all the SLOC members held to the same
standards as Welch and Johnson? And all these boards should be for
Utahans. If you don't live in Utah, you should leave the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch is Tom Welch, head of the bid committee who was fired
months ago over reports of spouse abuse and whose pension was ended
recently when the bribery and corruption probes picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is David Johnson, former vice president of SLOC, who was
asked to resign. He also might be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The SLOC ethics investigation is expected to be released on or
before Feb. 11. The IOC discusses its finding in Switzerland next
weekend. The Justice Department investigation might be finished in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welch has been lying to me for two years,'' Seed said. ``We
all heard rumors of scholarships for IOC members' families two
years ago. When I asked about it, Welch lied to me. I told
reporters about it, and all I got back was, `That's just that woman
raving about accountability again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that I didn't scream louder. However, now the ball is
in the IOC's court. That is just as corrupt. They have looked down
on us. Now we (should) tell them, `We don't grovel anymore. You
negotiate with us or take your Olympics somewhere else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Welch could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Seed, Pace and others here are cynical about the IOC
investigation. They want IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``His solution? Consolidate power in a small group of executive
members looking at themselves,'' Seed said. ``(That's) absurd.'' No
matter the outcome of the investigations, the sentiment here is
that they have planned a party and they might as well have one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Robson of the university is right. Maybe the snow and
show will come and the scandals will be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Seed, Pace and others will persuade the city to get
some sort of vote on a ballot next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a vote is the only fair way,'' music student Andrew
Moeller, 24, said. ``We have had no say in any of this, and we are
the ones humiliated. We need a vote.

 &HT;    Hendrick returns to shop with an emotional visit
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlotte, N.C. _ Rick Hendrick was back at his racing shop
Thursday for the first time in a year and the homecoming was the
emotional highlight of the week's NASCAR media tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick owns the No. 24 Chevrolet that Jeff Gordon has driven
to three Winston Cup points championships in four years, including
the past two. He has been under house arrest, the result of a mail
fraud indictment.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been battling leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   But he was back in the Hendrick Motor Sports shop Thursday,
tearing up as he recounted his medical treatment and what it meant
to him to be able to be around his championship team again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the leukemia that's whacking me right now, it's the
treatment,'' Hendrick said. ``Some days you don't want to get up,
but every morning the sun comes up I look forward to. Just being
here today is _ what's that word you use, Jeff? _ awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham said it was good to have
Hendrick back, to experience first-hand some of the joy the 24 car
has produced the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always spoke to Rick through the TV,'' Gordon said. ``It's
great for him to be back and really be a part of what we hope to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs likes Falcons
</P>
<P>
   At Joe Gibbs Racing, the team owner, a former head coach of the
Washington Redskins, was asked who he liked as a Super Bowl
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the NFC side, I've got a sentimental favorite,'' Gibbs
said. ``I love Dan Reeves and I've got several (former) assistant
coaches down there. To be quite truthful, when I watch them play,
they're about as close to the Redskins teams that I coached than
anything I've seen. They get after it. They've got a tough job,
though, going to Minnesota. I always bet with my heart, so never go
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes the Jets in the AFC championship but knows how
difficult winning at Denver can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year we were going to play at Denver in the opening
game,'' Gibbs recalled of his days as an assistant with the
Cardinals. ``Don Coryell said, `We're going to train for one whole
week in high altitude, then hopefully we'll play well.' We go to
Wyoming and the fifth night we're there he said this waiter that he
had looked like a runner. He said he was and that he trained in
high altitude. Don asks him `What have you found out about high
altitudes?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `Here's the way it works: in the first 48 hours, if
you go in and just have an activity, it's nothing. After 48 hours,
you start going downhill.' We'd just spent $100,000 to get
acclimated. Bottom line, we got shut out.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip's a Ford man
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1973, Darrell Waltrip will be driving a
Ford this season, the No. 66 Taurus for the newly formed
Haas-Carter Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   After shutting down his own team early last season, Waltrip
drove 13 races as substitute for the injured Steve Park in the No.
1 Chevrolet and finished the year in a terrible car. It appeared
his career was over. Then a few weeks ago, he struck a two-year
deal that enables him to have a farewell tour in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I was just waiting until they got the Taurus figured
out,'' he said, eluding to the car's rookie year in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is still so angry at the New York City
Council member Stephen DiBrienza that he seems willing to dislocate
any handy group to embarrass him. In the latest round of a
dispiriting political vendetta, the mayor wants to evict a senior
citizens' center and child-care facility in the Brooklyn
councilman's district _ and replace them with a homeless shelter.
The mayor cannot be accused of playing to the voters, since most
politicians would walk a mile to avoid offending senior citizens.
But displacing established community services simply to punish an
adversary is still a terrible policy.
</P>
<P>
   DiBrienza recently sponsored a bill putting restrictions on the
operation of city homeless shelters. When the council overrode a
mayoral veto of the bill, Giuliani announced that DiBrienza's
constituents would have to take responsibility for his actions by
accepting a shelter in their neighborhood. The only city-owned
building in the district that could be converted without a lengthy
review process was one on Baltic Street that housed a
state-sponsored mental health clinic, a senior center, child care
and other community services.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mental health clinic occupies most of the space, the
Giuliani administration announced that the state would have to move
it elsewhere. No one except the mayor seemed to think that
displacing 500 mentally ill outpatients from the clinic's longtime
location in Cobble Hill made any sense. Eventually Giuliani
backtracked and announced that the clinic could stay, but other
services in the building would have to leave to make way for the
homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   This would be less destructive than the mayor's original plan,
since the senior center and other facilities would have less
trouble relocating than the mental health clinic. But the city
should not be making policy on the basis of pique. There is no
pressing need for a new homeless shelter in New York. It is a good
idea to spread the burden of homeless care around the city, but
selecting sites as a punishment for crossing the mayor is
outrageous.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
   If Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is even fantasizing about presidential
politics, he already may have lost two key states in the last week.
New Jersey is miffed because New York City's mayor wants to create
a football dome in Manhattan to lure back the Jets. Virginia is
horrified because not only does he want to send its residents a lot
of the city's trash, he wants them to feel honored to take it.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of trash, some of which the mayor also wants to
send to New Jersey, his administrators have been explaining that
the city will be paying these areas a lot of money to take its
overripe leftovers. This is not a political putdown from the big
city, they maintain; it's business. It's interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Things might soon have settled down, particularly in Virginia,
as the Old Dominion began to realize it would not become Fresh
Kills South, a replacement for the mountainous landfill on Staten
Island that the city has promised to close by 2002. In poorer areas
of Virginia, where the city has proposed to send the contents of
its garbage barges, trash means money. Moreover, companies like
Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. and Waste Management Inc., big
garbage haulers that could have these contracts with New York City,
are solid contributors to many politicians in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's arguments clearly rankled. People in Virginia
and the rest of America beyond the Hudson enjoy the ``great
benefits'' that New York City provides as a cultural, financial and
tourist mecca, he said. Therefore, they should be willing to take
some of New York City's trash. ``A reciprocal relationship,'' the
mayor called it.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's governor and a number of its finest public servants
have been fuming and fulminating ever since. One legislator
attacked the mayor for his arrogance, not realizing of course that
Virginia's solemn insult has about as much sting as an air kiss in
New York's City Hall. Clearly, the mayor enjoys the banter.
Actually we all enjoy the banter, but if Giuliani is going to
offend every statehouse, we'll have to secede from this country.
Then where would we put the garbage?

 EDITORIAL OBSERVER: PLANNING A GARDEN IN THE SNOW 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Snow has been falling all day long as I write. The skylights are
drifted over, and by noon dusk seems to be in the offing, the day
so gray, so white, that the winter color of the goldfinches _ pale
as olive oil _ feels like an overdraft on the eyes. Some days
chores are barely that, just a visit to the barn and then back for
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But this morning the gates were deep in snow and the dutch doors
on the barn needed shoveling out, as did the deck and the path to
the woodpile. The horses dropped sweetfeed from their mouths,
staining the snow molasses. Three crows foraging beside the black
rubber feed pans seemed to stand watch over their shadows, except
that there are no shadows on a day like this. One horse had rolled
in a drift, leaving what looked like the wing-print of a giant owl
descending on its prey.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to the house, I stopped to clean out the winter
entrance to the beehive with my pocketknife. The beehive stands
beside a white steppe that will be a vegetable garden one of these
days _ perhaps not one of these days, with snow falling and more
promised, but one of those days, when April comes and the soil
seems impossibly black and fragrant once more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no better day to plan a garden than this one. The
landscape has a purity it will lose when the snow melts. The
geometry of each bed is perfect at this moment, even if hidden. The
snow radically simplifies all of a garden's dimensions _ height,
width, scent, length of bloom, and color in each season.
</P>
<P>
   One mail-order plant catalog is folded open to its pulmonarias.
Another is dog-eared where the hostas begin, and in another, from
North Carolina, I have carefully marked every plant that could grow
in this zone, while lamenting the crinums and kniphofias I can't
grow. ``Dirr's Hardy Trees and Shrubs'' lies open on the desk
beside Hugh Johnson's ``Principles of Gardening'' and ``The
National Arboretum Book of Outstanding Garden Plants,'' each one a
source of inspiration and depression.
</P>
<P>
   Latin names skim across my thoughts like water-boatmen on a
summer pond _ Tradescantia, Helleborus, Cryptomeria, Epimedium,
Cimcifuga. But by afternoon, designs have begun to tangle, and the
list of plants is far too long. The only sensible plan I can think
of is this one: I'll walk outside with a stick and draw my gardens
in the unadulterated whiteness, echinops here, ligularia over
there, a Japanese pieris by this corner. Then I'll sit by the fire
while the snow falls, watch them all disappear, and start over
again in the morning.

YOUNG VICTIM A SUSPECT IN FATAL FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAL VERDE, Calif. _ A 7-year-old who died days after his Val
Verde home in northern Los Angeles County was gutted by flames is
suspected of accidentally setting the fire that also killed his
teen-age brother, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and fire
investigators said they do not know how the fire started, they
believe that Patrick Crawford was the only one awake when the house
erupted in flames shortly after 8 a.m. Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   They have ruled out any accidental causes and have found no
signs that anyone other than family members was in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Battalion Chief Mike Sandeman said neighbors' statements
indicate that Patrick acted suspiciously after the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors told firefighters that Patrick, who jumped from a
second-story window, ran to a house next door and into the bathtub
to cool off. When he heard authorities were on their way, he ran to
a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the neighbors told him that the Fire Department was
coming, he went to hide,'' Sandeman said, adding that such behavior
is typical of children who feel they may have done something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Patrick's age strengthens firefighters' suspicions
that he might have been playing with matches or some other
incendiary device when flames ignited the family Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is of the fire-starting age, anywhere from 4 to 10,''
Sandeman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started in the living room, quickly spread to the tree
and then throughout the house. Patrick and his brother Sean
Williams, 17, suffered severe burns and died that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the fire began, however, remains undetermined since
no incendiary device was found, said Deputy Bob Killeen, a
spokesman for the Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff Department's two-week investigation ruled out
criminal activity, further confirming firefighters' suspicions.
There was no sign that any intruder had entered the home and the
doors were locked at the time of the fire, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sheriff's Detective Ed Nordskog returned to Val Verde
in the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles on Thursday to
confirm that an arsonist who has set small fires in the area was
not to blame for the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Although detectives have yet to interview one of the survivors,
Patricia Lynn Martin, they are not expecting significant new
information, Killeen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think that's going to yield too much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, Williams' 20-year-old friend who was living at the
house, suffered second- and third-degree burns over 18percent of
her body. She remains in critical condition in intensive care at
Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center and still cannot speak, said
hospital spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda.
</P>
<P>
   The other survivor was the boys' aunt, Dawn Carter, 45, who
suffered multiple fractures, including two broken ankles, when she
fell out of her second-story bedroom window during an attempt to
jump.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department investigators are conducting their own
investigation but are waiting to interview Martin before closing
the case, said arson investigator David Westfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's investigators would not confirm that Patrick set the
fire, but in a statement they wrote that ``only one person was
known to be awake at the time of the fire.'' Also, firefighters
said the boy was up when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Sandeman, the battalion chief, said Patrick told paramedics he
saw the family Christmas tree burning.

ARTHUR FATT, 94, GREY ADVERTISING CO-FOUNDER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur C. Fatt, one of the founders of Grey Advertising and a
former chief executive of the company, died Tuesday at his winter
home in Delray Beach, Fla. Fatt, whose main residence was in New
York City, was 94.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in failing health for nearly three years after
suffering a stroke, according to his secretary, Kathryn Fillmann.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Lawrence Valenstein, who died in 1982, Fatt
started Grey in 1925 with a handful of employees. By the time the
two of them retired _ Fatt in 1976 _ and passed on the reins to
others, it had become one of the country's leading advertising
agencies. Fatt maintained an office at the company into the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With billings of $7.8 billion last year, Grey Advertising, which
now has offices in 90 countries, some of them opened by Fatt, was
ranked by Advertising Age as the world's sixth-largest ad agency.
Its clients include Procter &AMP; Gamble, Time Warner, Sprint and
Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, Valenstein, then 18, borrowed $100 from his mother to
lease space on Fifth Avenue and start a direct mail advertising
company. The walls had been painted gray and, so the story goes, he
named his company Grey Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he placed an ad in The New York Times looking
for an office boy and Fatt, then 17 and just out of high school,
turned up. ``I liked his spirit,'' Valenstein said later, ``and
offered him the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatt never really saw himself as an office boy. Not long after
he was hired he suggested that the company replace the folders it
had been mailing out with a slick magazine. Valenstein hesitated.
But Fatt had a dummy issue. Valenstein liked it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Fatt was Valenstein's partner. With the money they made
from ads in the magazine, which they called ``Furs and Fashions,''
they expanded the company and in 1925 changed its name to Grey
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Fatt took to the road as the chief salesman while Valenstein
became the chief administrator. Fatt also wrote some of the copy,
including a well-received line for the Greyhound Lines bus company,
``Leave the driving to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatt, a native New Yorker, became president and chief executive
in 1956, succeeding his partner. From 1961 to 1970 he served as
chairman of the executive committee. In 1970, when Edward H. Meyer,
the current chairman and chief executive, took charge of the
company, Fatt was named founder-chairman, a largely advisory
position that he held for six years. Valenstein had been
founder-chairman from 1965 until 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Among the accounts that Fatt brought to Grey were the Ford Motor
Co., Procter &AMP; Gamble and Chock Full o' Nuts.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Fatt, who was an avid sailor, water skier and scuba
diver, had a home on the Spanish island of Majorca and often spent
the winter in Barbados. He entertained clients at both places.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a director of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies and the American Advertising Federation.
Fatt's marriage to Virginia Finder Gernsback ended in divorce in
1946. His second wife, Barbara Cappeau, died in 1992. He is
survived by two daughters, Barbara Costikyan and Marjorie Chester,
both of New York; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Valenstein and Fatt remained lifelong friends. In an joint
interview published in Grey's internal newsletter in 1982,
Valenstein said that ``men like Arthur Fatt have made life very
happy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatt added, ``Vice versa.''

HENRY COHEN, URBAN PLANNER   AND A NEW YORK CITY OFFICIAL , DIES AT
76 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: U.K., Germany ,  Mass., N.Y.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Cohen, an urban planner, a retired dean at the
New School for Social Research and a prominent New York City
official in the Wagner and Lindsay administrations, died Thursday
at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cohen served in the city government from 1950 to 1968. He
was the first deputy administrator and acting administrator of the
Human Resources Administration before he joined the New School
staff in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed a professor of urban affairs and became the
founding dean of what is now the Milano Graduate School of
Management and Urban Policy. He built the school into one of the
foremost teaching centers of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1968, he was the director and then dean of the
Center for New York City Affairs. The center was merged into the
Graduate School of Management and Urban Professions when it was
established in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen drew up innovative curriculums offering seven graduate
professional degree programs. He recruited a faculty that trained a
fresh generation of urban leaders and brought to life his concept
of what he called ``new urban professions.'' Among them were urban
policy analysis and management, human resources management, health
management and policy, and nonprofit management.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Cohen was born in Manhattan, graduated from City College
in 1942 and received a Master of City Planning at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1944. Toward the end of World War II, he
fought in the Army's Ninth Infantry Division through the Huertgen
Forest, the Battle of the Bulge and across the Rhine to occupied
Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with the postwar military government in Germany, then
did postgraduate studies at the University of Iowa and Columbia
University, taught urban sociology at City College and lectured at
the University of Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he joined the New York City government. He organized
the research division in the Department of City Planning and
directed it until 1955. He lectured on urban studies at Columbia's
School of General Studies and School of Social Work, and did
research for the New York Regional Plan Association.
</P>
<P>
   He was a deputy city administrator and senior management
consultant, simultaneously, in the office of Mayor John V. Lindsay.
He was appointed first deputy administrator and acting
administrator at Human Resources in 1967, the year before he moved
to the New School.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Cohen is survived by his wife of 50 years, Evelyn Fuhrman
Cohen; a daughter, Alison Rose Levy of Brooklyn; a son, Daniel, of
Needham, Mass.; a brother, Dr. Sidney Cohen of Manhattan; a sister,
Margaret Weisman of the Washington area, and two granddaughters.

 &HT;    Falcons: Ready to go
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Falcons arrived at this frozen tundra a little
late Friday night, but of sound mind and body and eager to get on
with Sunday's NFC Championship Game. ``We came here for one reason
and that's to win,'' linebacker Jesse Tuggle said. ``It's cold
here. We've got to get back South.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, Jamal Anderson, Chris Chandler and coach Dan Reeves
addressed the media, with each indicating that the Falcons are
qualified to knock off the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   But none was more adamant than Tuggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Minnesota has been hit like the Falcons will hit
them,'' he said. ``I know there's no way their offense can
intimidate our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Metrodome crowd, which has been enhanced by
ear-splitting sound effects, won't work, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key will be our ability to handle adverse conditions,''
Reeves said. ``I'd be surprised if we don't handle it well because
we practiced it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said the giant speakers the Falcons used to simulate
the Metrodome crowd noise was ``so loud we could hardly hear in the
huddle. Communication's the key. The noise will be louder than any
we've ever heard. But it's still a football game. We have to make
sure the crowd gets quieter as the game goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely to happen, what with the sound effects. Reeves
asked the NFL office about the legitimacy of such noise, but he
said he had not heard back from league authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the noise is legitimate or not,'' Minnesota
coach Dennis Green said. ``No matter what the speakers do, it's
going to be loud. It's noisy not because of the speakers, but
because of 64,400 fans.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be many Falcon diehards among the sellout throng.
But the Falcons promise to be as emotionally charged as they've
ever been. ``The great neutralizer will be that we're in the
Metrodome and not the Georgia Dome,'' Anderson said. ``But there's
certainly pressure (on the offense) to score every time we have the
ball. We have to bring our A games.

 &HT;    Young defends '96 bid actions
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and Gary M. Pomerantz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the expanding Salt Lake City controversy over
alleged Olympic payoffs continued to rage Friday, Andrew Young
stressed that humanitarianism, not bribery, motivated Atlanta's
assistance to Third World athletes and Olympic officials _ before
and after the city won the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are expected to help people in need in the Olympic family,
particularly if you come from a rich country such as this,'' Young
said. The former Atlanta mayor and United Nations ambassador worked
with lawyer Billy Payne to mastermind Atlanta's winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has asked 13 of its members to explain their actions in
dealing with the bid committees in Salt Lake and other cities. IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch has said that nine cases possibly
are serious enough to lead to expulsion. The members have until
Tuesday to respond, and the IOC executive board will recommend
action Jan. 24, with suspect members facing expulsion at an
emergency IOC meeting called Friday for mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we bid (in 1990), people wanted us to help,'' Young said
early Friday morning in his first extensive interview since the
Salt Lake scandal broke. ``And you can't have an operation that
makes that much money and have poor people with nothing and them
not ask for help.''
</P>
<P>
   After the president of Mozambique mentioned in 1991 that his
country's runners weren't getting enough protein, Young said he
helped to organize a massive shipment of food and protein that was
paid for by U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, when David Sikhulumi Sibandze, an IOC
member from Swaziland, became ill on a visit to Atlanta during the
bid process, Young said, ``We sent him to a doctor.''Atlanta bid
officials have acknowledged that Sibandze received free hospital
tests after he complained of chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he believes that Sibandze ultimately did not vote for
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never did anything for anybody in a humanitarian way
related to the Olympics that we hadn't done anyway and that we
wouldn't do if the Olympics weren't involved,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   Personal contact with IOC members was a much more important
factor in securing the '96 Games for Atlanta, Young said. ``We
visited every IOC delegate with the exception of North Korea,
Mongolia and Libya. We made personal calls to them and asked for
the vote. Everybody felt important.``
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta's winning bid, Young said, ``Absolutely no money
changed hands''in violation of Olympic rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised money, we raised it openly, we discussed it
publicly,''he said. ``It's inconceivable to me that Atlanta
(dealings), prior to the bid, could be conceived as a bribe to get
the Olympics.``
</P>
<P>
   Young currently serves as chairman of the Southern African
Development Enterprise Fund. He was appointed in 1994 by President
Clinton to lead the $100 million fund, aimed at providing capital
to entrepreneurs and small businesses in 11 African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Though still maintaining a home in Atlanta, he spends much of
his time in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Young served as an unpaid adviser to Salt Lake's successful bid
for the 2002 Winter Games. He made introductions to IOC members,
and spoke informally in support of Salt Lake's bid. Young stressed
that no Olympic Games can be bought through bribery as long as IOC
delegates continue to cast secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
   What some have characterized as ``bribes''in the Salt Lake bid
process, others have seen as a natural fact of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC operates in a very complex world, and to hold that
complex world judgmentally to U.S. press standards ... is just not
kosher,''Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to judge with a sense of understanding. Now, that
doesn't mean you have to tolerate corruption. But it means you have
to define it precisely for people in advance.``
</P>
<P>
   Young suggested that another word be added to the controversy _
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got some rich old Europeans who ran (the Olympics) as
an old-boys club _ and it was the same thing with FIFA (the world
governing body for soccer) _ and you've seen a tremendous reform as
these movements become globalized,''Young said. ``They are no
longer European-controlled. A lot of the old boys are resenting the
sharing of power and authority (with third-world nations).``
</P>
<P>
   Young cautioned against stereotyping poor African and Latin
nations, which have been the focus of the Salt Lake situation and
misplacing blame. ``We don't want to make a scapegoat of the poor
and think that the IOC is pure,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any major corruption, you have to look where the
money is,''Young said. ``The money is not in scholarships. The
money is not in skis. The money is in these billion-dollar
television contracts and the technical contracts that change hands
every so often. None of these guys (alleged to have accepted
bribes) have anything to do with that.``
</P>
<P>
   However, no matter the outcome of the Salt Lake scandal, he
said, ``There will be an Olympic movement carrying on.... It's too
valuable a resource to let a lot of foolishness and jealousy
destroy.``
</P>
<P>
   Young added, ``The ideal is the athletes _ not the people
organizing it.

 &HT;    Young: Atlanta did nothing improper
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Excerpts from Friday's interview with Andrew Young:
</P>
<P>
   _ On whether Atlanta made payoffs or bribes to IOC members:
``Nothing happened in Atlanta. I mean, nothing happened of (an
improper) financial way in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the Atlanta Games: ``We were probably the most humanitarian
Olympics ever, and we were charged with being the most
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the lifestyles of IOC members from Africa: ``I know two or
three IOC members whose homes have been wiped out completely
because they live in destabilized conditions. I think it's
unfortunate (for) the people who are living with royal privileges
to cast aspersions on people who have been bombed out of their
homes, who have been driven into exile, who have lived through
terribly destabilizing times and tried to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the distinction between ``bribery'' and ``doing business''
in an Olympic-bid process: ``I think you need to put another
category on there _ bribery, doing business and 'humanitarian
assistance.' I would put almost everything _ well, I don't know
about credit cards for sex and all of that. When you start dealing
in those kinds of rumors, I can't imagine anybody on the IOC that's
able to engage (in sex). They are too old and broken down. I mean,
you would have had more heart transplants.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch's accountability for
the current controversy: ``Samaranch should be praised to the high
heaven for rescuing the Olympic movement from poverty. (But) that
doesn't say that he has rescued it from all of its sins. (When) he
took over in '80, he took over the Olympic movement when it was at
its lowest point. He got them, without help, on a solid, secure
financial footing.''

NO KANDI FOR VALENTINE'S DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By RANDY HILL &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers had hoped a little scheduling luck
could supply ``Kandi'' by Valentine's Day, but potentially sweet
developments usually find bitter reality for this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi, the team and league's top draftee, has a
breakaway clause in his contract with Kinder Bologna of the Euro
League that allows him to hustle back to the NBA on Feb. 15.
Earlier this week, the Clippers were under the impression that Feb.
11 was Kinder's last game before Olowokandi's escape date.
Following a hopeful progression, it wouldn't seem unreasonable for
the Clippers to encourage a quicker return for Olowokandi than his
agent had negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Bill Duffy, Olowokandi's deal maker, that won't
happen. His client's last game is only two days before the original
departure date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure it's the 13th,'' said Duffy, who confirmed
that Olowokandi won't leave Italy for life with the Clippers until
the 15th.
</P>
<P>
   But there is
</P>
<P>
   good news, provided by the painstaking process of producing the
fine print in the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. The
pace has delayed the opening of training camp (Tuesday) and may
cause the season to start later than the prescribed resurrection
date of Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the plan all along,'' Duffy said. ``Before we made
the (Kinder) deal, I thought that if the NBA did have a season, it
would be difficult to get started by the 15th.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Clippers and Olowokandi may not be apart for much more
than a week. The 7-foot-1 center will miss training camp, but
should report to the NBA in close to peak fitness.
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) A bunch of Bologna
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press report from Italy this week indicated that
Olowokandi's game may not be shaping up as quickly as anticipated.
The former University of Pacific star had just six points and seven
rebounds in his third game for Kinder, but Duffy said the report
was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing fine,'' said Duffy. ``He picked up some fouls in
the last game and didn't play much, but in the first two, he had 14
points and nine rebounds, then 14 points and 13 rebounds in limited
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happy, I'm happy; I think it's worked out fine. People
have to understand that he's not going to just come in here (NBA)
and kick butt immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   (subhd) Reporting for duty
</P>
<P>
   Day Five of the team's optional workouts in Carson encouraged
most Clippers to exercise the option of not showing up. But one of
three who did, and for the first time this week, was Lamond Murray,
the fifth-year forward from Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Is Murray, who averaged 15.4 points and 6.1 rebounds last
season, excited about getting started?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' said Murray, who appeared to be in a bit of a
joking mood after shooting 3-pointers with teammate Eric Piatkowski
at the Veterans Park Sports Complex. ``It means we're in for a lot
of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for not showing up earlier in week, Murray said, ``I felt
like we really aren't going to get started until next week anyway
... But it's good to be here and see some of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The third guy who showed up was center Stojko Vrankovic.

THEO HIOS, PAINTER AND TEACHER, DIES AT 90 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Greece, Conn.)   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Theo Hios, a New York painter and teacher, died on
Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital here. He was 90 and had
homes in Manhattan and Hampton Bays, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   During his six-decade painting career, his style occasionally
turned abstract, but he mostly hewed to expressive portraits and
especially visionary views of nature that were sometimes
reminiscent of Marsden Hartley. These landscapes often resembled
the canyons and precipices around Tripi, the small Greek village
where he was born in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, after becoming disenchanted with law studies, Hios
followed his father and a brother to New York, where he scraped
together a living working mostly in restaurants. In 1934 he
enrolled in a Works Progress Administration art class in a public
school and by 1937 was a working member of the WPA. As a member of
the Artists' Union, he had his first public showing with that
organization in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Hios enlisted in the Marine Corps and was
made a combat photographer, serving in the Pacific. After the war
he studied at the Art Students League with Morris Kantor and Vaclav
Vytlacil. He had his first solo show in New York at the
Contemporary Arts Gallery in 1947. That year he married Catherine
Lekakis, a ceramist who was also Greek and a sister of the sculptor
Michael Lekakis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he and his wife bought a brownstone on a crime-ridden
block in of Manhattan. Rallying his neighbors, Hios helped found
the 100 West 95th Street Block Association, serving as its
president for eight years. It became a model for similar
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   From 1963 until his retirement in 1994 Hios taught at the New
School for Social Research, where he also had five solo shows. His
most recent exhibition, a 57-year survey, was held last year at the
Susan Teller Gallery in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Hios is survived by a brother, Themis,
of Greenwich, Conn.

BROADCASTING ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La, Miss, N.J.) SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE ON BAN OF CASINOS(rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether
the federal government can continue to ban broadcast advertising by
gambling casinos. The case raises an important issue of commercial
speech with implications for government regulations on advertising
for other lawful but disfavored activities like smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1934, federal law and Federal Communications Commission
regulations have prohibited broadcasters from carrying advertising
for gambling. The ban has been whittled down by a series of
legislative exceptions: In 1975, Congress permitted some broadcast
advertising of state-run lotteries, followed by other exceptions
for casinos run by Indian tribes and for games of chance sponsored
by non-profit groups for charitable purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But the ban on advertising by traditional, non-Indian casinos,
now legal in 22 states, has remained on the books. The case the
court accepted Friday was an appeal by an organization of radio and
television broadcasters in the New Orleans area, which want the
right to sell advertising time to casinos in Louisiana and
Mississippi. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans,
upheld the ban in a 2-1 decision in July.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, after noting that recent Supreme Court
precedents on commercial speech were confusing and inconsistent,
said that the ban permissibly reflected the view of Congress that
casino gambling was to be discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``simply targets the powerful sensory appeal of gambling
conveyed by television and radio, which are also the most intrusive
advertising media, and the most readily available to children,''
Judge Edith H. Jones wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been defending the ban in federal
courts around the country, with mixed success. The 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, which covers California, Nevada
and seven other Western states, struck it down in a 1997 decision
that the justices refused to review. Also in 1997, a U.S. District
Court in New Jersey declared the law unconstitutional in a suit
brought by the National Association of Broadcasters, several casino
companies, and others. That case is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had asked the Supreme Court to take the New
Jersey case, rather than the New Orleans appeal, even though the
New Jersey case has not yet been ruled on by an appellate court.
The New Jersey case, U.S. vs. Players International, No. 98-721,
contained a stronger evidentiary record on the social and economic
ills associated with casino gambling, Solicitor General Seth P.
Waxman told the justices in his unusual request for an accelerated
review, which the court turned down earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal in the New Orleans case, Greater New Orleans
Broadcasting Association vs. U.S., No. 98-387, the broadcasters
told the court that the growing split in judicial opinion around
the country was intolerable. ``There is only one First Amendment,''
they said. ``It is based on principles, not on geography, and it
applies to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief continued: ``Chief among the principles that underlie
the First Amendment is a conviction that the government of a free
people cannot suppress ideas or information solely on the basis of
a paternalistic belief that they concern matters the government
deems undesirable.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters' argument relies heavily on a 1996 Supreme
Court decision that struck down a Rhode Island law prohibiting the
inclusion of prices in advertisements for liquor. The state
defended the law on the ground that price advertising encouraged
competitive discounting and had the unfortunate effect of
increasing liquor consumption, a rationale the court rejected as
constitutionally inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Although all nine justices agreed with the result in that case,
44 Liquormart vs. Rhode Island, there was no majority opinion for
the court. The outcome demonstrated that the court's
commercial-speech doctrine is very much in flux, with the Justices
disagreeing over where to place advertising and other commercial
speech in the spectrum of First Amendment values. Traditionally, it
has held a lower place, but the court has not necessarily said its
last word on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the government would seem to have an uphill battle
in justifying the casino prohibition, especially in light of the
many exceptions that have left the airwaves saturated with lottery
and other gambling advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The area of commercial speech is being monitored closely as part
of the ongoing debate over government regulation of smoking, with
several cases in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal district judge in Manhattan, Deborah A.
Batts, struck down a New York City law that would have sharply
limited cigarette advertising in stores and banned it from doors,
awnings, and windows. Stores would have been limited to a single
generic advertisement, reading ``tobacco products sold here'' in
small black letters. The decision was based not on the First
Amendment but on the ground that federal law pre-empted the local
regulation.

BRAZIL'S CURRENCY DECISION BOOSTS STOCKS WORLDWIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ World stock markets soared Friday as traders saw in
Brazil's decision to stop defending its currency an end to the
uncertainty that has recently clouded the global investment
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being at least, investors returned to stocks and
pulled money away from havens, like U.S. Treasury bonds, where they
had sought shelter in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   South American markets soared, led by a 34 percent jump in
Brazil's Bovespa stock index, and European markets also gained.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Wall Street started a three-day weekend
with a positively giddy response to Brazil's new currency regime.
After four straight days of losses, the Dow Jones industrial
average gained 219.62 points Friday, or 2.4 percent, to 9,340.55.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term Treasury bonds fell nearly a point as traders moved
back into stocks, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up
to 5.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's gains were not enough, however, to allow
either the Dow industrials or the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
to recoup all the week's losses. The S&AMP;P index rose 31.07 Friday,
or 2.6 percent, to 1,243.26.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dow and S&AMP;P indexes finished the week lower than they
began, putting gains for the year between 1 percent and 2 percent.
And economists and investment managers say they expect that further
trouble in Brazil's economy is likely to find its way into the
earnings of U.S. companies by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the calm before the storm,'' said John Kim,
chief investment officer of Aeltus Investment Management, a unit of
Aetna Retirement Services. ``I think there will be more bad news
before any good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, meanwhile, proved to be one of the safest
havens of all.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Nasdaq composite index tacked on 71.38, or 3.1
percent, to 2,348.20. In the first two weeks of 1999, the Nasdaq
index, which rose nearly 40 percent last year, gained more than 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traders on Wall Street typically exhibit one of two moods:
despair or euphoria, and frequently switch between them several
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   But for four days the mood was mostly gloomy, as Brazil's
economic crisis threatened to sink the earnings momentum of big
U.S. companies that do business overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In early trading, the price of futures contracts on the S&AMP;P 500
index, which traders use as a gauge of how the day will proceed,
fell precipitously, losing another 2 percent of their value in the
30 minutes after trading began at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shortly after 7:30 a.m., the world changed. Reports
flooded the news services that Brazil's currency had already
declined about 9 percent, out of the range set Thursday by the
nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, futures prices rose tentatively, then soared
shortly after 8 a.m., when Brazil announced that it would allow the
real to float freely, at least until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To traders, the good news was in the Brazilian government's
decision to use its reserves to deal with the economic impact of
devaluation rather than slowly bleed them as investors withdrew
capital from the country.
</P>
<P>
   So when the New York Stock Exchange and other U.S. markets
opened at 9:30 a.m., stock prices raced higher.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. companies with the most at stake in Brazil _ banks with
big loans to the country, and manufacturers of automobiles and
heavy equipment with operations in South America _ retraced some of
their recent losses.
</P>
<P>
   American Express gained 8], to 104], while J.P. Morgan rose 6},
to 108}. Ford Motor rose 1|, to 62, and Caterpillar climbed 1[, to
47 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   However euphoric traders were in the short term, economists and
market analysts warned that Brazil's problems were far from over.
If a slowly dying Brazilian currency was bad for investors, it was
understandable that a swiftly eviscerated one might be worse.
</P>
<P>
   With the devaluation, ``growth in Brazil will be much smaller
than it would be otherwise,'' said Art Steinmetz, portfolio manager
of the $8 billion Oppenheimer Strategic Income fund, which invests
in global bond markets. He expects a 4 to 5 percent contraction in
the Brazilian economy this year, about twice the size of the
downturn he previously expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly that will affect the region, which will have an
effect on the hemisphere, which will eventually show up in the
world's growth,'' Steinmetz said. ``Should we be rallying stocks
and selling Treasuries in that situation? I don't think so. I think
the markets are being a little short-sighted today.''
</P>
<P>
   A recession in Brazil that is deepened by the weakened currency
is more likely to spill over to other South American countries, if
not to Mexico, economists said. The further north the effects of
the crisis creep, the more likely that U.S. companies could feel
the effect of that slowdown later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kim of Aeltus said he expected an economic slowdown across
Central and South America that will eat into economic growth here,
slowing America's gross domestic product gains this year to 2
percent from a previously forecast 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said that the
direct trade impact on the United States of the Brazilian slowdown
would be relatively small. But, he added, the effect on the
earnings of U.S. companies could be more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before all the emerging market crises, 30 percent of U.S.
corporate earnings came from outside the United States,'' Steinberg
said. ``Now the U.S. stands alone as the colossus of the world
economy. We are strong, and the rest of the world has negligible or
negative growth. As more and more pieces of the map fall off, at
some point later in the year we've got to slow down in reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, saw no such problem. Speaking at a conference
in San Jose, Calif., Abby Joseph Cohen, the investment strategist
at Goldman, Sachs, said she was ``still bullish'' on the stock
market, according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next several weeks we will introduce our forecast for
2000 and at this point I do not expect there to be any significant
problems developing either in terms of growth, inflation or
interest rates,'' Ms. Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly few investors appeared to believe that many problems
lie ahead for companies in the technology industry, which has taken
the lead as the market's bellwether industry group and whose
prospects seem to have no limits.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of almost all of the largest technology stocks were
higher Friday: Cisco Systems gained 5 5/16, to 101 11/16; Microsoft
rose 8, to 149}; Compaq Computer jumped 2 1/16, to 46|, and Sun
Microsystems rose 5 15/16, to 100 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of some of the larger Internet companies also gained,
with Amazon.com rising 2], to 140], and America Online moving ahead
2, to 146{. But Yahoo fell 26 15/16, to 317, cutting the stock's
gain in the first two weeks of the year to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   None matched the stunning debut of Marketwatch.com, however,
which made its initial public offering Friday. Those lucky enough
to get shares in the offering paid $17, but the shares started
trading at 90 and finished the day up 80{, to 97{.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Data Broadcasting, which owned half of Marketwatch.com
before the offering, fell 9 7/16, to 21}, retracing some of the
gains it had made as traders anticipated Friday's stock sale. CBS,
which owned the other half of Marketwatch.com, rose 13/16, to 34
15/16.

 &HT;    Callaway Gardens cultivates largest azalea collection in world,
expanding paths for experiencing nature
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ The buds are wound as tightly as ballpoint
pens, yet packed with the promise of color, of warmth, of
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 50 years, azaleas, the harbingers of spring, have
been the major draw for visitors to Callaway Gardens, the
2,500-acre oasis of natural beauty north of Columbus. Cason and
Virginia Callaway knew when they opened the gardens in 1952 that
the region's wild, deciduous azaleas wouldn't hold a candle to the
Orient's evergreen exotic ones, with their bright pink, purple, red
and white blossoms. So, like most home gardeners, they planted a
yard full of the cultivated varieties to ensure a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother called them `store-bought azaleas' because they weren't
natives. They are much more spectacular than the natives,'' said
Howard ``Bo'' Callaway, son of the gardens' late founders and
chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his parents, the ultimate nature lovers, also wanted
visitors to experience the site as they had, in its wild state. So
Callaway, the site of next weekend's 13th annual Southern Gardening
Symposium, has expanded its Azalea Trail to include not only more
exotics but also the less familiar natives. The new 40-acre Azalea
Bowl, to be dedicated in March, is believed to be the world's
largest collection of its kind, said Bill Barrick, Callaway's
director and executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest of several extensive changes under way at
Callaway. Next year, a new entrance will take visitors along an
alternate route, one designed to encourage touring the garden on
foot, on bike or by boat instead of the traditional means, by car.
The $12 million project, which includes a spacious educational
center, is a step toward eventually accessing Callaway's
surrounding 12,000 acres of undeveloped woodlands so visitors can
experience not only flora but fauna in its native habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Callaway is undergoing the most changes it's seen since
opening,'' Barrick said. ``The draw will always be the gardens, but
our intent is to operate much like a national park.''
</P>
<P>
   A former textile leader, Cason Callaway didn't buy what once was
a family weekend retreat and just build
</P>
<P>
   a road through it. ``He was a steward of the land long before it
became proper,'' Barrick said. ``He was interested in soil
conservation being a farmer and wanted to show how you could
restore the land and make it beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cason Callaway's interests took on many forms. Consequently, his
garden has become a leading botanical center and championship golf
resort. Its Sibley Horticultural Center is a state-of-the-art
facility for seasonal plant displays. Its Day Butterfly Center is
the largest free-flight conservatory in North America. Mr. Cason's
Vegetable Garden is a taping site for PBS' ``The Victory Garden''
series. And its Festival of Lights is a seasonal mecca, drawing up
to 12,000 each December.
</P>
<P>
   But its the simple trails meandering Callaway's extensive
collection of native and cultivated azaleas that lures visitors
back year after year.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful blooms are as much a part of the South as hoop
skirts and wide verandas. But the azalea-- that makes visitors ooh
and ahh for a few short weeks every April actually is a foreigner _
an evergreen from Japan. The Callaways blanketed a hollow in their
gardens with more than 700 varieties of exotic azaleas that ignite
the woods in a spectacular blaze. Some 16 species of the airy,
fragrant native varieties, including a rare summer-flowering
plumleaf with reddish-orange blossoms, are scattered throughout the
woodlands and its trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us here like the wild flowers better in the sense that
they represent the area,'' Bo Callaway said.
</P>
<P>
   So last fall, the gardens increased its collection, which now
covers 40 acres, to incorporate more native plants. The $3.5
million gift from Ely Callaway, whose father was a half-brother to
Cason Callaway's, includes many azaleas propagated from the
original plants as well as thousands of perennials and ferns,
waterfalls and architectural features. ``This is more of a
strolling garden now, so people should enjoy it even when it's not
in bloom,'' Barrick said.
</P>
<P>
   And strolling is uppermost in management's mind these days.
</P>
<P>
   More than two miles of new entry roads have been built and will
open Feb. 22, 2000 _ the centennial of Virginia Callaway's birth _
from an entrance on the gardens' east side off Ga. 18. It will
replace the main entrance to the south along U.S. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The shift will enable visitors to experience more of the gardens
along the 5-mile road circling Mountain Creek Lake, which forces
most visitors to drive from point to point. The new road will take
them directly to the Virginia Hand Callaway Discovery Center, where
they can learn about Callaway in an exhibit hall before setting out
to explore. ``We're very much trying to encourage walking,''
Callaway said. ``People are wed to their cars, and in a car you
just can't see that much. We think walking will give them a much
better experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars still will be allowed, but bikes, trolleys and boats will
be encouraged. To accommodate the increased traffic, Callaway plans
to double its number of roads and trails.
</P>
<P>
   For Anna Marie Klimovich, the only way to take in Mr. Cason's
Vegetable Garden on a brisk December day was to get up close and
personal. ``I had to come out and see this place because 'The
Victory Garden' show has been a staple with us,'' said the Hazlet,
N.J., resident. ``We learned how to make compost from the show.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, South Carolina landscape architect Robert
Marvin developed a master plan for Callaway with vehicle traffic in
mind. But that was long before attendance topped 1 million
annually, divided equally among the gardens, the resort and the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Virginia Callaway would like what's happening there,''
Marvin said. ``When we did the master plan, we realized eventually
there would be this need for a new entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Callaway had long eyed its untapped woodlands as
the next frontier for giving urban dwellers, including Atlantans
one hour to the north, the chance to enjoy the sights, sounds and
smells of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole thing is to show man's relationship with nature,''
Callaway said, and that includes extending trails where visitors
can encounter native wildlife, such as river otters, wild turkey,
deer and quail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families will be able to take walks, listen to birds and see
their wild habitats, to camp where they're not right next to a
neighbor, to be out of sight and hearing distance of man _ a place
where you can look up and see the stars so clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the development, Cason and Virginia Callaway's vision
for Pine Mountain remains as clear as it was a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No garden is ever complete,'' Barrick said. ``But we don't
ever want to get to the point that the inspirational message is
compromised.''

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 17
 &HT;    Women urged to get more folic acid
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What is folic acid?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it important during pregnancy?
</P>
<P>
   What foods contain it?
</P>
<P>
   These questions stumped many low-income pregnant women in
Atlanta during a survey conducted by Grady Health System chief
nutritionist Amy Kloeblen, whose study appeared in this month's
Journal of the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   This worries health officials because folic acid is crucial in
preventing spina bifida and other spinal and brain birth defects,
known as neural tube defects.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 pregnancies in the United States every year are
affected by neural tube defects, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2,400 babies are born with major defects, such as spina
bifida, which can cause paralysis, mental retardation, and a fatal
condition called anencephaly (incomplete formation of the brain).
In Georgia, 292 babies were born with spina bifida and anencephaly
between 1990 and 1996, state statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 percent to 70 percent of these defects could be
prevented if women consumed adequate daily amounts of folic acid in
their diet or through vitamin supplements, the CDC estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Folate is a B vitamin naturally found in leafy green vegetables,
citrus fruits and other foods. It is also called folic acid when
synthetically added to vitamins and food. In an effort to reduce
birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration required folic acid
additives in a wide variety of food, beginning last January. Flour,
bread, rolls, pasta, rice and cereal are among the fortified foods
on grocery shelves. If the label says ``enriched flour,'' the
product contains folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   However, women of childbearing age still may not be getting
enough folate when they need it most _ during the first weeks of
pregnancy. The spinal cord of a fetus forms 16 to 25 days after
conception. That's why doctors recommend that all women capable of
getting pregnant be getting adequate folic acid all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since at least half of all pregnancies in this country are
unplanned, and neural tube defects occur before most women know
they're pregnant, every woman needs folic acid during her
childbearing years,'' said Elizabeth Ward, American Dietetic
Association spokeswoman, and a Boston dietitian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really too late, the damage may have already been done,
by the time most women realize they are pregnant,''said Dr. Paul
Fernhoff, associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University's
division of medical genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Women should consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid
daily. But most women get only half of that amount, said Dr. Joe
Mulinare, acting chief of CDC's Prevention and Health
Communications Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Even consuming foods bolstered with folic acid may not be enough
unless several portions are eaten. Every serving of bread or
cereal, for instance, supplies about 40 to 100 micrograms of folic
acid. That's why many doctors advise taking one multi-vitamin every
day that contains 400 mcg of folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   While the women surveyed in the Grady study may not have been
savvy about folate or which foods contained it, 80 percent of them
were getting enough of it through their diet anyway, said
researcher Kloeblen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population eats lots of grain products because it's less
expensive,'' she said. ``They are not motivated to spend money on
multivitamins or prenatal supplements if they're worrying about
where their next meal is coming from.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT CITY _ Oil, for so long the source of so much easy
wealth, is now fueling hard questions along the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that its price, in real terms, has plummeted to
levels not seen since the mid-1970s. Nor is the concern limited to
the fact that the Saudis and other producers, so adept at
muscle-flexing in the past, have failed dismally to push prices
higher.
</P>
<P>
   What lies behind the bleak numbers is a gnawing sense of
vulnerability. For a quarter century, oil has allowed the gulf
states a self-sufficiency and political leverage far in excess of
what comparably sized countries could hope to achieve, and has
formed a dependable pillar of legitimacy for the region's six
monarchies.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after years of declining oil prices, the monarchies _
which depend on oil for three-quarters of their incomes _ have
watched revenues plunge by 30 percent in a year, a loss of $25
billion. And there is no rebound in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the arithmetic of big budgets and big spending no
longer adds up, and the situation looks so gloomy that Crown Prince
Abdullah of Saudi Arabia warned starkly in December, ``The boom
days are over, and they will not come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The reversal has led even politicians to recommend adjustments _
belt-tightening, borrowing or inviting foreigners to help _ steps
that would end the old ways of showering citizens with beneficence
while keeping outsiders at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   In countries already prone to domestic discontent, and with fast
growing populations of young people schooled in a sense of
entitlement, all those options carry the risks of instability and
of accusations that past riches have been squandered.
</P>
<P>
   As Ahmed al-Thani, 19, a Kuwaiti, put it, ``With all our oil,
why should life be harder for us than it was for our parents?''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the six monarchies control nearly half the known oil
reserves, and their exports account for 10 percent of the current
supply. Even now, a sense of economic woe is not immediately
apparent in places like Kuwait, where the signs of wealth so
visibly on display include the brand new Corvettes and BMWs that
teen-agers race up and down the seafront corniche.
</P>
<P>
   But the depth of the new strain can be measured on balance
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   In each monarchy, emergency measures announced last summer cut
government spending, by as much as 20 percent. But nowhere has that
been enough to close yawning budget gaps. With a 55-gallon barrel
of crude oil selling for about $12, about half of what it was a
year ago, the cost to governments of providing the lifetime jobs,
low-cost housing and other subsidies has soared well beyond what
they can earn.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, with just over 2 million people, the budget gap is
expected to reach $8 billion, more than all the revenues the
country will take in from oil. In Saudi Arabia, where the crisis
seems to be the worst, the deficit is expected to be $15 billion,
and has already forced the national oil company to borrow abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Qatar, Bahrain and Oman have also been pinched, as has the
United Arab Emirates, an oil and commercial giant regarded as the
most resilient economy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to stave off a deeper crisis, governments are
scrambling to cut spending further. Even Saudi Arabia, the world's
biggest oil exporter, is trying to prepare the ground for tougher
times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In an address in December, Prince Abdullah told fellow gulf
leaders meeting in Abu Dhabi that their people ``must get used to a
new way of life that is not based on total dependence on the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gulf leaders have begun to echo Prince Abdullah. To try to
gain control over bloated government payrolls, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE have tried to steer citizens toward more demanding and less
lucrative private-sector jobs most often performed by foreign
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait has introduced legislation to promote privatization and
to ease obstacles to foreign investment. The Saudis and others are
also signaling a new willingness to court foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   But big obstacles stand in the way of change. Few industries
apart from energy have demonstrated much potential for profit. And
past successes mean that oil is now seen as so central that it
could be difficult, if not impossible, for gulf countries to lure
investment in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States in September, Prince Abdullah even met with
chairmen of the biggest oil companies, dangling the prospect of a
new role in the Saudi energy industry, which like most across the
region was nationalized more than two decades ago. Then, in the
heady days of oil embargoes and seemingly limitless cash, the
foreign companies that had built the oil fields in the gulf region
were driven out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the long decline in oil prices include a supply
glut, brought on largely by new finds outside the Middle East.
Advances in technology have allowed producers in the North Sea,
Central Asia and West Africa to gain an increasing share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year a number of passing factors, including a drop
in Asian demand, have cut into prices further. And the prospect
that ostracized Iraq, with the third-largest reserves, may one day
resume full production has only added to the headaches.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, governments in the gulf have continued to
behave as they did when oil was king. Even now in Kuwait, for
example, most citizens who work are employed by the government, and
the staggering costs of the salaries and subsidies account for the
vast bulk of the government budget.
</P>
<P>
   For citizens and even foreign workers, health care is free. The
price of electricity is a small faction of what it costs to
produce. Upon marriage, citizens become eligible for a $230,000
interest-free housing loan.
</P>
<P>
   And in one way or another, despite the talk of privatization,
governments remain the dominant force. That means cuts in spending,
like those rushed into effect last year, quickly translate into a
broad economic slowdown and a crisis of confidence like one in
Kuwait, where stock prices have fell 40 percent since July.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, gulf governments have used their oil income as an
excuse for inaction,'' said Henry Azzam, managing director and
chief economist of the Middle East Capital Group, an investment
bank based in Beirut, Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Most private forecasters say oil prices will remain low at least
at least through 1999. After the failure of their own efforts to
push prices up, that view also seems to have taken hold among gulf
governments.
</P>
<P>
   But private economists worry that rather than make hard choices,
governments will dither. ``What we are telling the government is
that it must act now,'' said Rabah al-Rabah, a top official of the
Kuwait Chamber of Commerce. ``Otherwise, if there is delay, there
will eventually be no other choice but to cut to the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the options for are unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest is to draw on foreign reserves. Kuwait, which has
not taken that step since the Persian Gulf war in 1991, has already
asked parliament for permission to do so. But such a step risks
adding to public uneasiness: the reserves in Kuwait are known as
the Fund for Future Generations.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to borrow, a step that Saudi Arabia has said it
intends to take. But that could leave gulf countries even more
strapped, and if it meant turning to foreign banks, it could
require a degree of outside scrutiny with which the monarchies have
never been comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A better course, economists say, would be for governments to
seek foreign investment to revitalize their oil industries and to
broaden their economic bases.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the overture by Prince Abdullah, most governments
still appear resistant to allowing foreign companies to reassert
more than a peripheral role. One reason, particularly in Saudi
Arabia, is that the Western military presence has ignited domestic
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The best option would be realism _ to cut spending. But that
could certainly provoke the kind of outcry that the monarchies do
not appear eager to withstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is necessary will not be easy,'' said Amir al-Tamimi,
president of the Economic Society of Kuwait. ``Above all, it has
become clear that these governments are going to have to find a way
to cope with social pain.''

 &HT;    Even the best preachers can recall times _ painful then,
sometimes funny now _ when their sermons have fallen short.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's that Sunday morning all preachers dread, when
their sermon bombs and the congregation faces them like a firing
squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being trapped in quicksand,'' said the Rev. Gerald
Durley, pastor of Providence Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're standing in the pulpit with iron shoes,'' said the Rev.
Fred Craddock, a Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) minister
and internationally known authority on preaching who lives in Blue
Ridge (GA.).
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard about those great sermons that stir crowds and
grace the pages of history books.
</P>
<P>
   But a sermon can bomb in many ways _ none pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Some preachers inexplicably draw a blank in midsermon and forget
their subject. Others stumble as they tell long anecdotes, only to
realize that they've forgotten the point. One pastor confessed that
pulpit nerves caused him to put ``David into the Lion's Den, where
I couldn't get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   A language barrier caused the worst preaching moment for Philip
Bray, the pastor of SafeHouse Outreach Ministries, an Atlanta
ministry to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Bray was visiting a church in Canada, just over the Minnesota
state line. The congregation spoke English, but their accents were
so thick, Bray couldn't understand a word they said as they opened
the service with ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled speaker stood and said that God told him Bray
should preach in place of him. Bray, a novice preacher at the time,
stood and nervously began to ad-lib a sermon in his thick Georgia
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the congregation started to murmur. Others
stared at Bray in bewilderment. Then some began to giggle. Finally,
a person stood up and asked aloud in exasperation: ``What's a
y'all?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bray's, many preachers' worst moments come when they are
drafted to speak. It's an occupational hazard for ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who aren't prepared pay the price. That's what happened to
Tim McDonald, president of Atlanta's Concerned Black Clergy, when
he attended a church service held in Atlanta to honor a South
African minister.
</P>
<P>
   The South African apparently had little to say. He spent five
minutes in the pulpit, then suddenly retook his seat. All eyes
turned toward McDonald, who was seated in the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stall for time, McDonald, a fiery baptist minister
known for high-octane sermonizing, walked slowly to the lectern _
and kept on going slowly as he crawled through an improvised
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen you move in slow motion before,'' McDonald
recalls one of his colleagues telling him.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald learned his lesson. He now carries what he calls a
``stallion'' each time he appears at a public event, a trusty
sermon he can use on any occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every preacher has two or three stallions,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes even a ``stallion'' can't rescue a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said his worst experience came when he tried to stop a
``runaway stallion.'' He was preaching about the 12 spies Moses
sent to the Promised Land when he began to ramble. McDonald said he
couldn't ``find a place to land'' _ he didn't know how to end his
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get the people into the Promised Land,'' McDonald
said. ``The harder I tried, the more I flunked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a preacher can bomb by preaching the wrong sermon. Joe
McCuthen, a traveling minister based in Atlanta, was visiting a
church in Florida, where he gave what he thought was a fine sermon.
</P>
<P>
   But later, a member of the church sheepishly informed McCuthen
that he had given the same sermon a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they were gracious,'' he said. ``They did wait until
after the service to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many preachers deliver poor sermons when they try to mimic
popular preachers. Teresa Fry Brown, who teaches preaching at Emory
University, said it's common for seminary students to mimic famous
preachers in class.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes it can be annoying, Fry Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started teaching, I said if I hear another
imitation of Martin Luther King, I'm going back to Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst sermons have come when novice preachers have
tried to mimic ``whooping,'' a tradition in the black church where
preachers use their voice as a musical instrument to propel a
sermon to its climax.
</P>
<P>
   But a preacher needs a commanding voice to whoop, and pastors
with flat, unimposing voices often make themselves look silly when
trying the technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a trumpet if you're really a clarinet,'' Craddock
said.
</P>
<P>
   George Weaver learned that whooping can be difficult after he
attempted to follow the preaching style of his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not gifted with a whoop,'' said Weaver, a retired
Baptist minister who lives in Atlanta and author of a book of
essays, ``So We Preach.'' ``When I walk into a pulpit now and they
pull out the portable microphone, I tell them I don't need it
because I ain't going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a sermon can bomb before it starts. Preachers say a
bad choir or bad solo _ someone's 10-year-old niece is asked to
play a saxophone solo _ can make their job much harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to spend a little time on the runway before you take
off,'' Craddock said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why preachers love a good choir. They clear the runway.
Once, when a minister flew from New York to preach at Emory
University, he spent the previous day making arrangements for a
50-member choir to sing before he spoke. The choir lit the place
up. So did the preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Craddock later asked the preacher why he spent so much time
searching for a good choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't crawl out on that limb by myself,'' the preacher told
Craddock.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced preachers say, however, that bad sermons teach them
a valuable lesson _ the pulpit is no place for the ego. Trying to
impress a congregation is one of the quickest ways to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fool church folks,'' said Durley. ``They can tell
when the preacher sat down and the Spirit stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, preachers who bomb can console themselves with at
least one thought. There is no such thing as a worthless sermon.
God can redeem any message, no matter how broken, preachers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times when I've been disappointed in myself,
but someone will invariably say later to me, `You really spoke to
me,' '' Craddock said. ``I learned a long time ago that even an old
clunker that falls to the ground like a wingless dove, someone will
find help in it.''

 &HT;    A medical 'light fantastic' overturns old ways of healing
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let there be light.
</P>
<P>
   In dental chairs, doctors' offices and surgical wards, more
medical professionals are harnessing the power of light and lasers
to diagnose and treat everything from cancer to cavities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public thinks a laser is a laser is a laser,''
said Dr. David Garber, an Atlanta dentist who routinely uses lasers
in his practice. ``But it's really a multitude of different
instruments _ allowing doctors to have tremendous control over what
they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasers and other tools that emit light have become critical
instruments of mainstream medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Townes, who won the 1964 Nobel Prize in physics for
pioneering uses for the laser, did not foresee such a bright future
in health care for his invention, officially known as light
amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Townes, a professor emeritus at the University of California at
Berkeley, said he knew it would be useful in communications and
astronomy, but he produced only one short scientific paper on its
possible use in surgery in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply didn't know enough about medicine to envision how
useful it could be,'' said Townes, a native of Greenville, S.C. ``I
had never heard of a detached retina _ so there wasn't much of a
chance that I would predict that the laser could fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   At more than a dozen local vision centers, for example, lasers
are being used to reshape the lens of the eye, allowing nearsighted
people to toss their eyeglasses. The procedure, commonly referred
to as LASIK, involves the use of an excimer laser. Typically,
treatment costs about $2,000 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   But light, in one form or another, is also used in myriad other
procedures, many of which _ such as LASIK and other cosmetic
surgery _ are not covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists and plastic surgeons are using ruby lasers that
break up pigmented skin or dye to eliminate birthmarks, freckles
and tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Vein Center of Georgia, doctors use a machine called
a ``PhotoDerm,'' which relies on pulsating waves of light, to
remove small ``spider'' varicose veins, discolorations and hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the No. 1 advantage is it's not painful,'' said Dr.
Mark Mittenthal, a vascular surgeon at the Vein Center. ``And we
are able to truly customize the treatment because the settings
change on the basis of the pigmentation of an individual's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Davis said she started going to the Vein Center for spider
veins, but she decided to try the PhotoDerm for a birthmark about
the size of an orange on her leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never wear white hose,'' said Davis, 51, of College
Park (Ga.). ``It would magnify that dark spot.''
</P>
<P>
   After two treatments, the birthmark turned extremely dark,
flaked off and vanished _ ``sort of like when you get a sunburn and
your skin peels,'' she said. ``No one would ever know it was there.
I was truly amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dental field, most patients now find a laser lurking
somewhere near their chair.
</P>
<P>
   At Garber's practice _ Goldstein, Garber, Salama &AMP; Gribble _
different lasers are used for different jobs. Carbon dioxide lasers
cut away gum tissue. Argon lasers are used to cure new white
fillings, bleach teeth and bond cavity-preventing sealants to
children's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a new ``hard-tissue'' laser prepares teeth for
restorations. Although still not as good as a conventional
dentist's drill, this laser is expected to be refined and become
more convenient in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, we do believe the hard-tissue laser has
enormous potential, enormous promise,'' Garber said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers, however, have had the biggest impact in the field of
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   They were introduced in medicine about two decades ago after eye
surgeons discovered they were extremely effective in retinal
reattachment.
</P>
<P>
   And since then, lasers' ability to cut tissue precisely and
cleanly has made them nearly as common as the scalpel in the
operating room. ``We found that laser light was a source of energy
we could control much better and focus on very small spots,'' said
Mostafa El-Sayed, director of the Laser Dynamics Laboratory at
Georgia Tech. ``And we found that, unlike a knife, a laser carried
no bacteria _ dramatically reducing the chance of infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasers also cause less scarring and swelling, and often require
fewer follow-up stitches. Procedures using lasers often need less
postoperative time, which results in cheaper operations and faster
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Lasers are now commonly used to vaporize cancerous tumors,
cauterize ulcers and open blocked arteries. And as doctors become
more familiar with the technology, they become bolder in their use
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Emory Heart Center(Emory University (Ga.)), for example, is one
of 14 centers nationwide chosen to evaluate whether ``punching''
tiny holes in the heart via laser _ as an alternative to
conventional bypass surgery, where new arteries are implanted to
replace clogged ones _ may prove the best treatment for patients
with intractable angina, associated with chronic chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, called transmyocardial revascularization, or TMR,
creates new channels in the heart to facilitate blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. W. Morris Brown III, an Emory cardiothoracic surgeon leading
the study, said about 85 percent of the patients who have the
treatment get relief, although ``we don't completely understand the
mechanisms that make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   A laser is basically a beam of photons _ energized atoms _ that
are focused into a stream or pulse of light that can be used to
cut, melt or vaporize the material it hits.
</P>
<P>
   But the nifty thing about lasers is that they have different
characteristics depending on the type of crystal or gas used to
create the photons. A ruby laser is different from a carbon dioxide
laser, which is different from an argon laser.
</P>
<P>
   And each laser responds differently to the various types of
tissue it encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a laser like a painter's brush: Not only does the
artist have a spectrum of colors to mix and combine with the brush,
but each color he creates will react differently to the surface
being painted: The same color will look slightly different on a
canvas, a woodcarving or stone sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   That's why lasers are so effective, for example, in reattaching
retinas. Light passes harmlessly through the eye's lens but melts
retinal tissue, which is a different color and type than that of
the lens, reattaching it to the back of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   That boundless potential is making researchers seek new ways to
use the tool.
</P>
<P>
   El-Sayed, for example, is studying whether the laser could be
used as a diagnostic instrument in detecting ear infections. Light
could be bounced into the ear, and depending on the ``fingerprint''
of reflected light, physicians could tell exactly what type of
bacteria was causing problems _ and the best course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle is being examined by other researchers who
are studying whether lasers could be used in the diagnosis and
treatment of cancer. In particular, doctors are examining lasers'
effectiveness in throat, brain and breast cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians are also examining lasers' effectiveness with other
chronic illnesses, such as arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. In
a few studies, researchers have found that some lasers are able to
pass harmlessly through the skin, but relieve pressure at joints, a
``type of light acupuncture,'' El-Sayed said.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is wondrous to 83-year-old Townes, who said he has
been fortunate enough not to need any health care that requires his
invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really delighted that it turned out this way,'' he said.
``You're pleased when you learn (lasers) are useful for a normal
engineering function. But it's a very different feeling when you
know you've helped people in such a direct way.''

 &HT;    Rx for sick heart: Punch holes in it
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After two heart attacks, James DeBuc could barely walk
to the edge of his yard and pick up his newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But he got 22 holes shot through the left side of his heart in
October _ and now he feels great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't walk from my living room to my mailbox without
stopping,'' said DeBuc, 65, of Jonesboro (Ga.), who underwent the
laser surgery to alleviate his angina. ``This made an unbelievable
difference. I haven't felt so good in years.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBuc was not a viable candidate for traditional forms of heart
surgery, such as angioplasty or cardiac bypass. So his doctor
recommended a new laser procedure that increases blood flow, and
oxygen, to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was getting to the point I couldn't even walk without it
hurting so badly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation _ transmyocardial revascularization, or TMR _ is
being used in clinical studies at 14 medical centers around the
nation, including Emory Heart Center. It is just one of the newest
applications of the laser, already entrenched in such medical
specialties as ophthalmology, plastic surgery and dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of patients who undergo the procedure see
positive results within a year, according to Dr. W. Morris Brown
III, a cardiothoracic surgeon leading the Emory study. ``It seems
very good at relieving their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The best candidates for the procedure, according to the American
Heart Association, are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patients who are high-risk candidates for a second bypass or
angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patients whose blockages are too widespread to be treated with
bypass alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some patients with heart transplants who develop hardened
arteries in the new graft.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, although it sounds both high-tech and gory, is
relatively simple. Doctors, instead of slicing through the center
of the chest, make an incision from the left side and fire holes
into the heart. The laser is timed to fire when the chamber is full
of blood so the blood can protect the inside of the organ.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, about 30 tiny holes are punched into the heart, about
a half-inch apart, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The holes are punched one or two at a time while the surgeon
presses a finger on the holes on the outside of the heart. This
seals the outer openings, but lets the inner channels stay open,
allowing oxygen-rich blood to flow through the heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The entire operation takes about two hours, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers still are not clear on exactly how the operation
alleviates chest pain. One theory is that punching holes in the
heart stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. And that allows
more blood and oxygen to get to muscle previously deprived. If
true, the procedure would be truly fixing the problem of heart
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several studies indicate that this is the case, but we are
still waiting for conclusive evidence,'' Brown said. ``Right now,
tests that indicate blood flow tend to only report on the overall
blood flow of the heart. We need more tests that would actually
pinpoint where blood flow has increased.''
</P>
<P>
   But another theory is that heart punching damages nerve endings
that signal chest pain. And that would mean the heart isn't
actually made any healthier, but the pain is merely blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Using a laser to penetrate the heart is an extension of a
procedure developed in 1965 by Dr. P.K. Sen of India, who
experimented with acupuncture needles in the hearts of cobras. He
noticed that a reptile's heart allowed blood to filter directly
through its spongy material into circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen wondered whether people's hearts, severely damaged by heart
attacks, might benefit from a similar system achieved through
drilling small holes into the muscle.
</P>
<P>
   But it took more than two decades before doctors considered
using lasers for a similar purpose. The first TMR was performed in
1991. Eight years later, it is deemed by the Food and Drug
Administration as ``investigational but not experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the procedure, which costs about $20,000, is covered
on a case-by-case basis by some insurance plans. Medicare, however,
still does not routinely pay for it, although that might change in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   That's because TMR is less invasive, less expensive and requires
less recovery time than traditional coronary artery bypass surgery.
And because it doesn't require stopping the heart _ and a
heart-lung machine to continue circulation _ there also is less
potential damage to the kidneys, brain and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   However, it doesn't have the track record of traditional
surgeries, so Brown said there's little chance it would actually
replace such operations as angioplasty or bypass surgery. ``This is
still used for those who don't have more traditional surgeries as
an option,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for DeBuc, given eight months to a year to live without TMR,
any hesitation about the new procedure is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, he has traveled again, taking trips
to Florida, Tennessee and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would recommend it whole-heartedly.''

 &HT;    Carl Reiner makes a case for just one commandment
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carl Reiner thinks he can improve the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that the Ten Commandments are fine, but you
only need one commandment,'' he says. ``Thou shalt not hurt
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner, best known for his work with comedian and friend Mel
Brooks as the ``2,000 Year Old Man,'' as creator of the ``Dick Van
Dyke Show,'' and in recent years as a film director, doesn't spend
a lot of time musing over such religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll be in Atlanta on Jan. 24 to discuss his Jewish roots
before a sold-out crowd attending a meeting of the Atlanta Jewish

</P>
<P>
   The annual event will be held this year at the Crowne Plaza
Ravinia in north Atlanta, beginning at 7:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Though not an observant Jew, Reiner said during a recent phone
interview from his home in Los Angeles that his Jewishness helped
shape his comedic sensibilities. Humor, he thinks, is a great tool
to fight oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews have always fought back,'' Reiner said. ``Comedians fight
with their mouths. . . . You win the day by making other people
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not appeared on an ongoing television series in
years, Reiner remains popular with a new generation of viewers,
thanks to the Nickelodeon cable network that airs reruns of the
``Dick Van Dyke Show'' during its Nick at Nite programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids . . . come up and say, `I love that show,' '' Reiner
said. ``It's amazing, I love Nick at Nite.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks comics today have much more material to draw upon,
especially those using bathroom humor and profanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're given more fodder to work with,'' he said. ``But it
keeps them from being as creative. If you say (expletive deleted),
you get a laugh. But that stops you from writing a good scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner, married to jazz vocalist Estelle Reiner, is the head of
a show business family. His son Rob, still well-known as Meathead
on ``All in the Family,'' is an acclaimed director. His daughter
Anne is a poet and playwright, and another son, Lucas, also is a
filmmaker.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 17
 &HT;    The time has come for an eccentric Mississippi artist who had a
way with clay
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ When George E. Ohr died in 1918, Biloxi knew him
as the ``Mad Potter'' _ a wild-eyed man with an 18-inch mustache,
seven oddly named children and a way with clay that made sense to
almost no one.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohr knew that his pottery was simply ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a Biloxi souvenir before the potter dies or gets a
reputation,'' urged a sign outside his shop. ``Unequaled,
Unrivaled, Undisputed Greatest Potter on Earth,'' he dubbed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, the Mad Potter's time has come. Frank Gehry,
one of America's premier architects, has agreed to design a museum
for Ohr in downtown Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project sort of fell from heaven,'' Gehry explained from
his California office. He had recently seen a collection of Ohr's
pottery in New York and hoped one day to buy some pieces. Gehry
admired the potter's skill; he himself had tried his hand at
pottery once, but claims he was no good at it. ``But then I got a
call to do a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleanians Jeanne Nathan and her husband, artist Robert
Tannen, are Ohr collectors and friends of Gehry, so they approached
him last year about the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, it didn't hurt that we were friends,'' Nathan said.
``But he was fascinated by the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry, whose latest creation, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
Spain, has been hailed as one of the greatest buildings of the 20th
century, has designed no other buildings in the South, though he is
working on a Coca-Cola museum in Kentucky. And he has never been to
Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's a small project for the architect, who is better
known for concert halls and museums in exotic locales, Tannen said
the idea is to ``have the most extraordinary small museum
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ohr's work was rediscovered in the 1970s after languishing
in the attic of his sons' auto body shop, it was quickly recognized
as that of a genius almost a century ahead of his time. The vessels
are exotic in shape, with fluted edges and fantastical handles.
They are so paper-thin that accomplished modern potters have
puzzled over how Ohr managed to press clay to such limits. And his
glazes, as he himself said, are of ``unrivaled'' beauty. They are
colors straight from nature: organic and complex mossy greens to
underwater blues, deepest chocolate brown and glittery red.
</P>
<P>
   Ohr pots sell for as little as a few hundred dollars to as much
as $100,000, mostly in the Northeast. Giants of the New York art
world such as Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns have collected Ohr pots
_ Johns even painted images of Ohr's pots into a painting as a sort
of tribute. Ohr pots are displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   In Biloxi, where Ohr died known only as the town eccentric, a
modest collection of 250 pieces is displayed in a humble setting on
the second floor of the public library. But in two or three years,
Ohr's art will have a new home in a world-class museum that will
take shape in what is now a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been a small, struggling museum, and suddenly we're in
museum heaven,'' said Marjorie Gowdy, director of the George E. Ohr
Arts &AMP; Cultural Center at the library.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry O'Keefe, a former Biloxi mayor and local philanthropist
who earned his fortune in the insurance and funeral home
businesses, provided the first $1 million for the $8 million
project. He donated the money as a tribute to his wife, who died
last May. Local governments and private groups have donated another
$2 million, and it's likely that the state Legislature will chip in
$2 million, O'Keefe said. That leaves $3 million more to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Frank Gehry and George Ohr's paths cross, it's going to
be one of the most edifying cultural and artistic happenings in
this part of the world,'' O'Keefe predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will have two galleries besides the Ohr installation,
one for local artists and one for African-American artists. The
black component was O'Keefe's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is real important to make a statement to the world
that the Gulf Coast and Mississippi understand and appreciate the
culture of African-Americans,'' O'Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry said he likes the mix of galleries as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a democracy,'' he said. ``And the mix makes it timely,
rather than just something dumped there from another period.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum will also be a way to bring attention to Biloxi for
something other than its casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a statement that, while we enjoy the casinos, we
want to preserve and maintain our past and our background,''
O'Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohr was born in Biloxi in 1857 to German and Alsatian parents.
His father was a blacksmith, and for a while the young Ohr followed
in his footsteps. But when a friend invited him to New Orleans to
study with a famous potter, Joseph Meyer, Ohr accepted. He later
would say he took to the potter's wheel like a duck to water.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Biloxi in 1891, Ohr established Biloxi Art Pottery,
rowing up a nearby river to fetch clay and then working at his
potter's wheel, his mustache tucked behind his ears. He tried to
sell his work for what he thought it was worth, but no one would
pay what seemed like exorbitant prices for such odd-looking pieces.
So Ohr began making cheaper, whimsical items such as puzzle mugs
and piggy banks to make a living. He peddled his wares at fairs and
expositions around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued to beg for attention for his art. He took wild
pictures of himself, using his mustache as a prop, and constantly
promoted himself as a misunderstood genius. At the end of his life,
when he had stopped potting, he hoped the Smithsonian would one day
buy his life's work en masse. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   So he died dismissed as a buffoon, even by his sons, who after
his death chucked some 10,000 pieces into boxes in an attic. One
piece now in the Biloxi collection was used by an Ohr descendant as
a place to throw car keys. They would always get lost in the folds
of the vessel's almost erotic interior.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces stayed hidden for 50 years, when they were bought by
a New Jersey antiques dealer. They quickly became known throughout
the Northeast, achieving their first real renown when Johns
exhibited them in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ohr's greatest works are in the hands of private
collectors in the North. Gowdy says the museum's organizers are on
a campaign to ``bring George home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his pieces that remained in Mississippi are with the
alligators in the back bay between Biloxi and I-10. He threw about
200 pieces into the marsh, saying he hoped that a future
generation, able to appreciate him, would find them.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry has not been to Biloxi to look at the site; he plans to
visit in February and start formulating ideas for a design. He said
he's thinking of designing a single building that looks like three
separate pavilions, to house each of the three components.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me,'' Nathan said, `` `Don't expect it to look like an
Ohr pot.' ''

TYSON STILL A TICKING TIME BOMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In his latest incarnation, Mike Tyson has a new
manager, new promoter, new attorney, new trainer and even a new
shrink, but he has remained his same old unpredictable, malevolent
self.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's doubtful when he steps into the ring Saturday night for
the first time since June 28, 1997 that he will wind up munching on
Francois Botha's ears as he did to those attached to Evander
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Botha doesn't faintly pose the threat to Tyson's health that
Holyfield did that memorable evening 18 months ago, and Tyson
figures to easily retain his sanity and make quick work out of the
slow South African who can't punch in a scheduled 10-round match at
the MGM Grand Garden that has inspired dizzying heights of public
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   As he stumbles into the sunset of his notorious career, Mike
Tyson still is a ticking time bomb soap opera, set to detonate at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, he engaged in a live, obscenity-strewn
television interview via satellite hookup with a New York newsman.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, during his fistic purgatory when you'd expect his
behavior to be exemplary, he (a) roughed up Don King in a Beverly
Hills hotel parking lot, (b) engaged in a Maryland road-rage
incident in which he has pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor
assault charges and (c) made such a bad impression on the Nevada
State Athletic Commission that it forced him to undergo a thorough
psychiatric examination before consenting to license him to fight
again.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting, of course, is what sets Mike Tyson apart from the
several billion other human beings on the planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   He once did it well enough to become the undisputed heavyweight
champion and to forge an aura of menacing invincibility perhaps
unmatched in his sport's history, but that was before being knocked
out in Tokyo by Buster Douglas and before being convicted of rape
and spending three years in jail and before perpetuating his
cannibalistic act on Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven and a half years, Tyson has fought a mere 22
rounds, impaling such stiffs as Peter McNeeley, Buster Mathis Jr.,
Frank Bruno and Bruce Seldon in his post-prison frolics before
getting leveled in 11 rounds by Holyfield and then getting
disqualified in the rematch against Holyfield for his infamous
biting antics.
</P>
<P>
   At 32, he no longer commands the respect and awe he did when he
was 22 and rumbling through the likes of Larry Holmes, Tony Tubbs,
Michael Spinks, Trevor Berbick and anyone else brave enough to
venture into his path in those frightening days.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, there reportedly were only 8,000 tickets sold
for his engagement with Botha in an arena that seats 16,325, and
pay per view sales around the country also have been reportedly
sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Don King and Bob Arum have become multi-millionaires proving you
can fool boxing fans most of the time, but you can't fool all of
them all of the time. Not many are flocking to buy the $200 tickets
for Saturday's event, much less the $1,200 ones.
</P>
<P>
   And most knowledgeable patrons of the sweet science now have
come to the conclusion that Mike Tyson is only a soft shell of the
fearsome man who once was such an intimidating presence that one of
his victims, James (Bonecrusher) Smith, once confided to me, ``I
was scared to death of Tyson when the fight started. I felt like
running out of the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield certainly wasn't scared of Mike Tyson, and
Tyson's two-fight losing streak and his lengthy inactivity are
responsible for his once bright box office sheen suddenly turning
to a less appealing shade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his crafty new manager-adviser, Shelly Finkel, once
closely linked to Holyfield and Main Events, has signed a lucrative
four-fight deal with the MGM and Tyson is expected to earn in the
vicinity of $20 million for his debate with Botha, which figures to
wipe out the $13 million debt he has with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Can Mike Tyson still fight at a championship level?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   No definitive answer will be forthcoming Saturday night because
Francois Botha was selected as Tyson's opponent because he can't
</P>
<P>
   fight.
</P>
<P>
   And I doubt we will find out in the near future because the plan
is for Tyson to fight a few more foils Axel Schulz is one of the
names being mentioned before his new management team takes the risk
of allowing him to face a dangerous opponent like, say, the winner
of the upcoming Holyfield-Lennox Lewis match.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, those new personalities in the Mike Tyson retinue are
insisting he's in peak shape and that's he been looking better than
ever during his training sessions in Phoenix, ritual pre-fight
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a Mike Tyson you haven't seen since June
of 1988 when he flattened Michael Spinks in one round,'' says Dan
Goossen, Tyson's latest promoter who once headed the old Ten Goose
boxing organization in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's new trainer, Tommy Brooks, was, ironically, Holyfield's
for the two Tyson fights, and he is supposed to have Tyson throwing
combinations that have been notably missing in his arsenal for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson also has a new lawyer, John Branca, a Hollywood mover and
shaker who's the son of Ralph Branca, who threw the most notorious
pitch in the history of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Branca is now trying to resurrect Mike Tyson, a Brooklyn native
who turned pro in 1985 and a year later became the youngest world
heavyweight champion ever at a mere 20.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson is a lot older now, and one wonders what toll all the
late-night parties and run-ins with the law and fallouts with Don
King and Rory Hollaway and John Horne and beatings from Douglas and
Holyfield have taken on Tyson's skills and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, because of his self-destructive ways, Mike Tyson has now
deteriorated into more of a curiosity than a legitimate attraction,
but he still probably can alter the public's dimmed perception of
him with a few lethal knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Mike Tyson still has power, and he has a
perfect person to display it against in Botha.
</P>
<P>
   And he probably will.
</P>
<P>
   But so what?

COLORADO SCHOOL DISTRICT BARS STUDENTS WITH HIV FROM SCHOOL SPORTS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Reviving a dormant health controversy, a Northern
Colorado school district has adopted a health policy that could bar
students with HIV and AIDS from playing school sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the Poudre School District, centered on Fort Collins, an
infected student ``may be excluded from participation in school
athletics,'' depending on the decision of an assessment team of
school administrators, public health officials and the student's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Professional and amateur athletic groups generally have taken
the opposite approach since 1991, the year that basketball player
Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson announced that he was HIV-positive.
Instead of banning athletes with blood-borne diseases, such as AIDS
and hepatitis, athletic associations have almost universally
adopted sanitary procedures for handling open wounds and spilled
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``National Hockey League players with active bleeding are taken
off the ice until bleeding stops, the same thing for basketball
players,'' said Benjamin Young, an infectious disease specialist in
Denver. Noting that Johnson played basketball after he announced
that he had the virus that causes AIDS, Young said, ``Professional
sports elected not to make this a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, there is no known case of HIV transmission
through sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have ruled out sweat and saliva as agents of
transmission, he added. ``In the millions of household contacts,
there has been no transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte Peterson, a Poudre Valley School District official, said
that the new policy, adopted on Monday, was ``intended to be a
cooperative policy, not a restrictive, exclusionary policy.''
</P>
<P>
   It refers to ``students infected with a serious communicable
disease, including a diagnosis of an HIV or AIDS-related illness.''
Colorado law does not compel students to disclose whether they have
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a parent chose to share with us that a student was infected
with say, HIV, how can we help?'' he said from Fort Collins, 55
miles north of here. ``We are not dealing with a case. Our policy
is a proactive policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 26 AIDS cases have been recorded among Coloradans of high
school age since 1982, the state health department said. Last year
the department reported no new AIDS cases and five new HIV cases
among state residents of high school age.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, there are not believed to be any school
districts with policies aimed at excluding HIV-positive athletes,
said Jerry L. Diehl, assistant director of the National Federation
of State High School Associations, a sport regulatory group in
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``While risk of one athlete infecting another with HIV/AIDS
during competition is close to nonexistent, there is a remote risk
that other blood-borne infectious diseases can be transmitted,''
begins the association's policy, written in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the threat of Hepatitis B transmission, it lists sanitary
procedures for when open wounds are incurred on playing fields.
Doctors say that the main route for transmission would be from the
open wound of an infected player to the open wound of another
player.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, high school teams forfeit games if they refuse to
play teams that have members who have HIV or hepatitis, said Bob
Ottewill, commissioner of the Colorado High School Activities
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Young criticized the Poudre schools for not specifying whether
the new policy applied to noncontact sports. He added that
exclusionary programs are ineffective because the presence of HIV
in the bloodstream can manifest itself up to one year after an
infectious contact.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians and gay-rights advocates said Friday that the
new policy smacked of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this policy is uninformed, discriminatory and fraught
with ignorance.`` said Lori Midson, a spokeswoman for the Colorado
AIDS Project, an education and prevention group in Denver. ``This
means that students that are athletes and HIV positive will be
discouraged from revealing their HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of this policy is that you are going to discourage
students from being tested,'' said Christine Cimini, a lawyer for
the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado. ``And the
consequences of not being tested are incredibly severe.''

RELIGION JOURNAL: ST. LOUIS PREPARES FOR PAPAL VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next Friday, Pope John Paul II is scheduled to begin his 85th
pastoral trip abroad, flying first to Mexico City for five days,
then on to a single, brief stop in the United States. In his fifth
visit to U.S. soil, the pope will spend little more than 30 hours
in St. Louis on Jan. 26 and 27.
</P>
<P>
   On previous trips to the United States, he visited most of the
major archdioceses, on both coasts, in the South and the upper
Midwest. On his last U.S. trip, in October 1995, his destinations
were New York City and Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   On his longest U.S. trips in 1979 and 1987, he was accompanied
by the Rev. Justin Rigali, a Los Angeles-born priest who had served
in the Vatican since the 1960s. Five years ago, the pope appointed
him the St. Louis archbishop, with a flock of nearly 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although St. Louis is one of the older Roman Catholic
jurisdictions in the United States, organized in 1826, several
themes are suggested by the visit apart from regional history. The
pope's trip, experts on the church say, could allow him to speak to
America about what he sees as its responsibilities at the advent of
the new millennium. And it affords him an opportunity to reach out
to Catholic young people at a special ``youth rally'' Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The visit also includes an interfaith aspect, a meeting between
the pope and Protestant, Jewish, Orthodox and other leaders, a sign
of his interest in dialogue with other faith groups. About 90
non-Catholic guests have been invited to a prayer service with the
pontiff Jan. 27, at St. Louis' Catholic Cathedral Basilica. It will
be, according to the archdiocese, the most religiously diverse
gathering ever held there.
</P>
<P>
   Among those invited is the Rev. John Anderson, pastor of Third
Baptist Church, a 1,400-member congregation not far from the
cathedral. ``I hold the pope in high regard as a man of integrity,
as a man of deep spirituality who speaks with clarity'' on
important issues, he said, adding that, ``on those issues I as a
Baptist Protestant may differ with him, he raises them in a way
that you can have a healthy dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is also president of the Interfaith Partnership of
Metropolitan St. Louis, which includes Christians, Jews, Muslims
and Baha'is. In its most recent newsletter, he draws a quotation
from John Paul II's book, ``Crossing the Threshold of Hope''
(Knopf, 1994), that ``instead of marveling at the fact that
Providence allows such a great variety of religions, we should be
amazed at the number of common elements found within them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the broad, cross-denominational effect a papal
visit can have, Anderson said that the event was taken by leaders
in the organization as an opportunity to make a statement about how
faith groups can work together to society's benefit. ``There were
those who said, `Wouldn't it be wonderful if the pope's visit was
the catalyst for something new?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, is a coming program, co-sponsored with an
African-American clergy members' association, to get local
congregations involved in helping St. Louis' inner city. Goals
include providing immunizations and tutoring for children and
rehabilitating housing.
</P>
<P>
   Work will be done by volunteers from participating
congregations, said Rabbi Mark Shook, a director of the interfaith
group and spiritual leader of Temple Israel in nearby Creve Coeur.
``It gets people out of the congregations into the community,'' he
said, adding that it is also intended to foster ties among members
of different faith groups.
</P>
<P>
   The program is to be called Faith Beyond Walls, and its name
will be emblazoned on a handmade banner that clergy members will
present to the pope at the prayer service. As an example of
inter-religious cooperation, Anderson said he saw a message:
``Great things can happen when we work together and stress what we
have in common, rather than the differences that are there.''

 &HT;    King on our minds
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Becker is the typical visitor to the Martin
Luther King Jr. National Historic Site on the edge of downtown
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Becker came seeking a better understanding of
King's life, and his death.
</P>
<P>
   Like some others during a recent stop at the $11 million
National Park Service Visitor Center, he was moved to tears by the
emotionally powerful exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   And like most others, Becker is from out of town. Way out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only here a few days on holiday, but I wanted to see
this,'' said the 17-year-old student from Frankfurt, Germany. ``The
whole thing is very emotional for me. I will tell my friends they
should see this if they come to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catroppa of the U.S. National Park Service hopes Becker
will tell not only friends who zoom around the autobahn, but
whatever friends he has who drive on the Perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the 2-year-old visitor center, Catroppa says the
historic district is extremely popular among foreign and U.S.
tourists, but it's virtually ignored by locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here from everywhere, but attracting people from
metro Atlanta has been the hardest part of my job,'' said Catroppa,
who estimates about a half-million visitors tour the historic site
each year. ``I think a lot of people hear `Martin Luther King Jr.'
and think this is just for black people. Nothing could be further
from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Catroppa and his Park Service rangers have been doing outreach
in Cobb, Coweta, Fayette and Gwinnett counties. Their message: The
historic district is a fascinating, educational, free, and most of
all, safe place to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're in a bad neighborhood, but this area is one
of the best kept secrets of neighborhood revitalization,'' Catroppa
said. ``It's been weeks, no months, since we've had an incident,
but there is a perception problem, and we've had difficulty
changing that.''
</P>
<P>
   With King holiday celebrations under way, this is a good time to
discover, or rediscover, the legacy of one of Atlanta's most
important native sons, right in your back yard.
</P>
<P>
   VISITOR CENTER
</P>
<P>
   Although it was completed in 1996, the outside of the center
still resembles a subdivision under construction with newly planted
shrubs and tiny flags marking the spot for yet-to-be installed
sprinkler heads. Parking is close, plentiful and free of charge on
the Irwin Street lot, which is just across the street from the main
entrance. All the sites are within walking distance, so you can
leave your car in the lot. Or catch the MARTA east line to the King
Memorial station and walk or take a bus the half-mile to the
historic site.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the center, exhibits are arranged in intimate, C-shaped
alcoves with a television monitor mounted overhead. Running in an
endless loop on each screen is a short film on some aspect of
King's civil rights career and the historical backdrop of racial
segregation that spawned it. The glass walls enclosing each alcove
are etched with King's words, explaining his philosophy toward
racial tolerance and brotherly love.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the panels, pictures and placards in the alcoves are
more kid-friendly; they're mounted closer to the ground and written
in simpler language. But the center is not aimed at small visitors,
and some material may be too intense for sensitive children under
age 8. The depictions, including lynchings and cross burnings, are
not gory but are fairly graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden benches line the center's walls, but the only place to
sit while watching the films is on the floor, so wear jeans or
comfortable clothing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most moving exhibits, ``Testimony and Response,'' is
also the most low-tech. It asks and answers the question: What
would you say to King if he were still alive? Visitors can use the
bank of telephone handsets near the entrance to listen to messages
left by previous guests, or to record their own. Some visitors
offer a simple ``thank you''; others dissolve into tearful
remembrances of King's assassination in 1968 and how it affected
them.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the exhibits, ``Freedom Road'' is perhaps the most
haunting. It resembles the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala.,
site of the 1965 ``Bloody Sunday'' civil rights march _ complete
with life-size statues striding across the span. Underfoot, the
asphalt is inlaid with the names of the cities where King staged
marches. The statues include an old man, an amputee, a little girl
and a teenager. Walk among them, and you can almost hear them
singing the civil rights anthem ``We Shall Overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is a small but wrenching exhibit that can take nearly
two hours to complete. If you don't have that much time, watch one
of three King-related movies shown every hour in the center's
auditorium; for a large group of children, the projectionist can
show one of the films produced expressly for younger visitors.
</P>
<P>
   A gift shop just off the main lobby has reasonably priced books,
tapes and posters.
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM HALL AT THE KING CENTER
</P>
<P>
   This small collection of personal effects from King, his widow,
Coretta, and Mohandas K. Gandhi, whose nonviolent methods became
the underpinnings for King's civil disobedience, isn't the main
attraction for King district visitors, but it's an interesting
diversion.
</P>
<P>
   It's directly across Auburn Avenue from the visitor center in a
row of brown-brick buildings. Walk up to the second floor to see
glass displays containing the boots, hat, jeans and blue denim
shirt King wore on some of his civil rights marches. Other personal
effects include his well-worn Bible, his perfectly preserved cuff
link collection (King was always a sharp dresser) and the suit he
was wearing when a deranged woman stabbed him in 1962. Along the
walls is a photographic chronology of King's life, including
pictures of him as a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King's early career as a concert singer, including
some of the fund-raisers where she performed for the civil rights
movement, is depicted in programs and costumes. In the separate
Gandhi room, there are busts of the Indian leader and replicas of
his hand-driven loom, sandals and walking stick, which became
symbols of his ascetic lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   KING BIRTH HOME
</P>
<P>
   Just one block east of the King Center is the home where King
was born and lived until he was 12. This delicate two-story, Queen
Anne style house is among the most popular exhibits in the historic
district. Only 15 visitors are allowed inside at a time, and on
peak days, tours fill up quickly. If you plan to visit, your first
stop should be Fire Station No. 6, where Park Service rangers will
register you. The free tours take about a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   The house is exquisitely preserved with many of the original
furnishings and period pieces that give visitors a sense of what
the young King's life was like.
</P>
<P>
   Few visitors may realize that King's family was considered upper
middle class, and the house reflects their relative affluence.
Despite the racism that confronted every African-Amer-ican, the
Kings enjoyed many comforts such as an icebox and cast iron stove _
considered luxuries for whites and blacks of that era.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs at the rear of the house is the room where King played
with his brother A.D. and developed his love of reading, and the
front porch where they slept on muggy Atlanta nights. The tour
guides are armed with plenty of anecdotes about the close-knit
family that nurtured the young King in this home, providing
insights into the leader he would later become.
</P>
<P>
   KING GRAVE SITE
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a long, blue reflecting pool in a peaceful
courtyard outside the King Center, the slain civil rights leader's
body lies inside a white marble tomb. An eternal flame burns in his
memory, and the tomb is inscribed with the closing line from his
``I Have a Dream'' speech at the 1963 March on Washington: ``Free
at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple exhibit that lacks the whiz-bang technology of the
visitor center or the historic significance of King's birth home,
but this serene spot is a good place for visitors to spend a quiet
moment pondering the man and his life.
</P>
<P>
   EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH
</P>
<P>
   On the corner of Auburn Avenue and Jackson Street is the church
where King grew up, preached his first sermon at 17 and was
eulogized in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   On days when services are not being held, tour guides lead
visitors through the majestic sanctuary, which was completed in
1922 and later became ground zero for the civil rights movement,
even before it began in earnest in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   King's grandfather, A.D. Williams, was Ebenezer's pastor in 1929
and proclaimed that the church would ``dedicate itself to the
advancement of black people and support of every righteous and
social movement.''
</P>
<P>
   While walking through the red-carpeted pews, visitors are
reminded that this is the same building that gave birth to the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization of
churches and religious leaders who elected King as its first
president.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the site where King's mother was shot and killed in
1974 while playing the organ at a Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary has grown too small for its congregation. A new
Ebenezer is under construction just across Auburn Avenue.

By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future of AT&AMP;T is not hard to find _ if you can read a floor
plan. It is in Room 4430G2 at AT&AMP;T's sprawling headquarters in
Basking Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   There are five PCs in Room 4430G2, a big-screen television and a
bunch of phones. Nothing special in any of that. What distinguishes
the setup is what's missing: telephone wires. All the key equipment
links to the outside world through a single cable television line.
And the line is providing lightning-quick Internet connections,
crisp video images and, of course, a dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   Simple as it seems, that ribbon of coaxial cable represents what
may prove to be the most important strategic shift in decades at
AT&AMP;T, the nation's biggest communications company and its most
widely owned stock.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after the break-up of the Bell System severed
AT&AMP;T's hard-wire link to U.S. consumers, its pending acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable operator, will allow AT&AMP;T
to again reach out and directly touch millions of homes.
</P>
<P>
   And trying to re-create AT&AMP;T's glory days, the company's new
chairman and chief executive, C. Michael Armstrong, wants AT&AMP;T to
be the only communications provider its customers need.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a pipe dream in an arena teeming with competition _
wireless companies, long-distance companies and local phone
companies, not to mention Internet providers and satellite TV
services?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Three thousand miles from Basking Ridge, dozens of
technicians in Fremont, Calif., are preparing to move Armstrong's
vision out of Room 4430G2 and into the living rooms of paying
customers. Soon after the merger closes, as soon as this spring,
the TCI brand will start to disappear in Fremont, a middle-class
suburb of San Francisco, and Armstrong's operators will be calling
consumers to offer AT&AMP;T's new wares.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch will go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, this is AT&AMP;T. Did you know that we can now offer not only
long-distance phone service but also four lines of local service
with call-waiting and Caller ID? And may we interest you in our
high-speed Internet service, called At Home? It lets you download
from the Internet at speeds as much as 100 times faster than you
can today _ and at prices comparable to what you're already
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   The salesperson will pause to catch a breath, and then continue:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want high-speed access, how about a more
traditional Internet service, like AT&AMP;T Worldnet? And a wireless
phone that includes nationwide calling for as little as 10 cents a
minute? Oh, yes, we can provide all of these services on a single
bill with one number to call if you have questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T's proposition to consumers will be about more than a
simple variety of services; it will be about the extra perks that
come from becoming a full member of the AT&AMP;T family. So the closer
will be along these lines:
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, if you use any three of our other services, we
would be happy to add HBO and the Disney Channel to your basic
cable package for no additional charge.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1999, AT&AMP;T intends to offer this integrated
package of communications services not only in Fremont but also in
another, undisclosed community in the San Francisco area as well as
in Chicago, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Denver, Salt Lake City,
Portland, Ore., and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 2000, the company intends to expand its
competition against its progeny, the Baby Bells, by offering local
phone service in most of TCI's other markets.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the biggest gambles in AT&AMP;T's 114-year history _ a
test of technology, of financial might and of regulatory
flexibility. For Armstrong, it is the ultimate test of managerial
prowess: whether he can reshape one of the country's most hidebound
corporations to his vision of a lithe competitor in some of
technology's fastest-moving sectors.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, AT&AMP;T will again be not just big, but also
dominant, a mantle it lost because of competition from the likes of
MCI Worldcom, Sprint, SBC Communications and Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If he fails? The critics will say he failed to gauge adequately
the difficulty and cost of upgrading TCI's somewhat antiquated
cable systems. That he did not understand the complexity of the
local phone business. That he reached too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T declined to comment, citing a ``quiet period'' mandated by
regulators before shareholders vote next month on the TCI merger.
And for now, the critics are lying low. That is because Armstrong
has already seemed to make a huge change in an organization that
long had seemed to be inertia's captive.
</P>
<P>
   Though it lost its monopoly on phone service in 1984, AT&AMP;T never
seemed able to shake off its monopoly mindset. Well into the 1990s,
under Armstrong's predecessor, Robert E. Allen _ whose entire
career was spent at AT&AMP;T _ the company continued to rely on the
regulatory process to protect its core long-distance business and
to keep potential competitors off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shared belief in the company was that the single most
important entity that affected their future was the federal
government and the regulators,'' said Richard Bodman, who was
AT&AMP;T's chief of strategy and business development for most of the
'90s and who is now managing general partner of AT&AMP;T Ventures, a
venture capital firm backed by AT&AMP;T. ``That was a contest that
maybe they couldn't win, but it was a contest in which they felt
they had pretty good skills and tools to play the game adequately
well.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in November 1997, after Allen's choice as heir, John
Walter, quickly lost the board's confidence, Armstrong saw things
differently. At Hughes Electronics, he had presided over the
transformation of a military contractor into an entrepreneurial
dynamo, building its Direct TV satellite business. And under him,
AT&AMP;T has begun to shed its reputation as a company that would
rather lobby than compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time that MCI was created in the '60s until Mike
Armstrong, AT&AMP;T was essentially a defensive and reactive company,''
said Reed Hundt, who stepped down as chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission just as Armstrong joined AT&AMP;T. ``Since he
arrived, the company has been pro-active, creative and
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   John Nakahata, who resigned as chief of staff for Hundt's
successor at the FCC, William Kennard, late last year, said: ``It
seems that AT&AMP;T has realized that they need a business solution,
not a regulatory solution, to their business problem, which is that
they have not had a way to touch the customer in the local
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even as its share of the long-distance business slid
and its earnings gains came to rely mostly on cost-cutting, the
company always had ideas about how to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Some proved disastrous, like its $7.4 billion foray into the
computer business by buying NCR Corp. in 1991, a debacle reversed
five years later at an additional cost of $2 billion. Others were
inspired, like the acquisition of McCaw Cellular for $12.6 billion
in 1993, making AT&AMP;T a national player in wireless communications,
and the spinoff of AT&AMP;T's equipment operation as Lucent
Technologies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the seeds of every major move that AT&AMP;T has made in
Armstrong's 14-month tenure were planted long before his arrival.
His achievement has been in getting those plans off the drawing
board _ or out of the dust bin _ and into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a partial rundown of those efforts:
</P>
<P>
   TCI ACQUISITION _ The most important strategic move of
Armstrong's tenure, the TCI deal is meant to give AT&AMP;T a
high-capacity pipe into millions of homes and a leg up in striking
deals with other cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T had been talking to cable operators, including TCI, about
various sorts of joint ventures since at least 1991. But for years
those talks never went anywhere, partly because, in its arrogance,
AT&AMP;T refused to promise that it would not go into competition with
the cable companies by jumping into the ``content'' business,
whether by buying cable television networks, for instance, or even
a movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1997 that AT&AMP;T agreed to curb its media
ambitions, thereby bringing the cable companies back to the table.
Around Christmas that year, AT&AMP;T began having serious joint-venture
discussions with carriers including TCI, Comcast, Cablevision, Cox
and Time-Warner, the No. 1 cable company.
</P>
<P>
   Boldly, Armstrong made the key decision to acquire TCI rather
than simply form a joint venture. AT&AMP;T is now close to
joint-venture deals with Time Warner and wants to sign agreements
with the other big cable carriers by midyear. Together, these deals
could give AT&AMP;T a line into more than half the nation's homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TELEPORT ACQUISITION _ Just as the TCI deal gives AT&AMP;T a wire
into homes, the $11.3 billion deal for Teleport Communications last
January gave AT&AMP;T entry into the business of providing local voice
and data communications to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   This deal was loaded when Armstrong arrived. But he pulled the
trigger, adding a unit that is expected to provided billions of
dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   OVERSEAS DEALS, WITH LIMITS _ Armstrong led AT&AMP;T into a $10
billion joint venture with British Telecommunications PLC. All
their international communications behemoth needs now is a big
Asian partner _ and a chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways the deal highlights one of AT&AMP;T's toughest
choices. When the company decided that a big part of its future lay
in the huge investments it would make to get into the domestic
local phone market, it had no choice but to limit its international
aspirations and rely on strong partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, AT&AMP;T had been negotiating investments in Germany and
France and had been thinking about investing in Italy _ and even
considered building a network in Shanghai _ even as it participated
in loose overseas ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Room 4430G2, where AT&AMP;T now demonstrates its
ambitions for local communications services, used to be a reception
area for visiting foreign executives.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the rich benefits that AT&AMP;T stands to reap if its new
strategy succeeds are threatened by a commensurate set of daunting
challenges. Foremost is the competition _ both from the Bells and
AT&AMP;T's long-distance rivals.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the Bells _ seven of them when AT&AMP;T was broken up in
1984, now consolidated to five _ have more money, more customers
and arguably more influence in Washington than AT&AMP;T has. Whether
the Bells or AT&AMP;T emerge as the most powerful players in
communications depends on timing and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and the regional Bells know that whatever competitor
is first to offer customers an integrated package of local and
long-distance service in a given market stands a good chance of
holding on to that customer for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Bells is that none has yet convinced the FCC
that, as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it has
opened its local phone networks to competition enough to win entry
to the long-distance market. Even as AT&AMP;T introduces local service
over TCI's cables, the Bells will still have to face that test.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the regional Bell serving 13 states from New
England to Virginia, thinks it can put together a winning
application sometime before the middle of this year. That would be
later than originally anticipated but could still give Bell
Atlantic a head start on AT&AMP;T in the lucrative Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the technology that Bell Atlantic would have to use _
providing high-speed Internet access over standard copper telephone
wires _ appears to some analysts as less developed than the cable
technology that AT&AMP;T plans to employ. (Bell Atlantic was one of the
first companies to have the vision of delivering a full array of
communications services over cable lines. But its proposed merger
with TCI fell apart in 1993, the victim of regulatory uncertainties
and concerns over the costs of upgrading TCI's systems.)
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of Bell Atlantic's problem, though, is that AT&AMP;T's
most cost-efficient technology for delivering phone calls over
cable wires _ one that uses Internet systems _ is itself at least a
year away. In Fremont and its other initial markets, AT&AMP;T plans to
start out delivering phone calls using an older technology that
could cost as much as $900 a house (though the company is counting
on that figure being $550). The Internet option, however, could
cost as little as $350 a house.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of delivering local services to all of TCI's 10
million customers could total as much as $6 billion, and those
costs will be absorbed by AT&AMP;T's shareholders. Most analysts expect
the TCI acquisition to dilute AT&AMP;T's earnings for at least three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, AT&AMP;T faces big technical challenges in
getting TCI's systems to work with its own _ and big
human-resources challenges in getting TCI's sales force to work
with its own. Complicated new computer systems will be needed, both
to connect AT&AMP;T's old long-distance network to TCI's cable systems
and to provide integrated bills for the company's millions of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no chance, meanwhile, that MCI Worldcom and Sprint,
AT&AMP;T's two big rivals in the long-distance business, will stand
still.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has already unveiled its own plan to offer a bundle of
local services, though how the company will reach large numbers of
consumers remains unclear. Sprint has tried to make deals of its
own with big cable companies. But in that competition, AT&AMP;T may
have an edge.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, once AT&AMP;T acquires TCI it will be part of the
club with the other big cable operators. For another, Sprint has
already worked with some of the major cable carriers in forming the
Sprint PCS wireless joint-venture _ and that relationship did not
go as smoothly as it could because the cable operators were
expecting a higher, quicker return on their investments.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom runs the biggest Internet service provider, Uunet,
and the Bells' biggest competitor in local phone service for
businesses, MFS. Both those units, however, are geared to business
customers, and it is unclear how MCI Worldcom means to make a big
splash in local consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
   For years, AT&AMP;T was a burr in the hide of the Federal regulators
whose power still plays a big role in how competition unfolds in
the communications world. In consummating the TCI deal, however,
Armstrong and AT&AMP;T seem to have a special friend: the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment AT&AMP;T's deal with TCI was announced, Kennard, the
commission's chairman, has not seemed able to say enough good
things about it. And it isn't hard to understand why. For federal
regulators, the main issue of the last few years has been the
fostering of competition in local telephone markets. AT&AMP;T's
strategy promises just that.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, however, wants to make sure that AT&AMP;T follows through,
and not just for wealthy people able to afford the full panoply of
21st-century services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AT&AMP;T-TCI merger holds pro-competitive promise because it's
a long-distance company joined with a cable company to compete
against the local phone companies,'' Kennard said. ``That's what
all the hoopla is all about. But we need to make sure there's a
commitment to deploy these networks to all residential consumers _
not only the affluent but to everybody, not only in the suburbs but
also in the inner city.''
</P>
<P>
   More grave could be challenges to AT&AMP;T's plans to limit access
to its speedy new cable pipelines. Unlike local phone companies,
cable TV operators do not have to open their systems to all comers.
TCI, for instance, is under no obligation to let America Online
offer direct high-speed access over its lines. That ability to use
cable lines exclusively _ while the local phone companies have to
open their systems _ is a cornerstone of AT&AMP;T's plan.
</P>
<P>
   But together, the Bells and leading Internet companies like
America Online are challenging the disparity, on both the federal
and municipal levels. That puts the regulators in a tough spot,
because AT&AMP;T _ on which the regulators are counting to create
competition for local phone service _ will say it makes no sense to
build advanced networks in the first place if it must open them to
still other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the consensus _ both in the industry and on Wall
Street _ is that by moving boldly to deliver his basket of
services, Armstrong has given AT&AMP;T a new lease on market
leadership. Investors have bid up the company's shares 73 percent
since his hiring was announced, including a 29 percent increase
since the announcement of the TCI deal in June.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, Armstrong _ who once longed to run IBM, another
giant that needed stiff medicine _ will make good on his bid to
become a corporate icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee that 20 years from now the AT&AMP;T's of the
world will even survive,'' said Mark Fowler, a chairman of the FCC
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Armstrong recognizes is that they will have to take some
very bold decisions in terms of changes of direction, committing
capital, changing the culture within the company. Or they may not
be around.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A NEW DAY, BUT THE SAME OLD PAGE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By wILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ The first things that catch your eye are the
brightly colored collector toy trucks, relics of the early 1950s,
symbols of toys he couldn't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Your eyes move to another relic of a time gone by. A sign
announcing: ``Colored Waiting Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Over that, another sign from the same era:
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; NOTICE! Stop. &LR;  Help save the youth of America. Don't buy
Negro Records. If you don't want to serve Negroes in your place of
business then do not have Negro Records on your juke box or listen
to Negro Records on the radio. The screaming idiotic savage music
of these records are undermining the morals of our white youth in
America. Call the advertisers of the radio station that play this
kind of music and complain to them. Don't let your children buy or
listen to these Negro records.''
</P>
<P>
   These are all in the chambers of Justice Alan Page of the
Minnesota Supreme Court: jurist, politician and the greatest
defensive lineman to play for the Vikings. ``The trucks are toys my
parents could never afford,'' he said. ``The signs are there to
remind me. So I don't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Look around the chambers. Bookshelves contain the usual volumes
of case studies and rulings. There are photographs of Page, his
wife and their four children. One shows them all jogging. ``That is
20 years old,'' said Page, who is 53. ``My youngest is 22 years old
now.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few visual trips around the office, you notice that
something is missing. Finally it clicks: no purple and gold. No
Vikings paraphernalia. Page was the leader of the Vikings defensive
line _ a unit nicknamed the Purple People Eaters _ that elevated
the pass rush to such an astonishing level that the National
Football League had to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped calling holding,'' Page said, smiling, ``They
outlawed the head slap.'' In 1971, Page became the first defensive
player to be named the NFL's most valuable player. He played in
four Super Bowls. In 1988, Page was inducted into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Look around his office. No sign of it. How could this be in the
midst of a Vikings renaissance?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't who I was then,'' Page said. ``It's the past, and I
tend not to dwell in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The present is certainly compelling for Page, a former Notre
Dame all-American, the Vikings' first pick in 1967. Shortly after
he retired from football in 1981, Page became an assistant state
attorney for eight years. In 1992, Page ran for the State Supreme
Court and won in a bitter campaign. Last November, Page won
re-election with the highest number of votes cast for any candidate
in a statewide election.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Page's distance from his Vikings past, he is tuned in
to the team and the effect it is having on the state. This season,
he attended the final home game with other former Vikings. The
franchise plays an active role in supporting Page's 10-year-old
education foundation, which gives scholarships to high school
students of color.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all that, Page is connected to the Vikings' bittersweet
Super Bowl legacy: four appearances, four defeats. And the
questions. How could a team with so much talent not win one Super
Bowl? Page can't answer that, but he remembers each loss.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl IV: Kansas City 23, Minnesota 7. ``Against Kansas
City, we tried to be somebody we weren't.'' Super Bowl VII: Miami
24, Minnesota 7. ``We got our buns kicked; we got run out of the
stadium.'' Super Bowl IX: Pittsburgh 16, Minnesota 6. ``Pittsburgh
tried to give it to us everywhere they could; we wouldn't take
it.'' Super Bowl XI: Oakland 32, Minnesota 14. ``Some days it just
doesn't happen,'' Page said. ``That's how I looked at it. Did I
like it? No. You learn how to be a good sport on the outside, but
on the inside did I like losing? No.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Page is fond of saying, this is a new day. The new era
Vikings are as offensively potent as the Page-era teams were
defensively devastating.
</P>
<P>
   This is a new day for Minnesota. In the wake of Page's rousing
victory last November, when he won support from former Democratic
and Republican governors, Minnesota Democrats have asked Page to
run for the United States Senate. ``I don't see the United States
Senate on the horizon,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   But the invitation to run for Senate and Page's landslide
victory say as much about the potential of a new day dawning as the
'`Colored Only'' sign in his chambers said about the old.
</P>
<P>
   In his own understated way, Justice Alan Page is still shedding
blockers. This time he is tackling something far more formidable
than a quarterback, and he's doing it at a Hall of Fame pace.
</P>

THE SOARING JETS MINIMIZE THE MILE HIGH ALTITUDE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Painted in blue on the wall in the visiting locker room
at Mile High Stadium _ which many of the Jets will see for the
first time on Saturday _ is this piece of disquieting information:
</P>
<P>
   ``5,280 Feet''
</P>
<P>
   When John Madden coached the Oakland Raiders, who play here
every year, he theorized that the blatant citation of the local
altitude was a tactic to make his players think they wouldn't be
able to breathe properly over the course of a three-hour game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets don't seem overly concerned about the high-altitude
issue, although they are aware that playing four quarters here on
Sunday for the American Conference championship won't be quite the
same as if they were playing the game in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets arrived Friday afternoon in 50-degree weather, the same
temperature expected on Sunday when they take on the Broncos at 4
p.m., ET, for the right to advance to the Super Bowl. On Saturday,
the Jets will have a light walk-through at the stadium, where a
majestic white bronco towers over the field.
</P>
<P>
   Playing here, with the entire season on the line, is clearly the
biggest hurdle the Jets have faced in their startling season. But
having won in a driving rainstorm in Kansas City, having captured
key division games in front of roaring, hostile crowds in Miami and
Buffalo and New England, having lost only once in the last 12
games, who is to say they can't win here?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not,'' said quarterback Vinny Testaverde, ``get any
louder or more hostile than those places.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, unless Bill Parcells has decided to paper the
locker-room wall, his players will see that mile-high sign again
when they suit up. Perhaps it will unsettle a few players, or
perhaps it won't. Certainly, the 18 Jets who were here for the
opener of the 1996 season might be thinking less about altitude and
more about how far they have come in two years, from being a 1-15
laughingstock to being a 13-4 team playing for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   For the Broncos, that 1996 season opener is significant, too,
because that victory began a winning streak at home that now stands
at 18 games. In some ways, the streak is not that surprising
because the Broncos are the defending Super Bowl champions, armed
with John Elway and Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe. For what it's
worth, there is the thinner air, a factor that probably helps the
Broncos, who are used to it, and may hurt their opponents, who
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lodish, a defensive tackle for the Broncos, has his own
semi-scientific theory about being 5,280 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things make it tough to play here,'' said the nine-year
veteran, who has spent the last four seasons in Denver. ``First is
the altitude. Twelve-play drives are killers on you. Then we have
the crowd noise. This is a loud place to play. And we win here.
Home-field advantage doesn't win games, but we're comfortable and
other teams aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a member of the Jets' medical staff _ Dr. Calvin
Nicholas _ surmised that if a team arrives in Denver and plays
within 24 hours, the players' bodies and oxygen blood level would
remain geared to sea level _ in other words, they would not have a
problem. But if they got here, say, two days in advance, it could
be deleterious. Then it could take up to a week to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets arrived Friday, two days before the game, to satisfy
league rules about the championship game. Other teams this season
arrived the day before. Is this a concern?
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Jets' organization didn't seem to think so.
``They're athletes in very good shape,'' said one member of the
Jets' medical team, referring to the players.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the second-year defensive lineman Jason Ferguson said
that his teammates have been telling him to be ready to take oxygen
on the sidelines Sunday. And all the Jets have been urged this week
to drink a lot of water during their stay in Denver, because
dehydration is speeded up at higher altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more mental,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who studies which way grass on the field bends and can
tell you the wind velocity by looking at the flags, has learned
something about altitude first-hand, because he coached at the Air
Force Academy in Colorado Springs _ elevation, 6,008 feet _ for two
years in the 1970s. He had a blunt summation of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything to be done about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wilber, a sports psychologist with the Sports Science
Division of the United States Olympic Committee in Colorado
Springs, said the best way to adjust to high elevations is to
``arrive as early as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes take seven to 10 days to acclimatize to altitude,''
Wilber said. ``Teams take the approach of arriving 48 hours in
advance. Surely, they will be feeling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I should note that Denver, at 5,280 feet, would be
classified as low to moderate. It's not as if they were going to
Pike's Peak or Everest.'' &QL;

FEDS WILL TRY AGAIN FOR MOB CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Worcester federal jury that couldn't reach a verdict
this week against nine men charged in a violent plot to seize
control of the New England Mafia offered this advice to
prosecutors: Try again, only this time make it simple.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors who handed the FBI and federal prosecutors their first
setback after a wave of convictions that have decimated the
Patriarca crime family during the past decade said all but a few of
their panel peers wanted to convict, but the holdouts were troubled
by the complexity of the case and what they saw as a lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They proved their case to me and it was frustrating not to
reach a verdict,'' said a male juror who was among three jurors who
spoke to the Globe on the condition of anonymity. ``But I think
they should drop some of the case to make it less complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should focus on the charges they most want to
convict them on. It's almost like they threw up a bunch of stuff to
see if it would stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after jurors were dismissed Tuesday after returning
only partial verdicts in the case against Mob capo regime Robert
``Bobby'' Carrozza and eight other men, one female juror asked the
court for permission to speak to the FBI and another asked to talk
to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Nathaniel Gorton granted the requests over
objections from defense lawyers, noting that jurors have a right to
speak to anyone they please. He declined to identify the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and federal prosecutors wouldn't reveal Friday whether
they had talked to jurors.
</P>
<P>
   But several jurors, who spoke to the Globe on the condition of
anonymity, said some members of the panel wanted the government to
know that most of them favored convicting the defendants of
racketeering and conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of people wanting their opinions to be
heard and wanting them to know how they felt,'' said a female juror
who also said she hasn't spoken to either side about the case, but
was tempted. She said she voted to convict on the unresolved
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the evidence was there and they are dangerous people
who shouldn't be on the street, so it is very frustrating to leave
there without a decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had alleged that Carrozza, while serving a
19-year racketeering sentence in a federal prison, recruited eight
men who didn't belong to the Mafia for a violent plot to oust
reputed Mafia Boss Francis Salemme.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleged that they not only belonged to a
racketeering enterprise _ the Mafia _ but that the defendants also
formed a conspiracy to murder Salemme and 13 men loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Romano, of East Boston, was accused of offering $5,000
to $15,000 for each murder. Three men ended up dead.
</P>
<P>
   But after listening to 120 witnesses and reviewing 300 exhibits,
jurors returned only one guilty verdict. They convicted Anthony
Ciampi of running an illegal poker game in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeCologero of Burlington and Christopher Puopolo of East
Boston were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just too much to consider,'' said the male juror who
favored conviction. ``I think there was a question about is it a
conspiracy and also whether there was an enterprise and what is the
difference and how do they interact.''
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern said prosecutors don't consider the
jury's verdict a defeat. They plan to retry Carrozza, Romano,
Ciampi, Vincent ``Gigi'' Marino, John J. Patti III, Eugene ``Gino''
Rida Jr., and Nazzaro Ralph Scarpa on each of the charges on which
the jury deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress passed the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act) law in part to get at sophisticated organized
crime activity . . . By its very nature, these cases can be
complicated with a variety of twists and turns,'' Stern said. ``Our
objective is to make it understandable to the jury, but also offer
a full and complete picture of the criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said the Carrozza case differed from the
successful racketeering cases brought by the New England Organized
Crime Strike Force and the FBI over the past 13 years. Those cases
sent more than 40 Patriarca crime family members to prison.
</P>
<P>
   While the other cases relied heavily on electronic surveillance
of mobsters boasting about their criminal exploits, the Carrozza
case was built on the testimony of admitted criminals who cut deals
with the government for their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Martin G. Weinberg, a Boston attorney who represented then Mob
Boss Raymond ``Junior'' Patriarca in a 1990 racketeering indictment
and represents Ciampi in the Carrozza case, said, ``The government
is having trouble, and not only in Worcester, proving these
elaborate RICO charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racketeering law should not be routinely applied, because
although it carries certain technical advantages for the
government, it inevitably leads to these lengthy, costly and
confusing trials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three jurors said some members of their panel didn't believe
the government proved that the crimes were connected to the Mafia
and didn't believe they should consider testimony from witnesses
who offered second-hand information about crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain parts of it were confusing,'' said a male juror who
favored acquittal on many counts. ``I don't feel it was cut and
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The juror said he wouldn't vote for conviction on any count that
relied on the testimony of a witness without corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any jury wants to see solid evidence. People need to sleep at
night,'' the juror said. ``In other cases, there have been
wiretaps. The more solid case, the better case you have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if they retry the same case before any 12 people, they
would probably end up with a hung jury.''

NAVY WILL ACCEPT MORE RECRUITS WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a shortage of sailors at sea, the Navy
announced Friday that it would have to lower educational standards
for new recruits as part of a series of initiatives to increase
enlistments.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, the Navy has required that 95
percent of new recruits have a high school diploma, but for the
first time in a decade, it will require no more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig ordered the changes in the
wake of one of the Navy's worst recruiting efforts in years. Last
fall, the Navy fell short of its annual recruiting goal for the
first time since the draft ended in 1973, and it did so
disastrously, enlisting 12 percent fewer recruits than it needed.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in recruiting _ which has also hit the Army and,
to a lesser extent, the Air Force and the Marine Corps _ has forced
the Navy to send ships to sea with less than full crews. In recent
weeks, the Navy disclosed Friday, it has had as many as 22,000
empty positions _ or bunks _ in its 327-ship fleet. Most shortages
have come on ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The services attribute the shortages in new recruits to a
variety of factors, from a booming economy and low unemployment
rate to the fact that 70 percent of young people go straight to
college after finishing high school, compared with less than half a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy's response is certain to provoke criticism that the
service is lowering the standards of its enlisted sailors. The Army
faced sharp attacks from Congress when it announced a similar
change two years ago. The Marine Corps continues to require at
least 95 percent of enlistees to have diplomas. The Air Force also
has a minimum standard of 90 percent but for the last 15 years has
never fallen below 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Buyer, R-Ind., who is chairman the House
subcommittee on military personnel, responded Friday by saying that
he was ``deeply concerned'' about the recruiting problems facing
the services and the impact those problems were having on the
military's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am pleased the Navy is working to address these
issues,'' Buyer said in a statement, ``I have very deep
reservations about any action which results in the lowering of
recruitment standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its changes late on a Friday before a holiday
weekend, a time traditionally used to disclose unpleasant news, the
Navy emphasized that it had decided not to lower its standards for
aptitude. Instead, the Navy noted that some young people drop out
of high school for a variety of reasons but nonetheless prove to be
good recruits because of innate intelligence or hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high school diploma is an important validation of ability to
succeed,'' the Navy's announcement said. ``It is not, however, the
`be all' or `end all' of a potential recruit's measure of worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy estimated that by not requiring a diploma, it could
recruit 2,600 more new enlistees to help it reach this year's goal
of 53,224.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the education standards, the Navy announced a
series of initiatives to entice more young people to sign up and
stay in once they join. The Navy plans to increase its enlistment
bonuses and the money it gives for college tuition, as the Army did
last year when it increased tuition grants to $50,000 from $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy also said it would make it easier for experienced
sailors to re-enlist even if they did not qualify for promotion. It
pledged not to immediately discharge sailors who failed tough new
fitness tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's announcement has come as the Clinton administration
has faced criticism from Republicans who argue that budget
constraints have robbed the Pentagon of the resources it needs.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding the advice of the military chiefs and of Secretary of
Defense William Cohen, President Clinton has proposed $110 billion
in new Pentagon spending during the next six years. Included are
increases in pay and pensions aimed at persuading young men and
women to join the military and then stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, with 372,000 officers and enlisted personnel, needs
160,000 sailors to fill its ships at sea. The shortages have left
some ships, including aircraft carriers and submarines, at less
than 90 percent strength.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig, who took over as secretary in November, said the
shortages did not necessarily hurt ``readiness'' for combat. Still,
he said, crews were being forced to do double duty or to work in
areas outside their specialties.

CELTICS INTERESTED IN MICHAEL STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Michael Stewart has a decision to make. Two teams are
very interested in signing him and he has to choose which one he
likes. One team plays its home games close to the North End. The
other plays in Northern California. By Tuesday _ perhaps sooner _
Stewart will be the starting center for one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Which one? That's the question of the next 72 hours. Rick Pitino
certainly has a large Celtics jersey ready for the 6-foot-10-inch
Stewart. The Celtics president-coach hopes the 23-year-old free
agent will choose to wear it rather than the purple-and-black garb
of the Sacramento Kings, whom Stewart played for in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   It is now apparent that the Celtics are pursuing Stewart, most
likely by using their $1.75 million exception as a starting point
for a contract. As of Friday, the Celtics and Kings were Stewart's
top suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has an affinity for the Kings because he was their ball
boy as a teenager and attended college at the University of
California in Berkeley, just over an hour from Sacramento. But the
Kings are unsettled in several areas. They have ownership woes,
basketball operations chief Geoff Petrie was recently talked out of
resigning, former coach Eddie Jordan was fired after only one
season, and they still have to find a way to sign forward Corliss
Williamson and Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted Friday, Pitino confirmed that he is interested in
acquiring Stewart. But he did not mention any specifics. ``We're
looking at a lot of options right now,'' he said. ``We certainly
have a lot of work to do yet. But Stewart is someone we've been
looking at for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Stewart's agent, Bill Duffy, were unsuccessful.
But it is known that Stewart would like to have his contract
situation resolved before camps officially open next week (most
likely Tuesday). It is also known that the Celtics are far beyond
the initial stages of courtship when it comes to Stewart.
Apparently, they have told him he is the man they want in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   A few things make Stewart attractive to the Celtics. He weighs
only 230 pounds but he is a legitimate center. He averaged 6.6
rebounds per game last season and was one of the NBA's top
shot-blockers, rejecting an average of 2.4 in 81 games. That
shot-blocking mark was seventh in the league. Stewart had 11 fewer
blocks than San Antonio's Tim Duncan and averaged more than Miami's
Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   If he does become a Celtic, Stewart will find himself at the
free throw line a lot after practice. He was among the league's
worst free throw shooters last season, making just over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino will worry about the shooting later. In Stewart, he
would have a center with the athleticism to play his running and
trapping style. More important, he would have a defensive presence
at the center spot. Scan the Celtics' roster and you will find no
one with a reputation as a shot-blocker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to signing Stewart, the Celtics would like to find a
way to re-sign forward Popeye Jones. Those signings would
immediately improve their defense. Boston had the fewest defensive
rebounds in the NBA last season. Obviously, the Celtics would like
to change those numbers. But first they have to reorder their
salary cap numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $1.3 million will become available when Pervis Ellison is
declared out for the season in the next couple of days. Ellison is
still bothered by his surgically repaired right ankle. Because of
his injury, the Celtics will be permitted to use half his salary to
sign someone else (they cannot, however, combine the $1.3 million
with the $1.75 million exception).
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is still a possibility of the Celtics making a
trade. At this point, they would be interested in even the most
minor deal, just so they can clear some additional cap space.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Celtics wait. Stewart will make a decision in the
next couple of days. The Celtics hope he makes the decision that
will require him to board a plane leaving the West Coast, heading
east.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team will hold four free ``Meet the Celtics'' open practice
sessions starting next Saturday from 7:30-9:30 p.m. at New
Hampshire College in Manchester, N.H. Ticket distribution will
begin at the school Tuesday from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. The other sessions
will be at the FleetCenter Jan. 24, the Worcester Centrum Jan. 28,
and the Providence Civic Center Feb. 1.

AMA JOURNAL EDITOR DISMISSED OVER SEX SURVEY ARTICLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association dismissed the editor of its
leading journal on Friday, saying he had rushed through a paper on
whether college students think oral sex is ``having sex'' in order
to influence President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the executive vice president of
the American Medical Association, said the incident, which aroused
strong criticism from some medical researchers and journal editors,
had followed what he said was a steady erosion of his faith in the
editor, Dr. George D. Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   Although Anderson would not be specific, others said that
Lundberg had nettled many in the medical community over the years
when he published controversial articles.
</P>
<P>
   The paper that proved to be Lundberg's downfall was by Dr. June
Machover Reinisch, the former director of the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University. In
it, Dr. Reinisch concluded that in an eight-year-old survey of
college students, 59 percent said that oral sex did not constitute
``having sex.'' The article will appear in the Jan. 20 issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said in a statement that he had dismissed Lundberg
because by publishing Dr. Reinisch's article now, Lundberg ``has
threatened the historic tradition and integrity of the Journal of
the American Medical Association by inappropriately and inexcusably
interjecting JAMA into a major political debate that has nothing to
do with science or medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Anderson said that ``there was an
acceleration of the timing'' in the publication of the paper. He
added: ``I happen to believe that Dr. Lundberg was focused on
sensationalism here, not science. It grieves me greatly that that
magnificent journal that should be about science and medicine has
been used to extract political leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Anderson also said that ``over time, however,
I have lost confidence and trust in Dr. Lundberg's ability to
preserve that high level of trust and credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, reached at his home, where he is recovering from a
broken elbow, said he could not comment other than to say that
Anderson called him at 8:15 a.m. on Friday and told him he was no
longer editor of the journal. ``My attorney has me under wraps,''
Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The journal, under Lundberg's 17-year term as editor, has taken
strong positions on subjects like the dangers of tobacco and the
public health threat posed by violence. It has also published
articles that made some in the medical community wince. These
included a recent series of articles on alternative medicine; a
paper claiming, with what some said was weak evidence, that eating
fish slashes the risk of sudden death from heart disease; a paper
by an 11-year-old girl who reported that therapeutic touch was a
sham, and an anonymous essay by a doctor who told of how he took it
upon himself to kill a cancer patient to relieve her suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it was more or less inevitable that Lundberg would
lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me,'' said Dr. Richard Smith, the editor of
the British Medical Journal, who emphasized that he admires and
supports Lundberg. ``I had almost been waiting for it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The current paper, by Dr. Reinisch, was different from other
controversial articles, however, because it was not even a new
study. The paper made it clear that the survey's main conclusions
were published previously; the oral sex part was, apparently,
leftover data.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reinisch could not be reached for comment, but she told The
Washington Times on Thursday that she had thought of submitting a
paper on the oral sex findings to a journal last year, but then
changed her mind because, she said, she thought the Clinton sex
scandal ``would only last two weeks or so,'' whereas ``it usually
takes six months to a year to get scientific papers published.''
When the oral sex issue did not go away, Dr. Reinisch said, she
decided it would be ``irresponsible'' not to publish her data. So
she sent a paper to the Journal of the American Medical Association
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the paper has a certain news value now that it would
not have had if it were published before or after the Clinton sex
scandal, medical experts said. But the question remains, Why did
Lundberg decide to publish it? It typically takes six weeks to six
months from the time an article is submitted until it is published,
according to a staff member at the American Medical Association.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (FOLLOWING GRAFS OPTIONAL)
</P>
<P>
   Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University
who is a member of the editorial board at the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said he could think of two reasons.
Both tied into the impeachment hearings
</P>
<P>
   ``One is that he has a genuine belief that this is the most
important political decision in this century and every bit of
evidence on it should be published,'' Reinhardt said. The other, he
said, is that the subject is suddenly of news value. And the
journal, likes others, he added, ``loves being noticed in the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that it was his decision to dismiss Lundberg and
that he had made it despite an outcry from his own editorial board.
One member of that board, Dr. Jack D. Barchas of Cornell University
Medical College, said he and others called Anderson to try to stop
him from removing Lundberg. ``We were begging him to reconsider,''
Barchas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us feel anger, outrage, and a sense of betrayal by the
decision,'' Barchas said. Lundberg, he added, ``has been fearless
in publishing papers, even controversial papers, based on the best
tradition of science and the best tradition of peer review.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine, which is the chief competitor of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said her journal would never have
published the sex survey paper because ``it is trivial _ who cares
what a bunch of college students say'' about whether oral sex is
sex, she said. ``It also is irrelevant to the Clinton case,'' she
added. ``He wasn't asked the question in that context.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, Lundberg's decision to publish the paper ``is not
a reason to fire an editor who's been there 17 years and by almost
anyone's estimation has put a small society that no one took
seriously on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said his office has been deluged by callers
expressing support.
</P>
<P>
   One was Robert W. Seligson, who is the executive vice president
and chief executive of the North Carolina Medical Society.
Anderson, he said in a telephone interview, ``was careful and
decisive in doing the right thing.'' He said he has the utmost
confidence in Anderson who is ``very knowledgeable about the issues
and doesn't shoot from the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry L. Greene II, who is the executive vice president of
the Massachusetts Medical Society, also supported Anderson. He said
it is a publisher's role ``to take action,'' if he feels the
journal's integrity is threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (THE REST IS OPTIONAL)
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, in England, expressed dismay at the furor over the
sex paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the whole of the United States is going
mad with this impeachment thing,'' he said. ``There's something
crazy about the society.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Smith added, when Lundberg finally was dismissed, ``it's
probably no accident that this was about sex.''

WHY BRAZIL DID WHAT IT DID AND CAUSED SUCH AN UPROAR

 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Brazil drew a line in the sand in front of its
embattled currency, the real. On Friday it erased that line,
sending the sand scattering, as it allowed the real to trade freely
against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   That abrupt reversal came after investors doubted the Brazilian
government's ability to defend the currency following the
resignation of Brazil's hard-money central bank chief, Gustavo
Franco, and the 9 percent devaluation in the real's value on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's surprise move, the real tumbled another 8
percent, but stock markets from Toronto to Santiago, Chile, surged
in apparent relief that Brazil would no longer waste billions of
dollars propping up the currency. For a day, at least, Brazil did
not threaten to spin out of control, taking the rest of Latin
America down with it.
</P>
<P>
   But throwing in the towel on its old policy of pegging the real
to the dollar is only a stopgap. Now the Brazilian government and
international finance policy-makers must wrestle with what comes
next.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has the same choices that other countries with tottering
currencies have had. It can continue allowing the currency to trade
freely, or it can try to set a new trading range and maintain that
range by buying reis in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could follow the more radical example of its neighbor
Argentina, and set up a currency board, which would peg the real to
the dollar at a fixed rate of exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Such options are likely to be discussed this weekend, when
Brazil's finance minister and central bank chief meet in Washington
with officials from the International Monetary Fund and the U.S.
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Brazil's decision, it will reverberate throughout the
world. The impact will be felt most heavily in Argentina, Brazil's
biggest trading partner and, like Brazil, a country that has only
recently recovered from years of hyperinflation. Should the
Brazilian currency be allowed to trade freely, it is unclear how
the Argentine peso could keep its dollar peg when most of its
exports and imports will be priced in a currency that can fluctuate
wildly in value. Currency volatility is the last thing Latin
American economies need, as they enter a period of slowing growth
and rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   For American investors and businesses, the Brazilian eruption is
the latest chapter in a contagious currency crisis that started in
Thailand in July 1997 and spread as far as Russia last summer. If
the turmoil leads to a prolonged downturn on Wall Street or cuts
heavily into American exports, the robust economy in the United
States could turn anemic. Here is a brief guide to what is at stake
and what might happen next:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is Brazil so important?
</P>
<P>
   A. Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America, about twice
as big as Mexico's. While it buys just 3 percent of U.S. exports,
its economic health is vital to a region that accounts for
one-fifth of U.S. exports. But Brazil looms even larger in the
minds of international investors for the simple reason that it was
one of the last large countries to go down the road of free trade,
privatization and hard money. If that approach fails in Brazil, the
ideal of a unified global economy knit together by trade and
investment is threatened. That is one reason that the IMF cobbled
together one of the biggest rescue packages in history, and one
factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates in
the United States three times last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's a devaluation?
</P>
<P>
   A. Both devaluation and depreciation refer to a decline in the
value of a currency. The distinction is this: When a government has
declared that it is pegging its currency to another and will defend
it by any means necessary but lets it fall anyway, that is a
devaluation. When the falling currency is that of a country that
allows the market to set its value and its value falls, that is a
depreciation. One involves a broken promise; the other doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   When Brazil announced its devaluation, overseas investors saw it
as a sign that the government was caving in to political pressure
from unions and big business to put its anti-inflation strategy on
the back burner and to fight unemployment instead.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did Brazilians make the choices they made?
</P>
<P>
   A. Brazil pegged its currency to the dollar in the first place
as a way of convincing investors at home and abroad that it would
no longer tolerate the chronic inflation that has plagued it for
decades. When the so-called Real Plan was enacted in 1994,
inflation was running at running at more than 5,000 percent. Like
Russia and scores of other developing countries, Brazil had long
financed huge government commitments mainly by printing money
rather than collecting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But fixing the exchange rate and getting inflation down
initially proved easier than scaling back government commitments.
Brazil has a social security system that allows workers to retire
after 20 years, often with pensions higher than the pay workers
were earning on the job. What's more, it takes the equivalent of a
constitutional amendment to lay off public workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Brazil's economy has been stagnating,
unemployment has risen to nearly a record 8 percent, exports are
falling and the trade deficit is way up. Tight money was not only
hurting exporters by keeping the currency strong but was keeping
interest rates high (around 30 percent). Remember the early 1980s,
when the United States had a big budget deficit and the Federal
Reserve's chairman, Paul Volcker, declared war on inflation?
Interest rates were sky high, the dollar was very strong and
American manufacturers were screaming murder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Brazil's industrialists and unions are the ones who are
screaming. They want a weaker currency to stimulate exports by
making them more competitive on the world market _ even at the cost
of more inflation, lately running less than 3 percent a year.
Newspapers in Sao Paulo, the industrial center of Brazil, have been
calling for Franco's head for months.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did Brazil hope to accomplish?
</P>
<P>
   A. The devaluation was supposed to buy time. If investors had
gone along, bond prices might have stabilized or gone up, interest
rates might have leveled off or fallen, and exports might have
received a lift. But the strategy fell apart almost as soon as it
was introduced for the same reason it failed in Thailand, Russia
and elsewhere. Investors at home and abroad simply were not
convinced that the first devaluation would be the last. They saw it
as a sign of more to come. Any investor holding a currency she
thought was going to be worth less tomorrow would sell immediately.
</P>
<P>
   With foreigners and, increasingly, domestic investors taking
large positions against the real, Brazil faced a nasty choice. It
could try to stem the tide by using its hard currency reserves.
Unlike Mexico in 1994 or Russia in 1998, Brazil had roughly $40
billion in reserves as well as a $30 billion credit line from the
IMF. Or it could let the currency fall to whatever value the market
placed on it, making no promises to exchange it for dollars at a
particular rate or to defend it if it fell below a certain level.
It chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are Brazil's options now?
</P>
<P>
   A. A jet flying at 40,000 feet can fall 10,000 feet and still
avoid disaster if the pilot manages to regain control of the
aircraft. Everything depends on Brazil's regaining control of its
economic policy. For the moment, at least, it has. But to resolve
its currency crisis, Brazilian policy-makers must choose among
several long-term strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil could simply announce a new fixed rate _ or more
accurately a new range of rates _ tied to the dollar to replace the
old range of rates. As with the old regime, the new currency system
could be devalued by a specified, tiny amount every few days, but
no more than that. The central bank would promise to use monetary
policy and foreign exchange reserves to support the value of the
currency in the foreign exchange market. But this would work only
if Brazil could keep investors convinced that it was going to keep
its promises more faithfully in the future.
</P>
<P>
   With good reason, the finance minister of Mexico noted at the
height of his country's currency crisis that only the most extreme
exchange rate regimes _ in other words, those that essentially
remove any discretion _ truly rule out the threat of speculative
attacks. A permanent floating rate, the system that the United
States and most other rich countries have embraced, is one such
extreme. The other, chosen by Argentina and a number of former
Soviet republics, is to adopt a system that virtually rules out
devaluation by putting foreign exchange policy in the hands of a
currency board.
</P>
<P>
   Letting your currency fluctuate with supply and demand has the
definite advantage of allowing the currency to adjust to shocks
like, say, a collapse in commodity prices. Further, a country does
not risk speculative attack because it has not promised to exchange
its currency for a specified amount of dollars. Alas, Brazil isn't
a good candidate for a permanent floating exchange rate scheme.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, where Brazil goes, Argentina must follow.
Argentina, Brazil's biggest trading partner and a fellow recovering
inflation addict, would be forced to abandon its fixed rate
currency strategy _ a strategy that seems to be working well and
one that lots of investors are counting on.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government's huge domestic debt, around $270
billion, also poses an obstacle. Because the government could not
persuade investors to lend it money except by providing very short
maturities and promising to index much of the debt to dollars,
every time the exchange rate falls, the government's obligations
jump. A major decline in the currency would result in instant
default, just as it did in Russia last summer or in Mexico in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for Brazil, a currency board, is the most
radical, but has some strong supporters both within Brazil's
central bank and in the IMF. It is a desperate measure that
involves giving up all pretense of controlling one's own currency
and in effect replacing the central bank with a board that includes
some foreigners. On the other hand, Argentina, which has such a
board, has been able to borrow on world markets at the modest rate
of 8 percent this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under a currency board, the supply of reis in circulation would
have to be fully backed by dollars and convertible, on demand, at a
fixed rate of exchange. In effect, Brazil would be handing over
control of its money supply _ which would fluctuate with the amount
of dollars available _ to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Currency boards have long been considered an appropriate
strategy for small economies that rely heavily on international
trade. They do not eliminate the need to solve the fiscal
imbalance, but simply take away the option of printing more money
to finance shortfalls _ yet another hard choice for Brazil.

INTERNET STOCK ROCKETS 474 PERCENT IN INITIAL OFFER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an indication that investors remain manic for new
Internet stocks, the price of Marketwatch.com, the operator of a
popular financial news site on the World Wide Web, rose more than
474 percent Friday, its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that advance came on the first trade. The
2.75-million-share issue, offered to investors through an
underwriting group led by BT Alex. Brown Inc. and Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp., was initially priced at $17 a share,
slightly above the expected $14 to $16.
</P>
<P>
   When the shares were reoffered, their first trade was at $90 a
share, an increase of 429 percent. Of recent initial public
offerings for Internet companies, only Theglobe.com had a bigger
percentage gain on the first trade from its initial price, rising
605 percent on the opening when it was offered to investors last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The move was just the latest illustration of a voracious
appetite for Internet stocks that has become almost commonplace in
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, seven new Internet stocks have seen their
opening prices shoot up 100 percent or more above their initial
offering prices, said Francis Gaskins, editor of Gaskins IPO
Desktop, an online service based in Los Angeles. Of those, six
finished the first day with gains of 100 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rocketed still higher, peaking at $130. It closed at
$97.50, up $80.50, on the day. Trading volume in the stock was more
than 9.6 million shares, which means that each share sold changed
hands more than three times during the day.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which represented 22 percent of the company, raised
$46.75 million for Marketwatch.com. But when the dust had settled
at the end of Friday's trading session, the company's market
capitalization was more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to be a hot deal, but the opening was a
surprise to everyone,'' said Peony Kao, an analyst at Renaissance
Capital Corp. in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Marketwatch.com has no dearth of online competitors, including
financial news Web sites created by organizations like Dow Jones,
CNN and CNBC; general online services like America Online and
Microsoft, which provide access to financial and business news and
services, and Web sites aimed at satisfying business, finance and
investing needs, like Thestreet.com and Motley Fool.
</P>
<P>
   But in large measure, Marketwatch.com, which was created last
year, generated enthusiasm because of its original owners, CBS
Corp. and Data Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Friday's offering, CBS and Data Broadcasting each owned
half of Marketwatch.com, and each retained a 38 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its parent companies, it has great leverage,'' Ms. Kao
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most fledgling companies on the Web, Marketwatch.com has
a commitment from CBS to provide it with $30 million worth of
marketing on CBS-owned media from now through October 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising deal is invaluable,'' said Paul Cook, lead
portfolio manager of Munder Capital's Netnet Fund. ``The ability to
cross-pollinate the two media is remarkable, particularly in sports
and financial news.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the marketing agreement, Marketwatch.com is
licensed to use the CBS name and logo, as well as its news content.
The company has more than 40 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   And its Web site is attracting visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
company said there were nearly 2.2 million visitors to the site in
October, up from 785,000 in March.
</P>
<P>
   But profitability is something that has not yet been achieved.
Marketwatch.com lost $3.6 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 on
revenue of $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   For a day at least, financial data and balance sheets were
immaterial, as far as investors were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized that with the small number of shares being
offered there would be an imbalance between supply and demand,''
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought $50 a share would be a really good reception,
and that I could pick it up in the aftermarket at $25 to $30. At
$97.50, I am going to wait for a better price to get in.''

Klaassen family of Kansas fell victim to a tax law that was

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Even in a city is that is proud to be called the
snow capital of America, where residents say they feel joyful when
the first white blanket forms over Lake Erie, enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mounds of snow are so high here that storefronts and homes are
barely visible from the street. Talk radio has become the means of
communication for people trapped in their homes _ some of them for
nearly a week _ and in need of a snowplow. Despite it all, the mail
did get delivered. Of course, on the east and west sides of town
that meant carriers parked their trucks at a passable intersection
and blaring their horns, alerting residents to run out and collect
their letters.
</P>
<P>
   So while much of the Northeast coped with freezing rain, slush,
sleet and eventually sunshine on Friday, this city of 300,000
contended with its 14th consecutive day of snow _ with total
accumulations approaching 60 inches _ and flakes still falling
throughout the day, though expected to cease on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people in Buffalo are getting pretty sick of this snow,''
said Stacie Simmons, as she undertook what has become a two-hour
ritual of shoveling her driveway. ``At first I thought it was
great,'' she said, referring to the snow. ``But now, my nerves are
wearing thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have declared a state of emergency for much of the
metropolitan area, and driving bans have been imposed so that
government plows can work to keep major streets and highways clear.
Roofs have collapsed at dozens of homes, barns and businesses under
the weight of the relentless icy snow; pipes have erupted in
countless homes, causing water damage, and some residents say they
have not been able to receive heating oil because of impassable
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Almost miraculously, no serious injuries have been reported, but
a 9-year-old boy playing on the edge of Lake Erie fell through thin
ice and had to be rescued by two firefighters who jumped from a
helicopter. He was released from a hospital with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   For stores, keeping food in stock on store shelves has become
increasingly difficult, and keeping shovels and snowblowers in
hardware stores has been impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the sight of snowplow operators like David
Giambia, exhausted after long stretches of pushing mountains of
snow, are the only ray of sunshine they have seen all month. He
said teams of people like him are working around the clock, but
with at least five inches of snow falling from one day to the next,
sometimes their work seems futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not look as bad as a flood out here, but if you live on
one of these small streets, this is a real disaster,'' he said,
after taking a break from his work on the west side of town.
``There are people who haven't been able to get out of their homes
for days. They can't go to work. Their kids can't go to school.
Their roofs are caving in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Blizzard of 1977 has snow caused such widespread
panic in Buffalo, where people expect high accumulations in
January. The National Weather Service reported that 59.5 inches of
snow had fallen on Buffalo in the last two weeks _ the highest
two-week total in history and the third highest total ever for an
entire January.
</P>
<P>
   People here said that while the 1977 storm _ which raged for
four days and left 29 people dead _ caused more physical damage,
the current snowfall has caused more strains on city services
because it has gone on, without stopping, for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy fire commissioner, John Sniderhan, said city
officials would be requesting federal disaster relief to help the
city pay for the costs of the effort, an estimated $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the city's snow removal team _ about 80 people
with 15 plows and 30 dump trucks _ some 160 members of the National
Guard and five plow teams from Erie County have been enlisted to
help remove snow. Inmates from minimum security prisons from
throughout the area have been assigned to uncover more than 8,000
city fire hydrants and storm drains.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of drivers from the city engineering office have also been
working to clear snow from sidewalks and crosswalks, and Sniderhan
said, the city bought 1,000 extra shovels for volunteer
organizations including the Boy Scouts and Americorps workers to
help wherever necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logistical nightmare,'' Sniderhan said. ``But with all
these people, we have been able to keep the city open. Most cities
would have been paralyzed by all this snow. But our city is up and
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from the considerable traffic on most city streets, the
planes flying in and out of the airport and the open signs at many
businesses around town, it appeared that Buffalo had found a way to
function even though buried under five feet of snow. Officials said
that no city agencies, except the schools, had been closed during
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in The Buffalo News summed up the city's
attitude. ``Buffalo weather?'' the editorial concluded. ``Hey deal
with it.''

 BUFFALO, N.Y.: with it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than surrendering to the unremitting snow, many
residents, like Dottie and Bob Flynn, strap on their snow boots,
layer on the clothes and work several back-breaking hours a day to
keep their own piece of property clear.
</P>
<P>
   The piles of snow on each side of their driveway are taller than
both of them. About 11 a.m. _ when radio stations reported that the
temperature was about 13 degrees with a windchill that made it feel
like minus 8 _ the couple huffed and groaned as they tried to hoist
more snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' Mrs. Flynn, 58, said, peering out from under the
brim of a baseball cap that was covered by her hood. ``I don't want
to play this game anymore. But it's what you have to do so that you
don't get stuck inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, 62, annoyed that city plows had not traversed his street
in days, said: ``I think the best idea would be to get a whole
bunch of politicians out here talking. The whole block would be
melted in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers at hardware strores around the area said they had no
shovels or snow blowers left in stock. At Home Depot in north
Buffalo, clerks said they sold 33 snowblowers on Thursday in eight
minutes. And the day before they had received a small shipment of
shovels. All were sold in less than half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks at the Wilson Farms convenience store in west Buffalo
said they can hardly keep enough milk, eggs, cheese and bread in
the store. Another big seller, they said, are TV dinners, that went
on sale last week for 99 cents apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man came in and bought 40 TV dinners,'' said Kelly Hunter,
a cashier at the store. ``People want to be ready in case the snow
gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Many food pantries in the area have been forced to close because
volunteers have been stuck at home. Sister Mary Johnice, at St.
Adalbert's on the east side of town, got tired of turning people
away.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers could not reach her church, she said, because the
streets and the church parking lot had not been plowed.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Sister Johnice and two other nuns at the parish
started shoveling the area themselves. On Friday, a dozen others
had joined them, mostly people in the neighborhood who were
inspired by the sight of the nuns struggling against Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a mission to us,'' said Sister Johnice, all of 5
feet tall. ``I decided that I wouldn't ask for help. But I knew if
people saw us cleaning, they would join us.''
</P>
<P>
   News about the snow has made the front page of the daily
newspaper every day for the last two weeks. And it is just about
the only topic of conversation on talk radio, day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Bob from Riverside, complained that they had
not seen a plow in a week. ``I don't think they have any game plan
to deal with this,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Julie of suburban Kenmore, complained about too
many plows. ``They keep me awake all night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some just said they had found ways to forget about the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stay home with a couple of beers,'' said another
listener.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, for the first time in weeks, the main news
on the radio was that the snow would end on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cutler, a spokesman for Mayor Anthony Masiello, said,
``It's like a light at the end of a long, dark tunnel.''

 &HT;    Barr presentation interrupted by trial's first objection
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three paragraphs shy of finishing the presentation
he has waited so long to give, Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) was
interrupted by the first objection of the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the ornate Senate chamber, Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin rose to object to Barr repeatedly referring to the 100
senators as ``jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   The objection dealt with just one word, but it broke the tedium
that had built up over the afternoon and exposed the raw partisan
nerves that have been simmering all along.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's presentation drew an immediate reaction from Democrat Max
Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally embarrassed as a member of the Senate from
Georgia,'' said Cleland, visibly irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said he thought Harkin, who represents Barr's native
state, Iowa, felt ``demeaned'' by Barr's repeated use of a word
that did not fully describe the Senate's duty. He said he
apologized to Harkin afterward for Barr's ``faux pas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nonesense,'' said Barr when asked to respond to
Cleland's comments. ``It's not demeaning, the Senate sits as jury.
Hopefully, there are senators who will listen to substance, not
nitpicky words.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, who praised the House managers for their performance
Thursday, called Friday's session a ``low point.'' He said his
frustration with presentation of the case had been growing before
Barr got up to speak. Cleland said that moments before Barr rose to
speak, he had been reviewing Sen. Robert Byrd's history of the
rules of the Senate and read the line from the U.S. Constitution
which states: ``The trial of all crimes, except in case of
impeachment, shall be by jury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that lesson in Impeachment 101,'' said Cleland, who
has been consulting with University of Georgia historian Peter
Charles Hoffer, author of the book ``Impeachment in America,'' as
preparation for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said that Barr's repitition of the word ``juror'' was
not a small matter _ it was about understanding the role of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland did not conceal his distaste for the aggressive way
House prosecutors delivered their case Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not how you win arguments in the Senate,'' said
Cleland, comparing the Senate, which is known for its diplomatic
air, with the more overtly partisan House.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland was not alone his stern words for Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved the attention span of the United States Senate was
longer than Bob Barr thought it was,'' said Sen. John Breaux
(D-La.), referring to Barr's recent comment about the short
attention span of senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get in trouble whenever I talk about senators,'' Barr said.
``I'm sure if I used the word judge, they'd object to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr's task as one of 13 House prosecutors was to explore the
legal precedents undergirding the impeachment charges of
obstruction of justice and perjury. It was also part of his job to
show how Clinton violated those laws.
</P>
<P>
   He cited several legal cases in his 15-page presentation,
including the prosecution of former Georgia congressman Pat
Swindall, a case that Barr led as U.S. attorney for the Northern
District of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But Barr also tried to recount how the president spun what he
called a ``web of lies'' and encouraged others to lie for him.
</P>
<P>
   Barr suggested that the president sought to encourage former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky to lie to protect him in a
sexual harrassment lawsuit filed by former Arkansas state employee
Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The president called Lewinsky at 2 a.m. on Dec. 17, 1997 to
ostensibly tell her that his personal secretary, Betty Currie, had
just lost her brother in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Barr contended that the president's real reason was to tell
Lewinsky that she was on a witness list put together by the Jones'
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   During this conversation, Barr said, the president suggested she
could file an affadavit to avoid having to testify in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Barr made much of the fact that Clinton could not remember
making that phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said the president and Lewinsky concocted a ``cover story''
to protect each other. ``A cover story between two teen-agers
trying to steal a date without their parents' knowledge is one
thing,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we are not here dealing with two love-struck
teen-agers trying to circumvent their parents' watchful eyes,''
thundered Barr. ``We are dealing with the president of the United
States and a subservient employee, concocting and implementing a
scheme that, while, perhaps not illegal at its inception,
deteriorated into illegality once it left the realm of private lie
to that of public obstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Barr's use of the term juror and Rehnquist's ruling
on it, rather than his arguments against Clinton, that appeared to
elicit the most discussion from senators.
</P>
<P>
   After the day's proceedings, Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) said
Rehnquist's decision gave the Senate more flexibility on such
crucial questions as whether or not to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Juries are expected to hear from witnesses, Dodd said. Not so
with ``triers of fact'' or judges, necessarily. ``It sort of pulls
the rug out from the argument that we are jurors who have to have
witnesses,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the distinction was
meaningless because impeachment was plainly a political, not
strictly judicial, process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you call us a jury, triers of fact, judges and jurors
is irrelevant,'' Hatch said. ``We are all of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch speculated that Harkin may be seeking to lay the ground
for an argument that since senators are not jurors, they do not
have to deliberate in secret. Harkin has been a vocal critic of the
Senate impeachment rule that says Senate deliberations are to be
conducted behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), another House prosecutor, suggested
Harkin had political motives. ``He was just trying to interrupt the
presentation,'' McCollum said. ``He's been very harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) brushed the ruling aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to use the word juror,'' said Graham. ``If
that's the worst thing we do, we'll probably be OK.''

LAKERS' FISHER RIPS WORKOUT NO-SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Del Harris didn't return Friday to watch his team
work out, and that's probably for the best. The Lakers coach might
have gone postal at what he would have seen.
</P>
<P>
   Or in this case, didn't see. As in, didn't see anybody in the
gym.
</P>
<P>
   As in, the guys who disappointed Harris for supposedly loafing
Thursday didn't even show up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Four players _ Derek Fisher, Eddie Jones, Kobe Bryant and Corie
Blount _ made it to Southwest College for voluntary workouts.
That's the lowest attendance of the week after peaking at 13
(counting free agents) the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Only Fisher and Jones played all five days.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team favored to win the NBA title?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just amazes me that we continue to feel like we can just
(turn) it on out of nowhere,'' Fisher said. ``You have to have a
certain approach to the game, and if you don't have that, you
aren't going to be able to go out and compete at the highest level
every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's our inexperience. Maybe because we are so talented
we take it for granted. But in order to be the best, we have to
figure it out at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher hopes it's soon. He's running out of ways to describe his
disappointment, having endured the same thing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much disappointment you can go through,'' he
said. ``We've been off so long that it's amazing that four days
into basically some very light workouts, we're basically taking a
day off. . . . At least just come and show that you want to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The gym is reserved for the weekend, and Fisher and Jones both
plan to return. But it could be a lonely couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the practices will all be mandatory. The NBA's new
labor deal should be completed this weekend, Monday at the latest.
Training camps will open as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Once they do, the Lakers will hold their usual team meeting, and
Fisher _ just 24, but a budding leader on this young team _ will
make his feelings known to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do have some things to address before we even step
foot out on the court,'' he said. ``We have some issues to address
about whether or not people really want to be champions. If we just
want to come together and win a lot of games and then go home,
let's say that at the beginning. . . . If everybody wants to win (a
championship), we all have some sacrifices to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Return to sender: Harris' harsh assessment of his team's
Thursday practice apparently didn't make an impact, if any players
read the comments at all.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches can't talk to players until the lockout is officially
over, but Harris criticized his team's workout to reporters after
Thursday's practice, saying he saw no hustle and no defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Fisher seemed to feel the critique was off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way pickup ball is,'' Jones said. ``It's gonna be a
little rugged. Guys make their own calls, and the game looks
slow-paced.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the tone will change once coaches are on the floor and
once the roster is finalized through trades and free-agent
signings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When's the first game, Feb. 5?'' Jones said. ``When that day
comes around we'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Dribbles: The Lakers' two exhibition games against the Clippers
are set for Jan. 29 at the Forum and Jan. 30 at the Sports Arena.
Admission is free. . . . Fans can meet coaches and the new Laker
Girls today at the Laker Hour, which benefits the Cure for Lymphoma
Foundation. The event runs from noon to 1 p.m. at the Barker
Hangar, 3021 Airport Ave. in Santa Monica. Admission is free.

Klaassen family of Kansas fell victim to a tax law that was
intended to close a loophole for much wealthier taxpayers. How a

moderate earners illustrates how tax policy in Washington can be a

VODAFONE BEATS OUT BELL ATLANTIC IN BID TO BUY AIRTOUCH
COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest mobile phone company, has
agreed to buy Airtouch Communications Inc. for more than $60
billion, edging out Bell Atlantic Corp. in a bidding war for the
nation's largest wireless company, according to people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The terms have not been disclosed. But this will be the largest
cross-border deal ever. It is believed that Vodafone sweetened its
original cash and stock offer with more cash _ to $9 a share _ and
is structuring the deal as a merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, an on-again, off-again suitor of Airtouch, proposed to
buy the company after it was reported two weeks ago that Bell
Atlantic, the largest local phone company in the United States, had
been in talks to acquire Airtouch in a $45 billion stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch's board of directors met Friday to review the two
offers. Bell Atlantic's board of directors met Friday and, said a
person close to those talks, agreed to submit a higher offer than
the $45 billion originally offered, but that offer was rejected.
The higher offer was not disclosed. Bell Atlantic released a
statement Friday night saying it had ended its discussions with
Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the companies will each have an equal number
of seats on the board in the combined entity and that senior
management positions will be equally shared. The chairman of
Airtouch, Sam Ginn, is expected to be named nonexecutive chairman
of the combined entity. Chris Gent, chief executive of Vodafone,
will remain in that post.
</P>
<P>
   An Airtouch-Vodafone combination will create an international
powerhouse. The combined company will dominate throughout Europe.
Vodafone's customers outside Britain are largely in Northern
Europe, including Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch's European operations are mainly in the southern part
of the Continent, including Italy, Spain and Portugal. In all,
international wireless services make up 57 percent of Airtouch's
operating income, according to Deutsche Bank Research. The two
companies compete in Germany and are partners in ventures in both
Sweden and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Vodafone had shunned the U.S. market. In fact, the
company had been in talks earlier this year with Airtouch about
acquiring its European assets. Since splitting from Racal
Electronics, a telecommunications gear and defense electronics
company, in 1988, the company, which is based in Berkshire,
England, has grown into Britain's largest wireless carrier, with
almost 5 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers are attracted to its prices. In the last quarter
of 1998 alone, for instance, the company added more than 930,000
customers, mostly on the attraction of a plan that allows users to
pay as they call, rather than sign a long contract.
</P>
<P>
   A merger with Bell Atlantic, which had been in talks with
Airtouch for some time and already has 5.7 million cellular
customers blanketing the East Coast, would have aided the local
phone company's desire to be a national presence. Bell Atlantic's
bid for Airtouch had the blessing of GTE Corp., which Bell Atlantic
plans to buy this summer in a $52.9 billion stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's offer for Airtouch came two weeks ago when the
company delivered a preliminary proposal to Airtouch over the
weekend of Jan. 3. Vodafone said it would consider buying the
company for stock worth about $90 a share plus $5 to $6 in cash.
The price was higher than Bell Atlantic's offer, which at the time
was valued at $45 billion. But Ginn had earlier said he liked the
Bell Atlantic currency.

ONLINE CHATROOMS, CLINTON TRIAL HAVE THIS IN COMMON: OBSESSION WITH
SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ One of them begs for naughty pictures. Another jokes
about the joys of nude dancing and tries to cajole a woman into
trying it. Others jump in to share what they regard as the
titillating rewards of wearing mini skirts.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation in this online chatroom is a lot like President
Clinton's impeachment trial. With a few exceptions, it always seems
to come back to one subject: sex.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, I peeked into two chatrooms to find out what my fellow
Arizonans are saying about this week's proceeding in the Senate
chamber. The Town Square-Arizona chatroom on America Online seemed
like the perfect place for civic-minded people to discuss
Washington scandals.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was updating its members with minute-by-minute
news flashes on Clinton's fate, and that of the nation. Consider
these actual headlines:
</P>
<P>
   ``House Prosecutors Wrap Up Second Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton Wants Big Tax Hike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survey: Impeachment or Michael Jordan?``
</P>
<P>
   After eavesdropping on the virtual conversation for a few
minutes, it becomes embarrassingly obvious that no one has read
those stories and that they have other things on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, I announce my presence and interrupt the banter to
ask their thoughts on President Clinton. At first, no one responds.
But after a few minutes, a few of the chatroom participants forward
``instant messages'' - via separate private screens - and relay
their personal views on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   One chatroom participant makes this observation: ``We're all
obsessed with sex, just as the president is, just as members of
Congress are, just as anyone reading your paper is. It's human
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, who goes by the screen name, GregL33, says: ``Actually,
I think it's quite embarrassing. The rest of the world wants to
know why we are making such a big deal out of it . . . I think if
someone wants to punish him, that they come up with a better way. I
don't pay my taxes to have them spent on such trivial things.''
</P>
<P>
   GregL33 goes on to say he's a federal employee home with the flu
and trying to pass the time away. ``This is much more fun'' than
the Clinton trial, he writes. ``But, I'm also watching
Speedvision!''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Internet chat veers off the subject. One person
asks the chatroom visitors about their favorite soap opera. A few
even answer the question. But within seconds everyone is back to
discussing the group's favorite topic.
</P>
<P>
   One man tells the group that he's in the market for a cool gray
suit and needs the names of stores - just before complimenting a
fellow chatter on her ``great legs.''
</P>
<P>
   In a chatroom called Tucson, the conversation is the same. When
I drop in, a man (at least he identifies himself as a man) is
defending his honor. ``I'm a horny _- guy but I have a heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reference to President Clinton in this chatroom comes
when one writer, in a crude allusion to Monica Lewinsky, cautions
another not to ``stain her dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied that my chatroom visits have tapped into the virtual
pulse of America, I prepare to sign off, when I discover that my
foray into Internet reporting has come at a cost. Online porn
vendors have apparently recorded my presence in these chatrooms and
have begun sending me a barrage of pornographic pitches inviting to
visit their ``naughty'' and presumably apolitical websites.

   GLOBAL STOCK MARKETS SOAR AS BRAZIL FLOATS CURRENCY
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets around the world climbed as Brazil decided to let
its currency float. The news sent Brazil's Bovespa index higher by
34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average soared 219.62 points, or 2.41
percent, to 9,340.55. It closed lower for the week, however, after
setting a new high of 9,643.32 Jan. 8. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 31.07 points, or 2.56 percent, to 1,243.26, or
just 31.83 points lower than its high of 1,275.09, also set Jan. 8.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index jumped 31 points, or
2.56 points, to 2,348.20. The Nasdaq had set a new high of 2,384.59
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market snapped a three-day rally, faltering as strong
gains in stocks worldwide reduced demand for the safe haven of
Treasury securities. The 30-year Treasury bond fell, while its
yield rose to 5.12 percent, from 5.05 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION ROSE 0.2 PERCENT LAST MONTH
</P>
<P>
   Production by the nation's mines, factories and utilities
increased two-tenths of a percent in December and managed its most
vigorous quarterly gain of the year during the final three months
of 1998. For all of 1998, industrial production grew only 3.7
percent, down from 6 percent in 1997, the Federal Reserve reported.
In another report, the Commerce Department said business
inventories in November rose four-tenths of a percent, to a
seasonally adjusted $1.088 trillion, following a two-tenths of a
percent advance in October.
</P>
<P>
   TAXES ENRAGE CHINA'S FARMERS
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chinese farmers demonstrating against taxes imposed
by local officials clashed with hundreds of police officers in a
small town in southern China last week. It was the latest and
perhaps largest in a series of farmer and worker protests that have
sprung up around China in the last year as the country confronts an
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO BUYS A 13 PERCENT STAKE IN SCANIA
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, the Swedish car, bus and truck maker, has acquired a 13
percent stake in a rival Swedish truck manufacturer, Scania, for
5.2 billion kronor ($666.5 million) and said it wanted to take over
the entire company. Leif Johansson, Volvo's chief executive, said
neither company could sit on the sidelines while other automakers
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   2 SPANISH BANKS IN MERGER DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Spain's largest bank, Banco Santander, is buying that nation's
third-largest bank, Banco Central Hispano, for stock valued at
$11.3 billion. The combined bank will have assets of 239 billion
euros, now $277 billion.
</P>
<P>
   STRONG YEN HURTING JAPAN RECOVERY
</P>
<P>
   The strong yen is threatening to stifle any economic revival in
Japan even though the government has intervened in the currency
market to lower it.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO INCREASES NUMBER OF JOB CUTS
</P>
<P>
   ARCO said it would cut 300 more jobs than it had announced in
October and take a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of $890 million.
The 1,200 jobs that will now be cut in the United States represent
about 7 percent of the oil company's total worldwide work force of
18,000. ARCO also cut 1999 capital spending to $2.7 billion
worldwide, down 25 percent from 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
   SWEDEN SELLS PHARMACIA SHARES
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish government raised $1.71 billion selling most of its
shares in Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the maker of the baldness treatment
Rogaine and the incontinence pill Detrol. The government sold 31.1
million shares at $55 each, representing 6 percent of Pharmacia's
outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   PUSH FOR MINORITY BUSINESSES
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson's push to get minority-owned companies a
bigger slice of America's economic pie attracted hundreds of
businessmen to the second annual Wall Street Project conference in
lower Manhattan. Among those in attendance was President Clinton,
who proposed a tax credit to provide loans to increase business
investment in poor areas.

Klaassen family of Kansas fell victim to a tax law that was

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
(af) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 1968, while working on his doctorate at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kenan Sahin taught courses
at the Sloan School of Management. Brimming with theories on
information technology and operations management, Sahin, then 26,
strode into a classroom of prominent business executives one day _
only to be completely ignored. ``They thought I was the teaching
assistant who had come in to erase the board,'' he recalled. He had
to pound the table to get their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts about whether his theories could make the leap from
the ivory tower of academia into the brambles of the business world
were laid to rest last week. On Monday, Lucent Technologies
announced that it was buying Kenan Systems Corp., his Cambridge,
Mass., software company, for $1.45 billion in stock. And every
penny goes into the pocket of Sahin, who founded the company 16
years ago on $1,000 and nurtured it, without outside investment,
into the state's largest software company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sahin, 57, acts more like the business professor he once was
than the freshly minted billionaire he is now. After the
announcement of the sale, said his son Kent, a Kenan salesman,
``all the limos headed off, and he walked back to the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into a prominent family in Turkey, Sahin came to the United
States at 16, on an exchange program. Dating and dancing and going
to an American school were exciting, he said, but it was a trip to
a Texas oil company that made the biggest impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shown the shrine, the glass-shrouded computer
shrine,'' he said. ``There was this electronic brain on the other
side of the glass; it just fascinated me. That's why my whole
perception of life changed _ that the human mind could be extended
into a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   That fascination never left him. He wrote his doctoral thesis on
a new technology called ``expert systems,'' which analyze huge data
bases of information. And he went on to teach information
technology and quantitative methods for nearly two decades _ at
Sloan, then at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and
finally at the Harvard School of Public Health. Twenty of his old
computers are in what he calls the ``dead computer museum'' in his
Milton, Mass., home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he started Consultant Management Decisions _ later
renamed Kenan Systems _ as a consulting firm specializing in his
twin passions, engineering and management. His employees were ``MIT
MBAs who rolled up their sleeves and wrote code,'' he said.
Projects included designing software for the Postal Service and
transaction systems for Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the company began developing billing software
for the Baby Bells, to sort out their proliferating, and often
confusing, pricing plans. ``It's a hugely growing market,'' said
Paul Hughes, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston.
Ultimately, it made Kenan _ whose revenues rose to $175 million
last year from $40 million in 1996 _ irresistible to Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Sahin has kept himself and his company out of the spotlight,
quietly shrugging off offers to go public. ``The casualty rate for
software companies is very high, and Kenan had his ups and downs,''
said Howard W. Johnson, a former MIT president whom Sahin recruited
as principal adviser to the company. ``At one point he was close to
bankruptcy, but he sweated it through. He made it, and he did it on
his own resources. He carried all the burden _ insisted on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahin says that in 1986 he created a board of directors, on
which Johnson served _ it later morphed into an advisory board _ to
keep his own power in check. ``The presidents of small companies
are dangerous,'' he said. ``They confuse presidency with ownership.
The company is people, and you don't own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahin, though, did have trouble letting go, turning down
Lucent's original overtures a year ago. ``My mind and my heart were
disconnected,'' he said. His mind finally won, after he realized
Kenan needed a giant partner to keep growing. But he insisted that
the company keep its name and its autonomy _ as well as its leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sahin seems genuinely indifferent to his new status as
billionaire. He said that he planned to put most of his fortune
into a foundation to provide high school and college students with
educational software, but that it was too early to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation should allow him to continue following his own
path. One reason he kept his company private was that he didn't
want shareholders, or anybody else, to tell him what to do. And he
didn't want to have to tell others what he was up to.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, for example, ``didn't ever know whether the projects
they were working on were profitable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experiment was that people don't need that kind of
incentive,'' Sahin added.
</P>
<P>
   For an industry in which stock options are a common perk, some
say that Kenan employees have been wronged, stuck on the leeward
side of the windfall. Sahin counters that they didn't go to Kenan
to get rich. He acknowledges that they have to pay for their own
parking, and he considers ``fruit days'' _ free fruit for all on
Tuesdays and Thursdays _ to be noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   If fruit days sound dull, Kenan's main product, billing
software, isn't exactly a spine-tingler, either. Yet the offices
are full of young people fresh out of top schools _ including two
of his three sons _ and attrition is low. Employees
enthusiastically echo Sahin's catchwords, discussing ``balance''
and ``teamwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahin's office _ bedecked with his third son's artwork _ doubles
as a conference room, and he is routinely kicked out when some of
the growing ranks of employees need the space to meet. That suits
him fine. ``We don't have heroes,'' he said. ``We don't have
gurus.''

ALTERNATIVE-MIN-TAX-1, 1-10 -- With 13 children, and the various
medical expenses and other deductions that come with them, the
Klaassen family of Kansas fell victim to a tax law that was
intended to close a loophole for much wealthier taxpayers. How a

<P>
   Q: I have a question about the gold stripe on some of the pro
football games. Can that only be seen by the TV audience, or is it
visible to the players? _ L.F., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The onfield stripe, which has appeared this month on
telecasts of some NFL playoff games and the Fiesta Bowl, is visible
only to TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The stripe marks the line a team must cross to get a first down
on offense. Players and officials can pass in front of it as if it
were painted on the field.
</P>
<P>
   During NFL playoff games on CBS, the effect was created by
Princeton Video Image. Several companies provide similar technology
for other events. Video insertion also has been used to place
advertising and other information during Major League Baseball
games, soccer and auto racing.

   Q: What mailing address can I use to contact Kirk Kerkorian? _
I.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Kerkorian, a financier and philanthropist who owns the MGM
Grand Hotel and a majority share of MGM Studios, has several
business addresses. Employees at each company asked that they not
be published for the purpose of contacting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something we do,'' said a Kerkorian representative
at Tracinda Corp., his Las Vegas-based company that owns the MGM
properties. Tracinda does not publish its address or phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian, 82, never grants interviews and is described by
colleagues as extremely shy. He is worth $5.7 billion, according to
Forbes magazine, and has donated an estimated $500 million to
charities related to education, health care and other efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Armenian immigrant farmer, Kerkorian also supports
Armenian causes with efforts such as donating $25 million for
airlifts of medicine and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What actor played the part of the drunk Santa Claus in
``Miracle on 34th Street,'' and what else did he appear in? _
B.L.A., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: That uncredited role was portrayed by Percy Helton, according
to the Internet Movie Database at www.imdb.com.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who died in 1971 at age 77, appeared in 70 movies and
more than 20 TV shows during his seven-decade acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Helton performances that show up on TV today are on
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' as Sweetface, ``Beverly
Hillbillies'' as Homer Cratchit, ``Jailhouse Rock'' as Sam
Brewster, and several appearances on ``Gunsmoke.''  &QL;

SENATE PUTS LID ON PARTISAN SNIPING 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate opened its trial of President Clinton
this week, Sen. Robert Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia, wrapped
his arm around Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison took time to chat
with Clinton's chief counsel, Charles Ruff, and Sen. Russ Feingold,
a Democrat, greeted fellow Wisconsin resident and House Republican
manager Rep. James Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The public display of bipartisan bonhomie was a departure from
the angry partisan sniping that marked the House impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of visible rancor in the Senate may have as much to do
with the rules and role of the members as with politics and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Charged by the Constitution to deliver a verdict on the case
compiled by the House, the Senate has devised a series of rules
intended to ensure decorum and order.
</P>
<P>
   Senators have been ordered to remain mostly silent during the
presentation by House managers and Clinton's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where there was no such prohibition, vituperative
accusations flew as members took turns making five-minute speeches
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers noted that the nasty tone in the House was set
during the fall when the House Judiciary Committee, one of the most
ideologically polarized panels, embarked on its investigation of
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, House Republicans charged by releasing volumes of
salacious material from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report.
The release angered Democrats and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, on the other hand, is hearing evidence that has for
the most part already been released.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, its proceedings are being officiated by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist. He does not belong to either party's
leadership and thus does not draw the animosity of a Tom DeLay, the
Republican leader who spearheaded the impeachment drive in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Senate procedure for the trial does not allow
for constant bickering between the two sides. The Republican
managers have been given 24 hours to make their case, followed by
Clinton's lawyers, who have an equal amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for the House speaker, Rep. Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., said he believes the founding fathers envisioned
that the House debate would be more partisan. His reasoning, he
said, is that the Constitution requires the House to approve
impeachment by only a simple majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a majority situation, there's less a need for a
bipartisan situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, two-thirds of the members must vote to convict,
meaning that a bipartisan coalition would be required to oust the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 13 House Republicans who are serving as prosecutors are
aware that they cannot take the same approach in the Senate as they
did in their chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Although they rank among the most conservative in the House,
these members have been careful to stick to legal arguments and
avoid strident partisan rhetoric in their presentations to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, aware of strong public disapproval of the House's
behavior, have gone out of their way to show, at least in front of
the cameras, that they are not conducting business in the same
raucous manner as their colleagues in the other chamber.
</P>
<P>
   They managed to craft a procedure for conducting the impeachment
trial that at the beginning won unanimous support from both
parties. And they have been more subdued in their rhetoric, rarely
criticizing fellow senators or opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, almost every vote taken both by the House and its
Judiciary Committee was along party lines. And on the House floor,
Democrats hissed when then-Speaker-elect Robert Livingston, R-La.,
called on Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the more cordial atmosphere in the Senate, many of the
partisan differences that so badly split the House exist below the
surface in the Senate. They are likely to flare up in coming weeks
as lawmakers grapple over whether to call witnesses or dismiss the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the final outcome of any vote to convict the
president is expected to fall along party lines. Most if not all
Democrats are likely to oppose conviction and Republicans are
expected to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is no less partisan in the Senate than in the
House,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``But the
distrust in the Senate doesn't match that in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said senators view themselves as individuals rather
than ``cogs in the party apparatus.'' In the House there often is
more pressure on members to line up behind their party leadership,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have rankled many Senate Democrats who believe
they have been trying to influence the Senate procedure,
particularly on the issue of calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have blamed House Republicans for putting them in
the uncomfortable situation of sitting in judgment of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Harkin, D-Iowa, recently called the House
impeachment case ``counterfeit'' and ``a pile of dung.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Harkin interrupted one of the most virulently
anti-Clinton House managers, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., to complain that
he was mistakenly referring to senators as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republican senators realize that the mood of bipartisanship
will likely evaporate soon because of differences in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said that he and many Republicans
will probably vote to convict if House Republicans prove that the
president committed perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, many Democrats will not vote to convict even
if the House managers prove such charges because the Democrats do
not believe they are impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're passing like trains in the night,'' Smith said.

that people have, feelings of not having fear,'' said the Rev.

ALTERNATIVE-MIN-TAX-1, 1-10 -- With 13 children, and the various
medical expenses and other deductions that come with them, the
Klaassen family of Kansas fell victim to a tax law that was
intended to close a loophole for much wealthier taxpayers. How a
1969 law aimed at the tax-shy rich became a growing burden on
moderate earners illustrates how tax policy in Washington can be a
hall of mirrors. (Roy Inman/New York Times Photo)

HOUSE PROSECUTORS PAINT CLINTON AS LIAR

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors asserted Friday that Monica
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony was far more credible than
President Clinton's, and one of them told senators sitting in
judgment in the impeachment trial that ``it's the president who is
not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot
believe the president or accept the argument of his lawyers,'' said
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., opening the second of three days of
arguments by House managers. The Senate must decide which to
believe, he said, adding: ``If you have any significant doubt about
Monica Lewinsky's credibility or testimony, you should have us
bring her in here and let us examine her face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   As it had on Thursday, the question of calling witnesses, with
most Republicans in favor and most Democrats opposed, wound its way
through the day's proceedings. The issue will not be decided until
the week after next, but several Republican senators who said they
had doubted the wisdom of witnesses said they were changing their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, the main speaker Friday, delved into sexually explicit
material to support his contentions, something no one had done
previously during the trial. He cited sworn testimony by Clinton to
the effect that he had never kissed or fondled her breasts or
touched her genitalia, and sworn testimony by Ms. Lewinsky that he
had done so repeatedly, as well as corroboration by friends who
said she told them about it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Ms. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and others, McCollum
said: ``Time and again, the president says one thing and they say
something entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida lawmaker's approach dramatized one of the dilemmas
that Republicans face. Some of their strongest evidence in support
of the perjury article involves precisely the sort of material that
caused much of the public to sour on the presentation of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr and the proceedings of the House
Judiciary Committee. Without going into it, and questioning
witnesses whose testimony conflicts, their case is weakened; going
into it with live witnesses runs the risk of alienating voters
further with a spectacle reminiscent of the Clarence Thomas
confirmation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who filed the first impeachment resolution
over campaign financing in the House in November 1997, concluded
for the Republicans with typically vivid language that produced a
chilling moment of television. As he urged the Senate to ``strike
down these insidious cancers that eat at the heart of our system of
government,'' CNN showed Clinton, returning from a trip to New
York, stepping from his helicopter and calling to his dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Barr also prompted the first brief clash of the trial. Several
times, he referred to the senators as ``jurors,'' which prompted
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to rise to his feet and insist that the
Senate was sitting as a court, not as a jury. Until then, the
senators had sat mute, except for Majority Leader Trent Lott, who
spoke exclusively about housekeeping details. Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist, issuing his first ruling from the chair, said that
Harkin's ``objection is well taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly petty intervention had a large political point,
Democratic senators said. Harkin, who has backed Clinton as
fiercely as Barr has attacked him, told colleagues he was worried
that the word ``jurors'' would lead the public to conclude that the
Senate's job was merely to find Clinton guilty or not guilty,
whereas in his view they also needed to decide whether the
president's crimes, in any, constituted impeachable offenses, and
whether removing Clinton from office would serve the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, a mild-looking man who wears aviator glasses, is known
in the House as a detail man of unflagging persistence. Those
qualities were on display Friday as he extensively examined Ms.
Lewinsky's Aug. 6, 1998, grand jury testimony, now one of the most
familiar items in the case. It was then that she said, as the White
House never tires of pointing out, ``No one asked or encouraged me
to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   She was testifying about a late-night telephone conversation
with Clinton on Dec. 17, 1997. McCollum made two points: One, that
the entire sentence at issue was, ``No one asked or encouraged me
to lie, but no one discouraged me, either.'' Two, that Ms. Lewinsky
later said, ``I knew what he meant.'' Pressed, she added that she
knew that as ``we had on every other occasion and every other
instance of this relationship, we would deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum then asked: ``Can there be any doubt that the president
was suggesting that she file an affidavit that contains lies and
falsehoods?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Republicans presented ended with rhetorical
questions like that. Much else involved phrases like ``not
plausible,'' ``not reasonable,'' ``logical common sense says no,''
``you may infer,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a former CIA analyst and former prosecutor, was at pains
to insist, perhaps because of this, that circumstantial evidence
was not to be denigrated, no matter what commentators or the
president's lawyers might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a principle of long and consistent standing in every
federal court in our land, and I suspect in every state court in
our land,'' he said, ``that circumstantial evidence is not to be
and shall not be afforded any less weight than direct evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That question of the weight of the evidence also preoccupied
McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that not all the many details of the case meshed, he
admonished the senators: ``Never lose sight of the totality of this
scheme to lie and obstruct justice. Never lose sight of the big
picture. Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a whole, he insisted, ``the weight of the evidence in
this case is very great; it's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no direct White House rebuttal of any of this.
That will begin Tuesday, the very day when Clinton, in another of
the bizarre juxtapositions in which this case has abounded, goes up
to Capitol Hill to deliver the seventh State of the Union message
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presentation Friday was not well-organized, with
speakers crossing each other's paths again and again. It sometimes
seemed that they had not read or heard each other's statements. For
example, Rep. Carl Cannon, R-Utah, used the same quotation from
Theodore Roosevelt in his opening Friday that Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., had cited in his first words Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Barr heard criticism of this ``floating around in the ether out
there,'' he said, and entered a defense of ``not endless, not
pointless but appropriate repetition'' as a legitimate and
effective tool of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In his own argument, Barr devoted considerable time to the
events of Jan. 18, 1998, a Sunday, when Clinton talked with his
secretary, Betty Currie. He had testified the day before. He asked
her a series of questions _ in the form of ``false and misleading
accounts of events,'' Barr said _ and asking her to agree. In one
question, Clinton asked Mrs. Currie to agree that he had never been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky in or near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why did so, Clinton said he was ``trying to get the facts
down.'' But Barr contended that he was coaching her to support his
testimony, which he knew to be false. Often in white-collar
obstruction-of-justice cases, Barr continued, no one suggested to
anyone that they lie. He cited a 1953 case in the 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals in which Michael O'Keefe, a New Orleans real-estate man,
was convicted of obstruction for having tried to persuade a
colleague to testify falsely by falsely describing a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe never asked anyone to lie, Barr said. ``He didn't have
to. He was too smart for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, Barr declared, ``when one considers that
he had already testified, it was obviously too late to try to
recollect what the facts were.'' Barr added, ``in any event, Mrs.
Currie could not have told him what the true facts were because he
alone knew what they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Three prosecutors, or ``managers,'' to use the formal term, gave
little seminars on the law. One of them, Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio,
who explained what constituted perjury, said that one of the key
elements was whether a person lied knowingly or through accident or
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could not claim to have spoken out of ignorance in
testifying to the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter
because ``the president's own lawyer has acknowledged the care, the
intention, the will of the president to say exactly what he said.''
He was alluding to a statement by Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel, and he showed it on the special television screen set up
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff was clearly speaking about Clinton's deposition in the
Paula Jones civil case, not his grand jury testimony, which is a
subject of the impeachment article alleging perjury. The House of
Representatives rejected a separate impeachment article involved
perjury in the civil case.

SALINAS' LAWYER QUESTIONS VALIDITY OF TAPE RECORDING OF WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The chief defense lawyer for Raul Salinas de
Gortari, who is on trial in the 1994 assassination of a prominent
politician, has questioned the validity of a newly uncovered piece
of evidence that prosecutors said adds weight to the homicide
accusations against his client.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to The New York Times, the lawyer, Eduardo Luengo
Creel, said the tape recording of a key witness disclosed on
Thursday in The New York Times ``is not new evidence,'' and ``has
no value as evidence and does not prove anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The period for introducing new evidence in the trial has been
closed, and the judge is expected to rule in the four-year-old case
soon.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape the witness, Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, who has said
he helped hire the hit team that killed the politician, Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, describes the assassination plot in great
detail and repeatedly asserts that Salinas ordered the killing.
Rodriguez Gonzalez, who is serving 37 years in jail as an
accomplice to the killing, also says Salinas' father, Raul Salinas
Lozano, knew of and supported it.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was significant because it was made before the first
prosecutors to handle the case tortured Rodriguez Gonzalez. After
he was beaten, Rodriguez Gonzalez stopped mentioning any Salinas
family role in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Luengo said he doubted that the tape, made during the first
police interrogation of Rodriguez Gonzalez, would meet Mexican
standards for convincing trial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that the tape had been previously disclosed in an
article in September by the Mexican weekly newsmagazine Proceso,
and entered into the court record. But the tape reported in the
magazine registers a different conversation than that cited in The
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Luengo declined to comment on the tape,
saying he was obliged to remain silent in this period just before
the judge's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, the attorney general's office confirmed
that it ``had no knowledge of the existence of this tape'' before
the article about it was published in The Times. ``It should be
more than obvious that, had we had this tape earlier, the attorney
general would have presented it before the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jose Luis Ramos Rivera, the deputy attorney
general in charge of the case, said, ``We very much regret not
having had access earlier to this tape so that we could have
entered it in the trial as a very important piece of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Luengo wrote that it was also ``reprehensible and
unacceptable,'' to implicate Salinas Lozano ``based on an item of
suspicious origin.'' Raul Salinas de Gortari has maintained that he
is innocent, and his father was never called for questioning in the
case.

GERMANY TO COMPENSATE AMERICAN SURVIVORS OF NAZI CAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 3rd graf to add info on status of Americans in POW camps; In
4th graf, corrects number of Americans compensated in previous
settlement to 11 from 14) (JT/js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Germany Friday announced a
tentative agreement for the German government to compensate an
estimated 240 Americans who were imprisoned in Nazi concentration
camps.
</P>
<P>
   While terms of the agreement remained secret, lawyers for the
victims said they had been told that their clients would receive an
average of about $100,000, which would put the total value of the
settlement at $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   American officials would not confirm the figure but said Germany
had agreed to provide millions of dollars in restitution to the
Americans. Most are Jews who were trapped in Europe during World
War II or captured American soldiers, some of them also Jewish. The
settlement would not apply to the vast majority of Americans held
in regular prisoner of war camps.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was the result of a second round of negotiations
between the State Department and the German government over the
issue. The earlier talks ended with a settlement in 1995 that
required Germany to provide about $2 million to 11 Americans who
had been identified as former prisoners in Nazi concentration
camps. At the time, the two countries agreed that the United States
would search for others who were American citizens when they were
imprisoned in the camps and who might also be entitled to German
restitution. American officials, speaking on the condition that
they not be identified, said the search turned up about 240 more
claimants.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not apply to camp survivors who became
American citizens after the war, but many of them were entitled to
compensation under other agreements with the German government.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Perles, a Washington lawyer who represents about 20 of
the claimants, said his clients and their families were ``generally
pleased'' with the agreement, which was first reported by USA
Today. ``Generally the State Department has done a good job here.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was concerned by reports that it could take
another six months for his clients to receive their compensation
checks. ``Most of these claimants are well into their 80s, and as
you can imagine, any further delay is an extraordinary hardship for
them and their families,'' he said. ``None of these people have
been told whether they are going to receive funds and in what
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, the German government said that under the
agreement, ``it is up to the discretion of the U.S. Government to
distribute the funds provided for under the global agreement as
well as to determine who, on an individual basis, is entitled to
receive them.'' Germany, it said, ``sees this agreement as a sign
of good will and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The German Parliament must still approve the settlement.
American officials said that the lawmakers were almost certain to
approve the pact, and that the vote was expected within a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The German government and German corporations have been under
increasing pressure to settle compensation claims by victims of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Germany's new Social Democratic government and
several large trans-Atlantic mergers, large German banks and
industrial conglomerates have struggled in recent weeks to devise a
broad plan to compensate Holocaust survivors and Poles, Russians
and other Europeans enslaved by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The corporations, from Deustche Bank to Siemens and
Daimler-Chrysler, are trying to free themselves from a flood of
American class-action suits alleging that they profited during
World War II by collaborating with the Nazis.

   Once a month, 15 heavy hitters of business _ including the chief
executive of a drug company and a public relations bigwig _ meet in
the New York City office of Howard Milstein, the real estate
developer, banker and co-owner of the New York Islanders, to
discuss the Torah, with a dash of ancient rabbinical commentaries
thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? ``The Bible is all about business,'' says Rabbi
Burt Visotzky, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary and
leader of the study group. ``In Exodus, people step out of the
family, forming a corporate entity. A lot of negotiation goes on.
Abraham negotiates with God, with Pharaoh; Moses negotiates with
God, with the people. Most importantly, he learns how to delegate
authority. You need an ethos wherein you consider ethical practice
part of your obligation to shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Milstein described the allure of the discussions this way:
``It's a constant reminder of things greater than ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he missed the latest session, held Monday, a day after a
group he leads bought the Washington Redskins football team for
$800 million. No word if there were jokes about Hail Mary passes.

   Joseph P. Firmage, 28, founder of USWeb, a $2.5 billion Internet
consulting company in Santa Clara, Calif., has been on the cutting
edge of the technology revolution. But last week he quit his post
with the company, lest some people think his theories had gone over
the edge of credulity.
</P>
<P>
   He believes, you see, that extraterrestrials have visited Earth
and possibly helped seed recent technology advances. He has
published his ideas in ``The Truth'' (www.thewordistruth.org), a
600-page ``book'' that also discusses the influence of aliens on
science and religion. Demand is such, he said, that he took the
site down on Friday to triple the capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Firmage, whose title at USWeb was chief strategist, said he was
stepping forward with his beliefs because ``my kind of credibility

   Michael Jordan's retirement may be bad news for professional
basketball, but it was good news for the retail shop at Michael
Jordan's Steakhouse NYC in Grand Central Terminal. Sales of
autographed basketballs ($1,500 each), jerseys ($2,100) and other
sports paraphernalia tripled, to about $4,000 a day from $1,400,
after the superstar announced his departure last week, according to
Peter and Penny Glazier, the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been to the establishment twice, but maybe now he
will appear more often. Mrs. Glazier hopes so. ``He was very
personable, delightful, charismatic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Glazier said that contrary to his expectations, the restaurant
has become a hangout for investment bankers and business types,
like Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg L.P., Ralph Lauren,
the designer, and Frank Ginsberg, chief executive of Avrett, Free &AMP;

taking another crack at it, retiring officially on March 17. ``They
don't need me anymore,'' he said cheerfully.

   He and his son Chris have chipped in on a 27-foot racing sloop,

 &HT;    Stage set for legislative fight over water supplies
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The legislative skirmishing has begun on one of
the most contentious issues in Texas water policy, the transfer of
lake and river water from one area of the state to another.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so-called interbasin transfers are a well-established
practice, with about 80 in place. Corpus Christi, for example,
pipes water from the Navidad River about 100 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Bill 1, the water law enacted by the Legislature two
years ago, all but made it impossible to undertake new transfer
projects. The measure declared that any water rights transferred
would be ``junior'' to rights to water that remains in the basin of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is significant. Under Texas law, surface water
is the property of the state. But the right to use it is a property
right that can be bought and sold. Over time, the state has
parceled out, or appropriated, surface-water rights in a priority
system that can be summed up as ``first in time, first in right.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that system, farmers, factories, cities and other users
with the earliest water-rights permits get their shares before
those with less-senior rights. In a drought, there might not be
enough water to satisfy the needs of junior-rights holders.
</P>
<P>
   Because Senate Bill 1 makes water transferred out of a basin
junior to all other rights in the basin, the water source would be
unreliable in times of short supply.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, few users would be inclined to buy water or water
rights from another basin. A bill filed by Sen. Buster Brown,
R-Lake Jackson, would eliminate the junior provision and thereby
make new transfers a viable option again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as a tool that's going to be needed in the future by
various regions of the state,'' Brown said of transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown carries considerable clout in the Legislature on
environmental policy as the author of Senate Bill 1 and the
chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee. But his
proposal could face a tough ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll have a hard time passing in the House,'' said Rep. Rob
Junell, D-San Angelo. ``There are more people upstream than
downstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Junell's district includes the upper Colorado River. Junell and
then-Rep. Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont, were instrumental in adding the
junior-rights provision two years ago in hopes of guarding against
new transfers out of the Colorado and Sabine river basins.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators are suggesting a different approach. Rep.
Robert Puente, D-San Antonio, has filed a bill that would eliminate
the junior-rights provision for transfers within regional planning
areas. In other words, transfers would be viable provided the water
remained within the region. Under the water law enacted by the last
Legislature, the state has been divided into 16 regions.
</P>
<P>
   The regional approach proposed by Puente is also favored by the
House sponsor of Senate Bill 1, Rep. Ron Lewis, D-Mauriceville.

WILL TYSON SNAP AGAIN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The most compelling thing about the third
incarnation of Mike Tyson has little to do with boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The former champion figures to send Francois Botha home early
tonight just like he has done to most of his overmatched opponents
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The question, more than any other, that will put people in the
seats at the MGM Grand and in front of television sets around the
world _ even at $40-plus a pay-per-view pop _ is this: What will
Tyson do next?
</P>
<P>
   In his last fight, 19 months ago against Evander Holyfield, he
shocked the world and etched an indelible niche for himself as a
certifiable nut. Tyson, who said he ``snapped'' when he bit
Holyfield's ears, swore up and down during the reinstatement
process that it won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: It cost him a fortune and that's more painful than
any embarrassment or shame he might have experienced as a result of
his gross indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to him can't imagine it or anything like it
happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what he's been through, it won't happen,'' said Tommy
Brooks, Mike Tyson's new trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the dark appeal is the possibility that this might be
the only fight of his second comeback. Next month, when he's
sentenced for assaulting two motorists after a traffic incident in
August, another judge will determine whether to send him back to
prison for violating the conditions of his parole for rape.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to overlook the fact that this !ital!is!off!
a boxing match _ such as it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Botha (39-1, with 24 knockouts) is more than just a piece of
meat that will be thrown into Tyson's cage.
</P>
<P>
   The South African native, who lives in Newport Beach, is a
capable fighter who once outpointed Axel Schulz to win the vacant
IBF title only to be stripped when he tested positive for steroids.
He'll probably earn his $1.85 million share of the purse. (Tyson
will earn about $17 million.)
</P>
<P>
   However, he appears to have neither the power nor the skills to
contend with the likes of Tyson (45-3, 39 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   If there's any suspense from a boxing standpoint, it's what
Tyson might bring to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   After his two losses to Holyfield and the ear-biting debacle,
Tyson shed promoter Don King, his managers and his trainer. Guiding
him now in the ring is Brooks, who had been working Holyfield and
was in his corner the night of the bite.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, well versed in the fundamentals, has tried to resurrect
the long-lost Tyson of the '80s, the Tyson who bobbed and weaved
and threw devastating combinations in a fantastic run through the
heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said Tyson, 32, has been ``a sponge.'' He doesn't expect
to see the relatively stationary boxer who relied solely on his
power in the two losses to Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very explosive,'' Tyson said. ``We're just working
on basic things that we've always done. We're trying to focus on
them, not totally rely on explosiveness and power. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working hard, man, body punching, combinations, just
all-around basics.''
</P>
<P>
   This one probably won't determine much about Tyson the fighter.
Botha simply isn't a meaningful test, which is one reason the
energy surrounding the fight pales compared to past Tyson fights
and probably will hurt the live attendance and pay-per-view buy
rates.
</P>
<P>
   For those who watch, keep an eye on Tyson. You never know what
might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting: Two local fighters are on tonight's card.
</P>
<P>
   IBF junior lightweight champion Robert Garcia (31-0, 24 KOs) of
Oxnard defends his title against veteran John John Molina (45-5, 30
KOs), and heavyweight Lance Whitaker (17-0, 15 KOs) of Northridge
faces Alex Stewart (43-8, 40 KOs) in a scheduled 10-round bout.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Goyo Vargas (38-6-1, 28 KOs) takes on Ben Tackie (18-0, 11
KOs) in a 12-round lightweight bout, and Zab Judah (18-0, 13 KOs)
faces Wilfredo Negron in a 12-round junior welterweight matchup.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Reeling from the unrelenting hemorrhage
of dollars from its foreign reserves, the Brazilian government
lifted exchange rate controls on Friday and allowed the currency to
trade at market value. The move sent stock markets soaring here and
rising throughout Latin America and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Friday that the Brazilian central bank would
allow market forces to determine the value of its currency, the
real, came 24 hours after the bank had ruled out such a step. It
feared that it would send the currency plunging in value. The shift
appeared to signal at least some conflict and disarray over
economic policy at the top levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were relieved that Brazil had abandoned _ at least
for a day _its policy of spending dollar reserves to defend the
real from selling attacks by speculators who had bet it would
eventually fall in value. The real fell on Friday, but its descent
was not as sharp as had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paolo, Brazil's financial center, the benchmark stock
index rose 33.4 percent on Friday after two days of punishing
losses, reflecting the sudden attractiveness of Brazilian stocks
that had fallen to bargain levels. The reverberations of that
turnaround were like a tonic on other markets, and the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 219.62 points, or 2.4 percent, recovering
losses of the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift is a significant blow to Brazil's established
policy of relying on a stable currency loosely pegged to the dollar
to cure Latin America's largest economy of its chronically high
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised speech to the nation late on Friday, Brazil's
president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said he had abandoned defense
of the currency only as a last resort. ``I could not let reserves
keep going out and leave Brazil undefended in order to take
precautions afterward,'' Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Brazil's finance minister, Pedro Malan, and its
new central bank president, Francisco Lopes, flew to Washington to
meet with officials of the International Monetary Fund, who had
grown skeptical at Brazil's effort on Wednesday to allow a small
and gradual devaluation without lifting exchange rate controls. The
IMF has been supporting Brazil with a $41.5 billion bailout package
from a variety of nations and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The financial strategy of the central bank boomeranged and the
IMF aid package's purpose seemed to be thwarted, unnerving
investors who had bet on a stable currency. In a growing exodus of
dollars from Brazil, $1.8 billion left central bank coffers on
Thursday alone. Brazil's foreign reserves, $75 billion last summer,
have dwindled to $31 million, a main reason the government
officials felt forces to change policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central bank of Brazil will not intervene in exchange
markets today,'' an announcement from the bank said on Friday,
adding that ``another communique in this respect will be released
Monday.'' Officials in Washington said that IMF officials would be
discussing Brazil's future monetary regime with officials this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of lifting exchange controls, the Brazilian real
fell to 1.60 to the dollar from 1.32, but it settled at 1.43 by
day's end. Though economists had estimated Brazil's currency was
overvalued by up to 30 percent, by the end of trading it became
clear that Brazil had managed to stanch the flight of dollars _ at
least for the present. The real had recovered strength, closing
down down 10.4 percent for the day and 18 percent since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little sense that any long-term equilibrium had
been found. ``I think we still have a messy time for two months or
so,'' said John Welch, chief economist for Latin America at Paribas
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The move also had a healthy affect on Brazil's near term
interest rates, which had hit 71.65 percent on Thursday for
contracts maturing in February. That rate fell in half, to 36.11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m. here on Friday, just $173 million had left Brazil's
foreign reserves, which had lost more than $5 billion in the first
nine days of this year alone. Some analysts suggested that on
Monday the government would establish a new exchange rate based on
the free market value of the real established on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With investors breathing a continent-wide sigh of relief, the
Sao Paulo market, which has faced double digit losses for days,
began climbing. At day's end, the market registered its second
highest increase in a single day's trading, jumping 33.4 percent in
heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Markets rose throughout Latin America, going up 12.3 percent in
Argentina, 7.8 percent in Mexico and 5.6 percent in Peru. In
Germany, stocks were up 1.5 percent, while in Paris, the bourse
climbed 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's efforts to protect its economy from the turbulence
roiling emerging markets has been a continual preoccupation for
Washington and other industrial nations since last summer, when
Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on some foreign debt
payments. Representing more than half South America's population
and more than 40 percent of its economic output, Brazil was
considered the most likely candidate for ushering the troubles of
emerging markets to America's doorstep, by dragging down economies
throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government's earlier success in selling investors
on Brazil's commitment to ending hyperinflation and modernizing the
role of government, had encouraged foreign companies to increase
their stakes in Brazil throughout the four-year-old Cardoso
administration. In 1994, foreign direct investment in Brazil
totaled $2 billion. Now, it accounts for more than $36 billion,
thanks in part to aggressive privatization of state utility, mining
and telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is also considered the locomotive of Latin America, which
buys 20 percent of American exports. And it owes more than $228
billion in foreign debt, according to its letter of intent laying
out the terms of its bailout by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis emerged after the governor of Minas Gerais, Brazil's
third wealthiest state, announced a moratorium on paying his
state's debt last week. That caused a wave of dissent among state
governors and undermined Brazil's ability to deliver
deficit-cutting reforms and ultimately, to pay its debts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even before Brazil's reversal of course on Friday, the
government's credibility had been strained because of difficulties
in legislating civil service and pension reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had done this move a year ago, they would have been
much better off,'' Welch of Paribas said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had sought to keep its currency relatively stable by
permitting it to drop 7.5 percent a year against the dollar. That
approach, along with moves to open the economy to imports, had been
successful in controlling inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning the exchange-rate band represents a step into the
unknown for the architects of that approach. In the government's
letter of intent to the IMF, written in November, it called
``continued low inflation'' the ``priority goal of monetary
policy,'' and added, ``The current exchange rate regime is an
essential means to this end.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the jolts to investor confidence from Asia in the last
18 months, Brazil became subject to attacks on its currency and
paid high interest rates to attract investors who would otherwise
shun emerging markets in favor of safer investments offering lower
returns. Basic bank rates over 40 percent aggravated Brazil's
burgeoning budget deficit, now swollen to $65 billion, more than 8
percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   With consumer interest rates upward of 100 percent, and money
for capital investment in short supply, the economy screeched to a
halt in Brazil. Official unemployment jumped to a 15-year high of 8
percent, with little relief in sight, and in the Sao Paulo
industrial area, nongovernment labor analysts put joblessness at 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, business leaders welcomed the devaluation, which they
predicted would revive domestic industry by making exports cheaper.
At a trade show in Sao Paulo, leather manufacturers said the
devaluation would help the recovery of Brazil's shoe industry,
where sales have shrunk more than 60 percent in the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Rio, shopkeepers wondered whether inflation would
return, and in what form. No one knows whether the reflexes of a
culture practiced at dealing with hyperinflation, which ended five
years ago, would return. Some stores said that business was already
so bad that they could not increase prices without losing the few
customers who remained.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Homsi, 63, the owner of Micro Plant Computers here, had
already marked up prices on computer supplies like printer
cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of inflation, I don't have,'' Homsi said, ``but my back
is hurting from bending over to see which items I really do have to
raise my prices on.''

SPLIT EMERGING OVER WITNESSES IN CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate lurched toward polarizing along party
lines Friday in President Clinton's impeachment trial as House
investigators scurried for additional evidence to bolster their
case and prevent the split.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week after senators reached a consensus on a framework
for the trial, members increasingly broke by party ranks over the
need to hear witnesses before they decide the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're passing like trains in the night,'' said Senator Gordon
Smith, an Oregon Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The development, on Day 2 of opening arguments by House managers
for Clinton's removal from office, increases the probability the
Republican majority will prevail later this month in blocking a
White House motion to dismiss the impeachment charges and approve a
House request to extend the proceedings with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing concern among some senators that a partisan split
would cast a shadow over the trial, the 13 House managers, all
Republicans, stepped up their effort to persuade the Senate to
subpoena or invite witnesses, including Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's examine Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, Betty Currie,
and the other key witnesses,'' Representative Bill McCollum of
Florida told the Senate. ``Invite the president to come, judge for
yourself their credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House lashed out at the request. Gregory B. Craig, the
White House special counsel, accused the House managers, acting as
prosecutors, of trying ``to delay the trial by parading witnesses
on the floor of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The House Republican managers are seeking to expand and extend
this proceeding for one reason: They do not have a case based on
the facts, on the law, on the Constitution, or on the voluminous
record, for overturning the election and removing the president of
the United States,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The lead House manager, Representative Henry J. Hyde, said the
prosecution team is privately holding an ``intense discussion''
over whether to seek Clinton's testimony. Under the Constitution, a
president facing impeachment charges has the right to testify but
cannot be compelled.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said of Clinton
potentially appearing in the well of the chamber: ``It's up to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, who are nearly unified in opposition to
hearing from any witnesses, particularly Clinton, said the
arguments by McCollum and other House managers have not weakened
their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said the vote on calling witnesses
``may very well'' break along party lines because Democrats think
the potential witnesses have been questioned extensively enough
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Lewinsky, whose sexual affair with Clinton led to
the allegations that resulted in two articles of impeachment
against the president, has testified 22 times about the case in
civil depositions and grand jury proceedings. ``Quite frankly, I
don't feel the case has been made for witnesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the last Republicans who were uncommitted on the
witness issue Friday expressed support for the proposal, including
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who wields considerable
influence as chairman of both the Senate Rules Committee and the
National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Citing contradictions between Clinton and several other
individuals in the case, McConnell said, ``The only way you can
decide who is right is to listen to live witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   A key Republican moderate, Senator Susan M. Collins of Maine,
said she also is leaning toward favoring witnesses, although she
wants to hear the White House presentation before making a final
deicision. ``A lot of senators, including myself, feel there have
been a lot of contradictory statements presented so far,'' Collins
said. ``I don't know how I can resolve those differences without
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers will renew their appeal for witnesses to
Democrats Saturday as they complete their three-day opening
statement in the first presidential impeachment trial since Andrew
Johnson's in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   House managers said investigators also are continuing to seek
evidence against Clinton and to interview potential witnesses.
``There is a great deal of investigation going on behind the scenes
that is bringing forth some illuminating evidence,'' McCollum said
off the Senate floor. He and other House managers declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the ongoing inquiry. ``It's all about
witnesses,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois. ``They
understand that unless they make a breakthrough with something new,
they have a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In four hours of arguments Friday, McCollum and four other House
managers hammered away repeatedly with evidence supporting charges
that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice in trying to
cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr of Georgia said the repetition was
necessary to emphasize the gravity of the evidence. ``We have a
case here in which the fit between fact and law is as precise as
the finely tuned mechanism of a Swiss watch,'' he said. ``The
evidence that President William Jefferson Clinton committed perjury
and obstruction of justice is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   If senators do not punish Clinton's conduct by removing him from
office, Barr said, they will be ``poisoning future generations of
children, poisoning our court system, and perhaps even poisoning
future generations of political leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers repeatedly said the case was not about sex,
although they referred to sexual relations more than 75 times
during the day, to the discomfort of some senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all uncomfortable with it,'' said Senator Smith of
Oregon. ``But we've heard it so much that there is a certain
numbness to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith said, it is vital to ensure that Clinton is judged
no differently from any other person, particularly if he were a
less popular Republican politician. Polls show widespread
opposition to removing from Clinton office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the public feel different if the president was Dan
Quayle and the women involved were popular, like Katie Couric or
Diane Sawyer?'' Smith said. ``My concern is that justice be equal,
whether or not you're powerful, popular, and attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has three days to deliver a rebuttal to the
House charges, beginning next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first disruption of the House's tightly scripted
presentation, Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, Friday defied
an opening-day warning by the sergeant-at-arms that senators remain
silent ``under pain of imprisonment'' and objected to Barr
describing senators as ``jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presiding, Harkin argued
that the Constitution calls for senators to act as judges rather
than jurors, with broad powers to direct the course of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, rose to question
whether Harkin's objection was appropriate. But Rehnquist, after
warning Harkin not to argue his point ``ad infinitum,'' upheld his
objection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is not simply a jury, it is a court in this case,''
Rehnquist said. ``Therefore, counsel should refrain from referring
to senators as jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized on the ruling as a repudiation of the House
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House members have a total misunderstanding of the role of
the Senate, and a misunderstanding of their own role,'' said
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. ``This undermines the
argument the House members have made that they are a grand jury and
we are a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats, including Harkin, said the ruling underscores
the Senate's power to decide the case on political grounds as much,
if not more, than legal grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A House manager, Representative Lindsey O. Graham, described
Rehnquist's ruling as ``a semantic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Senate Republicans suggested Harkin was acting with an
ulterior motive, possibly at the White House's behest. Harkin has
advocated opening the Senate's private deliberations on Clinton's
fate to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was clearly a push by the White House to try to imply
that if we're not jurors we should not hold our deliberations in
private,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who is
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``The whole purpose of
that was to try and lay the groundwork that all the deliberations
should be open.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin denied Hatch's allegation, saying he was motivated
instead by ``not being put in a box'' as a juror. He said
Rehnquist's ruling ``sort of undermines the notion that you're only
a juror so you have to have witnesses,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Hatch's allegation, Harkin added: ``Mr. Hatch just gave me an
idea. I'm going to make that motion.''

 Marketwatch.com IPO Balloons 474%  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Marketwatch.com exploded onto the stock market yesterday, gaining
474 percent on its first day of trading, the second biggest
opening-day gain in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco provider of online financial news is not yet
profitable and may not be for several years, but that didn't stop
fevered investors from raising the price to a close of $97.50, from
an initial price of $17 per share. At one point, the stock traded
as high as $130.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have had better days, but I can't remember when,'' said
Marketwatch.com chief executive Larry Kramer, who was hoarse from
giving interviews all day.
</P>
<P>
   Marketwatch.com was the first marquee public offering of the new
year, a status due mostly to the backing of the CBS television
network. CBS owns 38 percent of Marketwatch, and Data Broadcasting
Corp., a Utah company that provides market data to stock traders,
owns another 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the IPO, 2.75 million shares were sold, representing a 23
percent stake. A closing price of $97.50 gives the fledging company
a total market value of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Marketwatch operates a Web site,  &LR; www.cbs.marketwatch.com &LR; , that
drew 2.2 million users in October, the last month for which figures
are available, Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   All 60 employees at the company _ including about 35 in San
Francisco _ have options to buy stock. They are not allowed to
exercise those options _ or convert them into stock _ for another
six months.
</P>
<P>
   The sky-high IPO, exceeded only by Theglobe.com's stunning 606
percent rise on its opening day in November, wasn't a surprise to
veteran market watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had the market wind behind its back, quality underwriters,
a brand name and a hot field _ the Internet,'' said John
Fitzgibbon, editor of IPO Reporter, a New York newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one Internet stocks debuted in December, Fitzgibbon said,
and on average their share prices have doubled since then.
</P>
<P>
   Marketwatch.com lost $8.25 million in the first nine months of
1998, on revenue of $4.5 million, according to the company's
prospectus. Since DBC established the business in October 1995, it
has lost $10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Web site faces intense competition in wooing
readers. It competes with traditional media and Web sites, such as
TheStreet.com, Motley Fool, the Internet stock report and the Wall
Street Journal Interactive Edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not the only one in the marketplace,'' said Internet
analyst Jim Balderston, a director at Zona Research Corp. in
Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   The company's journalists were in the odd position yesterday of
not being able to cover the hottest story on Wall Street _
themselves. That's because the Securities and Exchange Commission
orders a ``quiet period'' for stocks after their initial offering,
and the company can't be seen as touting itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pure financial reporting organization has ever had an
IPO,'' said Thom Calandra, the site's editor-in-chief. He said the
site's articles about the general stock market made mention of the
IPO, but the site did not put a special story about it on its front
page.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MARKETWA (68257 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Even though workers at the company were pleased with the
successful sale, Kramer and Calandra said people tried to stay on
an even keel. ``This takes off some pressure, because now we're
funded, but there will be no company Porsches,'' said Kramer, 48,
the former executive editor of the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all this work ahead of us,'' added Calandra, a former
columnist for the Examiner. ``We want to continue to improve our
financial news organization and reach out to more people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the frenzied trading of the first day, shares changed hands
9.8 million times, or more than three times for each of the 2.75
million shares issued.
</P>
<P>
   The lead underwriter on the offering was BT. Alex Brown.
</P>
<P>
   CBS stock climbed $81.25 to $34.81, but DBC, whose stock had
soared in advance of the Marketwatch offering, dropped $9.44, or 30
percent, to $21.75.

 McColl Wins Points in State  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
BankAmerica chief executive Hugh McColl may not have gotten ticker
tape parades and keys to the city during his four-day California
swing this week.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the North Carolina banker showed suspicious
Californians he didn't have fangs.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself was a big accomplishment for a banker who's been
saddled with an image as a businessman with an iron fist and a
heart of stone since his NationsBank bought San Francisco's BofA
three-and-a-half months ago and took its name.
</P>
<P>
   The barnstorming tour that ended Thursday took McColl to San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Before his visit, McColl was known here as the banker who
promised a merger of equals and then seized total power. He pushed
out David Coulter, the old BofA's CEO, and put his own people in
key jobs.
</P>
<P>
   McColl proceeded to get in more trouble when he refused to sign
community lending deals with California activist groups, something
that has become standard practice for big banks and thrifts in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   His image was tarnished again by a report that seven of the old
BofA's top 10 female executives resigned after he took command.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches before the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco and
Town Hall Los Angeles, and in meetings with public officials,
reporters and business leaders, the 63-year-old CEO took pains to
soften his image.
</P>
<P>
   He listened politely to requests and uttered the words people
wanted to hear about fair employment, women's rights, community
development and corporate philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   He handed out big checks, including $5 million to the University
of California at San Francisco to help fund development of a new
campus at Mission Bay on the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   And he earned praise for pledging to keep up the flow of funds
to Bay Area communities from Mayor Willie Brown and San Francisco
supervisors who days before had been calling for his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   McColl ``hit most of the hot spots and did what he set out to
do,'' said Kim Kellogg, an Oakland consultant who formerly directed
public relations at Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, McColl won points simply for taking
four days from his schedule to visit California. ``He did a lot of
damage contb &UR;

 Computer Users to Get Higher-Quality Video  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The transformation of the personal computer into an entertainment
center advanced yesterday when AtHome Network and RealNetworks
announced plans for Internet video with quality far higher than
users currently enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks, the Seattle company that pioneered online video
and sound, said it will develop technology to take advantage of
Redwood City-based AtHome's high-speed cable Internet service _
which is used by some 330,000 customers nationwide &UR;  &LR; and is
available in several Bay Area communities.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology represents a big improvement over current
Internet video, which is limited to tiny, shaky images that often
fail to synchronize with sound. With transmission speeds up to 500
kilobits per second _ 10 times faster than the fastest telephone
modem _ AtHome users will get a ``near-VHS experience,'' according
to Martin Dunsmuir, general manager of emerging technologies at
RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   Picture quality still won't rival digital or satellite TV, he
acknowledged, saying that that probably won't happen for a couple
of years. But he called the deal with AtHome a big step in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is bringing closer the convergence of passive
media such as TV and the interactivity of the Internet,'' said
Dunsmuir.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, say analysts, users of high-speed services such as
AtHome will be able to enjoy movies and TV shows on demand as well
as live concerts and other events. Programs will include
interactive ads and viewing options including such things as
multiple camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   The technology announced yesterday, which is expected to be
available later this year, may encourage providers of news and
entertainment to make video and audio a central part of their Web
services. CNet said it will offer enhanced radio online, and MTV
plans to deliver high-resolution music videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system will enable us to enhance the music experience MTV
Online offers as well as create new broadband applications,'' said
Matt Farber, senior vice president of Programming Enterprises for
MTV/VH1.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes a week after AtHome moved to bolster its
capacity by choosing AT&AMP;T to carry its traffic on a 15,000-mile,
high-speed fiber optic network.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, AtHome will use RealNetworks' technology
exclusively. That could be a blow to Microsoft, which has been
battling with RealNetworks to set standards for online video.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks was the first to develop software for sending and
receiving sound and video across the Internet, and its RealPlayer
continues to lead the market. Microsoft makes a competing program,
the Windows Media Player. Both programs can be downloaded for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``RealNetworks owns this particular space, and this deal gives
them the inside track'' to set a standard, said Rob Enderle of Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also could enable AtHome to attract more customers for
its young service, while positioning cable as the best method for
high-speed Internet access.

 EBay Fights Back Against Fraud  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Internet auctioneer eBay Inc. yesterday tightened security and
stiffened penalties on its popular online service to eradicate the
pockets of fraud that have been reported in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose company _ which hosts some 39 million auctions for
consumers offering everything from coins to Star Trek
memorabilia &UR;  &LR; _ said that beginning in March it will start a
user-identification program that lets consumers register their
driver's license, Social Security number and date of birth for $5.
Under that system, eBay users would know who they are selling and
buying goods from.
</P>
<P>
   EBay also will provide free insurance through Lloyd's of London
for transactions from $25 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to continue to set the pace in providing a safe
environment for trading,'' said Steve Westly, eBay vice president
of marketing and business development. ``As eBay grows, we will
take even more aggressive steps to protect our users.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay officials said they intend to cooperate fully with
authorities to investigate, prosecute and convict those who commit
fraud on the booming service. The company said it is working with
the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, state attorneys general and the postmaster
general to investigate and pursue claims of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, eBay plans to impose tougher penalties on
``deadbeat bidders,'' who don't pay after winning an auction, and
on ``shill bidders'' _ sellers who jack up the price of merchandise
by using a different identity or getting friends to bid on their
items. Frequent offenders will be suspended indefinitely from the
service, according to eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Westly denied that the safety measures were prompted by reports
in The Chronicle and elsewhere of fraud on eBay. In one case, an
Oklahoma City man pocketed at least $30,000 for baseball cards he
didn't deliver, postal inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
   EBay last month was the victim of high-tech pranksters, who
``shill bid'' on an item shown on NBC's ``Today Show.'' Although
bids skyrocketed to $200,000, eBay learned that the actual high bid
was just $11,400.
</P>
<P>
   Security upgrades were ``in the works for several months,'' said
Westly, who said the number of fraud complaints on eBay is
extremely small.
</P>
<P>
   EBay says less than 1/100th of 1 percent of the millions of
transactions on its site have resulted in reported fraud complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of eBay declined $1.94, to $223.38, in trading yesterday.

A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING IN WEATHER, ALL MESSY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.J., Pa., Vt.)   (bl)  
By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was slippery and soggy throughout the Northeast on
Friday, as New Yorkers practically skated down sidewalks that
looked in the morning as if they were coated with polyurethane, and
in the afternoon like slushy, running puddles as the sleet gave way
to rain and, finally, clearing skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so much ice with so little cold,'' said Carlos
Santos, 38, who lives in North Babylon on Long Island and works
near the World Trade Center in Manhattan. ``Coming out of the
subways, there were four blocks of ice in every direction.'' There
were people walking in the streets. I've never seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan International Airport in Boston was closed for three hours
because of freezing rain, and more than 200 morning flights at
LaGuardia and Newark International airports were canceled, leaving
thousands of travelers in long customer service lines, where some
knitted and some debated the relative merits of the coffee at
Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Commuter trains into New York from Long Island, Connecticut and
New Jersey were delayed 20 to 40 minutes, and there were dozens of
crashes on area highways during the morning commute, including two
pileups involving 16 cars on the icy ramps linking Interstates 287
and 80 in Parsippany, N.J. There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's Train No. 48, which was supposed to leave Chicago at
7:30 p.m. Wednesday and head to New York City, did not leave until
1:35 a.m. Thursday. Weather delays slowed its progress, so that the
crew, prohibited from working more than 12 hours in a row, had to
stop just outside Syracuse. The train sat for more than 10 hours,
and arrived in Pennsylvania Station at 6:44 a.m., 15 hours and 45
minutes behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 people in New Jersey, 22,000 people in Long Island
and about 8,500 in New York City lost electricity, and there was a
major voltage dip from Battery Park City to midtown Manhattan about
6 a.m. when four Con Edison transformers shut down because of ice.
About 200,000 people in suburban Maryland and Virginia were also
without power.
</P>
<P>
   Many New York streets and subways were strangely empty, as the
second day in a row of truly yucky weather and suburban school
cancellations led lots of people to just stay home.
</P>
<P>
   But by lunchtime, people were shopping in Chelsea without
jackets, and bicyclists were again filling the streets. It was
another installment of what meteorologist Fred Gadomski called the
``see-saw regime'' that has been this winter, a miserable morning
that turned mild by midday.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was in its final phases throughout the Northeast
corridor, Gadomski said. In Washington, it was 35 degrees and sunny
by 11:30 a.m. Most of New Jersey and Pennsylvania had dried out,
but it was still snowing in upstate New York much of Friday, and
Montpelier, Vt., was shivering with hard, freezing rain and
temperatures about 26 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The quick changes made things messier in many places. On Long
Island, temperatures as high as 50 degrees turned Thursday's snow
into pools of trapped water on many roadways. In Springfield
Gardens, a Queens neighborhood with no sewer system, residents were
trapped in their homes for fear of floods. And Lauren Serra, 12, of
Brewster in Putnam County was celebrating her surprise five-day
weekend with an afternoon of sledding on icy snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me more time to study,'' said Lauren, who was
supposed to have a math test and a social studies test in classes
that were canceled Thursday and Friday. ``Of course, I'm not
studying now.''
</P>
<P>
   The day dawned with a pretty dusting of snow on tree branches,
but freezing rain soon washed that away, leaving treacherous
streets and sidewalks as well as falling tree limbs that broke
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to put it mildly, a bad day to be a bike messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Brown, a messenger in Manhattan, was head-to-toe in
yellow raingear, his rubber overalls covered by a big slicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bills got to be paid, and it beats robbing somebody,''
Brown said. ``Besides, I love riding a bike. I have no boss on my
back, and I can set my own hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Letter carriers, too, remained surprisingly chipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Massachusetts, so this is nothing,'' said James Pate,
57, as he pushed a covered cart of mail along his route on West
18th Street in Chelsea. ``This is like summer to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oradell, N.J., letter carrier Ken Juergens noted: ``It's
nicer when people shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst place to be Friday was an airport, where
everyone wanted to be someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hutten left his home in Canada on Wednesday to visit his
girlfriend in Curitiba, Brazil. Instead, he spent three days stuck
in Boston, much of it in Logan airport.
</P>
<P>
   Hutten's flight from Nova Scotia to Newark was canceled, so he
got on a plane to Boston. It was diverted to Connecticut, where
Hutten caught a bus to Boston. Friday afternoon, he was waiting for
a flight to Kennedy International Airport, where he could connect
to Sao Paolo, but there were few planes coming into Logan. He said
he has learned one thing: He likes Starbucks more than Dunkin'
Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   One man celebrating the wet weather Friday was Joseph Pugni, 67,
of Valhalla, who walked away from what could have been a fatal
accident in the freezing rain Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pugni was driving his 1983 Lincoln on Lakeview Avenue when he
approached the Metro-North railroad crossing, with the gate down.
He lost control of the car when he tried to stop, and ended up on
the electrified third rail, watching the train's white lights
rushing toward him. Pugni got out without a scratch as the car
caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd stayed there one second more, I was finished,'' he
said. ``The strange thing is, this is actually a road that runs
through a cemetery.''

MULTIPLEX HAILED AS SIGN OF FORMER GM FACTORY SITE'S REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Joe Routh came to the old General Motors
plant site Friday to catch a movie at the Mann theater grand
opening, but also to see if it was really true: Was his blighted
neighborhood reborn?
</P>
<P>
   Routh had seen the plant in the suburban San Fernando Valley
area of Los Angeles when times were good, and when the factory
closed more than six years ago, leaving 70 acres of dust and weeds.
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, Routh was happy to join more than 100 moviegoers
in ceremonies marking a milestone in the rebirth of The Plant, once
home to the Camaro and Firebird, and now a retail hub featuring the
valley's newest state-of-the art cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a lot to us here in Van Nuys. It gives a sense of
home,'' said Routh, who paid his $5 to see ``Virus'' in one of the
eight theaters ready for the opening. ``I was waiting for a big
theater. I never thought it would come.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Routh, the matinee crowd was excited to finally have in its
community a theater featuring stadium-style seating, giant screens,
digital sound and buckets of hot, buttered popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   The opening ceremonies were limited to the length of a movie
preview so the appreciative patrons could get inside the gleaming
multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it with pride when we get to invest in a community like
this,'' said Jeffrey Lewine, principal owner of the 450-screen Mann
Theatres chain. ``It becomes a magnet for the community and
incorporates the direct community into a larger sphere of
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   With eight screens ready for the opening and another eight set
to open in about two weeks, the theater is bound to be a magnet for
movie fans across the northeast and central San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Mann officials said market potential is why the theater chain
opened its second 16-screen multiplex in an area still rebounding
from the staggering General Motors assembly plant closure.
</P>
<P>
   And elected officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this community, it is about time. But it had to be nested
in a larger project,'' explained state Sen. Richard Alarcon, who
represented the area on the Los Angeles City Council for six years.
``It signals the kind of change that we've seen in the Northeast
Valley and the San Fernando Valley as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores at The Plant shopping mall already include: Home Depot,
Office Max, Babies `R' Us, Tu Musica, Ross Dress for Less, Party
City, In-N-Out Burger and HomeTown Buffet.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial and industrial centers are expected to create
some 2,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mann Theatres filled a significant number of its 100 job
openings with residents from surrounding communities, said Arash
Behrang, managing director of The Plant multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   For Vilma Ekonomo, full-time work on the floor behind the
concession counter or as an usher is enjoyable, and only a
five-minute drive from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like working with people. It's fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks of training, Ekonomo managed to get a good
shift. By working 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays, she will have time
to spend with her 8-month-old daughter and 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect. I will be able to be with my kids, to take my
son to school early in the morning and to be home early for them,''
she noted.
</P>
<P>
   The outside walls of the site are done in muted shades of green
and yellow. There are brick sidewalks and ample landscaping
containing trees and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there are cheery shades of purple, yellow, aqua,
fuchsia, burgundy and rust.
</P>
<P>
   The new theater and stores impressed Miguel and Debbie Espinoza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks nice and has good seats,'' he said. ``As long as they
keep it safe with lights, I think it will be good for the people in
this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple brought their 2{-year-old son and Miguel's parents
from Palmdale for the opening, wondering how the commercial center
was turning out having moved from nearby Northridge in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised to see all the shops. This is good for the
area,'' she said.

NBA FANS WON'T BE SHORTCHANGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After playing games for six months, the NBA gets
down to the serious business of playing a season. Once teams fill
their rosters and players introduce themselves, the league is off
on a 50-game whirlwind tour starting in February, or when the ink
on the labor settlement dries, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what kind of season it will be, and the answer
for many people is ``tainted,'' or ``meaningless,'' or some other
word suggesting it will produce fluky standings and an unworthy
champion.
</P>
<P>
   This will probably be confirmed after the NBA Finals in June,
when 28 of 29 teams surveyed will say the season was indeed
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the opposite could be true. The 1999 NBA season might
prove to be a truer test for players, coaches and front offices
than a normal season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a test of character for everybody,'' said
Derek Fisher, the Lakers guard. And that's the point: The good guys
_ whichever uniform they wear _ have a better chance of winning
this year than most.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates for meaninglessness point out all the ways this
season will be different: 50 games instead of 82; a little more
than four games a week instead of a little more than three;
hurried, three-week training camps; an equally brief free-agent
signing and trading period; and no Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Each of which makes the season more meaningful, not less.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter season: How many games does it take to set the
playoff lineup, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The past three years, the 16 playoff teams after 82-game
schedules were 92 percent the same as they would have been after 50
games. Generally, a team establishes its level early in the season
and sticks to it.
</P>
<P>
   With the '99 schedule likely to be weighted heavily toward
in-conference games, each team probably will play each of its
rivals for a playoff spot three times, only one less than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What determines the (NBA) champion, as we all know, is not the
regular season,'' said Lakers coach Del Harris. ``It's never been
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And for teams that worry their luck won't even out in a short
season, here's a solution: Play hard every night. A novel concept
but it just might work.
</P>
<P>
   A hectic schedule: ``It's going to be a fast season,'' Shaquille
O'Neal said last week. ``Four games a week!''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, some people overhaul four transmissions a week or write
four columns a week. The difference being that you have to be in
some kind of shape to play all that basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The edge will go to coaches who think fast and players who can
squeeze into the same shorts as last spring. Everybody else, well,
whose fault is that?
</P>
<P>
   The mini camps: Three weeks, or whatever the practice and
exhibition season ends up, won't be enough to shape up the players
who sat around during the lockout or create chemistry among
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Which should give a big edge to teams who worked out together
all winter, or the one team, the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a word for those sneaky teams that steal championships
by working harder and longer than their opponents: (begin
ital)deserving(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   The signing circus: The Lakers had nine players under contract
at the settlement, the Clippers 10. They're among the lucky ones.
The Lakers anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Hawks, Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets were the
emptiest with four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-thinking general managers are going to do well in the
upcoming scramble for players. The dimwits are going to be lucky to
fill the bench. Anything unfair about that?
</P>
<P>
   In the other major sports, seasons jumbled by labor disputes
produced worthy champions and the champagne celebrations and
downtown parades were as long and lively as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Devils won their only Stanley Cup following a
54-game NHL season in 1995. Though the Devils failed to make the
playoffs the following season, they had come within one game of the
finals the previous season. No fluke there.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins won the Super Bowl after a nine-game NFL
season in 1982. Though it was the Redskins' first playoffs in six
years, they had finished the previous season strongly, and proved
themselves the following season with a league-best 14-2 record and
a return to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the World Series in
1981. The Cincinnati Reds had a legitimate complaint after putting
together the major leagues' best record only to be left out of the
playoffs because they didn't lead their division in either half of
the split season. But seeing that the Dodgers and Yankees were
facing each other in the Series for the third time in five years,
and the 11th time overall, it was hardly an odd result.
</P>
<P>
   No Jordan: The league is without a single, standout player
(Michael) since the days when short pants were short pants.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement hurts, but when was the last time you went to a
Lakers-Rockets game because Jordan was playing that night 2,000
miles away? Networks and sponsors will miss him more than real fans
will.
</P>
<P>
   The league is also without a lone, obvious championship favorite
(Chicago) for the first time since Jordan's previous retirement. So
what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   They'll play a season that's more like a steeplechase than a
marathon. Good players in good shape, smart coaches who adjust to
unique circumstances and clever GMs with an ear to the tracks will
come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   This year more than ever. &QL;

JUDGE REFUSES TO OPEN FILES ON SUSPECT   IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan refused Friday to open
secret court files pertaining to a former U.S. Army sergeant
suspected of conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
indicted in the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa last
August.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting a request filed by The New York Times, Judge Shira
A. Scheindlin of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said that the
public's right of access to criminal proceedings was not absolute
under the First Amendment, and that she was persuaded that
disclosure of the records could result in a ``significant
probability of harm to compelling interests'' cited in secret
filings by the government and the suspect's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the secrecy in the case, the suspect was described in
court papers only as John Doe. But in an article in October, The
Times, citing government officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, identified him as Ali A. Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, a former Egyptian Army officer, was charged in a secret
court proceeding last September and is being held in a
high-security cell in lower Manhattan. A lawyer for The Times, Adam
Liptak, told Judge Scheindlin Friday that the secrecy in the case
went far beyond the acceptable legal standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is the most complete secrecy imaginable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Scheindlin did not offer details of which ``compelling
interests'' could be harmed by the disclosure of the court records,
but said they pertained generally to the government's continuing
grand jury investigation and ``the safety of sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Closure of all proceedings and filings, she said, ``is the only
way to adequately protect those interests,'' Judge Scheindlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Scheindlin said she would monitor the case and review
future filings to make sure that continued secrecy was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and the suspect's lawyer, James A. Roth, have
refused to comment on the case, or to confirm that Mohamed is
``John Doe.'' Mohamed is believed to have been charged with
conspiracy to attack U.S. citizens abroad and lying in a federal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In one disclosure last month, prosecutors told a judge that
``John Doe'' was involved in plea discussions. It could not be
determined Friday whether Judge Scheindlin, in referring to ``the
safety of sources,'' was describing the suspect or whether the
government was any closer to gaining his cooperation in the bombing
case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did unseal several documents related to the motion
that was argued Friday. Prosecutors have said in court papers that
``the government does not seek a blank check to permanently seal
the record in this case,'' and that the government might later
change its position.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities suspect that Mohamed has been a close associate
of bin Laden's since the early 1990s.

TAPESTRIES RECOVERED AFTER THEFT FROM AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Francisco DiSanto, it seems, figured nobody else
would really appreciate the delicate beauty of the tapestries in
the Alitalia Airlines first-class lounge at Kennedy International
Airport. The silk hangings, after all, were very old and even a
little spotted.
</P>
<P>
   Flawed as the artworks were, he later told Port Authority
police, he still liked them very much, and he thought they would go
nicely in the bedroom of his Brooklyn home. That is what DiSanto,
24, a luggage handler, told detectives while being arrested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The five silk tapestries that DiSanto said he had envisioned on
his bedroom wall were created between the 7th and the 14th
centuries, had once adorned the Sistine Chapel and are valued at
about $1 million apiece. They were given to Alitalia by the Vatican
in 1970, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   All the tapestries were relatively small, about 6 feet by 3
feet. The designs ranged from a wave pattern in red and blue on
white, to a design of small gold roosters on a muted blue
background. The title card of the latter read: ``The haloed rooster
design of earliest Christian times, inspired by the fabric wrapping
`sacred relics' currently in the Christian Museum of Vatican
City.'' Each design appears to have been patterned after an
old-world landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The tapestries are worth a total of $5 million, ``But really
they're priceless,'' Detective Robert Belfiore said.
</P>
<P>
   DiSanto had no inkling that the tapestries were so valuable,
Detective Robert Caron said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither did many of the officials at Alitalia. Perhaps that
is why the tapestries _ framed and in glass cases _ had been stored
in a room that was locked but not guarded, Belfiore said. The art
had been removed from the lounge while Alitalia finished moving its
operations to the other side of the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   DiSanto, who works for Dyn Air, a contractor for Alitalia,
stopped by the terminal Wednesday evening, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his day off,'' Caron said. ``He was in the lounge, he
looked at it, he thought it was a nice piece of art.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he thought they all were nice pieces of art. DiSanto
used a hammer to shatter the five glass cases and smash the wood
frames, said Belfiore. The glass shards ripped the corners of two
of the artworks. ``They were so old, as soon as they touched the
silk it tore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia officials did not notice that the tapestries were gone
until Thursday morning. After hearing the news, a dozen Port
Authority officers fanned out in the terminal. But DiSanto made
their job easy _ he had dropped a dental insurance card imprinted
with his name on the storage-room floor. Police found it under a
chair.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the detectives went about questioning each
employee. ``We were just letting him sit there,'' Belfiore said.
``When we got to him, it had taken so long, and he was so worried''
that he told the story with very little coaxing, the detective
said.
</P>
<P>
   The time between the report of the theft and the arrest of a
suspect was four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found the missing tapestries in DiSanto's basement in
Canarsie, Belfiore said. They were ``folded neatly,'' put into
garbage bags and stored behind a table, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiSanto said he thought the tapestries were being thrown out and
that he took them home for safekeeping. ``He said he appreciates
art,'' Caron said incredulously, ``and was just going to hang them
in his bedroom to look at them.''

EXPERTS LOOKING AT STADIUM PLAN SAY GIULIANI LACKS DOLLARS FOR HIS
DREAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to sports, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has big dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But experts on sports financing said Friday that the mayor's
latest and grandest vision, a domed football stadium and new
Madison Square Garden on the West Side of Manhattan, is so far only
that _ a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, offered by the mayor in his State of the City address
on Thursday, seemed more like a wish list than a fully formed plan,
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, they said, was the lack of details about
financing and about how the burden would be shared by the city,
state and private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say but that it's very ambitious?'' said Mike
Kelly, a partner in Coudert Brothers, a New York-based law firm
involved in financing arenas and stadiums. ``But you have to wonder
if there was any financial analysis behind this, or just the
generalized thought that it looked neat and appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   John Moag, former chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority,
which publicly financed side-by-side baseball and football stadiums
in Baltimore for $550 million, said, ``I don't know how the
economics will work, but the private contribution for this will
have to be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The sketchiness of Giuliani's plan also dampened the enthusiasm
of aides to Gov. George Pataki. The governor's communications
director, Zenia Mucha, said, ``We really can't say anything about
it at this point because we really don't have any details about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's latest proposal is even more ambitious than his
suggestion last year that the Yankees move to a new, $1 billion
ballpark above the Long Island Rail Road storage yards, land
bounded by 11th and 12th avenues and 31st and 33rd streets and
owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he wants a retractable-dome football stadium to be built on
the site, to serve in part as a much-needed expansion of the Jacob
K. Javits Convention Center, which is too small for giant
conventions that now bypass New York. He also proposed extending
the No. 7 subway line from Times Square and extending Metro-North
and LIRR lines to serve the site.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani suggested that the stadium serve as a new home for the
New York Jets, who have a lease to play at Giants Stadium in the
New Jersey Meadowlands through 2008. The mayor said the stadium
could also handle national political conventions, the NCAA men's
basketball tournament, college bowl and Army-Navy football games or
a Super Bowl, which is usually played in warm climates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Giuliani and his advisers insist that the stadium
concept is feasible even without attracting the Jets back to New
York. ``The viability without a team is very good,'' Deputy Mayor
Randy Levine said. ``Football is only 10 dates a year. This is a
need. New York City has a vacuum. We lose enormous business.''
</P>
<P>
   One critical question is whether Cablevision Systems, which owns
Madison Square Garden, wants to move to a new arena further west.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Garden, its exposition hall and adjacent theater
handled about 450 events last year, including Knicks and Rangers
home games, and has sharply increased its cash flow in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they need a new arena?'' asked Mark Rosentraub,
director of the Center for Urban Policy and the Environment at
Indiana University. ``It's already the busiest arena in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said a new Madison Square Garden and football stadium
could be financed partly by Cablevision selling its property,
between Seventh and Eighth avenues and 31st and 33rd streets, for
hotel and office towers.
</P>
<P>
   The tax revenue from the development that would relocate the
Garden, which currently pays no property taxes, would help the city
pay for the sports complex, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also suggested using revenue from the commercial rent
tax, a financing instrument that he first proposed using last year
for new ballparks for the Yankees and the Mets. The tax, which is
now slated to be phased out, is paid only by large Manhattan
businesses below 96th Street.

GIULIANI RETREATS FROM PLAN FOR ENDING METHADONE USE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six months after saying he wanted to abolish the
city's methadone treatment programs, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
abandoned his plan to move all 2,100 heroin addicts at city
hospitals into abstinence programs, conceding Friday that his idea
was ``maybe somewhat unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift came after a five-month city experiment aimed at
moving heroin addicts into abstinence programs at the five public
hospitals resulted in few successes, city officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 of the 2,100 addicts have given up methadone, the
synthetic drug widely prescribed to blunt the craving for heroin.
Of those, five have relapsed into heroin use, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani emphasized that he would continue to vigorously promote
drug-free programs in the city, adding that he still believes local
clinics rely too heavily on methadone. But he said his
consultations with drug treatment experts had persuaded him not to
eliminate methadone programs, which researchers across the country
have described as the best hope for the vast majority of recovering
heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I had proposed was doing away with it completely except
for a very short transitional period,'' said Giuliani in an
interview Friday. ``That turned out to be too frightening, too
jarring and maybe somewhat unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks were quickly applauded by state officials and drug
experts who had been stunned by the mayor's plan and by his attacks
on researchers who embraced methadone programs. In August, Giuliani
derided methadone supporters as ``a politically correct crowd.''
And in September, he called Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House's
drug policy chief, ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the while, Giuliani and his officials were also
moderating their policy, acknowledging at press conferences and
City Council hearings that abstinence might not work for everyone.
And Thursday, Giuliani returned to that theme yet again in his
State of the City speech, pulling back from his original proposal
another degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say that I want people off methadone and toward drug
freedom, I realize that there's going to be a certain percentage
where that can't be done but we've got to reverse the horrible
situation we're in right now,'' Giuliani said in his speech. ``So
how about making a deal?'' he continued. ``Instead of doing away
with methadone completely _ maybe this will calm everybody down _
suppose we reverse the percentages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose instead of 63 percent of the slots being for keeping
people chemically dependent, 63 percent of the slots were for
programs that were for drug freedom,'' he said. ``And we'll reserve
10, 15, 20, whatever we have to for methadone for those people who
need to have a transition and for those people where drug-free
programs just can't work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Luis Marcos, president of the city's Health and Hospitals
Corp., which oversees the city hospitals that had changed their
treatment on the Mayor's orders, said the shift reflects a clearer
understanding of the patients who struggle to battle addiction.
</P>
<P>
   While he had originally estimated that most addicts could move
from methadone to abstinence in three months, Marcos now says he
would be happy if 40 percent or 50 percent could make that
transition over the next year or two. And he acknowledged that many
drug experts would characterize even that estimate as optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, after looking at the population that we treat in our
public hospitals, three months detox was not realistic,'' Marcos
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the public hospitals treat only about 6
percent of the 36,000 heroin addicts in methadone treatment
programs in New York City; the others receive treatment in clinics
financed by the federal and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani can affect treatment only in the public hospitals,
where the average patient has been relying on methadone for nine
years. About 30 percent have also abused alcohol and other drugs.
Seventy percent are unemployed and many suffer from mental illness
and medical problems, Marcos said.
</P>
<P>
   Under traditional methadone programs, addicts can take the drug
indefinitely. Giuliani has argued that addicts on methadone simply
substitute one dependency for another and advocated gradually
weaning all addicts from methadone altogether after three months.
He and his advisers now acknowledge that is unrealistic, and the
hospitals will now instead simply encourage addicts to try
abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Drug experts said Friday that the mayor's remarks would probably
have little impact on methadone patients in city hospitals because
City Hall's approach never stood a chance of success. They say that
the mayor is simply acknowledging that reality.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Gibson, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Alcoholism
and Substance Abuse, which had opposed Giuliani's plan to abolish
methadone, said her office supported the city's policy shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged that the city understands that there are
successes in all types of treatment, including methadone,'' Ms.
Gibson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And Don C. Des Jarlais, the director of research for the
Chemical Dependency Institute of Beth Israel Medical Center, echoed
her sentiments, calling the mayor's remarks ``tremendously
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a much more sophisticated understanding of the
problem of addiction,'' said Des Jarlais, an expert on heroin
addiction. ``It is important to provide methadone maintenance for
those people who really need that treatment. But creating
additional treatment options is likely to be beneficial, to the
extent that patients can make their own choices about what
treatment works for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he made his decision after reaching out to various
drug treatment experts, including Joseph Califano, the former
secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare
who is now the chairman of the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University. And when those experts
continued to express reservations about eliminating methadone
completely, he reassessed his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with people, listened to the debate, talked to Joe
Califano,'' Giuliani said. ``I really do listen and read what
people say and write. And there are times when I actually agree
with them.''

TYSON'S RAGE SHOWS HOW LITTLE HE HAS CHANGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call me stupid, but I'm not sure that I'm grasping the deep,
subliminal message of those current TV spots promoting the
pay-per-view telecast of tonight's Mike Tyson-Francois Botha fight.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones that show Tyson furiously running, punching and
breaking a purposeful sweat, all presumably before the rest of
America sits down to breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   We know the time frame because in the last scene there is Mikey,
enjoying his breakfast cereal, too. (A bowl of Ear-ios?) We can
even hear him crunching.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the point here? We're not fighting Botha. Do we have
to be reassured that Tyson is, indeed, back to work for the first
time in 19 months? Or that he's back _ and this time, by golly,
he's taking it seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the latter message is inescapable. Buy into the
premise that this is a serious Tyson, boxing a serious foe, and you
probably buy into the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   How the mighty has fallen. Once we took Tyson's ferocity and
deadly resolve for granted. Now we question his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be enough just to see Tyson rain mayhem on an
intimidated opponent. This was the Tyson who, when asked what his
game plan was for an upcoming fight, answered, ``I'm going to try
to push his nose bone through the back of his brain.''
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 25, Tyson was a feared world champion and had
already written his own epitaph. ``I put guys in body bags,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was seven years ago. The post-incarceration Tyson has
been a sideshow, hyped as a main event.
</P>
<P>
   According to psychiatric examiners at Massachusetts General
Hospital, Tyson is OK and fit to resume boxing. A serious man would
be grateful to receive that diagnosis. But earlier this week in Las
Vegas, Tyson said that the doctors, not himself, were the real
``crazy ones,'' and that they reminded him of Nazi concentration
camp torturers.
</P>
<P>
   His new promoters _ Tyson has cut the knot with Don King and is
suing him _ gave the fighter a fortuitous public forum. By
satellite feed, TV sports people from around the country were
invited to interview Tyson, live from Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the perfect chance for Tyson to show the
world the new Mikey. The hard-working, no-more-biting, older, wiser
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   But people who watched the live satellite feed said that Tyson
appeared irritated from the start. By the time that New York TV
reporter Russ Salzberg got his turn, Tyson was lacing his answers
with sneers and obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to kill this _ ,'' Tyson said, referring to Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Salzberg flinched and asked, ``Mike, what about your rage?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about it?'' Tyson shot back. ``It's a fight, so whatever
happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Salzberg's next question was about the June 1997 ear-biting
incident, and Tyson turned his foul language up a notch. When
Salzberg asked him why he was talking that way, Tyson said, in
part, ``You have to probably turn off your station.''
</P>
<P>
   Salzberg promptly ended the interview, which prompted Tyson to
yell two more obscenities at him before the tape stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Call me stupid, but I thought we weren't supposed to feed the
animals. If you're prone to being offended, why interview Mike
Tyson, whose very calling card is being rude and offensive?
</P>
<P>
   As for Botha, there is reason to think that this will be Tyson's
toughest foe since being released from prison. Botha, 39-1, beat
Axel Schulz in Germany in December 1995, and he lost a determined,
12-round decision to Michael Moorer 11 months later. His history
suggests that he will fight back and not be intimidated by Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Tyson, Botha hasn't fought much lately. He weighed in
for this bout at a fleshy 233 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Botha camp's prefight hype hasn't been about the
fighter, but about his trainer, Carlos ``Panama'' Lewis, who was
imprisoned for two years and banned for life from working a fight
corner because of a stunt he pulled in 1983. Lewis removed padding
from the gloves of welterweight Luis Resto, who proceeded to
inflict permanent eye damage on opponent Billy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will be allowed to sit tonight no closer than the fourth
row.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson himself has a new manager, a new trainer and two new
tattoos (a tiger and a mug shot of revolutionary Che Guevara) for
tonight's bout.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see a new Tyson. There isn't one, it seems.

 &HT;    `Erroneous' decision to flee law adds another year to sentence
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Darion ``Sam'' Castle traded 21 years of
illicit freedom for an extra year in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Castle, 63, was supposed to begin serving a 10-year prison
sentence in 1977 for blowing up his own sailboat at a Lantana
marina. Instead he fled the state, eluding authorities in Alaska,
Canada and other far-flung locations until he was nabbed in Seattle
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Castle pleaded guilty to a federal charge of unlawful flight to
avoid confinement _ a charge used by federal agents to arrest
fugitives who cross state lines, but which hasn't been prosecuted
against anyone in South Florida since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Castle told U.S. District Judge Kenneth Ryskamp he
was sorry he made that ``erroneous'' decision to run 22 years ago.
``I'm a lot older and a lot wiser,'' Castle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this amounts to is he's traded some years at a younger
age for some years at an older age,'' Ryskamp said in sentencing
Castle to 12 months in prison. ``I do feel that there should be
some consequences to this. We certainly have to send a message to
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle faced a maximum of 14 months under sentencing guidelines.
Federal prosecutors asked for the maximum as well as a fine, saying
Castle, whose wealthy family has ties to the Dole produce company,
may soon receive a large inheritance. Ryskamp fined Castle $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Castle's plea agreement, prosecutors agreed not to
pursue charges against his wife and parents, who helped him evade
detection over the years, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Castle's lawyer, Richard Lubin, said it was unclear if Castle
will serving his original prison sentence before or after his
federal sentence; already, he's served seven months of the federal
sentence, meaning he has five months more to serve.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it's unlikely he will spend 10 years in custody,
because his state sentence will be governed by the guidelines in
place at the time of his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officials said Castle could serve from 2-1/2 to 4
years of his original 10-year sentence, though that could be
increased if he is not awarded some time off for good behavior
because he fled. Current sentencing rules call for inmates to serve
at least 85 percent of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Castle was convicted in 1972 of three counts of arson for
torching his boat in what prosecutors called a scheme to collect a
$15,000 insurance policy. Castle was burned in the fire and his
girlfriend at the time died of injuries from the fire, though he
wasn't charged in her death.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors asserted Friday that Monica
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony was far more credible than
President Clinton's, and one of them told senators sitting in
judgment in the impeachment trial that ``it's the president who is
not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot
believe the president or accept the argument of his lawyers,'' said
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., opening the second of three days of
arguments by House managers. The Senate must decide which to
believe, he said, adding: ``If you have any significant doubt about
Monica Lewinsky's credibility or testimony, you should have us
bring her in here and let us examine her face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   As it had on Thursday, the question of calling witnesses, with
most Republicans in favor and most Democrats opposed, wound its way
through the day's proceedings. The issue will not be decided until
the week after next, but several Republican senators who said they
had doubted the wisdom of witnesses said they were changing their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, the main speaker Friday, delved into sexually explicit
material to support his contentions, something no one had done
previously during the trial. He cited sworn testimony by Clinton to
the effect that he had never kissed or fondled her breasts or
touched her genitalia, and sworn testimony by Ms. Lewinsky that he
had done so repeatedly, as well as corroboration by friends who
said she told them about it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Ms. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and others, McCollum
said: ``Time and again, the president says one thing and they say
something entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida lawmaker's approach dramatized one of the dilemmas
that Republicans face. Some of their strongest evidence in support
of the perjury article involves precisely the sort of material that
caused much of the public to sour on the presentation of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr and the proceedings of the House
Judiciary Committee. Without going into it, and questioning
witnesses whose testimony conflicts, their case is weakened; going
into it with live witnesses runs the risk of alienating voters
further with a spectacle reminiscent of the Clarence Thomas
confirmation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who filed the first impeachment resolution
over campaign financing in the House in November 1997, concluded
for the Republicans with typically vivid language that produced a
chilling moment of television. As he urged the Senate to ``strike
down these insidious cancers that eat at the heart of our system of
government,'' CNN showed Clinton, returning from a trip to New
York, stepping from his helicopter and calling to his dog, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Barr also prompted the first brief clash of the trial. Several
times, he referred to the senators as ``jurors,'' which prompted
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to rise to his feet and insist that the
Senate was sitting as a court, not as a jury. Until then, the
senators had sat mute, except for Majority Leader Trent Lott, who
spoke exclusively about housekeeping details. Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist, issuing his first ruling from the chair, said that
Harkin's ``objection is well taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly petty intervention had a large political point,
Democratic senators said. Harkin, who has backed Clinton as
fiercely as Barr has attacked him, told colleagues he was worried
that the word ``jurors'' would lead the public to conclude that the
Senate's job was merely to find Clinton guilty or not guilty,
whereas in his view they also needed to decide whether the
president's crimes, in any, constituted impeachable offenses, and
whether removing Clinton from office would serve the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, a mild-looking man who wears aviator glasses, is known
in the House as a detail man of unflagging persistence. Those
qualities were on display Friday as he extensively examined Ms.
Lewinsky's Aug. 6, 1998, grand jury testimony, now one of the most
familiar items in the case. It was then that she said, as the White
House never tires of pointing out, ``No one asked or encouraged me
to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   She was testifying about a late-night telephone conversation
with Clinton on Dec. 17, 1997. McCollum made two points: One, that
the entire sentence at issue was, ``No one asked or encouraged me
to lie, but no one discouraged me, either.'' Two, that Ms. Lewinsky
later said, ``I knew what he meant.'' Pressed, she added that she
knew that as ``we had on every other occasion and every other
instance of this relationship, we would deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum then asked: ``Can there be any doubt that the president
was suggesting that she file an affidavit that contains lies and
falsehoods?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Republicans presented ended with rhetorical
questions like that. Much else involved phrases like ``not
plausible,'' ``not reasonable,'' ``logical common sense says no,''
``you may infer,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a former CIA analyst and former prosecutor, was at pains
to insist, perhaps because of this, that circumstantial evidence
was not to be denigrated, no matter what commentators or the
president's lawyers might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a principle of long and consistent standing in every
federal court in our land, and I suspect in every state court in
our land,'' he said, ``that circumstantial evidence is not to be
and shall not be afforded any less weight than direct evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That question of the weight of the evidence also preoccupied
McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that not all the many details of the case meshed, he
admonished the senators: ``Never lose sight of the totality of this
scheme to lie and obstruct justice. Never lose sight of the big
picture. Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a whole, he insisted, ``the weight of the evidence in
this case is very great; it's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no direct White House rebuttal of any of this.
That will begin Tuesday, the very day when Clinton, in another of
the bizarre juxtapositions in which this case has abounded, goes up
to Capitol Hill to deliver the seventh State of the Union message
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presentation Friday was not well-organized, with
speakers crossing each other's paths again and again. It sometimes
seemed that they had not read or heard each other's statements. For
example, Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, used the same quotation
from Theodore Roosevelt in his opening Friday that Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., had cited in his first words Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Barr heard criticism of this ``floating around in the ether out
there,'' he said, and entered a defense of ``not endless, not
pointless but appropriate repetition'' as a legitimate and
effective tool of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In his own argument, Barr devoted considerable time to the
events of Jan. 18, 1998, a Sunday, when Clinton talked with his
secretary, Betty Currie. He had testified the day before. He asked
her a series of questions _ in the form of ``false and misleading
accounts of events,'' Barr said _ and asking her to agree. In one
question, Clinton asked Mrs. Currie to agree that he had never been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky in or near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why did so, Clinton said he was ``trying to get the facts
down.'' But Barr contended that he was coaching her to support his
testimony, which he knew to be false. Often in white-collar
obstruction-of-justice cases, Barr continued, no one suggested to
anyone that they lie. He cited a 1953 case in the 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals in which Michael O'Keefe, a New Orleans real-estate man,
was convicted of obstruction for having tried to persuade a
colleague to testify falsely by falsely describing a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe never asked anyone to lie, Barr said. ``He didn't have
to. He was too smart for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, Barr declared, ``when one considers that
he had already testified, it was obviously too late to try to
recollect what the facts were.'' Barr added, ``in any event, Mrs.
Currie could not have told him what the true facts were because he
alone knew what they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Three prosecutors, or ``managers,'' to use the formal term, gave
little seminars on the law. One of them, Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio,
who explained what constituted perjury, said that one of the key
elements was whether a person lied knowingly or through accident or
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could not claim to have spoken out of ignorance in
testifying to the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter
because ``the president's own lawyer has acknowledged the care, the
intention, the will of the president to say exactly what he said.''
He was alluding to a statement by Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel, and he showed it on the special television screen set up
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff was clearly speaking about Clinton's deposition in the
Paula Jones civil case, not his grand jury testimony, which is a
subject of the impeachment article alleging perjury. The House of
Representatives rejected a separate impeachment article involved
perjury in the civil case.

PARTISAN SPLIT ON WITNESS ISSUE HARDENS IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No matter how much senators say they want to avoid
it, the partisan split over witnesses appears to be hardening each
day that the House managers present their case against President
Clinton, with a near party-line vote in favor of taking more
testimony looking ever more likely.
</P>
<P>
   In their appearances before the Senate, the House managers have
refined their wish list of witnesses to a kind of prosecutorial
mantra, constantly repeating the names of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon
Jordan Jr. and the White House aides Betty Currie, John Podesta and
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., even finished his appearance before
the Senate Friday with a call for the ultimate witness. ``Invite
the president to come,'' he said, ``and judge everybody's
credibility for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Senate Republicans themselves had been divided over
the issue, with some powerful figures fearful of sullying the
dignity of the Senate with tawdry testimony. But three prominent
Republican senators who had been wary of calling the principals in
the case against the president _ Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Ted
Stevens of Alaska and Robert Bennett of Utah _ now say they are
inclined to support at least depositions, which would come before
any in-person testimony to all 100 senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved from being one of the most skeptical in the
conference, to leaning in that direction,'' McConnell said Friday,
speaking of deposing witnesses. He said the House prosecutors'
ability to skate around the questions of sex in their opening-day
presentations had calmed his fears of a sordid spectacle in the
well of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said, ``I think a convincing case has been made on
behalf of the House that we cannot have a full and complete trial
unless witnesses come.''
</P>
<P>
   While a few Democrats, like Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and Ron
Wyden of Oregon, said they had not made up their minds on
witnesses, most Democrats, if anything, seemed even more set
against them than before.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who had helped to write a
bipartisan agreement on trial procedures last week that pulled the
Senate back from partisan confrontation, on Friday dismissed the
need for witnesses. ``I don't think at the start of this yesterday
there were five senators who understood that Monica Lewinsky had
had 22 individual meetings where she responded to questions under
oath,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the witness question ``may be very well'' decided on a
party-line vote. He said sentiment against witnesses was growing
among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And when Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, startled the Senate Friday by
rising and objecting to repeated references by Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., to senators as ``jurors,'' Democrats said he was emphasizing
the right of senators to deviate from normal trial procedures, like
calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that as a senator sitting on a trial on impeachment,
we can take into account not just the facts and the law but the
public good,'' Harkin said after the Senate recessed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early in the proceedings and the president's lawyers
have not yet had the chance to make their case. That means
sentiment could shift once again next week when the White House
presents its defense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it is also the case that under the bipartisan Senate
agreement struck last week, the question of whether to depose
witnesses can be decided by a simple majority of 51 votes, which
means that the 55 Republicans could decide the issue if they stay
unified.
</P>
<P>
   If the partisan division is in some ways a display of simple
party loyalty, it also reflects a fundamental difference in how the
two parties are approaching the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   For many Republicans the question is whether the evidence is
hard enough to support the House's charges that Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice in his efforts to cover up his
extramarital relationship with a White House intern. ``It's not too
much to ask that your highest elected officials lead felony-free
lives'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith noted that in contrast to his view that the charges
warrant conviction if proved, many Democrats believe that even if
the charges are true they do not rise to the level that the
Constitution sets for a president's removal from office. That makes
it less important for Democrats to hear witnesses and clarify
questions of fact. ``So we're partly like trains passing each other
in the night,'' Smith said of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kennedy said Friday that the senators should be
considering first whether the facts ``rise to the standard of an
impeachable offense as outlined by the Founding Fathers.'' He said
he had agreed with historians who had told the House that they did
not.
</P>
<P>
   A party-line vote on witnesses is more risky politically for
Republicans than Democrats. They failed to make expected gains in
the November midterm elections in part because of public
perceptions that they were more concerned with investigating
Clinton than pursuing an agenda. Clinton's job-approval ratings
remain unusually high in public polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who is trying to avoid a
partisan confrontation, said a few Republican senators had urged
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, to try once again to
assemble a bipartisan group of senators to discuss guidelines for
depositions and numbers of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But some senators said that a partisan split over witnesses was
inevitable. ``I'm fairly certain this won't be a bipartisan
agreement,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``This will be the
point at which there's a parting of the ways. There's no question
about it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Likened to Martin Luther King and doused with praise
for the economy's strength, President Clinton was celebrated on
Wall Street Friday at a conference of minority and white
businessmen while, back in Washington, House prosecutors assailed
him for a second day before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ya done good, William Jefferson Clinton,'' said Susan Taylor,
editor of Essence Magazine. She advised him to ``be gentle with
yourself'' because ``only God is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grasso, president of the New York Stock Exchange, told
Clinton that King was surely smiling down on the gathering. ``He's
recognizing what you've done for this country,'' he said, as he
described how Clinton's presidency had benefited ``my little corner
of southern Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who organized the conference to
promote diversity on Wall Street, told the president that the only
people with ``clean uniforms'' were those who lacked the confidence
of their coaches to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who play have stains on their uniforms,'' he said, as
the crowd, gathered in Windows on the World at the top of the World
Trade Center, responded with cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said they learned only at the last minute that
Jackson had arranged for the series of eight testimonials before
Clinton spoke. The president sat solemnly, growing red in the face,
as speaker after speaker touted his achievements in a session that
combined the whooping of a revival with the statistics-spouting of
a shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally stepped to the lectern, Clinton observed that
such nice compliments were usually paid at funerals. Breaking into
a grin, he jabbed a hand in front of him and added, ``And I don't
think we're there yet!'' The crowd rose in a clamorous ovation.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, it was another day of the brutal juxtapositions
that have come to define his presidency, as the House prosecutors
attacked him for corroding his office while, in speeches in New
York and Washington, he spoke of his hopes for renewing faith in
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging, ruminative address, the president spoke
Friday morning to a conference at the State Department on making
government more efficient, saying that ``this is about, in my
judgment, the preservation of the vitality of democracy.'' He
added: ``To the extent that people do not believe their
representatives will handle their money for public purposes the way
they themselves would, democracy is itself diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in his half-hour speech in Manhattan, he argued that now
was the time to act to ``build a bridge between Wall Street and our
greatest untapped markets'': low-income areas in the cities and the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't do it now, when in the wide world will we ever get
around to it?'' he said. ``If there was ever a time when none of us
have an excuse, this is that time. But the world changes very fast,
and we have to seize the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Clinton proposed a federal initiative intended to
stimulate $15 billion of new private investment in poor areas over
several years. One element of the proposal is $1 billion in tax
credits spread over five years. Another would provide $608 million
in federal spending, mostly for guaranteed loans to increase such
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who flew up to New York Friday morning after his flight
Thursday was postponed because of icy weather, returned to
Washington after the conference for a fund-raiser Friday night on
behalf of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, the day was another opportunity to
demonstrate that neither sleet nor snow nor prosecution in the
Senate would stay Clinton from his duties. But such strategy aside,
the president was plainly enjoying himself. He clearly relished the
praise as well as the opportunities to tout before appreciative
audiences the sorts of issues _ government reform and economic
development _ that have been hallmarks of his quarter-century
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Senate trial was never far from sight. One of the
participants in the Wall Street conference was Lanny Davis, the
former White House strategist and spokesman, now a lawyer in
private practice who still informally advises the president.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Clinton arrived, Davis, illuminated by a
television light, stood at the back of the jammed, low-ceilinged
hall, declaring of the House prosecution: ``Been there, done that,
there's nothing new in this whole thing.'' His name tag identified
him as attending the conference on behalf of Motel 6, a client.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the businessmen, several Congressmen, including Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority leader, attended the
conference. Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice-presidential
candidate, was seated before the lectern as Clinton spoke. When the
president said, ``I always liked him,'' Kemp shot back, ``I like
you too, President.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's predicament was much on the minds of those in
the room. An appreciative murmur rippled through, for example, when
Ms. Taylor said that because of Clinton's ``bravery'' in hiring
women and minorities, ``some hardened hearts are bent on punishing
you.'' She continued, ``We black women, we just want to say thank
you, thank you for including us, and not demonizing our men.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to King and Clinton, Dr. Emma Chappell, president of
United Bank of Philadelphia, said they shared a love of justice and
civil rights. ``Tragically, one was assassinated and one is now
persecuted,'' she said. King would have just turned 70.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&AMP;T, did not refer to the
president's travails, but he also did not stint his praise of
Clinton's economic stewardship. ``You had the courage to get it
started,'' he said, adding that everyone was then able to take the
greatest ``economic ride in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also compared the president to King. ``What you are
about as a public-policy leader represents the fulfillment of his
dream,'' he said. Then he likened him to Babe Ruth, noting that
Ruth was remembered for his home runs rather than his numerous
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, what is your box score?'' he asked.
``That's how God judges us.''

ROBERT DOUGLAS, SUAVE ACTOR TURNED DIRECTOR, DIES AT 89  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: England, Calif., N.J.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
  
  Robert Douglas, a stage and screen actor who made a career
portraying swashbucklers and military commanders before turning to
directing, died on Monday at his home in Encinitas, Calif. He was
89.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas, who name was originally Robert Douglas Finlayson, was
born in Bletchley, England. He made his acting debut at 16 and
attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art the next year.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 21 Douglas had landed a featured role in an
all-star London revival of ``A Bill of Divorcement'' and by 23 he
was producing and directing plays in the city's West End.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared with Sybil Thorndike in ``Kind Lady'' and Laurence
Olivier in ``Last Enemy'' before moving to New York to star in the
American production with Jessica Tandy.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas made his film debut in 1936 in ``Over the Moon,''
starring Merle Oberon and Rex Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of commanders in the West Sussex regiment
in England, Douglas was one of the first actors to enlist at the
start of World War II, becoming a pilot for the British Royal Navy
in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge in 1946 he produced, directed and starred in
``Lighten Our Darkness'' in London before moving to Hollywood,
where he was placed under contract to Warner Brothers in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his patrician good looks and debonair manner he soon
became a popular supporting actor, appearing alongside some of
Hollywood's biggest names in such action films as ``Adventures of
Don Juan'' and ``Kim,'' which starred his friend Errol Flynn; ``At
Sword's Point'' with Maureen O'Hara; ``The Talisman'' with Rex
Harrison; ``Ivanhoe'' with Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Taylor and Joan
Fontaine; ``Desert Rats'' with Richard Burton; ``The Virgin Queen''
with Bette Davis, and ``The Fountainhead,'' starring Patricia Neal,
Raymond Massey and Gary Cooper, one of Douglas' favorite films.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas made his Broadway directing debut in 1956 with ``Ponder
Heart,'' starring David Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to direct several more theatrical productions before
turning to television, where he worked as a director and producer
on a succession of hits, including ``Medical Center,'' ``Quincy,''
``Barretta,'' ``Colombo'' and ``The Streets of San Franciso.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Giles Finlayson of Encinitas, and a
daughter, Lucinda Gabri of Scotch Plains, N.J.

TWO FALCONS SAY VIKINGS HAVE NOTHING ON THEM

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ One receiver is tall, rangy and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The other one is a polished veteran who runs crisp routes and
simply makes plays. Together they make up one of the league's top
receiver tandems.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: The above twosome is not the Vikings' dynamic duo of Randy
Moss and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Falcons receivers Terence Mathis and Tony Martin _ the
other guys in tomorrow's NFC Championship Game between the
Minnesota Vikings (15-1) and the Atlanta Falcons (14-2) and likely
the best receiver combo you've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   The two combined for 130 receptions for 2,317 yards and 17
touchdowns this season. The yards made them the second-best tandem
in the NFL, just 7 yards behind the Moss-Carter total of 2,324
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson has received a lot of credit for the
Falcons' success this season. However, Falcons coach Dan Reeves
said his Dirty Birds wouldn't be here without Mathis and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, they've done an awful good job for us this year,''
Reeves said. ``I don't know that I've been around two guys that
have contributed more than Terance and Tony have. They're unselfish
players. Both of them will do whatever you ask them to do, as far
as the running game is concerned. And they are both excellent
receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a 6-foot-1 speedster, caught 66 passes for 1,181 yards
and six touchdowns in the regular season. He averaged 17.9 yards
per catch, hauled in 13 passes for at least 30 yards or more and
had five 100-yard games.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, 5-foot-10, is the go-to guy. He caught 64 balls for
1,136 yards and 11 touchdowns, including 20 catches on third down.
But he also has speed, with four receptions between 55 and 78
yards.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the Vikings' first order of business on
defense is to stop Anderson and the running game. However, they
also know that they have to be wary of Mathis and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fast,'' Vikings cornerback Corey Fuller said.
``They're veterans and they're crafty. So it's going to be a battle
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle might not just be between the Vikings' secondary and
the two receivers, as the game also presents an opportunity for
Mathis and Martin to measure themselves against Moss and Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler said Mathis and Martin have
played large roles in his success this season and believes it's
time someone paid attention to the Falcons' duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition and accolades are related to what the media
decides to write about,'' Chandler said. ``The Moss story was
special because of the draft and being overlooked. There was a lot
more attention focused on that duo from the start. But our guys
made big plays all year, too. Mathis is as smart as anyone I've
ever been around and Tony is a true big-play receiver. They are two
guys I wouldn't want to trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons are nice. However, Moss said that is as far as
the discussion should go.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Vikings have the best duo in the league, and best
trio, when you include Jake Reed, who will not play because of a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like us in the league,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case all season, Mathis and Martin bear a
strong resemblance.

DISABILITY HELPS LAWYER AVOID PRISON FOR INSIDER TRADING 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young lawyer with cerebral palsy who had pleaded
guilty in an insider trading case avoided prison Friday after a
federal judge in Manhattan said his illness could make him
vulnerable to hardship and dangers in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan warned the lawyer, Craig Ryan Spradling, that his illness
could not serve as ``a free pass to stay out of jail'' if he
committed crimes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Spradling, a 25-year-old former associate at Cleary,
Gottlieb, Steen &AMP; Hamilton, had received widespread attention
because the circumstances were so baffling and because he had been
an inspiration to friends and colleagues for surmounting the
challenges posed by his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Spradling has difficulty walking, speaking, eating and dressing
himself, his lawyer, Nathaniel Z. Marmur, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Spradling was on his way to court, Marmur said, he found
the elevator at his train stop shut down, and had to sit on the
stairs and push himself backward up 10 flights.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Spradling rose and addressed the judge slowly, saying
that his behavior had been inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much enjoyed the practice of law, and am ashamed that I
betrayed the trust given to me,'' Spradling said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I have struggled very hard in life to become a
lawyer, and I know now that I have thrown it all away.''
</P>
<P>
   Spradling, an honors graduate from the University of Texas
School of Law at Austin, joined Cleary as an associate in September
1996, records show.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he was charged with making about $48,000 in illegal
profits after trading in the securities of a company he knew was
going to be the target of a takeover by one of Cleary's clients,
according to a federal complaint filed by the U.S. attorney's
office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Spradling, who could have received 12 to 18 months in prison,
pleaded guilty in October.
</P>
<P>
   He also is in the process of settling a civil complaint filed
against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission, his lawyer
said. A commission official said only that the matter was still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Ned B. Stiles, the managing partner of Cleary, which has
dismissed Spradling, said that he still finds the case ``an
absolute puzzlement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world would anybody jeopardize his career, his job
and all kinds of things?'' Stiles said, adding, ``He had seemingly
overcome a lot of disadvantages to get where he had gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Spradling was earning about $87,000 at the time he committed his
crime, his lawyer told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of his plea bargain with the government, prosecutors
agreed not to oppose his request that he avoid jail because of his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Scheindlin, in sentencing Spradling to a term of probation for
three years _ including six months of home detention _ and fining
him $3,000, said she had concluded that his physical impairments
would be difficult for a prison to accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does need special tools to get through the daily activities
of life,'' the judge said. ``He would be unable to defend himself
in the prison environment, properly exercise, or work.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said that if he committed another crime, ``You won't be
this lucky twice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest you will definitely go to jail if you decide to take
a shortcut again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also seemed struck by the incongruities of the
case, at one point interrupting Spradling's lawyer and asking
bluntly: ``Do you understand why your client did what he did?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was motivated by greed,'' the lawyer replied. ``He was
making money.''

HOUSE MANAGERS MAY ASK SENATE TO INVITE CLINTON TO TESTIFY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a growing consensus among the House
prosecutors to ask the Senate to invite President Clinton to
testify in his impeachment trial, prosecutors and their aides said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., favors that approach as a way of
pressuring Clinton to testify, and none of the 12 other prosecutors
strongly opposes the idea. But Hyde wants to discuss the proposal
one more time with his colleagues, perhaps after oral arguments on
Saturday, before deciding whether to make the request to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately denounced the growing sentiment
among the House prosecutors, and some Senate Republicans, to
strong-arm the president to defend himself in person in his
impeachment trial, calling it a partisan trap designed to embarrass
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've oftentimes in this process shifted quickly from judicial
to political, and I think that may be the case here,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The Republicans have just taken a
poll on this, and this is a winner, they think, for them.''
</P>
<P>
   House managers hope to call about half a dozen witnesses,
including Monica Lewinsky; Betty Currie, the president's secretary,
and Vernon Jordan, the president's long-time confidant. But the
prosecutors, eyeing a new Time-CNN poll that found that 66 percent
of those surveyed want Clinton to testify, are hoping to force him
to so or face political embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he really is innocent, he should come down to the Senate,
he should testify, he should present his case,'' said Rep. James
Rogan, R-Calif., one of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., wrapped up his oral argument to
senators Friday with a plea to call witnesses, including Clinton:
``Invite the president to come and judge everybody's credibility
for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts in Congress said it was an open question as to
whether the Senate could legally compel Clinton's testimony. There
is no precedent for compelling the testimony from anyone subject to
impeachment. President Andrew Johnson did not testify at his Senate
trial in 1868, but he was never subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   The more salient issue is whether Senate Republicans want to
risk extending the invitation, knowing full well that Clinton would
almost certainly refuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans sympathetic to the House managers so far are
avoiding any direct confrontation with the White House on Clinton's
possible appearance. ``I'd like to see him testify, but he's not
going to be compelled,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the
Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no value in having the president come because I'm
confident that if he did come, he would simply repeat the same kind
of tortured evasions that he's had before, and then claim that
those were accurate statements,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also voiced skepticism:
``We'd have to look at why they want to invite him, what void would
be filled, and what questions would be cleared up.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Senate Democrats assailed the idea of even inviting the
president, as a form of coercion. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., warned
fellow Democrats at a party caucus Friday morning that such a step
would be a breach of the separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., accused the House managers and their
Senate sympathizers of ``witness baiting,'' and said any attempt to
force Clinton to appear would ``remove that last vestige of
American jurisprudence, which is you're innocent until proven
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats saw no harm in asking Clinton to tell his
side of the story. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said, ``It would be
appropriate for Congress to invite him. It's his decision to accept
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they persuade the Senate to invite the president, many
House prosecutors acknowledge he is not likely to accept. At least
the president is embarrassed, they say. ``I don't think it's
anything that's likely to happen, so I'm no going to lose any sleep
over it,'' said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president unexpectedly accepted an offer, House
prosecutors said they were eager to grill him on what they say was
his scheme to conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, whether
he told Ms. Currie to pick up gifts he gave Ms. Lewinsky, and other
disputed parts of the scandal. ``We want to cross-examine him,''
said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors may even ask the Senate to offer the
president a certain form of immunity from prosecution in exchange
for his testimony. Under the so-called ``use immunity,'' none of
what the president said to the Senate could be used against him by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, or any other federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could not use the excuse of future prosecution as a
reason not to testify, the managers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use immunity is one of the issues the Senate may face if it
chooses to seek the president's testimony, especially if the
president is worried about exposing himself to criminal
prosecution,'' said Nicole Nason, a Republican spokeswoman for the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   An immunity offer, however, is unlikely to draw out Clinton.
Senate Democrats said it would take a lot more than that for the
White House to change its mind on testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hearing a hue and cry from my colleagues thus far, `We
want the president,''' said Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del. ``If 100
senators stood up and said, `We want the president,' then his
political dynamic changes.''

REPUBLICAN DONORS SAY PARTY'S REAL MESSAGE HAS BEEN OBSCURED
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 2nd graf for attribution `the contributors said')  (See also IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-STRATEGY, IMPEACH-ASSESS,

<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Many of the Republican Party's most
influential financial backers have castigated the party's chairman
and congressional leadership at closed-door meetings here in the
past few days, warning that they were sacrificing voters by failing
to articulate a clear message while focusing on scandal and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The views on the impeachment of President Clinton are not
uniform. Some of the biggest donors told their party chairman on
Thursday night that the impeachment trial had to be brought to an
end. But a more common view was that Republicans in Congress have
an obligation to see impeachment through. The mistake, the
contributors said, has been allowing their battle with Clinton to
drown out all other issues, the contributors said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans clearly have been hearing this last message.
They have been going to extra lengths the last few days to
demonstrate that they can carry out the government's work while
conducting the trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the resort meetings of big donors here, several participants
said in interviews that they had confronted Jim Nicholson, chairman
of the Republican National Committee, and other officials about
their distress over how the party fared in the November elections.
They said they had cited polls showing that the party's public
approval ratings have dipped steadily as the impeachment
proceedings against President Clinton go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember scribbling in my notes, `Do something!''' said
Scott E. Luellen, president of a technology company in Falls
Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a disconnect in the RNC right now about what we say
and what we do on a host of issues,'' Luellen said. ``We need
leaders. Most of the comments were aimed at Mr. Nicholson _ he was
at times defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, who faces a challenge to his re-election as party
chairman next week but is expected to win, declined to acknowledge
the serious concerns. Speaking on Friday about a meeting with
Republican Eagles, a group of big donors, he said: ``We had a good
candid discussion. But it was categorically positive. We are going
to have better message discipline about taxes, about improving our
national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mel Sembler, the Republican finance chairman, who was on a
panel with Nicholson, acknowledged that donors were not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of complaints that we talked a good game but
we didn't perform,'' Sembler said. ``They said: `Where were these
tax cuts that we were talking about? Where are all those issues
that we talked about? We're supposed to be doing things _ not just
talking about them. What happened to this tax cut? The House passed
a tax cut, it went over to the Senate, and it just sat there.
Nothing happened. We not only have to craft messages; we have to
execute them.'''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at the luxurious Breakers Hotel of more than 100
members of the Republican Eagles _ those who donate at least
$15,000 to the party every year _ was a reward for their generosity
and an opportunity for contributors to mix with prominent
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   After the Eagles session, Nicholson attended a meeting here of
even larger donors: members of Team 100, who have given at least
$100,000. Some of them said they had cornered Nicholson at an event
on Thursday night and warned that the party was making a mistake in
prolonging the impeachment issue because it appealed only to
already committed supporters.
</P>
<P>
   And at a closed-door meeting of Team 100 on Friday, donors said
they had expressed concerns to Nicholson that were similar to those
voiced by the Eagles the day before. ``There is a worry that we may
allow ourselves to be portrayed as the impeachment party,'' said
one participant in the Team 100 meeting, speaking on condition of
anonymity. But, he said, most of the discussion was centered on one
question: ``What is the congressional agenda? What are you going to
do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   The donors are a critical constituency of the Republican Party.
While no one overtly threatened to withhold support, the unspoken
message at the meetings of the Eagles and Team 100 was that the
party had better shape up or they could begin holding back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope there's not a lot of apathy out there _ I hope
they haven't given up,'' said Ted Welch, a veteran party
fund-raiser who traveled here. ``But there's concern among the
donors that the approval rating of Republicans in Congress has gone
down dramatically over the last few months and that since 1994 we
have lost ground. We can't afford to lose more ground. Republicans
are very concerned about that possibility.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While some Team 100 members expressed concern about the
impeachment matter, participants said members of the Eagles did not
specifically mention the party's handling of impeachment at their
meeting with Nicholson. Several said they were resigned to the fact
that Republican lawmakers had a duty to move forward with the
trial, regardless of the impact on the party.
</P>
<P>
   Sembler said that before the election, the party ``test-marketed
the impeachment issue to see if it would motivate our contributors
_ it did not.'' He added, ``Our base is interested in issues like
cutting taxes, improving education and reducing crime and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the consensus of many contributors here was that the
party had a powerful message on cutting taxes, improving the
military and reducing the size of the government, but had failed to
convey it to the public. The participants in the meetings here
singled out Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader,
and other party leaders in Congress for not pressing forward with
an aggressive agenda. There were no lawmakers from Washington at
the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``More could have been done this last session,'' said Donald T.
Branning, an Eagle who founded an electronics manufacturing company
in Gilbert, S.C. ``It's disappointing that more legislation wasn't
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Branning said that while Senate Republicans ``have to do the
right thing'' and carry out the impeachment trial, he expressed
worry that it could drag out at the expense of the party. ``It
should be an expeditious process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Brunelli, an Eagle who is a lobbyist in Washington, said
that if the party's low standing in the polls ``truly reflects the
American people, then I'm very discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't think it's the lack of a message. It's a
lack of communicating that message to grass-roots America. It
really is adjusting to governing. We don't want to speak at people;
we need to speak to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to become too glum about his party, Brunelli said: ``I
don't think it's a dark day for Republicans. It's time to stand up
for what we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   No contributor interviewed here expressed delight that the
Republican Party is at all mixed up in the impeachment matter. ``Do
you know anybody who enjoys what we're going through?'' Brunelli
asked. ``I hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who attended a meeting of Team 100 on Friday,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said several donors expressed
deep concern about the party's direction. ``You lose five or six
races and everybody wants to get under the hood,'' he said.
``Everybody recognizes that with impeachment you just don't turn it
off. But they are concerned that it defines the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sembler, who made his fortune building shopping centers, and
several other business executives here likened the private meeting
he had with Eagles to that of stockholders standing up to their
corporate board. ``These are our investors, these are our
stockholders,'' he said, adding that they asked him and Nicholson,
``What are we going to do to improve our performance?''
</P>
<P>
   Some contributors were not satisfied with the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a shareholders meeting,'' Luellen said. ``The
participants were reporting some quarterly losses. But the
leadership seemed to focus on their accomplishments instead of all
the things that aren't going well. In business, that's how you
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   David A. Bardes, an estate planner in Vero Beach, Fla., said:
``Some asked tough questions. But they're entitled to. It's no more
contentious than the Democrats talking to Clinton about what he has
done to them.''

 NETS REBOUND WITH $100 MILLION FOR WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day and half is not a long time to negotiate when tens of
millions of dollars are involved. But for the Nets, the 33 hours it
took to agree in principle to a seven-year, $100 million contract
with Jayson Williams must have dragged along like farm machinery
behind a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the Nets settled grudgingly on the contract that
was announced on Thursday by Sal DiFazio, Williams' agent. But the
club's relatively low initial offer, probably a negotiating step,
led to a series of events that could have slowed the momentum the
franchise has been accumulating over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Between the time that talks began at 9 a.m. Wednesday and the
time the two parties shook hands in agreement at 6 p.m. Thursday,
Nets coach John Calipari received a sobering call from Keith Van
Horn; Williams mulled over offers from four clubs, including two
that nearly doubled what the Nets' initially proposed, and the Nets
rearranged their thinking and their bank account. In the end, they
made Williams the highest-paid player in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which will pay Williams a pro-rated portion of his $11
million salary this season and increase by 10 percent in each of
the following seasons, will not be certified until the National
Basketball Association's new labor agreement is made final next
week. For that reason, Michael Rowe, the Nets' president, and John
Nash, the general manager, could not comment on the contract or the
negotiations. But Calipari, choosing his words carefully because of
league rules, confirmed Friday that Williams' future with the Nets
had been solidified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our heart and soul,'' Calipari said. ``He adds passion
and emotion and enthusiasm to what we want to do here. If Jayson
were not on our team, our path would have changed. I'm not saying
we'd turn around and go back down the path, but it would have
changed us, veered us in another way. So I thought it was important
to get that taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. According to a person close to the negotiations, the
Nets' first offer to Williams was perhaps as low as $40 million
over six years, plus $15 million in incentives. By NBA standards,
that is middle-class money, and Williams, the league's
second-leading rebounder and an Eastern Conference all-star last
year, was looking for first-class figures. He also wanted a
seven-year deal that would allow him to finish his career with the
Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was expecting at least $12 million per season, was
taken aback by the Nets' offer. The 6-foot-10 center said he was so
offended that, for the first time, he began seriously considering
signing with another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would have left,'' Williams said by phone Friday from
his home in Clinton, N.J. ``After that first offer, I was really
upset. I heard from five or six teams who wanted me to leave the
Nets out of spite. And spite was there. Because I thought, `Hey,
man, if they're going to treat me like that, I have to get on out
of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams called Van Horn, who has spoken often of his desire to
keep this young Nets team together. Concerned about the future
direction of the team, Van Horn called Calipari Wednesday to voice
his displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Cal and told him that I felt that if the ship was
going to start sinking, I didn't think many people were going to be
staying on it,'' Van Horn said. ``The people we have here are
coming in to win, and if they didn't re-sign Jayson, I would not
have seen that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   That message from one of the league's young stars, plus the
serious interest that Charlotte, Detroit, Denver and Chicago were
showing in Williams _ one club offered a six-year, $82.5 million
deal _ sent the Nets into the second day of negotiations with a
different mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that one false move could have derailed the entire
franchise, the Nets increased their offer substantially, paying
Williams, who will turn 31 on Feb. 22, more than they had to. In
making Williams the club's first $100 million man, they gave him
nearly $18 million more than any competitor could have. The Nets
also gave him the seventh year he wanted so badly, though after six
seasons, the club has an option to buy out the remainder of his
contract for $8.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the lucrative deal a signal to Williams and Van
Horn, but also to the rest of the Nets and the rest of the league.
``I think it says that the franchise is committed, that no games
are being played, that they want to get this thing rolling, that
they're going to take care of their players,'' said Rony Seikaly,
Williams' backup at center. ``They're going to reward hard work and
it's a great sign to show other players and younger players that
this is a franchise on the way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who said he was ``ecstatic'' about the deal, was
grateful to Van Horn for speaking out. ``That shows you what kind
of family we have,'' Williams said. ``When I go to war, I know I
have a warrior with me in Keith Van Horn. We have a good family
here.''
</P>
<P>
   A family that had its differences for 33 hours but is now back
on the same page.

LOCKING UP FREE AGENTS TOPS KNICKS' AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks are looking for closure this weekend. As
teams begin to agree in principle with free agents, a trickle-down
effect could help end much of the speculation and drama surrounding
the frenzy of activity that has unfolded since the lockout ended
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have just a few days before an abbreviated training camp
begins early next week, making it imperative for them to have their
rosters as complete as possible. The Knicks are moving in that
direction by intensifying their discussions with their prime free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Charlie Ward is a priority. His agent has indicated
that Ward is looking to make more than $5 million a year. Although
they are more likely to retain Ward, the Knicks have also toyed
with the idea of using him in a sign-and-trade deal. Not only are
the Knicks focused on Ward, but on Chris Dudley, too. He is looking
to make up for lost income after he passed up a contract offer from
Detroit worth $18 million over three years to be part of a
sign-and- trade deal for $1.15 million last season with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his monetary sacrifice, the Knicks were expected
to re-sign Dudley, their safety net for Patrick Ewing, at about $6
million a year. The Knicks have not made that leap, however, and
one team official said they were hesitant to give Dudley a
four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dudley is looking elsewhere, and there are at least
five teams interested in him. Most do not have the salary cap room,
but the Sacramento Kings could create about $5 million in cap space
to sign him as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   One other major issue that will very likely be resolved over the
weekend is the address of Latrell Sprewell. The Warriors do not
want to open training camp early next week with Sprewell on their
roster. Throughout the swirl of speculation, Sprewell has taken on
the aura of a reclusive eccentric. He is believed to be living in
Milwaukee, although no one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a fear of the unknown surrounding the volatile
Sprewell _ who has not played a game since choking Golden State
coach P.J. Carlesimo in December 1997 _ the lure of him has left
several teams ignoring a potential public relations nightmare for a
chance at landing the former All-Star guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have been one of those teams. Although team officials
from the Eastern Conference believe the Knicks have entered the
Sprewell sweepstakes more out of gamesmanship than real interest,
the Knicks could end up with the trade. The Miami Heat and Indiana
Pacers appear to be cooling toward the idea of Sprewell, but it
could change. Some days, it seems the Pacers, the Heat and the
Knicks are backing off. Other days, all three appear to be baiting
one another into making the trade.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pacers and the Heat step away, one team official said the
Knicks would gladly take Sprewell in exchange for Chris Childs and
Chris Mills, and possibly John Starks. The Knicks would then turn
Sprewell into a small forward and cross their fingers over their
risky move to gain an edge on a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gamble to plan on him being a guy who can push you over
the top,'' one general manager said. ``He could self-destruct just
as easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could just as easily stay the same entering training
camp by re-signing their free agents. To add talent, the Knicks can
use their $1 million and $1.75 million exceptions. The Knicks may
wait until the major free agents are signed next week, and then see
who is left. The salary cap is tighter than many teams expected,
which could leave some midlevel players unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about re-signing our free agents,'' the Knicks
president Ernie Grunfeld said. ``That's our priority right now.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Any threat of hope the Knicks had of signing the Israeli point
guard ODED KATASH were severed Friday. Although Katash asked the
Maccabi Tel Aviv team to release him from his contract in order for
him to play in the National Basketball Association, his request was
denied. &QL;

LAWSUIT SAYS GAY YOUTHS IN FOSTER CARE ARE ABUSED
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A class-action lawsuit was filed on federal court
Friday on behalf of gay, lesbian and bisexual youths in foster
care, charging that because of their sexual orientation they are
routinely subjected to physical violence and psychological abuse in
New York City's child welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, the first of its kind in the country, highlights
what experts say is a nationwide problem in foster care, affecting
children as young as 9 or 10 as well as teen-agers, and
contributing to high numbers of runaways and suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The six plaintiffs named in the lawsuit, Joel A. vs. Giuliani,
describe experiences of homophobic abuse _ from unrelenting
harassment to broken bones to rape _ by peers, foster parents and
staff members of child welfare agencies. Their appeals for
protection were typically met with indifference, blame or
isolation, according to the suit, which was filed in the U.S.
District Court in Manhattan by the Urban Justice Center, a
nonprofit advocacy organization for the homeless, and pro bono
lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, working for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the city's Administration for
Children's Services, said she could not comment on pending
litigation, but added, ``We are working on the issues concerning
gay and lesbian foster children on several fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel A., the lead plaintiff, is a 13-year-old boy who entered
foster care at age 9, when he already considered himself gay. The
lawsuit charges that staff members at a series of group homes and a
large residential treatment center rarely intervened when other
children abused Joel because he was effeminate. Among other
incidents, he was thrown down a flight of stairs, had his nose
broken twice, was hit in the face with a broom and had his shoulder
blade broken, the lawsuit charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another plaintiff, Eric R., attempted suicide by hanging himself
from a baseball backstop at age 15 after nine years in a series of
Long Island foster placements where, according to the lawsuit, he
was constantly humiliated because of his feminine demeanor and grew
increasingly depressed and fearful about disclosing his sexual
orientation. When he finally told his social worker that he was
gay, the suit charges, he was sent to a foster home owned by two
gay men, one of whom sexually abused him. When he complained, an
agency supervisor threatened to place him at a facility in the
Bronx where tough boys would beat him up for being gay, the suit
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Among other examples cited by the lawsuit were a therapist who
told Eric that all gay people get AIDS and it was God's punishment,
and a psychiatrist at an upstate residential treatment center who
told another adolescent that ``boys will be boys'' after other
youths had harassed him daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants' failure to protect members of the class from
bias-related aggression results in extreme physical, psychological,
emotional and developmental injury,'' the complaint says. As an
immediate remedy, the suit seeks foster care facilities specially
staffed and programmed as ``safe houses,'' and in the long term,
staff training to make all placements safe and supportive of gay,
lesbian and bisexual children.
</P>
<P>
   David Pumo, a lawyer at the Urban Justice Center and the
director of its Lesbian and Gay Youth Project, said it was
impossible to estimate the size of the lawsuit's class, which is
defined to include young people in foster care ``who are
questioning or confused about their sexual orientation or gender.''
</P>
<P>
   But he pointed to research indicating that gay and lesbian
youths are overrepresented in foster care because they are more
likely to be rejected by their families. National studies show that
gay and lesbian youths are two to three times more likely to
attempt suicide than other children.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1992, in an internal memo included as evidence in
the case, city child welfare officials acknowledged that many gay
and lesbian children were ``nearly impossible'' to place
appropriately because private, nonprofit foster care agencies
either rejected them or reported that they were ``scapegoated'' by
other children and staff members, ``which disrupted services to
other residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one specialized program exists, unofficially, among more
than 60 foster care agencies caring for 40,000 children in the
city's custody, according to the lawsuit: Green Chimneys Gramercy
Residence, a group home that serves only 35 boys ages 16 to 21.
Nationally, the only other residential foster program specifically
for gay youths is in Los Angeles, Pumo said, and serves an equally
modest number of older teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wiener said the city plans 11 more group home beds and began
staff training on sexual identity last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Mallon, who founded the Green Chimneys program and is on
the faculty at Hunter College, said the greatest need is for
services for younger children. ``Clearly the research is showing
children are identifying earlier,'' he said. Mallon, who recently
led training sessions on the issue for judges in Georgia and child
welfare groups in Mississippi, Florida and Missouri, said the
violence described in the lawsuit echoes what he found researching
child welfare systems in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the lawsuit was filed, its lead plaintiff, Joel
A., had his jaw broken in two places by youths on a playground in
Queens who demanded to know whether he was gay, Pumo said.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires an adult, known as a ``next friend,'' to
approve a juvenile plaintiff's appearance in a class action.
Jonathan Cole, the provost of Columbia University, volunteered to
be Joel's. ``Your heart goes out to him,'' Cole said of the boy,
who had worn his blue platform shoes to the law firm handling the
litigation. ``He's a wonderful kid, and he's basically a street
urchin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole added, ``These are youngsters who are at great risk and who
in effect are being put out on the street because the city simply
doesn't have any mechanism for handling gay and lesbian kids.''

 &HT;    MLK Day still struggling to catch on
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 25 years ago, Della Green, now 57,
lobbied the Austin City Council to create Martin Luther King Jr.
Blvd. A decade later, she urged the school board to make his
birthday a paid holiday for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And after moving to Georgetown about two years ago, she was
dismayed to discover that it did not officially recognize the slain
civil rights leader with a holiday of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But this year for the first time, Georgetown is joining the
state and federal governments in commemorating King's birthday by
granting employees a day off work. The City of Round Rock will also
officially observe it for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years after King's birth, however, not all Central Texas
cities observe his holiday, which, after overcoming political
rancor and tumult in Congress, became a national day of celebration
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Leander, Cedar Park, New Braunfels and Temple don't give city
employees a break on King Day. The State of Texas used to combine
the holiday with Confederate Hero-- s Day until 1992, when King's
birthday was celebrated separately.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange recognized the day only last year _
as did Ocoee, Fla., where in 1920 a race riot left at least six
people dead. A nationwide survey found that only 26 percent of
businesses closed for the holiday last year, up from 14 percent in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   But in Georgetown and Round Rock, thanks to Council Members
Shelley Davis and Earl Hairston, Monday will be a day to reflect on
King's message of social justice and equality, a message that
galvanized the country, helped collapse pillars of racism and
became an integral part of the national credo.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that Georgetown, by embracing the national holiday,
is taking significant steps toward the kind of social equality that
King envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot because what I've found is that this city is
still somewhat prejudiced and segregated,'' Green said of
Georgetown, which according to 1990 census had a black population
of 5 percent. ``And many blacks don't want to live or come to this
county.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes people like Davis, a Georgetown City Council member,
and Hairston, his Round Rock counterpart, to get many communities
to recognize the day, said Gary Bledsoe, Texas president of the
NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has spread from year to year,'' he said. ``And this is
significant. It takes grass-roots efforts within communities
because it's not mandated. There is a healing involved in
celebrating Martin Luther King Day. I think it says something when
a community takes that step. It empowers that community.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, not observing the holiday can be costly. In 1987,
the governor of Arizona abolished the holiday. As a result,
activists boycotted the state, and the National Football League
refused to allow Phoenix to be host to the 1993 Super Bowl, costing
the state millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   C. T. Vivian, who was involved in the Arizona boycott and was a
member of King's executive committee, said King's work is relevant
and resonates in virtually every aspect of modern American life. As
the country creeps toward the millennium, becoming ever more
diverse, he said King's significance will be more profound than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin King finished the work of 1776 for us,'' said Vivian,
who is now chairman of the Center for Democratic Renewal in
Atlanta. ``He opened up the possibilities. He opened up a new era
of freedom for the fulfillment of everything this nation believes.
And he did it without violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, King influenced the nation's direction and
consciousness, he said. Such movement manifests itself slowly, so
he said he is not surprised some communities still don't honor him.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons the holiday hasn't caught on in some
places. Many whites regard it as a black holiday, Vivian said.
Teresa Bledsoe, Round Rock's director of human resources, said
governments often balk at another holiday because ``there is the
perception that government employees take a lot of holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   In some local cities, King Day has been eclipsed by more-routine
business.
</P>
<P>
   Making it a city holiday ``is something I intend on doing,''
said Cedar Park Mayor George Denny. ``I've just been inundated with
so many other things in this fast-growing city.''
</P>
<P>
   Leander Mayor Charles Eaton said the holiday ``is not something
that has really been brought up. If I had thought about it a week
ago, I would have seen that we made it a holiday this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, its rising momentum is evidence of King's lasting and
profound effect, said Lance Hill, director of the Southern
Institute for Education and Research, a race relations center at
Tulane University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably signals a change of attitude toward Martin Luther
King and the civil rights movement in general,'' he said. ``We've
made some progress. But even in the mid-'80s, Martin Luther King
and the civil rights movement was controversial and regarded as
disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Georgetown City Councilmember, said he was pleased
that the city has embraced the holiday ``because there is always
room for improvement.''

 &HT;    Groups seek state plan to track pesticide use
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 10 years ago, Congress required
chemical plants, computer-chip companies and other industries to
file annual public reports detailing toxic pollution released to
air, water and land. The law does not require companies to trim
emissions, but many did as a result of public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, environmental and consumer groups in Texas are seeking a
similar requirement for the sale and use of pesticides. Under their
plan, the public could find out the types and amounts of pesticide
applications at farms, ranches, golf courses, schools, parks and
office buildings. Sales to homeowners by hardware stores and
building-supply shops also would be tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting pesticides into the environment, and we don't
know where they're going,'' said Reggie James, director of the
Austin office of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued Friday by the Texas Pesticide Information
Network recommended that Texas follow the lead of California and
New York in requiring pesticide reports. The network is a joint
project of Consumers Union, the Texas Center for Policy Studies and
the Texas Clean Water Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kelly, executive director of the Center for Policy Studies,
said information on individual households or farms might be
withheld from public disclosure for privacy. But records should be
available by ZIP code, neighborhood and watershed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The groups want the Legislature to order state agencies to
develop a reporting plan that could be enacted two years from now.
The proposal received a cool reception from farmers and
exterminators.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Meister, director of commodity and regulatory activities for
the Texas Farm Bureau, said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is
already gathering statistics on the use of crop pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record keeping would be huge ... and a concern because of
the cost,'' said Beth Brooks, executive director of the Texas Pest
Control Association.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Mathis, executive director of the Texas Structural Pest
Control Board, which regulates exterminators, said the only
drawback to the proposal is that it would be very costly for his
agency to collect and maintain the records

ABC ENDS LOCKOUT OF 2,200 WORKERS AS NEW CONTRACT OFFER FACES VOTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., N.Y.)   (rk) 
 By   JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC ended its 74-day lockout of 2,200 behind-the-scenes workers
in five cities Friday as the workers' union agreed to send the
network's latest contract offer to its members for a vote, even
though many of them were dissatisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians will return to work at ABC television and radio
stations in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Washington by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The contract offer would provide two raises of 3.5 percent and
two of 3 percent over four years, and allow the company to increase
the number of temporary workers hired, now 14 percent of the union
work force, to 26 percent this year and 45 percent by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On the picket line outside ABC headquarters on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan this week, workers were encouraged by news of the
approaching end of the lockout, but still wary of the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go back the first day; I want to work,'' said
William Bores, a videotape editor for ``Monday Night Football.''
``But I'm not going for a contract that will, in effect, phase me
out after a few years. ''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout began after the union, whose members had been
working without a contract since March 1997, staged a one-day
strike on Nov. 2 over the network's new health care program. As
part of the agreement ending the lockout, the union is promising
not to stage any job actions until the completion of the contract
vote, which is expected by Feb. 7. If the workers reject the
contract, the situation will return to where it was last fall: the
union members can either continue to work without a contract or
stage another strike.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the president of ABC, described the end of the
lockout as a ``very welcome development,'' but noted that the labor
dispute was still to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the return of our employees brings one difficult period
to a close, there is much that still needs to be accomplished,''
Iger said in a statement released Friday. He added that ABC
executives were ``hopeful that our final contract proposal will be
ratified promptly by all of the various bargaining units so that we
can get on with the business of keeping ABC a strong, competitive
force in the broadcast industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Joyce, a spokesman for the union, said that returning to
work was a victory, even if the contract did not represent many
concessions by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not having the pressure of not receiving a paycheck and
not receiving their medical benefits, having that lifted certainly
is a better position,'' Joyce said. ``People being able to vote on
the inside, they don't have that economic threat hanging over their
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton Bahr, president of broadcast union's parent union, the
Communication Workers of America, described the 10-week job action
as ``a valiant battle against a stubborn employer who was
determined to break their spirit.'' He recommended ratification of
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said ABC was eager to end the lockout because a
boycott of the network by prominent Democrats was hurting the
network's coverage of the impeachment trial of President Clinton,
and because next week new celebrity anchors will make their debuts
on ``Good Morning America.'' The company, on the other hand,
maintains that it was ready to take the workers back as soon as the
union agreed to provide warnings of future strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, the U. S. secretary of labor, Alexis M.
Herman, has been involved in the negotiations, meeting with both
Bahr and Iger.
</P>
<P>
   On the picket line in Manhattan as the lockout officially ended
at 5 p.m. Friday, one technician was sweeping the curb of debris
and removing barricades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth it,'' said the man, who spoke on the condition he
not be named. ``You've got to stand up for what you believe in, for
what you think is right. We stood up against a multibillion-dollar
corporation. It wasn't easy to do.''

GANG LEADER PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY IN DRUG CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of the New York state branch of the Latin
Kings street gang, who had claimed to be leading members away from
violence and drug dealing to self-improvement and community
advocacy, pleaded guilty Friday to conspiring to traffic in heroin
and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   As more than 50 followers and supporters watched in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn, the leader, Antonio Fernandez, 32, a
Brooklyn man known as King Tone, admitted the crime in a plea deal
under which he is expected to be sentenced to 12{ to 15{ years in
prison. That is about half the prison time he would have faced had
he been convicted at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, a former crack addict, took over leadership of the
Latin Kings' New York chapter in 1996, after his predecessor was
convicted of ordering three murders. As the new head of the group,
Fernandez began speaking of new and productive directions for the
chapter members, urging them to eschew crime and seek schooling and
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Preaching a combination of radical politics, Latino pride and a
self-help program, Fernandez publicly suggested that the group,
which his lawyer said had 2,400 members, would become a force that
would strive for benefits like business opportunities, health
insurance, day care and scholarships for Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, reading briskly from a piece of paper as he stood
before the bench, Fernandez, a short, energetic man wearing a
sweatshirt in the gang's traditional black and gold, told Judge
Reena Raggi that he, ``together with others, conspired to
distribute and possess with intent to distribute'' heroin and
cocaine between September 1996 and June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was arrested in the case last May, one of nearly 100
Latin Kings members and associates taken into custody at the time,
on various charges ranging from trafficking in drugs and firearms
to conspiring to commit murders. He was on home detention pending
the outcome of the case, but Friday, Judge Raggi ordered that
Fernandez be jailed pending his sentencing on an undetermined date.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Rey (The King)!'' his followers exclaimed, standing in
unison in the courtroom gallery and giving him the Latin Kings'
raised-arm salute as he was escorted out.
</P>
<P>
   In the year before his arrest, Fernandez had spoken on
television and radio of the new path he envisioned for the Latin
Kings' New York chapter, a branch of a group that originated in the
1940s in Chicago and later added chapters in the Middle West and
Northeast, with the New York branch dating from 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But although some clergymen and other supporters said they
believed that Fernandez, who had spent time in prison for drug
dealing, was sincere in his denunciations of crime, New York City
police officials said they did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the Latin Kings' attempts to portray themselves as
a benign, community-oriented organization, this gang has always
been, and continues, to this day, to be a dangerous group of
criminals,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said in May, when
Fernandez was taken into custody on federal charges filed by the
U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Papers that the office submitted in court said that in one of
the heroin deals in his case, Fernandez conspired with three other
members and associates of the Latin Kings to sell an undercover
officer $7,700 worth of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant U.S. attorney, Eric Tirschwell, said Friday that
Fernandez had also conspired in selling between four and eight
pounds of cocaine in various deals.
</P>
<P>
   But one of his supporters, the Rev Gordon Duggins, an Episcopal
priest, insisted after watching Friday's plea session that ``King
Tone did not do what he pled guilty to,'' but rather had taken the
only route to avoiding an even stiffer sentence in a false case
built with government-bribed witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's lawyer, Ronald Kuby, said that although he had been
right in portraying his client just after his arrest as a
``do-gooder'' who had tried to ``get the Latin Kings out of the
street,'' he had been ``wrong about him being innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Kuby said, ``he himself succumbed to those
streets.''

VIRGINIA'S GOVERNOR DUMPS ON   NEW YORK MAYOR'S REMARKS AND HIS
GARBAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is a man of many talents,
but silver-tongued diplomacy has never been one of them. His recent
remarks that other states should accept New York City's trash as a
fair price for enjoying its cultural bounty drew a chilly response
Friday from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the mayor, Virginia's Governor, James S. Gilmore
III, said, ``I am offended by your suggestion that New York's
substantial cultural achievements, such as they are, obligate
Virginia and other states to accept your garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the mayor outlined his vision of a ``reciprocal
relationship'': three million people a day visit the city for
culture and business, and some of the considerable amount of
garbage they generate should follow them back home, especially once
the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island closes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's comments were prompted by an earlier threat from
Gilmore to pursue a ban on garbage arriving in Virginia on barges.
Gilmore said that the influx of New York City trash to Virginia has
increased sharply in recent weeks, and Waste Management Inc., a
national disposal company, recently signed a contract with a barge
company that would enable it to ship up to 4,000 more tons there.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said that Gilmore had got the mayor's
message all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, at the same time the Governor is making these
comments,'' Lhota said, ``county leaders and local leaders, in
Virginia and elsewhere, who have capacity in their landfills have
contacted the City of New York to express their interest in
receiving our garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who are objecting to this lucrative
business,'' Lhota said, ``are pandering politicians trying to
achieve their own agenda.''

   GRANADA HILLS, Calif.: massive explosion rumbled through the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a big ball of fire that rolled over the top of my
house and within a second my house was in flames,'' said Partlow,
who estimates the explosion occurred 30 to 40 minutes after the
quake.
</P>
<P>
   Partlow and his son ran into their home to grab a few belongings
and managed to force Partlow's car and boat out of the garage
before the fire consumed the single-story home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing we could do to save my house,'' said
Partlow. ``It was fully engulfed in seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fire, as Partlow wandered about the house searching
through the blackened rubble, he discovered a 200-pound slab of
asphalt lying on his son's charred bedsprings.
</P>
<P>
   Partlow believes the chunk was blown off the street by the
broken water main and fell through the roof onto Joseph Partlow's
double bed, landing next to him as the earthquake hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Joseph) didn't even know it was in his bed,'' said Partlow.
``All he knew was that there was water coming down through his
roof. We were pretty lucky he didn't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part of the aftermath was coming to terms with the
loss of all the knickknacks the family had accumulated over the
years, said Partlow, who still owns his lot, but is considering
putting it up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind won't accept it,'' Partlow said. ``One day I might
say I'll work on a project and all of sudden I'll say no, I don't
have that tool. That tool burned up in the fire. My wife has gone
through the same thing.''

NEIGHBORHOOD STILL BEARS SCARS OF '94 EARTHQUAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANADA HILLS, Calif. -- As San Fernando Valley residents tried
to pick up the pieces of their lives following the Northridge
Earthquake, Charles Partlow faced a grim prospect: There simply
were no pieces to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The house Partlow called home for 31 years had burned to the
ground with four others after the Jan. 17, 1994, quake ruptured a
gas main and triggered a fiery explosion. The tower of flame became
one of the most enduring images of the earthquake, reflecting how
30 seconds of shaking can plague neighborhoods even five years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only one of the five homes that burned is being rebuilt
along the 11600 and 11700 blocks of Balboa Boulevard in the
suburban community of Granada Hills, about 25 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles. The rest remain abandoned, empty grass lots
-- victims of the most costly quake to hit an American city.
</P>
<P>
   For Partlow and his neighbors on that street, it was the end of
an era along this thoroughfare that runs north and south across the
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a major change in our life,'' said Partlow, 70. ``It
affected a lot of people. The whole neighborhood changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some along the block moved away, while others are trying to
rebuild. One man wanted to turn his lot into a storage center.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread destruction created opportunities for people like
Charles Mott, a contractor who purchased one of the empty lots in
1995 from his church deacon and is building a new home
single-handedly, piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a great job,'' said resident Patrice Kennedy, who
moved into a home across the street in the winter of 1997. ``It's
not like you see a big crew. It's one man with a hammer and a nail
just working away.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both lots on either side of Mott's home remain empty. One
homeowner moved several miles east to Sun Valley and sold his lot
to a Lancaster man in 1997, according to property records. The
other empty lot was purchased by a Granada Hills company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street and adjacent to Partlow's lot, the property
owner attempted to receive an electrical permit to build a storage
unit, but was turned down because the lot is in a residential area,
according to Inspector Bill Foster of the city Department of
Building and Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kennedy, other new residents on the street voiced their
hopes of seeing similar homes erected on the remaining lots so the
neighborhood can experience a true rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that something gets done,'' said resident Patti
Adams, who moved into a home next door to Partlow's lot. ``The
empty lots are a constant reminder of the earthquake for the people
who live here.''
</P>
<P>
   For Adams and her husband, Allen, there were some reservations
about moving into an area with a notorious earthquake reputation,
but there are no regrets. ``I figure that's the newest gas pipe in
town, so I feel safe,'' joked Allen Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of another quake hitting near their home was an
issue the couple discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the big question,'' Allen Adams said. ``But I said if
it happens twice in my lifetime, it's just my luck.''
</P>
<P>
   On Partlow's lot, a blooming navel orange tree is the only sign
of life on an otherwise bleak landscape of cement, dirt and a
graffiti-scrawled wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rebuild his home, Partlow decided it was time to
rebuild his life. The quake was a good excuse to do what he and his
wife had discussed -- move to Northern California to get away from
city life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't about to move back into that lot and my wife felt the
same,'' said Partlow, whose insurance company reimbursed him for
his losses. ``Once this happened we said there's no sense
rebuilding there if we didn't want to stay there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fire, the explosion and the earthquake are just a
memory for Partlow. He lives an idyllic life in his hometown of
Live Oak, a Northern California town with fewer than 2,000
residents. There he spends his days fishing, doing volunteer work,
and taking part in the chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earthquake was kind of a jolt, but as long as we got out
in one piece we figure we were lucky,'' said Partlow, a retired
assistant district supervisor for the Department of Water and
Power.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Patrick, who at the time of earthquake lived next door to
Partlow, sold his home last year to the Adamses in order to care
for his aging father in Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   Partlow credited Patrick, a fire inspector, for saving the rest
of the neighborhood from burning during the fire. According to
Patrick, when the explosion hit he ran to the alley behind his home
and flagged down a group of firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Since a broken water main had cut off the water supply, Patrick
had the firefighters plunge their fire hoses into his pool to spray
his home and prevented the fire from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hell broke loose,'' said Patrick, 49 and now retired. ``My
house was on fire, the roof and a little bit into the attic and the
front and side windows burned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes after the earthquake rocked Partlow's home, he
scurried about in the eerie silence of the aftermath looking for an
escape route for his family.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his son, age 38 at the time, and wife out of the
house, Partlow went to check on his motor home. He helped neighbors
turn off their gas valves and then went to check on the broken
water main on Balboa Boulevard and realized that a gas main had
ruptured as well.
</P>
<P>
   He spotted Simi Valley resident Jimmy Menzi stranded in the
middle of the street attempting to start his stalled Chevrolet
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hollered to him to get out of there before the gas went
off,'' said Partlow, who then headed to the back of his property.
Seconds later the massive explosion rumbled through the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a big ball of fire that rolled over the top of my
house and within a second my house was in flames,'' said Partlow,
who estimates the explosion occurred 30 to 40 minutes after the
quake.
</P>
<P>
   Partlow and his son ran into their home to grab a few belongings
and managed to force Partlow's car and boat out of the garage
before the fire consumed the single-story home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing we could do to save my house,'' said
Partlow. ``It was fully engulfed in seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fire, as Partlow wandered about the house searching
through the blackened rubble, he discovered a 200-pound slab of
asphalt lying on his son's charred bedsprings.
</P>
<P>
   Partlow believes the chunk was blown off the street by the
broken water main and fell through the roof onto Joseph Partlow's
double bed, landing next to him as the earthquake hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Joseph) didn't even know it was in his bed,'' said Partlow.

AMA JOURNAL EDITOR DISMISSED OVER SEX SURVEY ARTICLE
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 6th graf to expand quote)  (lh) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association dismissed the editor of its
leading journal on Friday, saying he had rushed through a paper on
whether college students think oral sex is ``having sex'' in order
to influence President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the executive vice president of
the American Medical Association, said the incident, which aroused
strong criticism from some medical researchers and journal editors,
had followed what he said was a steady erosion of his faith in the
editor, Dr. George D. Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   Although Anderson would not be specific, others said that
Lundberg had nettled many in the medical community over the years
when he published controversial articles.
</P>
<P>
   The paper that proved to be Lundberg's downfall was by Dr. June
Machover Reinisch, the former director of the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University. In
it, Dr. Reinisch concluded that in an eight-year-old survey of
college students, 59 percent said that oral sex did not constitute
``having sex.'' The article will appear in the Jan. 20 issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said in a statement that he had dismissed Lundberg
because by publishing Dr. Reinisch's article now, Lundberg ``has
threatened the historic tradition and integrity of the Journal of
the American Medical Association by inappropriately and inexcusably
interjecting JAMA into a major political debate that has nothing to
do with science or medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Anderson said that ``there was an
acceleration of the timing'' in the publication of the paper. He
added: ``I don't question the material in there, but I do very
clearly question the judgment in publishing that article in the
middle of the congressional proceeddings. I happen to believe that
Dr. Lundberg was focused on sensationalism here, not science. It
grieves me greatly that that magnificent journal that should be
about science and medicine has been used to extract political
leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Anderson also said that ``over time, however,
I have lost confidence and trust in Dr. Lundberg's ability to
preserve that high level of trust and credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, reached at his home, where he is recovering from a
broken elbow, said he could not comment other than to say that
Anderson called him at 8:15 a.m. on Friday and told him he was no
longer editor of the journal. ``My attorney has me under wraps,''
Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The journal, in Lundberg's 17 years as editor, has taken strong
positions on subjects like the dangers of tobacco and the public
health threat posed by violence. It has also published articles
that made some in the medical community wince. These included a
recent series of articles on alternative medicine; a paper
claiming, with what some said was weak evidence, that eating fish
slashes the risk of sudden death from heart disease; a paper by an
11-year-old girl who reported that therapeutic touch was a sham,
and an anonymous essay by a doctor who told of how he took it upon
himself to kill a cancer patient to relieve her suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it was more or less inevitable that Lundberg would
lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me,'' said Dr. Richard Smith, the editor of
the British Medical Journal, who emphasized that he admires and
supports Lundberg. ``I had almost been waiting for it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The current paper, by Dr. Reinisch, was different from other
controversial articles, however, because it was not even a new
study. The paper made it clear that the survey's main conclusions
were published previously; the oral sex part was, apparently,
leftover data.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reinisch could not be reached for comment, but she told The
Washington Times on Thursday that she had thought of submitting a
paper on the oral sex findings to a journal last year, but then
changed her mind because, she said, she thought the Clinton sex
scandal ``would only last two weeks or so,'' whereas ``it usually
takes six months to a year to get scientific papers published.''
When the oral sex issue did not go away, Dr. Reinisch said, she
decided it would be ``irresponsible'' not to publish her data. So
she sent a paper to the Journal of the American Medical Association
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the paper has a certain news value now that it would
not have had if it were published before or after the Clinton sex
scandal, medical experts said. But the question remains, Why did
Lundberg decide to publish it? It typically takes six weeks to six
months from the time an article is submitted until it is published,
according to a staff member at the American Medical Association.

   Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University
who is a member of the editorial board at the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said he could think of two reasons.
Both tied into the impeachment hearings
</P>
<P>
   ``One is that he has a genuine belief that this is the most
important political decision in this century and every bit of
evidence on it should be published,'' Reinhardt said. The other, he
said, is that the subject is suddenly of news value. And the
journal, likes others, he added, ``loves being noticed in the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that it was his decision to dismiss Lundberg and
that he had made it despite an outcry from his own editorial board.
One member of that board, Dr. Jack D. Barchas of Cornell University
Medical College, said he and others called Anderson to try to stop
him from removing Lundberg. ``We were begging him to reconsider,''
Barchas said.

   ``Many of us feel anger, outrage, and a sense of betrayal by the
decision,'' Barchas said. Lundberg, he added, ``has been fearless
in publishing papers, even controversial papers, based on the best
tradition of science and the best tradition of peer review.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine, which is the chief competitor of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said her journal would never have
published the sex survey paper because ``it is trivial _ who cares
what a bunch of college students say'' about whether oral sex is
sex, she said. ``It also is irrelevant to the Clinton case,'' she
added. ``He wasn't asked the question in that context.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, Lundberg's decision to publish the paper ``is not
a reason to fire an editor who's been there 17 years and by almost
anyone's estimation has put a small society that no one took
seriously on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said his office has been deluged by callers
expressing support.
</P>
<P>
   One was Robert W. Seligson, who is the executive vice president
and chief executive of the North Carolina Medical Society.
Anderson, he said in a telephone interview, ``was careful and
decisive in doing the right thing.'' He said he has the utmost
confidence in Anderson who is ``very knowledgeable about the issues
and doesn't shoot from the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry L. Greene II, who is the executive vice president of
the Massachusetts Medical Society, also supported Anderson. He said
it is a publisher's role ``to take action,'' if he feels the
journal's integrity is threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (THE REST IS OPTIONAL)
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, in England, expressed dismay at the furor over the
sex paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the whole of the United States is going
mad with this impeachment thing,'' he said. ``There's something
crazy about the society.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Smith added, when Lundberg finally was dismissed, ``it's
probably no accident that this was about sex.''

GALLEY IS A REGULAR AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Garry Galley looked around the Kings' dressing
room following practice Friday, and a simple truth revealed itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many defensemen here,'' Galley said.
</P>
<P>
   And for much of the early part of the season, the 15-year
veteran was a victim of those numbers, a healthy scratch for eight
of the first 10 games. In one of the games he did appear in, on
Oct. 25 at Carolina, insult compounded injury when Coach Larry
Robinson played Galley out of position on the wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably a pretty embarrassing moment,'' Galley said.
``You play defense 15 years, and your whole career you hope to be
respected for what you do. That was a time when things were falling
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Galley persevered, and since those dark early-season days,
he has reclaimed a regular spot in the Kings' lineup, performing
solidly if unspectacularly. Coach Larry Robinson said Galley was
making risky plays offensively at the start of the season, and
credited the veteran for removing those plays from his game.
</P>
<P>
   Galley, three months shy of his 36th birthday, has appeared in
seven consecutive games and 28 of the last 32, and is expected to
play tonight when the Kings (16-22-4) face the Pittsburgh Penguins
at the Forum. He is seven games shy of becoming the second Kings
defenseman to reach 1,000 in his career. Doug Bodger reached 1,000
in the same game at Carolina that caused Galley such distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think playing my 1,000th game where I played my first will
be special,'' said Galley, who began his career with the Kings in
1984-85 and rejoined them before last season as a free agent.
``It's been a great ride. I've enjoyed every minute. I think it
will be a really nice accomplishment for myself and my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was married at 21. My wife (Terri Lynn) has been a rock
through this whole thing. Six cities in 15 years. It will be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sidelined (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   The latest King to hit the injury list is winger Craig Johnson,
who suffered separated rib cartilage during the first period of
Thursday's 3-0 victory over Calgary. Johnson is listed as week to
week.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Courtnall, sidelined two months with a broken ankle, would
seem the natural replacement for the speedy Johnson, and Courtnall
is getting close to returning. X-rays Thursday revealed that
Courtnall's injury has healed, but he still has some tenderness,
though that was starting to abate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is tempting to try to jump in (tonight),'' Courtnall
said. ``But the smart thing is to have a couple of days like
(Friday) before I jump in.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall said he is hoping to play in at least one game before
the All-Star break, which begins following Thursday night's home
game against New Jersey. Robinson is anxious to have him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``With C.J. and Muzz out, it takes a lot of speed out of the
lineup,'' Robinson said, referring to winger Glen Murray, who is
sidelined with a knee injury. ``I would like to get (Courtnall)
back in there because of his speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   A team spokesman said reports that the Kings would open next
season with either preseason or regular-season games in London
against the Ottawa Senators are inaccurate. Owner Philip Anschutz
owns the London Knights of the English League and had hoped the
Kings could play some games in Great Britain, but efforts to
finalize plans did not work out. The Kings are expected to play
their preseason home games next season at the Forum, then to move
into the Staples Center for the start of the regular season. The
Kings also are expected to have visits to Las Vegas and Bakersfield
in their 1999-2000 preseason schedule. ... Robinson said he expects
to use Jamie Storr in goal tonight, then play Stephane Fiset on
Tuesday at home against his former team, the Colorado Avalanche.
... After missing six games with a cervical strain, Bodger returned
to the lineup against Calgary, and his injury was tested
immediately. ``I didn't see who hit me,'' he said. ``Same spot,
first shift.'' Bodger survived the hit, and said he was feeling
fine the day after his first game since he was checked from behind
by Phoenix's Dallas Drake.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANADA HILLS, Calif. -- As San Fernando Valley residents tried
to pick up the pieces of their lives following the Northridge
Earthquake, Charles Partlow faced a grim prospect: There simply
were no pieces to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The house Partlow called home for 31 years had burned to the
ground with four others after the Jan. 17, 1994, quake ruptured a
gas main and triggered a fiery explosion. The tower of flame became
one of the most enduring images of the earthquake, reflecting how
30 seconds of shaking can plague neighborhoods even five years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only one of the five homes that burned is being rebuilt
along the 11600 and 11700 blocks of Balboa Boulevard in the
suburban community of Granada Hills, about 25 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles. The rest remain abandoned, empty grass lots
-- victims of the most costly quake to hit an American city.
</P>
<P>
   For Partlow and his neighbors on that street, it was the end of
an era along this thoroughfare that runs north and south across the
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a major change in our life,'' said Partlow, 70. ``It
affected a lot of people. The whole neighborhood changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some along the block moved away, while others are trying to
rebuild. One man wanted to turn his lot into a storage center.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread destruction created opportunities for people like
Charles Mott, a contractor who purchased one of the empty lots in
1995 from his church deacon and is building a new home
single-handedly, piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a great job,'' said resident Patrice Kennedy, who
moved into a home across the street in the winter of 1997. ``It's
not like you see a big crew. It's one man with a hammer and a nail
just working away.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both lots on either side of Mott's home remain empty. One
homeowner moved several miles east to Sun Valley and sold his lot
to a Lancaster man in 1997, according to property records. The
other empty lot was purchased by a Granada Hills company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street and adjacent to Partlow's lot, the property
owner attempted to receive an electrical permit to build a storage
unit, but was turned down because the lot is in a residential area,
according to Inspector Bill Foster of the city Department of
Building and Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kennedy, other new residents on the street voiced their
hopes of seeing similar homes erected on the remaining lots so the
neighborhood can experience a true rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that something gets done,'' said resident Patti
Adams, who moved into a home next door to Partlow's lot. ``The
empty lots are a constant reminder of the earthquake for the people
who live here.''
</P>
<P>
   For Adams and her husband, Allen, there were some reservations
about moving into an area with a notorious earthquake reputation,
but there are no regrets. ``I figure that's the newest gas pipe in
town, so I feel safe,'' joked Allen Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of another quake hitting near their home was an
issue the couple discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the big question,'' Allen Adams said. ``But I said if
it happens twice in my lifetime, it's just my luck.''
</P>
<P>
   On Partlow's lot, a blooming navel orange tree is the only sign
of life on an otherwise bleak landscape of cement, dirt and a
graffiti-scrawled wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rebuild his home, Partlow decided it was time to
rebuild his life. The quake was a good excuse to do what he and his
wife had discussed -- move to Northern California to get away from
city life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't about to move back into that lot and my wife felt the
same,'' said Partlow, whose insurance company reimbursed him for
his losses. ``Once this happened we said there's no sense
rebuilding there if we didn't want to stay there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fire, the explosion and the earthquake are just a
memory for Partlow. He lives an idyllic life in his hometown of
Live Oak, a Northern California town with fewer than 2,000
residents. There he spends his days fishing, doing volunteer work,
and taking part in the chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earthquake was kind of a jolt, but as long as we got out
in one piece we figure we were lucky,'' said Partlow, a retired
assistant district supervisor for the Department of Water and
Power.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Patrick, who at the time of earthquake lived next door to
Partlow, sold his home last year to the Adamses in order to care
for his aging father in Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   Partlow credited Patrick, a fire inspector, for saving the rest
of the neighborhood from burning during the fire. According to
Patrick, when the explosion hit he ran to the alley behind his home
and flagged down a group of firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Since a broken water main had cut off the water supply, Patrick
had the firefighters plunge their fire hoses into his pool to spray
his home and prevented the fire from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hell broke loose,'' said Patrick, 49 and now retired. ``My
house was on fire, the roof and a little bit into the attic and the
front and side windows burned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes after the earthquake rocked Partlow's home, he
scurried about in the eerie silence of the aftermath looking for an
escape route for his family.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his son, age 38 at the time, and wife out of the
house, Partlow went to check on his motor home. He helped neighbors
turn off their gas valves and then went to check on the broken
water main on Balboa Boulevard and realized that a gas main had
ruptured as well.
</P>
<P>
   He spotted Simi Valley resident Jimmy Menzi stranded in the
middle of the street attempting to start his stalled Chevrolet
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hollered to him to get out of there before the gas went
off,'' said Partlow, who then headed to the back of his property.
Seconds later the massive explosion rumbled through the
neighborhood.
</P>

Still on the run, Strug likes just being Kerri
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Real funny, they thought. Who's the smart aleck?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Stanford coeds were standing in a gym on the first
day of classes last semester, about to write their names on the
Beginning Gymnastics sign-in sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Scribbled at the top of the list was the signature, ``Kerri
Strug.''
</P>
<P>
   The women giggled. Yeah, right _ Kerri Strug in Beginning
Gymnastics. Next semester, they'll take Basketball 101 and find
Michael Jordan's name on the sign-in sheet. Or maybe it will be
Music Appreciation and on the first line will be the symbol
representing the artist formerly known as Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who did this?'' one student said to the other. ``Could you
imagine Kerri Strug in this class?''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't have to imagine for long. The women turned
around and right there stretching in a corner of the gym, trying to
blend in as best she could, was Strug, the American hero of the
1996 Summer Olympics and a supreme gymnast who can do
double-layouts in her sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' one student asked the coach. ``Are you
sure this is Beginning Gymnastics?''
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so embarrassing,'' Strug said. ``They were like, `Uh,
what are you doing here? We thought this was going to be an easy
class.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Strug was just trying to fit in. Just trying to be a regular
student, a regular Stanford coed not making a big deal about
herself or her fame.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Strug will be here Sunday, somewhere in the middle
of the pack at the Methodist Health Care Houston Marathon _ ``Way,
way back in the pack,'' she said _ having some fun. Just trying to
fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Since stunning the world and gaining instant fame nearly three
years ago, Strug has become a lot of things she never imagined she
would become. She is a popular speaker at corporate and charitable
events. She has been featured in television shows and commercials.
She has launched a line of children's gymnastics wear and written a
book. She has toured with the ``Magnificent Seven'' gold-medal
winners.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything she has become Kerri. Just Kerri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my entire life focused on only one thing _
gymnastics,'' Strug said. ``All I wanted was to compete and win.
Everything I did, every moment of my life, was dedicated only to
one goal. Gymnastics and the gold medal was everything. And I
wouldn't change anything about that part of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've learned there are different phases in a person's
life. Now, I know there are a lot of things out there and I want to
experience as many of them as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is drinking life in, savoring all the experiences she
only used to read about or watch on television between grueling,
lonely eight-hour practice sessions. There is no Bela Karolyi, no
seemingly endless trips to competitions around the world, no
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs at herself and runs from adventure to adventure.
</P>
<P>
   She has taken up golf, using ``real short clubs,'' she says. She
rollerblades and hikes. She is into mountain climbing. She even
made the Stanford bowling team, complete with a satin shirt
embroidered in script with her team nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call me `Struggles' because that's how I play,'' Strug
said. ``We go all over the place for competitions, and I'm usually
lucky if I knock down a few pins. We're the worst team in the
country, but we still play.''
</P>
<P>
   And she runs. She runs and runs and runs. She puts on the
Walkman and takes off across the Stanford campus until, ``something
gets too tired to go anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started because of that world-famous ankle. The ankle
that buckled on a vault runway in Atlanta, but did not keep her
from clinching the gold, took nearly two years to heal. Strug took
up running in hopes of making the ankle stronger, but it still
bothers her on long runs, which is why Strug is worried she will be
unable to complete the marathon course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there hills on it?'' she said. ``I hate hills. I really
hate hills. Are there slopes? How steep are the slopes? I don't
know if I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the running has made the ankle stronger and given Strug
everything she wants out of sports today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of doing serious stuff, I want to do cool stuff,''
Strug said. ``I want to accomplish neat things, personal things.
The greatest thing in my life was winning the gold medal, but I
realize I don't have to win to be happy. I realize I don't have to
do anything. I can do what I want and get a lot of satisfaction out
of it. I don't want to make a big deal about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why she enrolled in the Beginning Gymnastics class last
semester rather than ask the Stanford gymnastics coach for special
treatment and private time in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Stanford is there are so many unique
people who come to school here and they're all treated the same,''
she said. ``I asked the coach if I could use (the gymnastics
equipment), but I didn't want to make a big deal about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach told Strug to enroll in a class and she would be
allowed to work out on her own while classmates went through the
basics. Even at that, Strug makes it a point to stretch and warm up
with classmates before heading off to the bars or beam to work on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all real good about it in the class now,'' Strug said.
``They give me a hard time _ `Hey, Kerri, can you do a cartwheel?
Are you getting credit for this? What's your grade?' It's a lot of
fun. It's just what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Like this marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Strug decided on the Methodist Health Care Houston Marathon
because she has family here and wanted to be just another anonymous
runner, just another in the pack trying to accomplish a personal
goal.
</P>
<P>
   She hoped to quietly fly into town, have a pasta dinner at her
favorite restaurant and then run the race with only friends and
family members quietly encouraging her to finish.
</P>
<P>
   But her name stood out on the entry list like it did the
gymnastics roll.
</P>
<P>
   Is that Kerri Strug? Is she training for a new Olympic endeavor?
Marathon officials called and inquired about appearances. They
wanted to treat her differently, give her special attention.
Television stations tried to set up interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But she just wants to be Kerri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nice, but please let everybody know that I'm real,
real slow,'' Strug said. ``Honestly, I don't think I'm going to
finish. When I run, it's like slow motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug has run consistently for the past six months, but her
training sagged during the holidays because of her speaking
schedule, the ankle pain that lingers and time spent with a family
friend whose father died. She has run in a pair of 10-kilometer
races and twice gone 18 miles on one run, but she has no strategy
for Sunday's race other than staying in the pack and looking for
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to run for as long as I can and then I'm going
to stop if I have to,'' she said. ``That's my strategy: Run, run
slow and then when something hurts too much, stop and go to dinner
at Ruggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell everyone to say hello when they pass me. They're all
going to pass me, believe me. I hope nobody laughs. If they want to
wait until it's dark to see me cross the finish line, if I cross
the finish line, great. Trust me, I'm not going for the gold
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? She's got her gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's for fun now,'' Strug said. ``I'll try to finish,
but if I don't it still will be a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she will head back to class at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``This semester,'' she said, ``I'm up to Intermediate
Gymnastics.''

Curiosity calls, if nothing else
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   If he is faithful to the habits of his boxing lifetime, Mike
Tyson will enter the ring tonight without a robe, without socks,
with a black shroud around his head and a towel wrapped around his
20-inch neck. He will be the loneliest person in a crowd of some
15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other boxers, including his opponent, Francois Botha, have an
entourage. Tyson has demons. Except for them, he travels light.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in this decade, Tyson is back from an exile
not of his choosing, and Las Vegas is agog with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that line is one we used to save and drag out for the
really compelling heavyweight fights. This one falls into another
category. There is interest in the match, a morbid curiosity
attached to all of Tyson's fights since he proved he was human by
losing to Buster Douglas in 1990, the first defeat of his
destructive career. It was the classic upset, the neighborhood fat
guy beating the neighborhood bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Later, to the masses, Tyson proved less than human. Convicted of
rape in 1992, he served three years in prison. Given his freedom,
he signed contracts worth $100 million with the MGM Grand Hotel and
cable TV. Then, consumed with the goal of regaining his title, he
was beaten by the champion he had scorned, Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was the biting irony of the rematch. In June 1997,
Tyson was disqualified for chewing off a piece of Holyfield's right
ear, and then taking a bite out of Evander's left ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once is bad enough,'' said referee Mills Lane, ``twice is
dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Idle for 18 months, the fighter who had been described as ``The
Ultimate Warrior,'' will try for another comeback against a member
of that disadvantaged minority, the white heavyweight. Botha is an
affable fellow, a native of South Africa, who looks as if he sleeps
in a sack of Gladiola flour.
</P>
<P>
   He is neither a ``White Hope'' nor a fattened calf, but a decent
puncher with an impressive record. He has lost once in 40 bouts,
falling to the enigmatic Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus of this fight, as all of his are, will be the one
Tyson wages within himself. Many boxing insiders believe he is
washed up, at 32, in George Foreman's phrase ``an energy fighter,''
always destined to have a short career.
</P>
<P>
   He was once the matador, flourishing the cape. Now Tyson is
compared to the bull, weakened and bloodied by the picadors.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, he was the youngest ever to win the heavyweight title,
and his story touched us: the little street kid who survived by
beating the bigger, meaner kids; who raised pigeons on his roof,
and had a lengthy rap sheet by the age of 13. Then fate delivered
him into the care of Cus D'Amato, a crusty old-school trainer with
an odd disinterest in taking money from his fighters.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato guided Floyd Patterson, a reluctant tiger, to the
heavyweight championship. He died a few months before Tyson would
have given him another. Two years later, Jim Jacobs, his
co-manager, lost his battle to leukemia. From then on, his life
spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson had the potential, as D'Amato believed, to rank with
the greats, he wasted it on parking-lot brawls, driving fast cars
into trees and crimes against decency.
</P>
<P>
   It is an old tale, but one that still has the capacity to
perplex and offend us. Fans and media agonize over Tyson. Is it
acceptable to pay money to watch him fight, live or on TV? Can he
regain the form he showed when one- or two-round knockouts were his
norm? What can he do to win the approval, or at least the
forgiveness, of society?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are 1) it's a free country; 2) unlikely, and 3) who
knows? To the last question, Tyson offered a brutal, one-word
answer: ``Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Some will watch in the same spirit in which they slow to observe
the remains of a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   A metallic bundle of contradictions, Tyson predicted his
downfall. Before his loss to Douglas, he said: ``Lots of people
want to see me self-destruct, see me with those big handcuffs on,
be able to say: `We told you that you were heading for that. '''
</P>
<P>
   He could be brooding one instant, insightful the next. A student
of boxing history, he once startled a news conference by naming as
his favorite former champion a vintage figure, John L. Sullivan, an
avowed racist. Mind you, he did not pick the revered Joe Louis or
the electric Muhammad Ali, but a guy who fought in the late 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was a racist,'' Tyson said, ``but Sullivan went into
every fight certain he would win. He thought there was no one on
earth who could beat him. He was a great puncher, who won the last
bare-knuckle fight ever held for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   On a moral basis, a lot of fans won't leave a quarter slot
machine to watch Tyson face Botha. But if you are making moral
judgments, you shouldn't follow boxing, period.

Having fun yet? Drexler says he is
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   It's an ugly, rainy Wednesday night, and although the seats are
completely sold, two-thirds of them are empty.
</P>
<P>
   One in-the-fold prospect has quit because he thought his
underappreciated, albeit overrated, fanny was spending way too much
time warming the pine. Worse, the status of next year's incoming
hotshot is suddenly clouded by his efforts, inadvertent or
otherwise, to sneak in a fifth year of high school eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The players who are here suddenly can't buy a layup, and one of
the referees, the guy with the white cane, is compounding matters
to the extreme with his obvious bias against the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about Mark Whitehead, though. The official can't see
well enough to make the painfully obvious calls, UH coach Clyde
Drexler notes, but he can read Drexler's lips from 100 feet away
well enough to hit him with a ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, a promising early lead disappears, then a too-little,
too-late comeback abruptly aborts in the final seconds. So chalk up
another tough loss for Coach Superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the real world, Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day in Chicago, Michael Jordan was signing off
while darn near the entire world paid homage. Jordan and Drexler,
fellow '98 retirees (as it turns out) from the NBA's fast-break
lane, likely will enter the Hall of Fame together, but it appears
that between now and then, the former is going to have a lot more
down time than the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't want to be like Mike
</P>
<P>
   Does Cougar Clyde really need the aggravation for what amounts
to, using his own word, a ``charity'' position. Shouldn't he be at
home with his kids, or out on the golf course? If Jordan can retire
to a life of leisure _ of giggling children, Vegas and 36 holes a
day _ why can't Drexler?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun,'' Clyde protested. ``I'm all right. I really
am.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. And, yes, it did appear to be sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler's new business is a rough one, full of runaway egos and
underhanded dealing _ and that's just the refs. But he knew what he
was getting into, because he has been there, in the middle of it.
We must assume he entered the coaching profession with his eyes
wide-open.
</P>
<P>
   If he didn't, they will soon be swollen shut. His is a job that
can beat up the biggest of men.
</P>
<P>
   Not halfway through Drexler's first season, Moses Malone Jr. _
one of the Cougars' two scions of hoops icons _ concluded his coach
must be too dumb to recognize his talent. I mean, anybody with such
a name must be a superstar-in-waiting, right?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the junior Malone possessed middling Division I
ability and was a callow freshman to boot. Remember, Drexler is
trying to survive with six walk-ons. Had Moses also been a Gee
Gervin _ a chip off the old Ice cube _ he would have received as
many minutes as his young lungs could handle.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Clyde gave Malone one start, and he produced nothing
of consequence. So he got benched, and now he's gone. Unfortunate,
but fortunately, survivable.
</P>
<P>
   The Antonio Fal matter is more worrisome. The pairing of Fal
with Gervin and a solid supporting cast puts the Cougars back in
Top 25 country and makes them March Madness worthy. For now,
there's no reason to believe Fal isn't still UH-bound, albeit
possibly minus one season of eligibility, but you worry that
there's more to his situation than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Trying times at present
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Drexler needs as he learns the coaching ropes is
the hot breath of the NCAA on his neck. Of course, the first thing
he needs are players, and the better they are, the more potential
baggage they tend to bring with them these days.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Fal's circuitous journey from Puerto Rico to
Waltrip High School raises a number of questions. Hopefully, the
answers will be readily forthcoming and won't thwart his becoming
the centerpiece of Drexler's first recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler has nothing to say on the subject _ he has been told to
be quiet until the investigation is complete _ but you can be sure
he's frustrated. As much as he might love basketball, as opposed to
hanging around and living off the interest from his investments, he
wants to be in an environment where he has at least a fighting
chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde's first team doesn't. Its 6-9 record only figures to get
worse unless its shooting percentage magically gets markedly
better. Drexler can expect to experience more angst than ecstasy
over the next couple of months, yet from what we've heard about his
golf swing, it's probably a wash that he opted to coach instead of
hit the links daily.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Jordan, Drexler declines to pass judgment on M.J.'s
plans for a carefree post-basketball existence. To each his own, he
shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever makes you happy,'' Clyde said, ``is what you should
do. My only advice to Michael is that he find a way to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, whether we choose to believe him, Drexler swears he did.
