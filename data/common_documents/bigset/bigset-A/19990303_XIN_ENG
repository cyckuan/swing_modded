<HEADLINE> Russia Assures Y2K Won't Affect Nuclear Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Russian military expert on
Tuesday gave assurances that the automated control system for the
country's strategic nuclear forces were safe from the affects the
Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Vladimir Dvorkin, director of the Defense Ministry's
Fourth Central Research Institute, said, "Control over the issue
of warnings about unauthorized launches and actions will be
reliable."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the main, reserve and duplicating control
computers will not be affected by the millennium bug problem, as
there are no calendar dates in their memories, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Dvorkin acknowledged that the Y2K problem, in which the
computer could mistake the year 2000 for 1900, does threaten the
early warning and space control systems.
</P>
<P>
"Experiments have been conducted, and systems, software and
hardware, which need to be replaced or improved, have been
determined," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty working groups have been set up to deal with the Y2K
problem in the Russian strategic nuclear forces. They have
checked 134 facilities, including command posts and the main
control center.
</P>
<P>
Dvorkin said 85 million rubles (about 3.7 million U.S. dollars)
needs to be invested in measures to deal with this problem.
</P>
<P>
In October, the final comprehensive tests of the adjusted
software will be carried out. "Nothing suggests that we will fail
to cope with this problem," Dvorkin said.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that mistakes "in receiving and processing
the information on launches of strategic missiles" are possible,
especially when international tension escalates," Dvorkin ruled
out any possibility of hackers penetrating the computer networks
of the strategic nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
"All automated control systems in the Russian Armed Forces are
closed, they have no exterior outlets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Parties Press for Reconsideration of Poll Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Six Nepali parties including two
ruling parties warned Tuesday that serious consequences would
result if the Election Commission ignores their demand for
reconsideration of a decision to hold the May general elections in
two phases.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), the Nepal Sadbhavana Party and the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), the two
factions of the National Democratic Party (RPP) and the Communist
Party of Nepal (Masal) did not elaborate in a memorandum they
submitted to the commission.
</P>
<P>
They urged the constitutional body to reconsider its decision
and hold the election to the House of Representatives at one go on
May 3 as announced by King Birendra when he dissolved the house on
January 15, the official RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from all the parties except the ruling
Nepali Congress (NC), the commission decided on Sunday to hold the
election in two phases with the first on May 3 and the second
within two weeks after that.
</P>
<P>
The six parties argued that at a time when the king had set the
date for the polls in accordance with the constitution and the
whole country is already involved in the electoral process, the
Election Commission ran counter to the constitution, the house
members election act and the precedence set by the Supreme Court
by making such a decision.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said that as the decision was made despite the
opposition of all the parties except the NC, it makes one smell
foul play.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said it is virtually impossible to hold
the election in a single day due to logistic problems.
</P>
<P>
It said 71,000 security personnel are needed to man some 8,000
polling booths all over the country but the Home Ministry said it
can provide only 28,000 police personnel for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the six parties also submitted a memorandum to NC
President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, RSS said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Early Trial of Lockerbie Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday called for the
earliest possible trial in the Netherlands of the suspects in the
Lockerbie airliner bombing that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a briefing
that the speedy implementation of the U.N. Security Council
resolution on starting a trial in the Netherlands of the suspects
"meets the interests of the entire world community."
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya after
the African country refused to extradite two of its citizens
suspected of organizing the bomb explosion aboard a Pan-American
airliner that crashed into the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the United States and Britain proposed that the
suspects be tried in the Netherlands in accordance with Scottish
laws, which means that if the suspects are convicted they will
serve their terms in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said that "Noticeable progress" had been made by
Libya in implementing the U.N. Security Council resolution on
initiation of the trial.
</P>
<P>
"One can say with certainty that over the past ten years the
world community has never been so close to the solving of the
Lockerbie case," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
It was very important that all sides continue to cooperate
constructively with the U.N. secretariat and abstain from
unilateral moves, he said.

</P>
<P>

accompanying risks of destabilization and increased inequality

</P>
<P>
The D-8, an economic group comprising Bangladesh, Pakistan,

in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The D-8 is a forum of functional cooperation, which would

economic development, social development and environmental
protection."
</P>
<P>

area of cooperation, and in this context, directed that a meeting
of their ministers of commerce/trade and economy be convened at an
early date to explore such possibilities.
</P>
<P>
They proposed simultaneous or parallel meetings of a business
forum, involving entrepreneurs of D-8 member states to help
develop partnership for development between the private sector and

economic group was set up in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at the D-8 summit decided to consult with relevant
international institutions both to minimize the effects of the
global financial crisis and to contribute to efforts aimed at
reforms in the international financial system.

indispensable for sustained growth. "We are of the view that the
respective roles of the government and the private sector are
complementary."

implementation of priority projects so that they could be
functional as soon as possible, emphasizing a pragmatic and
flexible approach aimed at the optimum utilization of the
available resources and capabilities.

<HEADLINE> D-8 Aims at Economic Cooperation: Bangladeshi PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The objective of the Developing
Eight (D-8) group is to foster economic cooperation among the
member countries, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said
here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to enhance economic cooperation among our
countries," Hasina told a press conference at the end of the
two-day D-8 summit.
</P>
<P>
"This group represents a population of about 800 million, or
about 13.5 percent of the total world population. Their share of
world trade is roughly 4 percent... We feel that there is much
that we can do among ourselves," she said.
</P>
<P>
The members of the D-8 -- Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran,
Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey -- have taken major steps
in advancing cooperation since it was established in June 1997,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, taking the lead in matters of trade, is expected to hold
the first meeting of experts in April this year and Turkey has
taken the initiative to build an agricultural aircraft and to
organize cooperation in the environment and health, said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
While Bangladesh and Egypt will jointly implement a project on
rural industrialization, Iran is organizing the industrial and
technological data bank network which would become operational by
July this year, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is coordinating projects in fisheries and agriculture
while Indonesia will organize cooperation in poverty alleviation
and in the energy sector, she added.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 countries recognize that globalization offers potential
but also brings dangers as highlighted by the recent financial
crisis, Hasina pointed out. She added that countries in the world
"should cooperate to guard against recurrence of such crises and
new threats of destabilization."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the D-8 countries have agreed to establish contacts
with the Organization of the Islamic Conference, of which they are
members and inform other international bodies and groupings about
their views, according to the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM in Riyadh on Gulf, Oil Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Tuesday arrived in Riyadh, capital of Saudi
Arabia for talks on the latest Iraqi and oil prices crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi brought with him two messages from Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah on
bilateral ties, according to Iranian diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency said that during his two-day stay,
Kharrazi will hold talks with his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud
Al-Faisal on regional issues and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the low oil prices on the world market will
dominate their talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are the world's major oil producers
and rely heavily on oil exports for revenues. The record low oil
prices have made them suffer from budget deficits since last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the two countries held several rounds of
consultations last year to coordinate their stances on ways of
shoring up the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
However, they are at odds on how to approach the problem, with
Tehran supporting a further cut in oil production while Riyadh
tending to extend the current quotas for a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia produces some 8 million barrels per day, the
highest among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
and it believes a further cut, somewhat proportional, would not be
in its favor. Iran's daily yield is close to 4 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing Iraqi crisis, the two sides will discuss the
issue "within the framework of a comprehensive assessment of the
whole situation in the area."
</P>
<P>
Iran has been trying to mediate between Iraq, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait following Baghdad's verbal attacks against its two Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials accused Riyadh and Kuwait of harboring
U.S. and British warplanes to enforcing the "no-fly" zones in
Iraq, imposed by the U.S. and its allies in the wake of the 1991
Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy on Afghanistan to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi is scheduled to visit Iran as the
second leg of his fresh peace mission, according to U.N. sources
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi will meet Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi and
other senior officials of the Foreign Ministry and will brief them
on his meetings with Pakistani officials and Afghan Taliban
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy will also meet Afghan leaders during his
three-day stay in Tehran to discuss with them ways and means for
the restoration of peace in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the U.N. envoy and Iranian officials will focus
on the investigation into the killing of Iranian diplomats and a
journalist by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan's northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had earlier announced to send a mission for
the probe but has yet to dispatch it. The Taliban have stopped the
investigation after the U.N. announced the probe but failed to
carry it out.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here on February 14 on his fresh peace mission.
The visit will also take him to the Central Asian republics for
talks on the Afghan crisis and to find a peaceful solution to the
long-standing problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy's visit is aimed at seeking views and opinions
of the Afghan rival factions and other concerned parties to the
conflict in a bid to make a success the forthcoming proposed Six
Plus Two group meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival in Pakistan he held talks with Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz and envoys of the Six Plus Two group, and
briefed them on his mission. The group comprises Pakistan, Iran,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, China, the United States and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi visited Kabul on Sunday and met Mohammad Rabbani, head
of the Taliban's Interim Council, and Muhammad Hasan, a senior
Taliban official responsible for foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed several issues ranging from security
for the U.N. international staff to the establishment of a
broad-based government in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Landmine Clearance Exercise Needs Unity: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Disabled People International
Chairman Joshua Malinga Tuesday said there is need for African
governments, private sector and the donor community to work
together in the on-going landmine clearance exercises.
</P>
<P>
Malinga told Zimbabwe News Agency in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's
second largest city, that even in peacetime, landmines were still
killing and injuring hundreds of innocent civilians in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe had been identified as
the worst affected countries in the world with an estimated 20
million mines among them. So far mines had claimed more than
250,000 victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many African countries are joining the worldwide campaign for
a complete ban of anti-personnel mines and have resolved to
achieve a mine- free Africa that will be an international model,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that organizations of disabled people and human rights
 activists were concerned about lack of attention and support
given to victims of landmines who needed to be compensated for
their injuries and to be integrated into the community.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue would be resolved next month during a meeting
on " disability and landmine survivors" seminar in Harare,
Zimbabwean capital, to be attended by the Pan African Federation
of the Disabled and Southern Africa Federation of the Disabled.
</P>
<P>
Participants are expected to come from Algeria, Angola,
Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Lesotho,
Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia,
South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that it would cost more than nine billion U.S.
Dollars to clear 100 million landmines scattered in 71 countries
worldwide, half of them in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Meets IMF Criteria for Loan: Finance Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will disburse a new tranche of loan to Pakistan as scheduled
after an IMF review mission found the country's macroeconomic
performance satisfactory in the first half of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Tuesday, Pakistani Finance
Minister Ishaq Dar said the country realized all the performance
criteria laid down by the IMF for the period from July to December
1998 for the disbursement of the tranche.
</P>
<P>
The mission noted with satisfaction tumbling trends in
inflationary pressure owing to prudent monetary and fiscal
policies and enormous improvement on the exchange rate front, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Dar noted that following the formal procedure of presenting the
review report before the IMF Executive Board, the next tranche of
51 million U.S. dollars will be released as scheduled by the end
of April.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a shortfall in the agricultural sector was
largely compensated by better than expected performance of the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Overall growth was on target, inflation remained under control
due to prudent fiscal and monetary policies, exchange rate
stability was realized and higher trade deficit during the first
half of the fiscal year of 1998-99 was offset by improvement in
services account, he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves were higher than anticipated at the
end of December 1998 as the target was 737 million dollars, but
actually foreign exchange reserves increased to 1.016 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arrears on account of invisible payments were largely cleared
and budget deficit for this span remained within the IMF ceiling
of 89.2 billion rupees, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Says Italy May Violate EU Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said here
on Tuesday that it just sent a reasoned opinion to Italy about a
possible violation of the European Union (EU)'s single market
rules.
</P>
<P>
In its warning, the EU executive body said the single market
rules require public procurement contracts to be awarded under
transparent, open and competitive conditions.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a statement that the Italy's Metropolis
S.p.A, a company wholly-owned by Italian national railway company
Ferrovie dello Stato S.p.A., failed to respect the requirements of
the EU directive on procurement procedures when it awarded a
series of contracts for design of a new railway station in
Bologna, Italy.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the commission said, the contracts were awarded
directly without following the procedure laid down by the EU
directive for inviting competitive bids. The directive does
provide for direct award of contracts under certain specific
conditions, but these conditions were not met this case, the
commission explained.
</P>
<P>
The Italian authorities' response to the letter of formal
notice in regard to this case sent in June 1998 was not
satisfactory, the EU branch added.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is mainly responsible for proposing and
enforcing legislation, concluded that in the absence of a
satisfactory response from the Italian authorities to the reasoned
opinion within two months of receipt, the commission could decide
to refer the matter to the EU Court of Justice for judgement.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of Burundian
President Pierre Buyoya will visit South Africa for talks with
President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association Tuesday quoted a Burundian
embassy spokesman as saying in Pretoria that the envoy, Justice
Minister Terence Sinunguruza, would be in South Africa for a day
or two and would only meet Mandela.
</P>

South African presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the

Burundi's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said Pretoria remained committed to Burundi's peace
process and would assist in the socio-economic reconstruction of
that country.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has actively supported the Burundian peace talks
under former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, said Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, for example, has seconded his legal adviser, Fink
Haysom, to assist Nyerere in negotiating a peace settlement in the
war-torn country.

GENEVA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
set up a panel here Tuesday to examine the United States' "Section
301" trade law at the request of the European Union (EU),
according to WTO officials.
</P>
<P>
Although the EU's second request was again objected by the U.S.
on Tuesday, the panel was established automatically in accordance
with the rules of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism, which
state that a panel must be granted at the second time of asking
unless all members are opposed.
</P>
<P>
After its first proposal was blocked on February 17, the EU
promptly said it would apply for a special session of the WTO's
Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) within 15 days to reconsider the
request.
</P>
<P>
Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act was recently used by the U.S.
as the basis of its threat to impose swinging trade sanctions on
the EU in the two sides' dispute over banana imports.

DHAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammad on Tuesday made a strong call for free labor movement
across national borders if free flow of capital is allowed in
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Labor movement should be made free across borders as the
movement of capital is free in globalization," Mahathir said at a
press conference after attending the two-day Developing Eight
(D-8) summit which ended here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are many countries where a lot of unused land is
available. The poor people of poor countries can settle there," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"When they (western countries) say in favor of globalization,
they say about free movement of capital not the labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a separate press conference at the Winter Garden conference
room, which was especially built for the summit, Bangladeshi Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina said she supported Mahathir's views on free
labor movement.

"Yes, we'll hold talks with other countries (about free labor
movement)," she said.

<P>
ABUJA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo pledged Tuesday to run an "open, fair and transparent"
government and urged his opponents to "join hands together to make
Nigeria great".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first press conference after his election
victory, Obasanjo said his "first duty and priority is to
reconcile the people of this country and heal their wounds."
</P>
<P>
The retired general noted that "everyone in our
ethnically-diverse country has suffered in many ways from the
unacceptable and undemocratic manner in which we have been
governed for so long."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who regained power 20 years after he handed over the
power to an elected government in 1979, said "it is my
determination to run an open, fair and transparent government
throughout the period of my mandate."
</P>
<P>
Describing his victory as a challenge from Nigerians to salvage
the country, Obasanjo promised to lead by example, restore the
dignity of the country, revive the institutions and reinvigorate
the battered economy compounded by falling prices of oil, the
nation's economic lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo pledged to fight corruption, a cancer-worm plaguing
the oil- producing country, adding that he would professionalize
the military tainted by prolonged years of involvement in
Nigeria's politics.
</P>
<P>
To his opponents, the president-elect offered an olive branch,
saying "let's all join hands together to make Nigeria great".
</P>
<P>
"The contest is over but the process of democratization is
continuous. I will continue to widen and deepen that process. My
belief in democracy is absolutely," Obasanjo told the press
conference dominated by his People' s Democratic Party (PDP)
faithfuls.
</P>
<P>
"Look at the high table (pointing at PDP party members) if I
decide to form a government from among these people, what can be
more national," he said in a reference to a call by his defeated
opponent Olu Falae, who rejected the poll results and urged the
formation of a government of national unity.

<HEADLINE> BMW Denies Producing of Mini Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- German carmaker BMW denied a trade
paper report Tuesday that the company was planning an even smaller
car than its current 3-series models.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no BMW below the 3-series compact," company
spokesman Uwe Mahla told the German Press Agency in response to
the report in the magazine "Auto-Zeitung", according to a report
of this Agency.
</P>
<P>
That paper had said that BMW was planning a 2-series car
starting in the year 2002 to compete with Mercedes' A-class car
and the new Audi A3.
</P>
<P>
Mahla confirmed that BMW had been considering such a car back
then, but after the purchase of the British group Rover in 1994,
the German company concentrated its front-wheel drive activities
there. This was what made it possible to develop the new Rover 75
car so quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Auto-Zeitung in its report said BMW was also looking at a
smaller car at Rover, the R-50, which would succeed the current
Rover 200 and 400 models and then provide the basis for a BMW
2-series car.

Nigerian troops form the bulk of the west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG, supporting President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah against
Sierra Leonean rebels trying to overthrow him.

<P>
There has been mounting domestic pressure on the Nigerian
government to recall the troops, especially in light of the
country's dwindling economic fortunes.

"We are sympathetic with the plight of our brothers and sisters

said Obasanjo.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial Task Force (ITF) of
the National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) of Zimbabwe has
finalized a policy document whose objective is to stimulate
industrial development and expansion.
</P>
<P>
ITF Chairman Pat Rooney told an annual general meeting of the
Matabeleland Chamber of Industries Tuesday in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city, that the document was drafted
following dialog among business, labor and government
representatives, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It must be noted that the strategies devised for promotion of
industrial growth must assume, as a prerequisite, a macro-economic
environment that is both competitive and conducive to
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The policy document noted the need for the modernization and
upgrading of the infrastructure in the country such as
communications, roads, rail, power and air services, he said.
</P>
<P>
The document also mentioned the need for the stabilization of
the foreign exchange rates, abolition of exchange controls,
reduction of inflation to single digits levels, reduction of real
interest rates to below five percent and reduction of the budget
deficit to less than five percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Growth in public investment and net lending level to above
eight percent of GDP and greater transparency and the stemming of
the current rampaging corruption were also needed.
</P>
<P>
Rooney said the ITF was now working on plans for future action
and has thus finalized the formation of sub-committees to urgently
recommend and work on actions for future development of the
industrial base in the country.

<HEADLINE> Pak Revenue Collection Increases 1.5 Percent: Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's revenue collection in
the first seven months of the 1998-1999 fiscal year (July to
January) was 3.367 billion U.S. dollars, showing an increase of
1.5 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties the revenue collection during the seven
months amounted to 3.367 billion dollars, from 3.317 billion
dollars in the corresponding period of last fiscal year, Finance
Minister Ishaq Dar told a press conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total collection, direct taxes increased by 5
percent to 1.152 billion dollars as against 1.098 billion dollars
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Dar said, indirect tax collection registered a
marginal decline of 0.29 percent to 2.215 billion dollars from
2.221 billion dollars of last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Giving factors that affected the revenue performance, Dar said
various government measures to protect the country's balance of
payments from a total collapse and quick disbursement of current
as well as back log of refund/rebates impacted the revenue
performance.
</P>
<P>
Reduction in imports to the extent of 7 percent resulted in the
decline of revenue from import-related taxes such as custom
duties, sales tax and income tax at the import stage, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said inflation continued to be low. The Consumer
Price Index (CPI) during July 1998 and January 1999 rose by 6.5
percent as compared with 9.2 percent in the corresponding period
of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit during the period improved by 45.7 percent
from 1.315 billion dollars to 714 million dollars. In fact, it was
the lowest in the last six years, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the seven months amounted to 4.361 billion dollars,
11.8 percent less than last fiscal year's level of 4.946 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dar ascribed the main reasons for the decline in exports to a
drop in unit values, global economic recession and the Southeast
Asian crisis. "Almost all the developing countries in our region
are facing similar decline in exports for the same reasons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Imports during the same period amounted to 5.075 billion
dollars, 18.9 percent less than last fiscal year's level of 6.261
billion dollars.
</P>

than 1.7 billion dollars by March 1, 1999," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany will have their strongest team
available for next month's Fed Cup World Group II tie with Japan when
Steffi Graf and Anke Huber team up for the first time in almost three
years.
</P>
<P>
Graf had announced her return into the team last week, and
Huber also said on Tuesday: "I always liked playing Fed Cup and I
am looking forward to playing again." He also said: "It is our
goal to return into the World Group,"
</P>
<P>
This time around they aim to return into the elite World Group. For
that they need victory over Japan in Hamburg April 24-25 and another
against a first-round loser from the World Group later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Graf and Huber lifted Germany to the 1992 title in Frankfurt. Their
last showing together was in July 1996 when they won a relegation

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Decline Again in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. new home sales dropped for
the second straight month in January but remained exceptionally
robust, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
New homes were purchased in January at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 918,000, down 5 percent from 966,000 in December.
</P>
<P>
The sales rate nevertheless was the third highest on record.
With mortgage rates remaining under 7 percent and jobs plentiful,
at least so far this year, most economists expect strong new home
sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decline in sales means new homes are somewhat more
available nationally, in proportion to the number of buyers. The
inventory of unsold homes at the end of the month was 302,000, the
most in two years. That's a four-months supply at the current
sales rate, up from 3.8 months in December.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home was 157,000 in January, up 6.1
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that
people purchased existing homes at a record seasonally adjusted
rate of 5.07 million in January.

<HEADLINE> War Will Continue, Says Ethiopian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Addis Ababa City
Administration Ali Abdo said Tuesday that Ethiopia's war with
Eritrea will continue until its sovereignty is restored
completely.
</P>
<P>
"The war will continue until the enemy forces are fully wiped
out," he told hundreds of thousands of cheering metropolitans who
gathered at Maskal Square in Ethiopian capital to celebrate the
recent victory achieved by the Ethiopian army at the contended
Badme front and the 103rd anniversary of "the Battle of Adowa".
</P>
<P>
He also called on the United Nations Security Council to
reconsider its resolution 1227, which he described as "unfair".
The resolution 1227 urges all states to end immediately sales of
arms and ammunitions to Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In 1896, Ethiopians defeated the colonial Italian forces at
Adowa, northern Ethiopia, and forced the Italians to recognize
Ethiopia as an independent and sovereignty state. Ethiopians
celebrate "the Adowa victory day" on March 2 every year.

and negotiated settlement to solve the crisis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, who just completed a tour of African nations involved in
the DRC conflict, said he had made it clear to the leaders on the
need of political will to solve the conflict, according to a
statement by the British High Commission in Harare.

"After my tour of five African countries it is clear to me that
neither side can win this war," he said, adding "it is costing
human lives and draining Africa's resources."
</P>
<P>
Lloyd visited the DRC, Zimbabwe, Angola, Uganda, Rwanda from
February 22 to 26 as the special envoy of British Prime Minister
Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now is a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement
to achieve the withdrawal of all foreign troops," he said,
pledging that Britain will "play its part in backing this process
through the United Nations and the international community."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad deployed troops to the DRC
at the invitation of DRC President Laurent Kabila to help repel a

<HEADLINE> UK's Hospital Waiting Lists Fall in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of people on hospital
waiting lists fell by 14,200 in January, according to government
figures released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figures for England represent a two-year low and come after
an 11,500 rise in December.
</P>
<P>
The December hospital increase was mainly blamed on the flu
outbreak which continued into January.
</P>
<P>
There was also a big rise in the number of people waiting to see
a specialist in the final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government claims its January figures show it is very much on
course to reach its target of reducing waiting lists figures to the
level it inherited at the general election.
</P>
<P>
The number of people waiting for hospital treatment is 1,159,368
- just 1,400 more than March 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Health the number of people
waiting over a year for treatment fell by 600 in January, the eighth
monthly fall.
</P>
<P>
No patient was waiting over 18 months for treatment. The number
of people waiting has fallen by 10.7 percent since March 1998, says
the government.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the number of people waiting over
13 weeks to see a hospital specialist rose by 31,000 in the final
quarter of 1998.

MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian defense chief on Tuesday
reiterated Moscow's opposition to a European security system based
solely on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no security monostructure in Europe based on NATO

</P>
<P>
"There must be alternatives, one of which is taking shape in
the northwestern Europe," the minister said.

He said relations have warmed up in the northwest of Europe
thanks to Russian and Swedish efforts.

Moscow supports Stockholm in the construction of a new system

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits New Low in Frankfurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The euro fell to a new record low on
Tuesday, while German shares posted a late rally on good early
news from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The euro was mixed against other major currencies. The European
Central Bank's reference rate for the euro showed it slipping to
1.0887 dollars, a new low and down sharply from Monday's rate of
1.0986 dollars. On the currency markets, the rate for the Euro
drops to 0.6764 pounds sterling, from 0.6829 pounds on Monday, and
to 1.5912 Swiss francs, from 1.5930 francs.
</P>
<P>
But the euro firmed up against the yen, rising to 131.37 yen,
from 131.13 yen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In late-afternoon trading, the euro began to show a recovery,
rising to around 1.0924 dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the same day the 30-share DAX Index closed at 4,804.02
points, up 19.71 points from Monday, with the end-of-session rally
reversing a day when the index had been running some 40 points
below Monday's level.
</P>
<P>
The rally did not help the secondary list of 70 shares, the
M-DAX, which finished at 3,728.61 points, down 18.79 points.

<HEADLINE> UNDP: Violence Kills More Women Than Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Violence has killed more women in
their childbearing years than road accidents and malaria combine,
said the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The last International women's Day of the century, on March 8,
will not be cause for celebration for hundreds of millions of
women who make up 70 percent of the world's poor and who are
caught in a vicious circle of discrimination, lack of education,
violence and poverty, which they pass on to their children," said
Bertrand Coppens, Director of the European Office of UNDP.
</P>
<P>
The initial results of a survey conducted by UNDP revealed that
violence had killed and maimed as many women in their childbearing
years as cancer, and more than road accidents and malaria combine.
</P>
<P>
A third of married women in developing countries are battered
by their husbands, according to UNDP.
</P>
<P>
On a world scale, it said, in all the countries where reliable
studies have been conducted, results indicate that between 16
percent and 52 percent of women have been assaulted by an intimate
partner.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress of the past 20 years, women still account
for two thirds of illiterate adults in the world, said UNDP. Over
70 percent of women aged over 25 in Sub-Saharan Africa are
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, of 33 million contaminations with the AIDS
virus worldwide, 14 million were women in their childbearing
years.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Meets Air Defense Officials, Specialists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Tuesday met with a number of senior officials to discuss issues
related to air defense, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by ministers of oil and military
industry, air defense commander and a number of specialists in
the air defense field, said INA. But it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after the U.S. and Britain had intensified air
raids on "civilian and military targets" in the no-fly zones in
the north and south of the country.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday and Monday, U.S. and British warplanes bombed the
control and communication system of the most important sixth
relay station on the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline and Ein Zala oil
field, killing two civilians and wounding 11 others.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes on Iraqi
targets, Saddam has met with senior officials, military commanders
and specialists of air defense several times to discuss means of
countering the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraqi air defense units and U.S. and British
jets patrolling the no-fly zones have become almost daily
occurrence since the mid-December bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad suppression."

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Cut Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's top four banks
Tuesday announced to cut their prime lending rates and home loan
rates by one percentage point to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the rate-cut announcements earlier in the day by
First National Bank, Nedcor and Absa, Standard Bank said its prime
overdraft rate and mortgage rates would be reduced from 21 to 20
percent from March 15.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Absa, the largest commercial bank in South Africa,
announced similar plans. But the new 20 percent rate will not
apply to existing Absa home loans until April 1, it said.
</P>
<P>
First National Bank and Nedcor led the new wave of rate cut by
saying they would drop their prime lending rates to 20 percent
with effect from March 8.
</P>
<P>
Their home loan rates will fall to 20 percent with effect from
early April.
</P>
<P>
Since November last year, the banks have lowered their lending
rates several times from about 25 percent to the present level.
The latest cut is seen as a further relief to an economy which was
badly wounded in a five-month currency crisis last year.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Policy Document Finalized in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial Task Force (ITF) of
the National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) of Zimbabwe has
finalized a policy document whose objective is to stimulate
industrial development and expansion.
</P>
<P>
ITF Chairman Pat Rooney told an annual general meeting of the
Matabeleland Chamber of Industries Tuesday in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city, that the document was drafted
following dialog among business, labor and government
representatives, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It must be noted that the strategies devised for promotion of
industrial growth must assume, as a prerequisite, a macro-economic
environment that is both competitive and conducive to
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The policy document noted the need for the modernization and
upgrading of the infrastructure in the country such as
communications, roads, rail, power and air services, he said.
</P>
<P>
The document also mentioned the need for the stabilization of
the foreign exchange rates, abolition of exchange controls,
reduction of inflation to single digits levels, reduction of real
interest rates to below five percent and reduction of the budget
deficit to less than five percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Growth in public investment and net lending level to above
eight percent of GDP and greater transparency and the stemming of
the current rampaging corruption were also needed.
</P>
<P>
Rooney said the ITF was now working on plans for future action
and has thus finalized the formation of sub-committees to urgently
recommend and work on actions for future development of the
industrial base in the country.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov said here Tuesday that the International Monetary
Fund "is applying pressure (on Russia) and acting inapproriately."
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov made the statement following IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus' assertion that the fund is unhappy over Moscow's
economic policy and so is in no hurry to extend a loan to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Camdessus is eager to score an easy victory and make us do
what we cannot," Maslyukov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is obstinate during talks with the IMF because it can
never accept certain conditions, Maslyukov said.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we are told to set up trading and forwarding
organizations in the gas industry, but this means the creation of
more thieves," the Interfax news agency quoted Maslyukov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia cannot accept certain conditions because "our road to
the market has been very short, and so we had no time to set up
certain vital institutions," Maslyukov said.

BEIRUT, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
said Tuesday that the rising tensions in south Lebanon have begun
to cool off following intensive diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the current situation in south Lebanon
but that came as a result of intensive efforts made by Lebanese
government," Hoss said when meeting with Lebanese parliament
members.
</P>
<P>
But he accused Israel of provoking the escalation of tensions in
the border area and urged the Jewish state to pull its troops out
of Lebanon without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, four Israelis, including a general and a radio
journalist, were killed in Hezbollah's two bomb blasts in the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This was the second heavy loss in a week the Israeli forces
suffered in south Lebanon.

On February 23, Hezbollah ambushed an elite Israeli paratroops
unit in eastern Lebanon, killing three Israeli officers and
wounding five others.
</P>
<P>
The latest deadly attack prompted swift retaliation from
Israel whose warplanes and artillery forces pounded Hezbollah's
suspected bases in eastern and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet on Monday convened an emergency meeting in
which it decided to continue its air strikes on Hezbollah targets
for a number of days to avenge the killing of the Israeli
general, who is the most senior officer killed in Lebanon since
Israeli 1982 invasion.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
drive Israeli forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers and five Hezbollah guerrillas have been
killed in the clashes between both sides in south Lebanon since
the start of this year.

<HEADLINE> UK Awaits Word From UN On Lockerbie Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday it had to
wait for news from the UN to see whether there had been any
breakthrough to put on trial the two Libyan suspects in the
Lockerbie airliner bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for news from the Office of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan," a Foreign Office spokesman told Xinhua while answering a
question on a report that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had said that
a final agreement was expected on the Lockerbie suspects.
</P>
<P>
"Our channel is through the UN and that channel keeps open. Libya
knows what it has to do," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
British government is expected to be informed about any deal with
Libya through the office of Annan rather than directly from South
African and Saudi Arabian envoys who have been mediating with the
Libyan leader, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports from Libya said that a Saudi envoy had arrived in
Libya on Tuesday and that South Africa President Nelson Mandela and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had telephoned Gaddafi as part of
efforts to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
British government proposed to the U.N. Security Council last
Friday that the two suspects be handed over as soon as possible
and gave a deadline of thirty days for Libya to consider.
</P>
<P>
In December of 1988, a Pan Am airliner was bombed over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people. The United States and Britain alleged
that two Libyan agents were responsible for the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had proposed to put the two libyans on trial
by a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said on Tuesday that a deal on the trial was near.
</P>
<P>
But he said at the same time that Mandela, Mubarak and Saudi
Arabia had all asked him not to worry about the 30-day deadline which
had been rejected by Libya.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Bars Coalition With PDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
reined in the leftist leader of his own Social Democrats Tuesday
by declaring a formal ban on alliance with the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS).
</P>
<P>
"With me there will be no cooperation with the PDS in the
Bundestag (like a parliament's lower chamber)," said Schroeder at
a meeting of Social Democratic (SPD) parliamentary deputies in
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said there was still a gulf between the PDS and the
SPD on major issues, including domestic security and economic,
foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Calls by the SPD chairman and German finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine, for the party to use the PDS as a normal coalition
partner in the future had drawn anger from SPD members, not to
mention outrage from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine last weekend disavowed a 1994 SPD declaration, which
formally bars cooperation with the PDS, as "outdated" and "old
hat."
</P>
<P>
Despite the declaration the SPD has set up a "red-red"
coalition with the PDS in eastern Mecklenburg-West Pomerania state
and runs a de facto SPD-PDS coalition in Saxony-Anhalt.
</P>
<P>
But hypocritical as it may appear, these governments were meant
to be exceptions to SPD policy of always first seeking other
possible coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
At the local government level in eastern Germany there is
frequent cooperation between the SPD and PDS. The conservative
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) also works with the PDS in
numerous local east German governments.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the SPD should continue to decide on cooperation
with the PDS on a case-by-case basis at the local level.
</P>
<P>
The PDS remains the third strongest political force in eastern
Germany but has almost no support in the west.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some SPD leaders in eastern Germany warn that
working with the PDS at any level will scare away moderates and
mainly benefit the post-communists in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Saxony's SPD last weekend voted to ban future cooperation with
the PDS at the state level.
</P>
<P>
Criticism continued to rain down on Lafontaine's bid to forge
closer ties with the PDS.
</P>
<P>
The SPD president of Germany's federal parliament, Wolfgang
Thierse, said PDS attempts to justify the Berlin Wall meant the
party could not be considered as a federal coalition partner.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Jordan Keen on Boosting Arab Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Jordan Tuesday
agreed on the necessity of boosting unity among Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was reached at the meeting between Kuwaiti
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah and his visiting Jordanian counterpart Abdul Ilah
al-Khatib, a Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
The source told the Kuwait News Agency that the two sides
stressed keenness on boosting the unity of Arab ranks and they
were anxious to build Arab ties on the principle of "respecting
the sovereignty and independence of each state, non-interference
in its internal affairs, non resort to the use of force in
solving inter-Arab conflicts."
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered bilateral ties and means to boost
them in all domains, the source said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two foreign ministers also urged Iraq to
fully implement United Nations resolutions concerning its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib arrived here earlier Tuesday for a two-day official
visit aimed at restoring diplomatic ties with Kuwait that
broke off eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
He is the highest-ranking Jordanian official to visit the
Gulf emirate since the 1991 Gulf War, during which Amman
sided with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib is scheduled to attend on Wednesday the reopening
ceremony of the Jordanian Embassy in Kuwait, which will mark
the full normalization of diplomatic ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Kuwait began a rapprochement process in May 1997
when Kuwait declared that it "likes to improve ties with all Arab
countries except Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two countries have exchanged a number of
middle and high-level visits, which included a trip by Kuwaiti
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad to Amman early
February to attend the funeral of Jordan's late King Hussein.

<HEADLINE> All Passengers Evacuated from Hijacked Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- All the 75 passengers have been
evacuated from the Airbus 320 Air France passenger plane which was
hijacked Tuesday afternoon on its route from Marseille to Paris,
said Air France.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked when approaching the Orly airport in
Paris and was forced to land at the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle
airport after being hijacked by an Italian speaking man.
</P>
<P>
The man, who called himself Stefano Savorani and claimed to
represent an unknown group called "vitalunismo," threatened to
blow up the plane with a bomb he had brought on board, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse reported that the hijacker said his group
was a religious group dedicated to unifying Europe in the
political field.
</P>
<P>
He had asked for making a declaration on television with his
picture broadcast, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would not accept any money but only wants
to have his movement recognized.
</P>
<P>
Passengers coming out of the plane said that no acts of
violence took place during the hijacking and the atmosphere in the
plane was "calm."
</P>
<P>
The six-member crew -- four hostesses and two pilots -- are
still being held hostage.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The hijacker of an Air France Airbus
320 plane surrendered at 19:00, after a three-hour action of air
piracy which is overall bizarre.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the Italian man, who called himself
Stefano Savorani, handed himself over to police without resistance
after holding talks with a public prosecutor of the local city of
Seine-Saint-Denis near the Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were carried out with the help of the pilot of
the plane, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The elite anti-terrorist commando force who arrived at the
airport did not intervene, said the same sources.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked on its route from Marseille to Paris,
and was forced to land at the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker claimed to represent an unknown group called
"vitalunismo," and threatened to blow up the plane with a bomb he

</P>
<P>
Passengers coming out of the plane said that no acts of
violence took place during the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that the hijacking is linked with the
large Kurdish community living in Marseille, which have promised
to take some actions to mobilize the public opinion about the
arrest of PKK chief Abdullah Ocalan by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank to Commission Audit of FIMACO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Central Bank plans to
ask auditing firm PriceWaterHouseCoopers to conduct a special
audit of FIMACO, the offshore company that managed the bank's
funds, Interfax reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was made to defend the bank's professional and
business reputation, Interfax quoted Oleg Mozhaisky, a deputy
chairman of the Central Bank, as saying.
</P>
<P>
FIMACO has been at the center of a scandal that broke early
last month when former Prosecutor General Yury Skuratov, in a
letter sent to the State Duma just before his resignation, claimed
that the previously obscure company had managed 50 billion U.S.
dollars of Russia's hard currency reserves over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is the lower house of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's former chairman Sergei Dubinin and current
leader Viktor Gerashchenko have both denied any inappropriateness
in the dealings, insisting that FIMACO was used strictly to
safeguard Russia's currency reserves from litigious creditors.
</P>
<P>
There were also accusations that FIMACO was investing in GKO
treasury bills for the benefit of the bank's officials.
</P>
<P>
"Although I was not a witness to the events of those years, I
am sincerely surprised by the irresponsibility of certain deputies
who with suspicious ease make conclusions based on fragmentary
information," Mozhaisky said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Bank was not FIMACO's only client, and that
money from Eurobank, a Russian overseas bank, also passed through
the company.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, using make-believe and fragmentary information, it
is possible to come up with all kinds of cunning schemes,"
Mozhaisky said.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said here
on Tuesday that its member states are seriously concerned about
the deteriorating political situation and growing instability in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
All the 15 EU member countries called on all parties and
political office holders to show restraint and moderation and to
abstain from the use of all forms of violence as a political
weapon.
</P>
<P>
The west European bloc said in its presidency declaration that
the lack of respect for elementary principles of democratic
governance seriously hampers prospects for development. "If
political violence and intolerance should continue, foreign trade
and investment will be negatively affected and collaboration in
development will necessarily suffer to the detriment of all," the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The EU also appeal to all political parties in Bangladesh to
resolve their differences on the floor of parliament and through
other legitimate ways.
</P>
<P>
"They call on the government and political leaders of the
opposition alike to exercise responsible leadership on the basis
of democratic principles, which require the respect for decisions
of the parliamentary majority as well as the respect for the
legitimate rights of the opposition," the declaration added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The alleged U.S. spying on
Iraq no doubt would make disarmament regimes and future efforts
difficult if governments believe this kind of thing could happen,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan was responding to reports that the United States
intelligence services spied on Iraq without the knowledge of the
United Nations arms control teams that it used to disguise its
work.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Annan said, "I personally has no
direct knowledge of this and UNSCOM (the United Nations Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction) does not report to me."
</P>
<P>
"I think the U.N. disarmament of Iraq is an important step
in international efforts to disarmament. I would hope all of us,
especially the Council, would draw the right lessons from what
was happening in Iraq and move on from there," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Council which is responsible for UNSCOM should
draw the right lessons. We want to focus on disarmament and to
implement the Council's decisions," Annan added.

CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the International Atomic

field of nuclear energy, said visiting IAEA Director-General
Mohamad El-Baradei on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IAEA and the Egyptian agencies concerned will conduct close
coordination in this respect, El-Baradie told reporters after
meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
El-Baradie, who arrived here on the weekend, said that he
discussed with El-Ganzouri ways of further promoting bilateral
cooperation in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza, who
attended the meeting, said the talks also covered cooperation in
applying nuclear energy in health, agricultural and industrial
fields.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has proposed to set up a committee to work with the
Vienna-based IAEA to benefit from its scientific expertise in the
service of Egyptians in various domains, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt inaugurated in February 1998 a 22-megawatt nuclear
reactor, which was built with Argentine aid and technical

</P>
<P>
The reactor, the second in Egypt, has 11 times the output of
its first Russian-built one, which went into operation in 1961.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid called on the world community on Tuesday to force
Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar, which opened here Tuesday under the
theme of "nuclear energy, its peaceful application in the 21st
century," Abdel-Meguid stressed that all Arab countries have
joined the NPT and exerted efforts to render the Middle East free
from nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over Israel's refusal to sign the treaty,
saying that Israel is "the only country that neither joins the
treaty nor voices intention to sign it."
</P>
<P>
Israel has long refused to sign the NPT and neither confirms
nor denies reports that it has built atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israel's refusal to sign the treaty has created an imbalance in
powers in the regional countries, threatening peace and security
in the Middle East as well as the world, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has been working for a long time to hammer out
a draft treaty to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Middle East, he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is important to match up-to-date technological progress to
utilize nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and in the service of
all peoples in the region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker of Air France Plane, Former Italian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The man who hijacked an Air France
Airbus 320 passenger plane for three hours Tuesday afternoon was a
retired Italian police officer, Agence France-Presse quoted
authorized sources in Rome as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stefano Savorani was from Borgo Tossignano near Bologne in
northern Italy and was suspended his job because of "troubles of
personality," AFP quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that Savorani did not have any bomb on
him and only used a false telecommander when he forced the plane
to land at the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris
around 16:00 at the end of the flight of the plane from Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Marseille at 14:49 and was due to land
at the Orly airport south of Paris at 16:00.
</P>
<P>
The French government dispatched the elite anti-terrorism
commando force the GIGN to the airport as soon as the plane landed
on a remote part of the airfield.
</P>
<P>
The GIGN, specialized in intervening in a highly risky
situation like hijacking, successfully stormed an Air France
Airbus hijacked by Algerian Muslim militants on its way from
Algiers to Marseille in 1994.
</P>
<P>
No violence took place during the hijacking Tuesday as all the
passengers were peacefully evacuated from the plane after it
landed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Five passengers volunteered to stay on board with the
six-member crew, including two pilots and four hostesses.
</P>
<P>
The crew helped Savorani get in contact with the French
authorities and let them hold negotiations, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
Savorani agreed to free all his hostages after the authorities
agreed to let him get in contact with the press as he had asked.
</P>
<P>
He talked with Agence France-Presse on a mobile phone he
borrowed from a passenger, claiming that he represented an unknown
group called Vitalunismo, which was dedicated to uniting Europe
politically.
</P>
<P>
But he was subdued by police who rushed into the plane as soon
as all the hostages left.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Greets Nigerian President-elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- President Jerry John Rawlings
Tuesday congratulated Nigeria's President-elect, General Olusegun
Obasanjo, saying that his "impressive" election is a clear
demonstration of the people's confidence in his leadership,
especially toward peace, stability and prosperity, the Ghana News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a message released by the Foreign Ministry in Accra,
Rawlings said the people of Ghana have followed with understanding
and admiration the short and difficult transition to
constitutional rule "in your country and congratulate all
Nigerians for making a success of the process.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to be associated with developments in your
great country in keeping with our common history and close
cultural ties." Rawlings expressed the hope that Ghana and Nigeria
will cooperate even more closely together as well as with other
member states of ECOWAS for their mutual prosperity in a stable
and peaceful west Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Rawlings wished General Obasanjo good health
and overwhelming success in the discharge of his "heavy
responsibilities amid prosperity, peace and stability" in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Former military leader Obasanjo was declared elected on Monday
after weekend elections in which he polled 18.7 million or 62.8
percent of the nearly 30 million votes cast.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes to See "True Success" of Nigerian Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Tuesday that all Nigerians will unite behind the new
government to make the transition to civilian rule "a true
success."
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference, "I would hope that all Nigerians
will come together and work with the new government to make this
transition a true success, and lead Nigeria into an era of
democracy and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Former General Olusegun Obasanjo was elected president of
Nigeria, election officials said Monday in the nation's capital of
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, a retired general and former military ruler, captured
63 percent of Saturday's votes, according to Nigeria's Independent
Election Commission chief Justice Ephraim Akpata. However,
Obasanjo's opponent, former Finance Minister Olu Falae, called the
vote a "farce" and said he may contest the results.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that whatever complaints they have about irregular,
activities will be investigated and looked into by the legal
mechanism established for that," Annan said. "In the meantime, we
would have to live with the resource as pronounced by the properly
constituted electoral commission."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has never held a presidential election in which the
loser accepted defeat. In both previous presidential elections, in
1979 and 1993, the apparent results were contested by at least one
candidate.
</P>
<P>
It is highly hoped by the international community that
Saturday's election would pave the way for the return of a
civilian leader to Africa's most populous nation after 15 years of
military rule.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Concerned at Damage of Iraq's Pipelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Director of
the United Nations Office of the Iraq Program, Benon Sevan, on
Tuesday expressed deep concern at recent incidents which have
resulted in an interruption in the flow of Iraqi oil for exports.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said any extended stoppage would aggravate further the
lack of funding available for humanitarian supplies under the
"oil-for-food" program.
</P>
<P>
"Given the depressed price of oil and the state of Iraq's oil
industry, there is currently a 900 million U.S. dollars gap
between the revenue expected and what's needed to fund the
humanitarian program," Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
"This shortfall is already cutting deeply into the allocations
for water and sanitation, agriculture and education," Sevan added.
</P>
<P>
The Krikuk to Ceyhan pipeline was shut down on Sunday following
damage to a communications repeater station which was caused by
the almost daily confrontation between the United States, Britain
and Iraq in northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline carries half the oil Iraq is permitted to export
under the terms of the United Nations Security Council resolutions
establishing the "oil-for-food" program.

<HEADLINE> France Criticizes U.S.-British Raids Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- France criticized on Tuesday the
repeated U.S.-British air raids against Iraq, and regretted that
an oil pipeline Iraq used to export oil in exchange for food has
been damaged in the raids.
</P>
<P>
``It is clear that these repeated military operations don't go
in the way which we want, that is the study of the conditions for
the global relations between Iraq and the United Nations
re-establish in a favorable environment,'' said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She also said that France is concerned about the damaging of a
major pipeline sending Iraqi oil abroad in exchange for food and
other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
``You know about the importance for the Iraqi people the good
application of the oil for food program... This incident
complicated the application of this program which we judge very
important,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that France has proposed a lifting of oil embargo
against Iraq, a reform of U.N. arms monitoring system, and the
establishment of a mechanism to prevent Iraq from re-arming
itself.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also called on the United States and Britain to stop
the raids while Iraq has warned of a ``general flare-up'' if the
Americans and British do not stop bombing.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Splits Into Two Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard Co., one of
the world-famous computer makers, said Tuesday it will split
itself into two companies, according to a report from the Silicon
Valley-based high-tech giant.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking this action to sharpen the strategic focus of
our businesses, improve their agility and increase their
responsiveness to customers and partners," chief executive officer
Lewis Platt said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
After restructuring, Hewlett-Packard said, one of the two
independent companies will focus on computer products for which
the tech giant is best known, while the other will include
Hewlett-Packard's test-and-measurement, components,
chemical-analysis and medical businesses.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard's board of directors approved the realignment
plan at a special meeting Tuesday morning. Under the plan,
stockholders will hold shares in each company.
</P>
<P>
Each company will have its own research-and-development unit.
They will be managed separately to "better focus on growth in
their individual markets," Hewlett-Packard said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources noted that the plan follows a period of
underperformance by Hewlett-Packard after a suite of hot-selling
consumer products in the early 1990s revived the fortunes of the
pioneering scientific measurements company. But heavy competition
in the consumer market hit its fast-growing consumer unit in the
past two years, they added.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard joins a growing list of major companies that
have split themselves up to become more profitable, including AT&AMP;T
Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ITT Corp.

<HEADLINE> California Exports to China Rises 9.3 Percent Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Exports to China from
California, the largest exporting state in the United States, rose
9.3 percent to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, as sales of products to
Asia as a whole fell more than a fifth in 1998, according to the
state officials.
</P>
<P>
The increase of exports to China, along with similar increases
of exports to Canada, Mexico and Europe, offset the decrease of
California's exports to Asia region as a whole, the officials said
in a report published in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
The shipment to every Asian country and region except China
fell for the year, as computers and electronic equipment to Asia
fell more than 20 percent, according to the officials. However,
they stressed exports to Asia, totaling 41.3 billion dollars last
year, still made up the largest share of total California's
exports, 39.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
California exports to Canada, Mexico and Europe all rose more
than 10 percent in 1998, said Lon Hatamiya, the state's trade and
commerce agency secretary, who praised the passage of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The total exports from California, the so-called world's
seventh-largest economy, fell 4.2 percent in 1998 to 105 billion
dollars, marking the third consecutive year the largest state has
surpassed 100 billion dollars in exports. In 1997, the state's
exports totaled 110 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, U.S. exports last year were 680 billion dollars,
down one percent from 1997, according to the Massachusetts
Institute of Social and Economic Research.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi to Accept Mandela's Word on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on
Tuesday said he is willing to accept verbal guarantees by South
African President Nelson Mandela on resolving the issue over the
trial of two Libyans in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
In a speech broadcast on Libyan television, Gaddafi said
Mandela's words are sufficient and "stronger than a Security
Council resolution and stronger than any other commitments" to
resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Libya, the United States and Britain have been disputing over
the trial of two Libyan intelligence agents suspected of bombing a
Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah have tried to
mediate in the dispute and they sent envoys in January to meet
Gaddafi in an attempt to persuade him to hand over the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said he has received a letter from Abdullah that
"includes guarantees and assurances." Libya was seeking guarantees
for the two suspects' security and fair trial after agreeing to
let them stand trial in the Netherlands by Scottish judges and
under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States and Britain gave Libya a one-month
deadline to surrender the two suspects, a request rejected by
Libya.

PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
on Tuesday that France will support the Czech Republic in its
effort to join the European Union (EU) as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel, Chirac said that France will surely stand by the Czech
Republic in respect of its entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
President Havel arrived here on Tuesday on a visit which is
aimed at seeking French support to his bid for an early entry into
the EU.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by his wife, Dagmar, and several government
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, which began negotiations with the EU in
1998, is concerned that the process of integration of new members
by EU could slow down because of budget problems.
</P>
<P>
Although Prague still officially hopes to enter the EU in the
year 2000, Havel said that if his country can become an EU member
in 2003, it will be a great success.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Statement Encouraging, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday said that he was encouraged by comments from Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi, but he said he had received no official
response on the surrender of suspects accused of bombing a Pan Am
jet over Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, in a speech lively televised across his North African
nation, said that "a final agreement is expected." He said he
asked the Libyan people to trust South African President Nelson
Mandela and Saudi Arabian officials who "asked us to accept"
provisions for the handover of the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in answer to questions at a news conference, said he had
seen reports on Gaddafi's statement.
</P>
<P>
"If it is indeed accurate, it is an encouraging sign. I did not
hear from leader Gaddafi," he said. "I hope it will be a positive
one."
</P>
<P>
At issue is the surrender for trial of two alleged Libyan
intelligence agents the United States and Britain have indicted
for placing a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 as it flew over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. A total of 270
people perished, 11 of them on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"I continue my efforts to secure Libya's compliance with
Security Council resolutions," said the U.N. chief, who paid a
visit to Libya in January, but failed in his efforts to talk the
Libyan authorities into handing over the two suspects for the
trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Libyan permanent representative to the United
Nations, Abuzed Omar Dorda, whom he saw Monday, "was disturbed"
about reports that a 30-day ultimatum was issued.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said this was not true because the
Security Council "did not offer an ultimatum." But he said he had
discussed with the Council last Friday "a reasonable period for
Libya to respond" since his last letter to Tripoli a day before
the council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Britain Friday said 30 days was a
"reasonable" time period for Tripoli to make a decision following
six months of negotiations through the United Nations on a trial
before a Scottish court sitting at Camp Zeist, a former military
base in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"I met with the Libyan ambassador yesterday to discuss this
issue and to ask him about his government's response, which I hope
will be forthcoming shortly," Annan said. "Obviously, he was
disturbed about press reports that there has been an ultimatum."
</P>
<P>
"As most of you will know, the (Security) Council did not offer
any such ultimatum," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have provided Libya with all the answers and clarifications
and explanations that they have sought and we are now waiting for
a decision to be able to move on with the trial and I hope it will
be forthcoming soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dorda last week accused Washington of having a "hidden agenda"
because U.N.-imposed sanctions would be suspended and not lifted
when the surrender took place.
</P>
<P>
However, it is improbable that once the sanctions, which
include bans on flights, arms and certain kinds of oil equipment,
are suspended, they could be reimposed. This would take a positive
vote of nine council members and no veto from any of its five
permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Libya in August last year accepted a U.S.-UK proposal to have
the two suspects tried before a Scottish court in the Netherlands,
but later Libya was locked in a dispute with the U.S. and Britain
on the place where the two suspects, if convicted, to serve their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Libya is seeking a U.N. written assurance for the
relevant arrangement in the process of the proposed trial and
imprisonment, U.N. officials said.

Israel invaded Lebanon twice before setting up a self-styled

However, Netanyahu did not make an iron-clad commitment that

<HEADLINE> UK Earnings Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON March 2 (Xinhua) - The UK's average earnings in December
rose by 4.2 percent on a year-on-year basis, according to figures
released by the Office for National Statistics Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That compared to average earnings growth in November of 4.5
percent, as the figures continued to decline for the seventh month
in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said that the figures were "encouraging", but some
economists said were surprised by the strength of the figures, a
dey indicator of inflation.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new figures will have some influence on
the Bank of England as it begins its deliberations on interest
rates today.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has made it clear it no
longer sees wage inflation as a major threat to its 2.5 percent
inflation target.
</P>
<P>
It said in its February inflation report it had lowered
"significantly" its profile for nominal earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that the Bank may well decide to leave
rates on hold until the economic situation is clearer. And it may
be some time before average earnings figures affect economic
policy so directly again.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration Withdraws Support From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The administration of U.S.
President Bill Clinton Tuesday withdrew its support from the
Independent Counsel Law and urged Congress to let it expire in
June.
</P>
<P>
"Despite its good intentions, the act has failed to accomplish
its primary goal: the enhancement of confidence in the rule of law
by the American people," Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told
a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said: "The president
concurs with the judgment of the Justice Department that the
statute should not be renewed and that its flaws outweigh its
benefits."
</P>
<P>
Several times, Holder emphasized that the administration's new
opposition was not based on "problems with individual independent
counsels," such as Kenneth Starr, whose five-year probe into
President Clinton's affairs led to the second presidential
impeachment in history.
</P>
<P>
He said the 21-year-old act "comes dangerously close to tipping
the traditional balance of fairness in the conduct of criminal
investigations and prosecutions" by insulating independent
counsels from financial accountability and traditional Department
of Justice rules.
</P>
<P>
His comments before the House Subcommittee on Commercial and
Administrative Law highlight deteriorating political support for
the statute among both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Holder testified that the Justice Department is capable of
investigating and prosecuting most of the officials now covered by
the law.
</P>
<P>
Holder's opposition to the Independent Counsel Act directly
reverses the Clinton administration's stance five years ago, when
both President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno
successfully urged Congress to renew the law.

WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The death toll linked to
contaminated hot dogs and meats made by Sara Lee Corp.'s Bil Mar
Foods in Michigan State of the United States has reached 14,
government health investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tainted meat has been blamed for six
miscarriages and 97 illnesses in 22 states of the country from
last August to January 17 this year, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak is the nation's second-deadliest involving
Listeria bacteria.

<P>
On December 22 last year, Bil Mar began a recall of 15 million
pounds of hot dogs and cold cuts produced at its Zeeland plant in
Michigan State after a rare strain of Listeria was found in both
opened and unopened packages.
</P>
<P>
Listeria can be found in soil, water and various raw foods. The
bacteria can cause death or severe illness in women who are
pregnant, people with weakened immune systems, newborns and the
elderly.

WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. intelligence services have
infiltrated agents and espionage equipment for three years into
U.N. weapons inspection teams in Iraq to eavesdrop on the Iraqi
military without the knowledge of the U.N. agency, the Washington
Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was another scandal of U.S. intelligence services that took
advantage of U.N. arms monitoring in Iraq to insert their agents
for theirs own purposes.
</P>
<P>
In January, the same newspaper disclosed that the U.S.
intelligence services, in collaboration with the UNSCOM (U.N.
Special Commission), had sent American spies to work under the
cover of weapons inspectors to ferret out secret Iraqi weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
But in Tuesday's disclosure, the U.S. agents had even skipped
over the UNSCOM's attention to gather intelligence information
about the Iraqi military programs.
</P>
<P>
The White House acknowledged Tuesday that intelligence was
gathered by the United States, but refused to comment directly on
the allegation the UNSCOM was kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
The whole story comes out as follows according to the
Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM in 1993 had more than 300 weapons installations and
research facilities in Iraq. For the first three years of
operation, the video images and logs of electrical power use were
recorded onto magnetic tape at the remote sites. Inspectors based
in Baghdad periodically drove out to collect the tapes.
</P>
<P>
In March 1996, with Iraq's consent, the UNSCOM began
transmitting images from the cameras back to Baghdad using radio
signals. The signals were boosted by relays, arrayed along the
paths from the camera sites to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
But unbeknownst to the UNSCOM, the U.S. signals and sensor
technicians who installed and maintained the system were
intelligence operatives, and the repeater stations they built had
a covert capability by using hidden antennas capable of
intercepting microwave transmissions, and the U.S. agents placed
some of them near important nodes of Iraqi military
communications.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the principal designer of the new
system was a military intelligence operative, and at least two
technicians lent by the U.S. government to run the remote camera
system for the UNSCOM were employees of the Central Intelligence
Agency's clandestine service. The newspaper said it was
withholding the names of the three agents at the U.S. government's
request.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long claimed that the United States and its allies
were using the UNSCOM as a way to spy on Baghdad and the two
disclosures, especially the latest one vindicated its claim.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Leavy, while acknowledging U.S.
spies' penetration into the UNSCOM, argued what they did was to
support the UNSCOM's inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Everything the United States did was to support UNSCOM in its
effort to break Iraq's concealment of its weapons of mass
destruction program," he said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to discuss details of the operation, other than to
say that unspecified aspects of the newspaper account were not
accurate.

<HEADLINE> Bush Announces Formation of Presidential Exploratory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Texas Governor George W.
Bush, eldest son of the former president, announced Tuesday he
will form a presidential exploratory committee to raise money and
measure support for a White House bid of his own in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bush, 52, stopped short of formally entering the presidential
race. But he has begun assembling a fund-raising team and has been
consulting policy advisers for weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Those of you who cover me every day know I don't make this
decision lightly. I've carefully considered its ramifications,"
Bush said in Austin, capital of Texas State.
</P>
<P>
"I've been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fellow
elected officials and party leaders all across our country many of
whom, as you know, have made the trip to Austin, Texas."
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Bush said forming a presidential
exploratory committee would allow him to assess the national
political mood and raise money.
</P>
<P>
"It'll be interesting to see what the different politics are
around the country. But raising money is the most important aspect
of an exploratory committee," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator whose
low-budget campaigns shocked the Republican establishment in 1992
and 1996, opened his third presidential race Tuesday in
Manchester, New Hampshire State.
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he won't talk about other candidates until he
actually enters the race.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Egyptian Makeup More Complicated Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- An analysis of makeup used by
Egyptian women 4,000 years ago indicates that the ancient Egyptian
women used much more complicated chemistry than had been
appreciated, the Washington Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to P. Walter of the Laboratoire de Recherche des
Musees de France and colleagues who conducted the analysis,
cosmetic powders that had been preserved in their original stone
containers contained lead chloride compounds that do not readily
exist in nature.
</P>
<P>
The French researchers said that the underlying chemical
reactions to create the chemicals are simple, but the whole
process including many repetitive operations, must have been quite
difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
The finding shows that the chemical technology of ancient Egypt
was more sophisticated than previously thought, said the
researchers.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Overall Inflation to Rise due to Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's overall inflation remained
low in February but it is likely to rise in near future as a
widespread drought brings up the price of basic foods, the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prices overall dropped 0.5 percent year-on-year in the 12
months to February, compared with a fall of 1.1 percent in
January, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The threat of famine looms across a large part of the country
of 29 million people, which has caused an upsurge of prices of
fresh vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
However, CBK Chief Economist Maurice Kanga said that underlying
 inflation, which excludes food prices, declined to 2.5 percent in
February from 5.8 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Kanga said that the shilling, which fell following a cabinet
reshuffle nearly two weeks ago, had restored most of its losses.
But it remained generally weak against the dollar, at an average
of 64.01 this week from 63. 12 last week.

<HEADLINE> 19 Killed, 31 Injured in Road Accident in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen people were killed and 31
others injured when a bus plunged into a Nile canal Wednesday in
southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The bus slid into the canal when the driver swerved to avoid a
tractor pulling on to the highway from a village road, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bus, which belongs to the state-owned Upper Nile Bus
Company, was heading from Cairo to Qena, 610 kilometers south of
the capital, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place near Dairut, 280 kilometers south of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Villagers dove into the canal and rescued 28 people, including
the driver, and rushed them to hospitals in Dairut and nearby
Al-Qusiya. Only four passengers were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the tractor was detained for questioning, said
the police.
</P>
<P>
Such accidents are common in rural Egypt, where roads are
narrow, poorly lit and crowded with trucks, villagers and farm
animals.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England Wednesday kept
UK interest rates on hold at 5.5 percent which brings to an end
five months of monetary easing.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have tumbled from 7.5 percent last September to
stand at 5.5 percent at present -- a five year low.
</P>
<P>
The decision will dismay manufacturers and trade unions who
were calling for further interest rate cuts to help stave off a
recession.
</P>
<P>
Millions of homeowners will also be disappointed. Mortgage
lenders are expected to keep the rates they charge on hold for now.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said the inaction by the Bank, ahead of
next week's annual budget from Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown, was merely a pause for breath.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa on Budget for 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Wednesday
described the budget for 1999-2000 as "a key milestone" in
implementing the government's economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
He told a media session that since its founding on July 1, 1997,
the SAR government has sought to build on Hong Kong's economic
strengths and improve the quality of life for Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the financial turmoil, we have never wavered from the
implementation of this strategy," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the budget, unveiled by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
Wednesday, the government is offering a series of one-off tax
concessions to assist individuals and business to cope with the
economic downturn, as well as freezing of government fees and
reduction of property and other taxes.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to make substantive progress in many economic areas"
in the long term, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the service industry, he noted that tourist arrivals nearly
touched 10 million again in 1998, adding: "We expect growth and
some revival further this year."
</P>
<P>
Tung specially mentioned the fact that Hong Kong has signed a
letter of understanding with Walt Disney and will commence
intensive negotiations on building a Disney theme park on
reclaimed land at North Lantau.
</P>
<P>
If the discussions are successful, he said, this will bring
many benefits.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned a joint government and private sector
development to construct a "Cyberport," a plan to merge the stock
and futures exchanges and their associated clearing houses into a
new holding company and civil service reforms.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the government will continue to pursue its economic
strategy and reform the public sector, so that Hong Kong will be
well placed to meet new challenges as a knowledge-based economy
and the premier international city in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Britain Insists Its EU Budget Rebate Not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) - The British government said on
Wednesday that its 15-year-old budget rebate from the European
Union (EU) was non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing on the table that would tempt us to negotiate
it away," Minister for Europe in the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office Joyce Quin told a parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been attracted by anything we have seen," she said
when asked by a Conservative parliament member if the budget
rebate was non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
But she also acknowledged that Britain was ready to examine
alternative proposals and still hoped for an agreement on European
Union budget reform later this month.
</P>
<P>
The rebate, which was negotiated by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher in 1984, saves Britain around two billion pounds a year.
Her successor, Tony Blair, has repeatedly said it is still
justified.
</P>
<P>
Ms Quin said Britain remained firmly wedded to the mechanism
devised in 1984 to meet Thatcher's demands for a cut in Britain's
payments, "unless there is something better on the table."
</P>
<P>
It has been expected that British Prime Minister Tony Blair
would come under strong pressure at the coming EU summit, which is
scheduled to be held in Berlin in three weeks time, to give up
part of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
But Quin said Britain opposed the idea of "equality of
sacrifice" because even after the rebate, it was paying more than
its fair share.
</P>
<P>
She noted that other member states wanted to limit the rebate,
which cannot be changed except by a unanimous vote, to existing
spending among 15 countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain says the rebate should continue to apply when new
members are admitted.

<HEADLINE> Navigation on Yangtze Returns to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- An oil tanker stranded in shallow
water yesterday at the Jiujiang section of the Yangtze River was
towed out into the main course today.
</P>
<P>
Navigation on the Jiujiang section has now returned to normal,
and transportation departments are closely monitoring the ship
traffic on the waterway.
</P>
<P>
A 20-kilometer-long section downstream from Jiujiang has had
very shallow water since the beginning of the year, blocking the
flow of several large cargo and passenger ships, said bureau
director Zhou Guanlun.
</P>
<P>
The heavy flooding last summer washed huge amounts of sand into
this section causing the silt there to reach one million cubic
meters and hindering the passage of large vessels, he added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure normal navigation at the section, the Yangtze River
Navigation Bureau sent two dredgers to dig out the silt and dredge
the waterway. Currently, the water level at the shallowest point
has risen from 1.8 meters to 3.2 meters.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Decides to Return to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has decided
in principle to send its international staff back to Afghanistan
later this month, U.N. sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.N. secretary general's special envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi is likely to formally make the
announcement here on Thursday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi received full assurance of security for the U.N.
international staff from top Taliban leaders during his one-day
visit to Kabul on Sunday, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Foreign U.N. staff were evacuated from Kabul last August after
the killing of an Italian U.N. military officer.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Taliban signed a sub-security
agreement here in October last year that bound the ruling Islamic
militia to provide protection to the U.N. staff and its premises.
</P>
<P>
Both the militia and the United Nations described their talks
as highly successful and hinted at the resumption of U.N. relief
activities in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Taliban charge d'affaires here Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani
said the Taliban have given full assurance to the U.N. envoy to
protect the U.N. international staff.
</P>
<P>
"Talks with Brahimi were constructive. We have not only assured
full security to the U.N. staff on return to Afghanistan but will
also facilitate them to smoothly continue their activities,"
Haqqani said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi held talks in Kabul on Sunday with head of the Taliban
Interim Council Mulla Mohammad Rabbani and top official
responsible for foreign affairs Mulla Hasan Akhhund on his fresh
peace initiative in Afghanistan and matters concerning security
for the U.N. staff.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call for Legislation for Information Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Second Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the nation's highest
law-making body, are calling for an early legislation to ensure
information security in China.
</P>
<P>
"Legislation in that regard will facilitate a healthy
development of the nation's information industry," said Zhang
Zhongli, a researcher from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences,
pointing to the poor management, poor awareness of information
security and lack of industry rules in China's information
industry.
</P>
<P>
He and 30 fellow deputies submitted a proposal this afternoon
to the Second Session of the Ninth NPC, suggesting legislation
concerning information security be put on agenda as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
China cracked nearly 100 cases of computer break-in last year.
Computer network of financial institutions such as banks and
securities companies were attacked the most by the hackers.
</P>
<P>
Another Shanghai deputy, Zhang Lansheng, pointed out that
insecurity of information has become the leading problem plaguing
the rising E-business in China.
</P>
<P>
Although the popularization of computers in coastal cities
makes E-business possible, the stores still have worries about a
safe flow of electronic cash and lack of regulations governing
such trading, which have held the development of E-business in
China.
</P>
<P>
China has stepped up efforts to ensure information security in
recent years: stipulations about computer-related crimes have been
included into the Criminal Law two years ago, and a series of
regulations governing the protection of computer information
system have also been unveiled.

KATHMANDU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 11,617 new cases of
leprosy were detected in the six-day leprosy elimination campaign
launched on January 31 in 27 of Nepal's 75 districts, the official
RSS news agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
And 2,277 patients were found to have stopped taking medicine

</P>
<P>
So far 55,666 leprosy patients have been cured in Nepal through
a multi-drug therapy, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization and some international

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
today issued standard fee cards to overseas-funded enterprises in
a bid to eliminate arbitrary charges targeting such firms.
</P>
<P>
The cards cover a total of 74 kinds of administrative fees and
20 funds approved by the provincial government and collected by 26
agencies. Overseas-funded firms are obliged to pay only those fees
which apply to them.
</P>
<P>
Official regulations accompanying the cards also stipulate that
overseas-funded enterprises will be charged at the lower rates in
cases where there are rate variations.
</P>
<P>
Besides these fees, eight other types of fees are allowed in
Chengdu because of its status as a provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the fee cards will help to effectively
protect the rights and interests of overseas-funded enterprises,
said Vice Governor Li Dachang.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans to Vote on June 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africans will go to the
polls on June 2, President Nelson Mandela announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the unofficial announcement in parliament in reply
to his budget vote. The constitution bans him from proclaiming the
election date before April 30.
</P>
<P>
Although the government had previously indicated that it would
have preferred a date in the second half of May, consideration of
the Independent Electoral Commission's (IEC's) arguments relating
to its capacity and obligations had convinced him that it would be
safer to hold the elections a week later, he said.
</P>
<P>
All the political parties in parliament had already agreed that
the provincial premiers would proclaim the same date for the
provincial elections so that the national and provincial elections
would be held on the same day, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, neither I nor the premiers can officially proclaim
the election date until after April 30.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is in the interest of everyone that this
date should be brought forward; and this will require a
constitutional amendment."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had been informed that discussions would be
initiated among all parties to ensure that a constitutional
amendment was effected which would allow him to proclaim the date
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Certainty about the date of the elections was something that
everyone was looking for, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to know where to register, voters need to know where
they are likely to be on election day.
</P>
<P>
"People turning 18 around the election period need to know
whether they will qualify to vote."
</P>
<P>
In the run up to the final registration drive at the weekend,
it had been agreed with the IEC that it was urgent for the
government to announce a date, so as to encourage those who had
not yet registered to do so.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks' Net Income Hits 473 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-nine foreign banks operating
in South Korea registered a combined net income of 577.1 billion
won (473 million U.S. dollars) in 1998 due to a rise in interest
revenues, the Financial Supervisory Service said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The net income, despite down from 1.116 trillion won (910
million dollars) in 1997, was in a stark contrast to South Korean
banks' net loss of 14.48 trillion won (11.8 billion dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
Among the 39 banks, Citibank maintained the first place with a
net profit of 110.9 billion won (90.7 million dollars), followed
by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation with 72 billion won (
58 million dollars), Banque Nationale de Paris with 43.7 billion
won (34.8 million dollars) and Standard Chartered Bank with 37
billion won (32.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fall in the foreign banks' net profits from 1997 was mainly
caused by a huge loss on the valuation of derivatives, which
amounted to 1.1 trillion won (883 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 39 foreign banks suffered a loss of 77.8 billion won (63.6
million dollars) in non-interest revenues last year for the same
reason.

<HEADLINE> 11 Vancouver Prostitutes Disappear in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Eleven women working in the sex
trade in Vancouver, Canada, disappeared last year, a local
newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one women known to work as prostitutes in Vancouver have
disappeared mysteriously since 1995. Four other Vancouver
prostitutes have been killed, the Globe and Mail said.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver prostitutes said they had inadequate police
protection and fear downtown Eastside, the city's worst red-light
district, has become a stalking zone for one or more serial
killers.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver police said Tuesday there was no evidence pointing to
a serial killer, but the prostitutes claimed there was no other
explanation for the sharp increase in disappearances.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be a particular block where almost all of
them worked before they disappeared," said Jamie Lee Hamilton, an
unofficial spokeswoman for many of the estimated 2,000 prostitutes
working in downtown Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"These disappearances must be treated as homicides," Hamilton
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who has argued in the past that a serial killer is
active, appealed for an increase in police investigations and
protection. In the sprawling and decrepit section of the city,
drug dealing, prostitution, open displays of addiction,
homelessness and violence are rampant.
</P>
<P>
"If these women were not street-involved, there would be an
outpouring of concern and immediate action to find their killers,"
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver police spokeswoman Anne Drennan said the sharp
increase in the number of missing prostitutes in the last two
years "is a cause for real concern," but did not point to a serial
killer at work.
</P>
<P>
A number of those missing may have committed suicide, or moved
away to escape the rough and dirty trade, Drennan said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Gov. George W. Bush, whose fledgling candidacy for president
has sparked an extraordinary surge of support from around the
country, took the first formal step toward running in 2000 by
announcing Tuesday he will allow him to start raising money and
building a political organization.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary General Kofi Annan said Tuesday allegations that
American intelligence agents used U.N. weapons inspection teams as
cover to spy on Iraq could harm the cause of disarmament because
suspicious government might be unwilling to cooperate with U.N.
surveillance of their arms programs.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A hard-line political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
Adem Demaci, resigned, raising hope among diplomats that the
ethnic Albanian guerrilla movement would sign an autonomy plan
proposed at peace talks last month.
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican leadership in U.S. Congress debated a plan to
end the long-standing practice of using Social Security money for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Leading business economists predicted the U.S. economy will
slow in time to avert an increase of inflation. A forecasting
panel said the U.S. economy will expand by 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
-- An Iraqi oil official said U.S. attacks have cut half of
Baghdad's oil exports allowed under a U.N. program to buy civilian
goods. The official said damage Sunday and Monday at sites
controlling a pipeline to Turkey will take "a long time" to repair.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Condemns Killing of Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Wednesday condemned the killing of eight foreign tourists by
Rwandan Hutu rebels in western Uganda Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in State House Wednesday afternoon, the
president described this act as barbaric and cowardly.
</P>
<P>
He said the Interahamwe rebels are criminally-minded and what
they did to the tourists in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest is a
sign of their criminal nature.
</P>
<P>
The president who is also Minister of Defense, said he has
already ordered Ugandan troops to pursue the Hutu rebels who are
said to target British and American tourists.
</P>
<P>
The army will permanently guard the national parks prone to
rebel attacks from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to
ensure security for international tourists and local people, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the international community to pursue the rebels
and expressed condolences to the families, both local and foreign,
who lost their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
"We shall follow the rebels. We will kill them if we cannot
catch them," the 54-year-old president promised.
</P>
<P>
Their act will affect Uganda's tourism industry for some time,
he acknowledged, but added quickly that in the end people will see
our measures to be taken are effective.
</P>
<P>
A group of some 150 Interahamwe rebels hit some tented camps in
the forest early Monday morning, abducted 32 tourists who went
there to see mountain gorillas.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen later escaped and another six were reported to have
been released. At least nine people, including eight foreigners,
were killed by the attackers.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair called this incident
appalling. A team of U.S. agents have arrived here to help
investigate the incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Wednesday blamed the national park authorities and police for the
killing of eight foreign tourists by Rwandan rebels in western
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks at a press conference at State House
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said park authorities should foresee this problem and take
adequate steps to ensure safety of tourists.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the army should be responsible for this
incident because the attackers came in from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), he said Ugandan troops were not deployed
in the area where the rebels infiltrated into Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the police and the officials responsible for
internal affairs should come up with steps to be taken.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that soldiers will be deployed at national parks
to guarantee safety of tourists and to protect the country's
fragile tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that the increasing insecurity is one of
key reasons for Uganda's military presence in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
On whether this incident is linked with Uganda's military
involvement in the seven-month armed conflict there, Museveni said
it's not so much related because they did not attack the barracks
of Ugandan troops there.
</P>
<P>
The killing of eight foreign tourists by the Interahamwe rebels
sent shock waves to the outside world, especially to countries
like Britain, the United States, New Zealand whose nationals were
among the victims.
</P>
<P>
Interahamwe rebels, together with rebels of Allied Democratic
Forces, have been operating from the DRC. They often go into
western Uganda to kill, loot and abduct.

KUWAIT CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and U.S. forces
stationed in the Gulf will conduct joint military exercises from
March 4 to April 4, the U.S. embassy here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fifth Fleet of the Central Command's naval component
will join in the one-month maneuvers along with Kuwaiti armed
forces, according to an embassy statement.
</P>
<P>
The joint war games were designed to strengthen military ties
between Kuwaiti and U.S. forces, to enhance the proficiency in
rapid deployment of marine forces and to train Kuwaiti forces.
</P>
<P>
The games also enabled U.S. naval amphibious forces to stage
combined operations with Kuwaiti armed forces in Kuwait, while
showing U.S. military capability and commitment to the region, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Under bilateral defense cooperation agreements signed after the
1991 Gulf War, Kuwait conducts joint military exercises with its
western allies regularly, especially with the U.S., which
maintains a strong military presence in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement did not mention where the games are to
take place.

PYONGYANG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on Wednesday called for a fair and peaceful
resolution to the Kosovo conflict which respects the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the DPRK's Foreign Ministry told the Korean
Central News Agency that although the Rambouillet accord reached
between the warring parties days ago had overcome critical
obstacles, the confrontation between Washington and Belgrade on
the military presence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO) in Kosovo was becoming serious.
</P>
<P>
The official also attributed the Kosovo issue's seriousness and
complexity to attempts by the U.S. and other Western countries to
dominate Balkan region by military intervention and to strengthen
NATO's status and role around the world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the issue was an internal Yugoslav affair and
that the international community had to stop the U.S. attempt to
settle the Kosovo issue with force.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Urged to Monitor Expenditure Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Wednesday that Luxembourg should continue to monitor expenditure
growth, in particular social security spending, in order to
maintain sound public finances and to meet the budgetary pressures
resulting from its aging population.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's executive body said in a statement that it
has assessed the Luxembourg stability program and presented a
recommendation to the EU Council of Ministers for approval.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the program covers the period between 1999
and 2002 and envisages the maintenance of a budgetary surplus,
throughout the period, projected at one percent to 2.5 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, Luxembourg's gross debt to GDP
ratio would continue to remain very low and the country's
envisaged objectives are in line with the EU Stability and Growth
Pact requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Stability and Growth Pact was agreed to by all the 15 EU
member states in June 1997 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The
pact requires countries adopting the euro to present stability
programs to the Council of European Union, the EU's policy-making
body, and the EU commission, which is mainly responsible for
proposing and enforcing legislation.
</P>
<P>
Generally, such a program aims to demonstrate how a euro-zone
country intends to meet the objectives of the pact and, in
particular, the medium-term goal of a budget close to balance or
in surplus.
</P>
<P>
The commission said its analysis considers whether the medium-
term budgetary target provides a sufficient margin for normal
cyclical fluctuation without exceeding the reference value of
three percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Former Nepali Deputy PM not to Contest Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Deputy Prime Minister and
Nepali Congress (NC) candidate Shailaja Acharya decided Wednesday
not to contest the May election to the House of Representatives,
Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to NC President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala, Acharya said she would work for the unity of the party
and the consolidation of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The state-run radio did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
On February 27, the NC announced a list of candidates to
contest the election in the 205 constituencies all over the
country. Acharya was selected to contest in the No. 7 constituency
of Morang District in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The party also gave tickets to 12 other women, but Prime
Minister Koirala's daughter Sujata, who has been involved in
social work for years and is popular with the landless people and
the poor in the No. 1 constituency of Sunsari District, eastern
Nepal, was denied a ticket.
</P>
<P>
People in the constituency called a market shutdown on Monday
to protest Sujata's denial of the ticket, saying they would
otherwise boycott the election.
</P>
<P>
Sujata herself said there had been a major conspiracy in the
party to deny her a ticket.
</P>
<P>
Chandra Prasad Shrestha, the NC's candidate for the
constituency, had issued a statement saying he was ready to vacate
the candidacy for Sujata.
</P>
<P>
Dil Man Pakhrin, the party's candidate for the No. 1
constituency of Dhading District in central Nepal, has offered to
give up his candidacy in favor of Subir Khanal.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the dissolved house who were denied tickets
have voiced their displeasure and are pressing for changes in the
list, press reports here said.
</P>
<P>
But NC General Secretary Tara Nath Ranabhat said Tuesday that
the candidates have no authority to transfer their tickets to
others. "There is no chance of any alterations in the list of
candidates now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has decided to hold the election in two
phases with the first on May 3 and the second within two weeks
after that.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Attract More Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam hopes to receive 12.6
million tourists this year, of whom 1.6 million are foreigners.
</P>
<P>
This year's target would lay the foundation for the sector to
obtain 13 million tourist arrivals in 2000, of which 2 million are
international travelers, the Tourism General Department said in a
statement published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism income would then total 1.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is to do much more to realize this target amid dropping
tourist arrivals, as in other crisis-hit countries in the region,
said Vo Thi Thang, chief of the Tourism General Department.
</P>
<P>
The agency is cooperating with other government bodies to draw
up the National Action Plan on Tourism, including the Vietnam
Tourism Event Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The program, which has been endorsed by the government,
constitutes a widespread promotion and advertising campaign for
Vietnam's tourism.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will host a number of tourism activities, including
international tourism fairs and will participate in similar events
held elsewhere in the world.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Banks' Non-Performing Loans Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean banks' non-performing
loans amounted to 22.22 trillion won (18.15 billion U.S. dollars)
at the end of 1998, accounting for 7.4 percent of their total
lending, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 4.3 percent rise from 21.31 trillion
won (17.41 billion dollars) recorded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Domestic banks' non-performing loans totaled 12.23 trillion won
(9.99 billion dollars) in 1996, then surged to 28.04 trillion won
(22.91 billion dollars) and fell to 22.42 trillion won (18.32
billion dollars) last September.
</P>
<P>
The non-performing loans are the sum of doubtful loans, whose
interest repayments are overdue by more than three months and
whose expected losses have yet to be realized, according to the
FSS.
</P>
<P>
South Korean banks saw their ratio of non-performing loans grow
from 3.9 percent in 1996 to 5.8 percent in 1997. The ratio
reached 7.3 percent last March and then slipped to 7.1 percent in
September.
</P>
<P>
The financial watchdog attributed the high ratio to a reduction
of total lending by domestic banks last year. South Korean banks'
total lending decreased from 364.56 trillion won (297.84 billion
dollars) in 1997 to 300.6 trillion won (245.59 billion dollars)
last year.
</P>
<P>
The nation's big six commercial banks -- Cho Hung, Hanil,
Commercial Bank of Korea, Korea First, Seoul and Korea Exchange --
had combined non-performing loans of 12.56 trillion won (10.26
billion dollars) in 1998, accounting for 8.6 percent of total
lending, the FSS said.
</P>
<P>
Korea First Bank topped the list with 3.83 trillion won (3.13
billion dollars), followed by Seoul Bank with 2.98 trillion won (2.
43 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Budget to Help HK Boost Fundamentals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
Yam-kuen Wednesday unveiled the 1999-2000 Budget, in which he
proposed major initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong's fundamentals
in face of the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
In his annual budget address to the Legislative Council, Tsang
forecast that the overall gross domestic product will grow by
around 0.5 percent in 1999, against a contraction of 5.1 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary outlined a series of major initiatives
in the new budget entitled "Onward With New Strengths." He pledged
that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
will undertake major reforms in the securities and futures market,
further develop the local debt market, develop a multi-billion
cyberport, plan the construction of a Disney theme park, partially
privatize the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) and reform
the civil service.
</P>
<P>
One bold step to be taken in restructuring the securities and
futures market is to merge the current two exchanges and
associated clearing houses into an eventually listed commercial
entity.
</P>
<P>
Tsang forecast that government spending will total 241.6
billion HK dollars (30.9 billion U.S. dollars) in the coming
financial year, which starts on April 1, 1999. Total revenue will
remain flat at 205.1 billion HK dollars (26.3 billion U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
He told the 60-member Legislative Council that a budget deficit
in the coming financial year is "unavoidable," but he promised a
return to balanced budgets in the medium term. Tsang forecast a
deficit of 36.5 billion HK dollars (4.6 billion U.S. dollars) or 2.
8 percent of the gross domestic product in 1999-2000. But he added:
"From 2001-02 onwards, our finances will be back on a healthy
footing."
</P>
<P>
Considering current economic difficulties, the financial
secretary explained: "A deficit budget in the short term is
entirely consistent with the provisions of the Basic Law, provided
that it is set in the context of a return to balanced budgets over
the medium term."
</P>
<P>
"From a macroeconomic point of view, returning to a fiscal
balance over the medium term is prudent and rational," said Tsang,
who forecast that total fiscal reserves will stand at 389 billion
HK dollars (50 billion U.S. dollars) on March 31, 2000, the end of
the next financial year. There is no government debt, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999-2000 financial year, the biggest share of spending
will be on education, which accounts for more than one-fifth of
the recurrent public expenditure. Education, health and social
welfare make up for half of the total expenditure, while heavy
investment will be pumped into infrastructure and major public
projects. Tsang said the government has decided to freeze civil
service pay in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the revenue side, the budget offers special relief for the
community and provides incentives for businesses. The financial
secretary proposed a one-off tax rebate that benefits taxpayers
and a one-off rates concession that relieves burdens on rate
payers.
</P>
<P>
Tsang also introduced changes to business-related taxes and
fees to help reduce operating costs. He said Hong Kong has one of
the world's most business-friendly and competitive tax regimes,
with a low corporate tax rate of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary announced a deficit of 24.5 billion HK
dollars (billion U.S. dollars) for the outgoing 1998-99 financial
year.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Wednesday reiterated
that it would continue to support the efforts of the United
Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to restore
lasting peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
While meeting visiting U.N. Special Envoy on Afghanistan
Lakhdar Brahimi here Wednesday, Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju said Pakistan's only concern is the
restoration of durable peace in the war-torn country in accordance
with the wishes of the Afghan people themselves.
</P>
<P>
Kanju appreciated the efforts made by the United Nations in
this regard and urged the international community to contribute
generously toward reconstruction in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is also the time for the international community to come
forward generously with funds for the reconstruction of
Afghanistan and rehabilitation of refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who arrived here last week on his fresh peace mission,
briefed Kanju on recent developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy visited Kabul over the weekend and met with
Muhammad Rabbani, chairman of the Afghan Taliban's Supreme
Council, and Muhammad Hasan, a senior Taliban official responsible
for foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi also plans to visit Iran and Central Asian states.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Asked to Report to Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
country's central bank, issued an order Wednesday, asking
commercial banks and the Bangkok International Banking Facilities
(BIBF) to report their incomes and expenses every month.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks and the BIBF are currently required to report
to the central bank every six months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move would indirectly force cash-strapped
institutions to ask for state financial aid under the government's
capital-raising scheme introduced in August last year.
</P>
<P>
BOT officials said the central bank needs to closely monitor
banks' operating performances so that if any serious problems
occur, efficient measures could be put into place without delay.
</P>
<P>
The frequent reports will help the central bank better analyze
and estimate the situation of the financial sector as a whole and
the follow-up will be an additional measure working along with the
measures announced last August, BOT officials said.

<HEADLINE> All Pigs to be Vaccinated in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
wants all pigs to be vaccinated to curb the spread of the Japanese
Encephalitis (JE) disease in the country, Health Minister Chua Jui
Meng said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Veterinary Services Department had been directed to
advise pig farmers on the proper way to carry out the job.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet which discussed the JE outbreak at length at
Wednesday's meeting wants the relevant authorities and parties
involved to discharge their responsibilities fully, he told a news
conference at his office here after attending the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chua said the Health Department would enforce the law empowered
under the Destruction of Disease Bearing and Insects Act to ensure
that the farmers protect their lives and those under their care.
</P>
<P>
"The Veterinary Services Department must also ensure that the
farmers implement good farming practices with proper sanitation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The JE is caused by the Japanese B Encephalitis virus which is
spread from pigs to humans by the Culex mosquito.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 JE related deaths had been reported from October
last year to yesterday in the country.

GENEVA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)

Settlement Body (DSB) at the request of the United States, trade
officials said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally scheduled on Wednesday morning, was to

<P>
On Tuesday, the WTO set up a panel to examine the Section 301

NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Ambassador to India
Cedomir Strbac said here Wednesday that his country is for a
political solution to the Kosovo problem and against military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
He also asked India to explicitly support his country's stand
on the Kosovo issue and join international efforts to firmly
oppose any use of military force to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to heightened tension in the wake of stepped-up
clashes between Serb forces and Kosovo Albanian rebels over the
weekend and buildup of NATO forces near the border, the ambassador
said time has now come for India to oppose any form of military
intervention to resolve the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia remains committed to finding a political
solution to end the Kosovo problem. "We are ready to discuss an
enlargement of the existing autonomy and to provide the so-called
substantial autonomy under existing international standards but
not an independent statehood," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks are expected to resume in France later this month
to negotiate an agreement between the warring Serbs and ethnic
Albanians, he said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Actively Promotes China's Reunification,  Overseas Exchanges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's top advisory body in the
past year has made active efforts to promote the country's
peaceful reunification and friendly exchanges with other nations
in the world, a senior CPPCC leader said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening meeting of the Second Session of the
Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this afternoon, Ye Xuanping, vice-
chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said that in 1998 his
committee carried out various activities to increase friendly
exchanges with compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and with
overseas Chinese while expanding friendly contacts with other
countries through various channels and at all levels.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the work of the CPPCC National Committee's
Standing Committee, Ye said that the Standing Committee, in
accordance with the nature of the CPPCC, has followed the
principles of peaceful reunification and "one country, two systems
" and made friends in all circles to promote the reunification of
the motherland and China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The Standing Committee has received 46 delegations or groups
composed of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan or
overseas Chinese during the past year, and thus helped enhance
mutual understanding," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macao
last year continued to play an active role in maintaining
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and in promoting Macao's
smooth return and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Committee for Liaison with Hong Kong, Macao,
Taiwan and Overseas Chinese last year made friends with many
overseas Chinese scholars, invited some of them to attend a forum
on China's agricultural development, and had more than 30 articles
with constructive ideas by these scholars printed and distributed
among the Standing Committee members.
</P>
<P>
"Based on extensive contacts with overseas Chinese and foreign
nationals of Chinese origin, the Ninth CPPCC National Committee
also invited people who had recently immigrated to other countries
to visit China, and enabled them to contribute to the
modernization drive of the motherland," he added.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Actively Promotes China's Reunification, Overseas Exchanges (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ye went on to say that in the past year, acting within the
general framework of the foreign affairs of China and taking
advantage of its own favorable conditions, the CPPCC has made
friendly contacts with other countries at different levels through
a variety of channels.
</P>
<P>
"The CPPCC National Committee sent six delegations or groups to
visit 12 countries during the past year and received 10
delegations or groups from eight countries. CPPCC Chairman Li
Ruihuan also paid his first official goodwill visits to Romania,
Italy, Spain and France and achieved good results as expected," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February this year, he said, the CPPCC National
Committee had maintained friendly contacts with 105 institutions
in 71 countries and four international organizations. Contacts
with three countries and seven institutions were newly established
during the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee
held in March of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Through these activities, the CPPCC has informed the people of
other countries about the achievements China has made in reforms,
opening-up and modernization drive, as well as about the line,
principles and policies formulated at the 15th National Congress
of the Chinese Communist Party, China's independent foreign policy
of peace, and the important status and role of the CPPCC in the
country's political life. These activities have also helped
relevant countries to acquire a better understanding of China and
have promoted their friendship with China," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Describing the return of Macao to its motherland in December of
this year as "another great event for the Chinese nation", Ye said
that the CPPCC National Committee would continue to give full play
to the role of its members, especially members from Hong Kong and
Macao, in contributing to the smooth return of Macao and in
maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to publicize and implement Party General
Secretary Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal for the promotion of
peaceful reunification of the motherland and help further expand
contacts with personages in Taiwan and economic and cultural
exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, promote dialogues and political negotiations between the
two sides and the peaceful reunification of the motherland," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC will continue to firmly oppose any activities
designed to split China by seeking "Taiwan Independence" or
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", and continue to
strengthen the bonds of friendship with overseas Chinese
compatriots through various channels, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, the CPPCC should further expand friendly
exchanges with its counterparts in other countries, continue to
arrange the exchange of visits between the chairman and vice-
chairmen of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee and high ranking
officials in other countries, explore new ways and forms of making
contacts with other countries, develop friendly relations with
foreign institutions and organizations, and make active efforts to
prepare for the "Forum on the Prospects for the 21st Century" to
be held in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican PM Calls for Improved Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi has called for the improvement of his country's economic
relationship with Portugal to a level that satisfies both sides.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said the political relationship between Mozambique and
Portugal proves to be excellent, but the two countries need to
forge sound economic ties, Maputo-based newspaper Noticias
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Monday in Maputo at the end of the
five-day 99' Mozambique International Industrial Exhibition, which
was organized by the Porto International Fair of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The commodities at the exhibition, he said, were good in
quality and suited to the development level of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Porto International Fair to hold
an international industrial exhibition in Maputo. The exhibition
attracted 70 enterprises, 45 of which are Portuguese firms.
</P>
<P>
Portugal is the second largest investor in Mozambique after
South Africa. It invested 169 million U.S. Dollars in 225
projects in the southern African country during 1985-1998 period.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the two countries signed Tuesday in
Lisbon an agreement on bilateral co-operation for the coming three
years. Under the agreement, Portugal pledged to invest another
120 million U.S. Dollars in Mozambique, according to media
reports.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Ask U.S. Recognition of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat will ask the United States to formally
recognize the Palestinians' right to an independent state, a
senior advisor to Arafat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The recognition would be part of a broad international
agreement in which the Palestinians would agree to postpone a
unilateral declaration of statehood, Israel Radio quoted Tayeb
Abdul Rahim as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
March 23 for talks on the issue of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has said that he will declare statehood
on May 4, the end of a five-year interim period laid down under
the Oslo accords signed by Israel and the Palestinians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat has been under mounting pressure from Arab and
Western nations to put off the move in light of the early
elections in Israel, which is set on May 17.
</P>
<P>
They said such a unilateral move would boost the position of
hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is staunchly
opposed to a Palestinian state, in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Arafat hinted last month that he may back off from his
original plan, saying that he is ready to consider all the
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians officials said Arafat is seeking an international
recognition of a Palestinian state if he agrees to declare it
later.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is against a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
state, urging the Palestinians to resolve the issue through
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The status of the Palestinian territories, together with other
issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, is set to be negotiated in
the final-status talks, which have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's government has threatened to annex parts of the
West Bank still under its control in response to a unilateral
declaration of statehood by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Denies Threat of Capital Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
the public Wednesday that there is no threat of capital flight by
major multinational corporations from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) said in a radio interview this morning that a talk with
officials of these companies showed that reports of a planned
pullout were "exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
He said multinational companies such as Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
Warner Lambert, and Abbott Laboratories will continue their
manufacturing operations here, but will pass on 70 percent of them
to subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
The other 30 percent, he added, would be imported from other
sources such as Thailand, so they can remain competitive in their
international market.
</P>
<P>
"That is their realignments and they will not abandon the
Philippine market, but they have rationalized their
manufacturing," Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
He said these companies have decided on these "realignments" to
take advantage of the special trade arrangement offered by the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Under this arrangement, Pardo said, all ASEAN member countries
will give incentives to non-ASEAN investors for two years in a bid
to attract investments to the region.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand,
Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Myanmar and
Laos.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said some of these multinational companies have started
retrenching workers, but stressed that they have been given
adequate separation compensation by their former employers and the
Philippine government will help qualified retrenched workers find
new jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has set its
export target this year at 2.7 billion US dollars, Mayor Liu Qi
said today.
</P>
<P>
This figure is down from last year's 2.83 billion US dollars,
which was 14.7 percent more than that in 1997, Liu said at a
municipal economic and trade meeting.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Beijing plans to actually utilize 2.2 billion
US dollars in overseas investment this year, down from last year's
2.87 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will make special efforts to improve its export mix and
its use of overseas investment this year, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor referred to measures including giving continued
support for key industries and major exporters, expanding exports
by private companies, and increasing exports of new and high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and electronics accounted for 39 percent of Beijing's
exports last year, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
He also said that efforts will be increased to tap the markets
in Latin America and Africa and to strengthen cooperation with
multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also encourage competitive enterprises in light
textiles, garments and electronics to establish companies and
conduct manufacturing trade overseas, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will direct more overseas investment to the sectors of
infrastructure, high-tech industries, retail business, tourism and
foreign trade, he said, adding that investment by multinational
corporations are especially sought.
</P>
<P>
A total of 83 multinational corporations and other large
companies invested in 87 projects in Beijing last year, with
contracted overseas investment reaching 670 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Fiscal Deficit in 1998 Hit Four Percent of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's financial budget
deficit in 1998 came to four percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP), lower than the anticipated five percent, said the Ministry
of Finance and Economy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit reached about 16.7 trillion won (10.4 billion U.S.
dollars), 4.6 trillion won (3.6 billion dollars) lower than the
target figure of 21.3 trillion won (17.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Originally, the government hoped to expand the year's financial
deficit to five percent of GDP by accelerating budget outlays to
stimulate the flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, budget savings totaled 5.7 trillion won (4.66
billion dollars) while revenue shortages amounted to some 1.1
trillion won (883 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget savings included 2.2 trillion won (1.76 billion
dollars) earmarked for interest payments on government bonds which
were delayed. Another 1.5 trillion won (1.2 billion dollars) was
saved from smaller-than-expected disbursements of the employment
insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
The government had explained the smaller-than-planned budget
deficit to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last month after
it failed to reach the agreed-upon deficit target.
</P>
<P>
"The smaller deficit means less debt burdens for the government.
Stimulating the economy is important, but there is no reason to
make unnecessary fiscal expenditures," said a ministry spokesman.

MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Year 2000 (Y2K) Asian regional
coordinators Wednesday signed a historic Y2K declaration that will
lay down the framework for the region's approach to the millennium
bug debacle as the Second Global Y2K Summit was closed here.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration of Cooperation and Support of Asian Y2K
Coordinators summarized the priorities of action which will be
implemented by the regional coordinators in the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The regional coordinators agreed to work together and intensify
efforts in sharing information across borders on Y2K issues and
minimizing adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors.
</P>
<P>
They called on the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and
other financial and multilateral organizations to review and
increase their level of support for national and regional Y2K
efforts.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Forecasts Budget Deficit for '99-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said here Wednesday that a budget deficit in the
coming fiscal year is "unavoidable," but he promised a return to
balanced budgets in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
In his annual budget address to the Legislative Council, Tsang
forecast a deficit of 36.5 billion HK dollars (4.6 billion U.S.
dollars) or 2.8 percent of the gross domestic product in 1999-2000.
But he predicted: "From 2001-02 onwards, our finances will be back
on a healthy footing."
</P>
<P>
Considering current economic difficulties, the financial
secretary explained:" A deficit budget in the short term is
entirely consistent with the provisions of the Basic Law, provided
that it is set in the context of a return to balanced budgets over
the medium term."
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law, the mini-Constitution of Hong Kong after July 1,
1997, stipulates that the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
should "follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the
limits of revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve
a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate
with the growth rate of its gross domestic product."
</P>
<P>
"From a macro-economic point of view, returning to a fiscal
balance over the medium term is prudent and rational," Tsang told
the 60-strong Legislative Council. "It would be inflexible and
unreasonable to try to achieve a strict balance year after year."
</P>
<P>
Tsang estimated that government spending will total 241.6
billion HK dollars (30.9 billion U.S. dollars) in the coming year,
which starts on April 1, 1999. Total revenue will remain flat at
205.1 billion HK dollars (26.3 billion U.S. dollars) with forecast
economic growth of 0.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The financial Secretary forecast that total fiscal reserves
will stand at 389 billion HK dollars (50 billion U.S. dollars) on
March 31, 2000, the end of the next fiscal year. There is no
government debt, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999-2000 period, the biggest share of spending will be
on education, which accounts for more than one fifth of the total
recurrent public expenditure. Education, health and social welfare
make up for half of the total expenditure, while heavy investment
will be poured into infrastructure and major public projects.
</P>
<P>
On the revenue side, the budget offers special relief for the
community and provides incentives for businesses. The financial
secretary proposed a one-off tax rebate that benefits taxpayers
and a one-off rates concession that relieves burdens on rate
payers.
</P>
<P>
Tsang also introduced changes to business-related taxes and
fees to help reduce operating costs. He said that Hong Kong has
one of the world's most business-friendly and competitive tax
regimes with a low corporate tax rate of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary announced a deficit of 24.5 billion HK
dollars (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) for the outgoing 1998-99 fiscal
year.

XI'AN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The long-term control office of
northwestern China's Xi'an Satellite Control Center looks after
all the country's satellites in space.
</P>
<P>
Although satellites are supposed to move synchronously around
the earth when they go into space, they can drift off course and
out of orbit because of solar, lunar, or earth influences.
</P>
<P>
This change in position in space make it difficult to keep the
angle of inclination perpendicular to the equator and it is the
work of Lu Sida, an engineer, and his colleagues to keep the
satellites in their proper orbit.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, problems can keep them on the job for more than 24
hours, Lu explains. He still remembers the rescue of Fengyun-1 on
the night of February 14, 1991, on Chinese lunar new year eve,
very clearly.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Forecasts 0.5-pct GDP Growth for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Announcing the Budget for 1999-2000, Tsang said overall
economic activity is envisaged to remain slack in the early part
of 1999, followed by a more visible pick-up in the latter part of
the year.
</P>
<P>
For this GDP forecast, Tsang said, "considerable uncertainties
or downside risks" remain both externally and locally, so that the
GDP forecast for this year is "necessarily subject to a larger
margin of variations than usual."
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the economic developments in 1998, the financial
secretary said the preliminary estimate of GDP showed a
contraction of around 5.1 percent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Overall economic growth turned negative, falling 2.6 percent in
real terms, in the first quarter in 1998, the first time since the
third quarter of 1985. It fell by 5.1 percent in the second
quarter and then went further down by 7.0 percent in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, total exports, including re-exports and domestic
exports, fell by 4 percent and imports declined by 7 percent.
Retail sales plummeted by 17 percent and overall investment
spending fell by 5.8 percent in terms of gross domestic fixed
capital formation. The unemployment rate rose from 2.5 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1997 to 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI), a main
inflation indicator, rose by 2.8 percent in 1998, the lowest since
the index began in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Tsang pointed out that the economic adjustment process is
expected to continue in 1999, and there are likely to be further
downward pressures on rentals, wages, prices in general, as the
economy seeks to uphold its external competitiveness against the
significant currency depreciation in most economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that a number of positive signs have emerged
locally, including improved bank liquidity, reduced interest rates,
substantial gains of share prices from the low in August last year,
stabilized property market, and improved local sentiment.

<P>
On these positive developments, he said, consumer spending may
be able to resume "a modest growth" of 2.5 percent in 1999,
against a particularly low level 1998. However, he predicted a
continued decline by around 4 percent in investment spending due
to relatively high real interest rates, tight credit availability,
corporate consolidation and slack building activity in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Relatively high unemployment, moderated income, and concern
about job security among the local workforce are likely to pose a
continued restraint, he said.
</P>
<P>
For re-exports and domestic exports combined, Tsang foresaw a
fall of 4 percent in total exports of goods for 1999 but a revival
of 2.5 percent in imports. Meanwhile, exports of services are
forecast to revive to a growth of 3 percent from a decline of 7
percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Limp to Marginally Weaker Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket limped
to a marginally weaker close Wednesday after an afternoon sell-off
wiped out substantial intra-day gains.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 2.9 points lower at 2,889.9
points after being in positive territory for most of the day and
well off its intra-day peak of 2,912.2.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials gave up 1.4 points on the day to close at
5,239.4 and all resources lost 5.2 points to 956.0.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover stood at 402.2 million shares traded for 1.191
billion Australian dollars (747.95 million U.S. dollars), with 583
falling, 499 rising and 446 steady.
</P>
<P>
Dickson's broker Jon Hancock said buying interest petered out
in the afternoon after the market had jumped mid-morning following
the strong rise in the GDP figure.
</P>
<P>
"The GDP figure had a really positive effect on the market at
lunch time but concerns about the U.S. market tonight seemed to
take over in the afternoon and we just lost it," Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
But in a generally weaker market the stronger performance from
a couple of major banks and Lend Lease stood out.
</P>
<P>
Financial services and construction behemoth Lend Lease gained
42 cents and both Westpac Bank up 17 cents, and Commonwealth Bank
25 higher, were the stars in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, market leading bank National Australia gave up
14.2 cents and ANZ lost three cents.
</P>
<P>
Market leader News Corp slipped 9.2 cents as its preferred
scrip slipped 8.3 cents.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the industrial sector, Biota Holdings recovered 65
cents after the company announced that its anti-flu drug Relenza
could be used to treat some sufferers in the United States despite
last week's denial of marketing approval in that country.
</P>
<P>
In the resource sector, BHP fell 3.2 cents, WMC eased six cents
and MIM drifted one cent.
</P>
<P>
The gold index eased 8.5 points to 982.2 points. The spot price
of gold bullion in Sydney was 286.60 U.S. dollars an ounce, which
compared to a close of 286.45 Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> New Life of Former Tibetan Serfs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I do wish I can live another 40 years," said 73-year-old
Tibetan granny Gesang when she tells stories about her present-day
prosperous and happy life.
</P>
<P>
But she could never hold back her tears when she recalled the
death of her elder sister in a former serf owner's manor 70 km
away from Lhasa more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Gesang's elder sister was given a good beating and starved to
death after being found to have taken a rest during work. "She
could have also lived a free and happy life like us if she was
still alive," said the old granny. "Shortly after my elder sister'
s death, the cruel serf system was abolished and we serfs have
ever since become masters of our own."
</P>
<P>
Gesang's family of five was then allotted two rooms, 2.6
hectares of farmland, two oxen and a dozen sheep. Gesang was
appointed as a head of township women's association of
Maizhokunggar County and became Tibet's first generation of female
cadres after the democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
The old granny's wrinkly face is full of love for the new
society. "In the past, serfs were treated as talking tools, but
now everyone enjoys full rights to participate in government and
political affairs," said Gesang," The village committee and people'
s representatives will pass on the public's opinions to concerned
government departments and will be given answers in time."
</P>
<P>
Cering, her eldest son-in-law, was elected as chairman of the
standing committee of Maizhokunggar County People's Congress in
late 1997. He publicized his home telephone number to the people
of the whole county and more than 500 local residents have
expressed their opinions or demands via his personal hotline, 80
percent of which were handled successfully.
</P>
<P>
Last month, for instance, one old herdsman phoned Cering asking
him to help control contagious diseases among cattle. After the
call, Cering took a veterinary surgeon from the county veterinary
station to the herdsman's home, prevented the spreading of the
infectious diseases and saved the herdsman from big economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
"The new and old societies are two different worlds. In old
days of Tibet, nobody would care for the state of us human beings,
not to mention that of livestock," said Granny Gesang.
</P>
<P>
Pointing at a brand-new tractor, Granny Gesang said most rural
families in Tibet now use tractors to till the farmland and some
families have bought automobiles. "It is quite different from my
days as a young person," Granny Gesang said gleefully.
</P>
<P>
Her three daughters' families have all built new houses and
have bought TV sets, refrigerators and tape recorders. Granny
Gesang usually lives a care-free life in the elder daughter's home
in the county seat of Maizhokunggar.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Merge Stock, Futures Exchanges: Tsang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will merger its two
exchanges into a single market operator in response to increasing
challenges of a globalized financial market.
</P>
<P>
In his Budget address delivered here Wednesday, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen proposed to demutualize the
exchanges and their associated clearing houses, consolidate them
into a single market operator, which will eventually operate in
the form of a listed commercial entity.
</P>
<P>
"This move will separate ownership from trading rights and
enhance competition and in turn lead to greater market innovation
and cost efficiency," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Hong Kong has two exchanges, the Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, and three clearing
houses. Hong Kong's securities and futures market has gone through
a decade of rapid growth after the 1987 global market crash.
During the period, Hong Kong stock market capitalization surged by
5.5 times to over 3 trillion HK dollars (400 billion U.S. dollars),
and annual turnover soared 19 times to nearly 4 trillion HK
dollars (512 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the financial secretary warned that Hong Kong should be
alert to the increasing challenges brought about by globalization,
such as the regulatory lacunae between domestic laws and
international flow of capital and investment.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the merger of two exchanges, Tsang proposed two
other major reforms on the securities and futures market -- to
upgrade market infrastructure and modernize regulatory framework.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen Hong Kong's position as a major world financial
center, Tang outlined a string of measures in the new Budget, such
as to strengthen banking supervision, relax the entry requirements
for foreign banks, develop the local debt market by listing
Exchange Fund Notes in the second half of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reconsidering Cease-fire Understandings With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) - Israel is considering to amend or
even abandon the understandings it reached with Lebanon in 1996 to
give the Israeli army a free hand to strike at Hezbollah
guerrillas, a Jerusalem Post daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Defense Minister Moshe Arens as saying in an
exclusive interview that the understandings are bad for the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF).
</P>
<P>
"In a large measure they tie the IDF's hands and won't allow it
to use its full capability and provide a large degree of immunity
to the Hezbollah," Arens said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understandings, reached in 1996 after Israel
launched a large-scale assault on Lebanon to punish Lebanon's
Hezbollah, or Party of God, for firing rockets on northern Israel,
bar attacks on or from civilian sites.
</P>
<P>
Arens said the understandings have created a situation in which
Hezbollah guerrillas are free to launch attacks against Israeli
military targets in south Lebanon but the Israeli army is not
free to attack their bases because most of them are in villages.
</P>
<P>
Israel often complains to the five-nation monitoring group,
which comprises representatives from Israel, Lebanon, Syria, the
United States and France, that Hezbollah fire mortar or rockets at
IDF targets from inside Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Israel would abandon the understandings, Arens said,
"it is a possibility among a number of options that we have to
look at."
</P>
<P>
The remarks came two days after Israel waged a massive
offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in retaliation for the
killing of four Israelis including a general in the so-called
security zone Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-carved 15-kilometer-deep security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Blood Samples from Afghanistan Reveal Bacteria- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The blood samples taken last
week from northern Afghanistan have revealed a bacteria which
causes severe pneumonia but not epidemics, an official from the
World Food Program said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria can cause a secondary bacterial infection in
influenza epidemics, the official said, adding these results have
not been reported publicly as they are too inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
A mysterious disease erupted in the middle of January in the
Darwaz district of Afghanistan's Badakhshan province, which has
reportedly claimed about 300 lives so far.
</P>
<P>
An experts team of the World Health Organization (WHO) has been
sent to the district to probe the causes of the eruption of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The WHO team on Tuesday sent more blood and sputum samples to
Islamabad which are being analyzed currently at the Pakistan
National Institute of Health.
</P>
<P>
The experts are for the time being calling it an influenza-like
illness with a high rate of secondary complications, mainly
pneumonia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, they do not know exactly what the disease is, why the
disease seems to be worse this year than others, or why the
mortality rate is so high, added the official.
</P>
<P>
The WHO did not give mortality figures as they do not have the
figures in, but they believe the mortality rate to be 1-2 percent
of the affected people, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The WHO team took a U.N. helicopter to the village of Jamarche
Bala last weekend where the disease was first discovered.
</P>
<P>
They interviewed the village chief and elders and searched out
cases, treated victims and collected samples.
</P>
<P>
They were told that the disease arrived in mid-January with two
young men who had been working in another village in the south.
The two men both had severe flu. Members of the chief's family as
well as people living where the men stayed also became ill.
</P>
<P>
The disease then affected 70-80 percent of the households in
the village and spread to others. Symptoms are fever, headache,
chest pain and cough, which lasted a week to ten days.
</P>
<P>
The official further said that the WHO team found the living
and sanitary conditions of households are poor with 7-20 people
living in one room. No health services are nearby and nutrition is
poor.

JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon has called on the ruling Likud and the opposition Labor
Party to join hands and set up an emergency national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported Wednesday that Sharon has proposed
the two parties establish a unity government for several months to
deal with issues of Lebanon and peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We need to set up an emergency government immediately... in
order to reach a decision on unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon
and on implementing the agreement with the Palestinians," Sharon
said.
</P>
<P>
The mounting Israeli casualties in south Lebanon have led to
growing public pressure for a unilateral troop withdrawal and the

Sharon said he has informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
of his proposal and Israel Radio has reported that Netanyahu is
in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
But the Labor Party is opposed to the proposal, saying in a
statement that the formula proves that Sharon, too, understands
now Netanyahu has failed.
</P>
<P>
"After the elections, (party leader) Ehud Barak will create a
broad government which will work with determination and courage to
fix all the failures of Netanyahu," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Israeli parliament voted overwhelmingly for
an early election after Barak rejected the last-minute call by
Netanyahu to form a unity government.

ADDIS ABABA, March 3 (Xinhua) --The Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture is undertaking construction of four major development
projects in different parts of the country during the current year
at a cost of 5.38 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gebre-Medhim Belay, head of panning and program department of
the Ministry of Agricultrue said that the projects are the
All-Africa Rinderpest Eradication Project, Tse-tse Fly Control and
Agriculture Development Project, National Livestock Researches
Project, and Second Round Forest and Genetic Resources
Registration and Plan Project, mainly focussing on livestock
development.
</P>
<P>
These projects are executed with 5.38 million U.S. dollars, of
which 800,000 U.S. dollars allocated by the Ethiopian government,
3.07 million U. S. dollars obtained in foreign aid and 1.51
million U.S. dollars secured from foreign loans, the Ethiopian
Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted Gebre- Medhim Belay as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
Gebre-Medhim Belay said that special attention is being given
to livestock development in consideration of the fact that
Ethiopia, being the first in Africa in possession of animal
resources, has not yet fully exploited livestock resources and has
not yet earned as much foreign currency from this sector.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that registration of genetic resources has been
well underway in preparation for taking stock of available
resources, which will in turn help in drawing natural resources
strategy.

statement that the formula proves that Sharon, too, understands
now Netanyahu has failed.
</P>
<P>
"After the elections, (party leader) Ehud Barak will create a
broad government which will work with determination and courage to
fix all the failures of Netanyahu," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Israeli parliament voted overwhelmingly for
an early election after Barak rejected the last-minute call by
Netanyahu to form a unity government.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Initiates E.African Regional Coffee Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya initiated the erecting of a
regional coffee auction in Nairobi with the involvement of the
countries of Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi amid efforts to
enhance regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi said on Tuesday
that Kenya was holding informal talks with these neigboring
nations on selling coffee at a regional auction just like the
successful practice of the east Africa tea auction at Kenya's
coastal city of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted Mudavadi as saying
that the idea of a centralized coffee auction had been well
received by the neighbors and traders in the regions.
</P>
<P>
But traders warned that such a plan could take time to
materialize. They said a single auction would increase
competitiveness in pricing, but technical questions including
customs and foreign currency regulations in some of the east
African states, needed to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi said the informal talks on a common coffee auction
would serve to enhance the regional cooperation as tea auction has
proved.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is carrying the reform of its coffee sector which is
expected to be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Uganda and Tanzania had expressed their desire to
sell their coffee at the Nairobi auction, which regularly attracts
premium prices and gourmet coffee seekers.

<HEADLINE> Indian Economy Affected by Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- India's economy has been
affected by economic sanctions against it by some Western
countries following its nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
During the current fiscal 1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March 31,
1999), foreign assistance to the country is likely to show a
shortfall of over 12.27 billion rupees (0.29 billion U.S.
dollars), resulting in the net external assistance falling sharply
to 9.1 billion rupees (0.22 billion dollars) against the budget
estimates of 23.37 billion rupees (0.56 billion dollars), a
government official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The biggest shortfall has been in the case of the World Bank,
which has failed to provide a major portion of the expected
assistance during the current financial year. India had expected
to receive the World Bank's assistance of 15.27 billion rupees
(0.37 billion dollars), yet it had only received 6.26 billion
rupees (0.15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
India's two major donors, Japan and Germany, also provided less
that what was expected. The shortfall in case of Japan was as high
as 3.78 billion rupees (0.09 billion dollars) while 1.17 billion
rupees (0.03 billion dollars) did not come from Germany, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall in assistance has also occurred in case of grants
and commodity assistance. Against the budget estimates of
receiving 10.53 billion rupees (0.25 billion dollars) during the
current financial year, actual inflow is expected to be only 8.12
billion rupees (0.20 billion dollars). This figure is likely to go
down further to 7.15 billion rupees (0.17 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, India's repayment obligations are rising.
Against an estimated total repayment of 76.57 billion rupees (1.84
billion dollars) during 1998-99, the actual repayment is likely to
end up slightly higher at 78.56 billion rupees (1.89 billion
dollars). In the coming year, the repayments are expected to go up
even higher to 81.55 billion rupees (1.96 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg to Eliminate City Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Johannesburg, the biggest
metropolis in southern Africa, has embarked on a major campaign to
get rid of the city' s huge debt which severely hampered the
city's management efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Greater Johannesburg is to appoint a chief financial
officer within the next few days to take charge of a revamp plan,
which is expected to bring the city's deficit to zero and also
balance its budget by 2002, South African media reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, named Igoli 2002, was unveiled last week by the city,
which is heading for a deficit of 257 million Rand (43 million
U.S. Dollars) by the end of the 1998/99 budget year.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Moloi, the newly appointed transformation manager of the
Greater Johannesburg, said the new chief financial officer would
have to develop and implement financial policies and disciplines
that would lead the city back to financial viability.
</P>
<P>
The chief financial officer would be appointed on a two-year
performance- linked contract, Moloi said.
</P>
<P>
The city council would meet union bosses and other stakeholders
in the next week to discuss the plan's major issues, Moloi said.
</P>
<P>
Non-core assets such as Rand airport, the Johannesburg Fresh
Produce Market, the Johannesburg and Orlando stadia and the
council's housing stock are to be sold to recoup millions that the
city is losing.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg is also expected to appoint a labor relations
officer to create unified labor relations structures and
practices.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts on local government voiced their doubt on
the efficiency of the plan. One expert said local government was
facing a financial crisis because most residents were not paying
for their municipal services, such as water and electricity.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to build World-Class Cyberport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong plans to spend 13
billion HK dollars (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) developing a world-
class cyberport starting from 2002, according to Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the Budget for 1999-2000 on Wednesday, Tsang said
the cyberport will provide the essential infrastructure and a
working and living environment of the highest standard for the
formation of a strategic cluster of top international information
services companies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsang, the development of the cyberport will
provide 12,000 vacancies in full operation, and 4,000 construction
jobs when it is being built.
</P>
<P>
In his Policy Address last October, Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa set out the target of developing Hong Kong into an innovation
center for Southern China and beyond, and put forward specific
initiatives to achieve the target.
</P>
<P>
In line with this target and the need to meet the challenges of
the 21st Century, Tsang said, Hong Kong must identify its
strengths and develop its own niche by exploiting the strengths of
the city's sophisticated telecommunications network, strong
intellectual property rights protection regime, and the progress
in making electronic transactions secure.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsang, the cyberport will need to provide a state-
of-the-art optical fiber network, a broad-band facility with high
speed access to the rest of the world. It will also provide
multimedia, educational, entertainment and retail facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Cyberport development will have to rely largely on the
expertise and entrepreneurial spirit of the private sector, Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he is "extremely pleased" that a number of
international companies have expressed their interests in becoming
anchor tenants of the Cyberport.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary said the funding of the project will
mainly come from private investment and the project will be
commissioned in phases starting from 2002.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Japan Exchange Loan Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Japan Wednesday
exchanged notes for 107.695 billion Japanese yen (about 888.684
million U.S. dollars) loan to finance key projects which will
assist Malaysia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed signed the agreement
for the Malaysian government at the Treasury here while Japan was
represented by its ambassador to Malaysia Issei Nomura.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Finance Ministry the loan
will be used to finance Malaysia's look-east policy education
program, the development of University Malaysia Sarawak, the
construction of Beris dam in Kedah, the rehabilitation of the
Port Dickson power station and to provide funds to small and
medium scale industries.
</P>
<P>
This loan is directed at strengthening the industrial base,
improving the quality of human resource and the environment which
contributes to the country's sustained development in the long
term, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The latest disbursement is also part of the 594.1 billion yen
(4.9 billion dollars) loan extended to date to Malaysia under
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia first received loans under the OECF in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad met his Japanese's
counterpart Keizo Obuichi in Hanoi last year, where the latter
pledged 117 billion yen (about 965.2 million dollars) to Malaysia
for seven projects.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of loan notes Wednesday was for five projects
while funding for the remaining two projects which is a higher
education loan fund and the Pahang-Selangor raw water transfer
project will be concluded in the near future, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Redouble Efforts to Boost Tourism: Tsang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will redouble its
efforts to consolidate its position as Asia's most popular tourist
destination, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the Budget for 1999-2000, Tsang said Hong Kong, in
cooperation with the Walt Disney Company, will plan the
construction of a major theme park on reclaimed land at North
Lantau and grant a 500-million-HK-dollar (64.1 million U.S.
dollars) loan to the Ocean Park for redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsang, tourism has long been a mainstay of the
Hong Kong economy and total travel and tourism receipts in 1998
amounted to 55 billion HK dollars (7.1 billion U.S. dollars),
contributing 4 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"Our assessment is that the development of a Disney project in
Hong Kong would bring substantial economic benefits," Tsang said,
adding that such a theme park would help boost the economy by
directly or indirectly creating thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong and the Disney Company have "reached a common
understanding" and the signing of a comprehensive project
agreement is envisaged if the outcome of the negotiations for the
project is positive.
</P>
<P>
After the redevelopment for the Ocean Park, Hong Kong's most
popular tourist resort, the Waterworld of the park will be
replaced by a new theme area, "Adventure Bay," housing a new
dolphinarium, a new water ride and high quality food and retail
services, Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Improve Public Sector Efficiency, Tsang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will reform its civil
service and review the mode of delivering public services as part
of its effort to improve public sector efficiency, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In releasing the Budget for 1999-2000, Tsang said Hong Kong
will launch major civil service forms, strengthen its result-
oriented and service-based culture, freeze salaries in 1999 and
institute a general freeze on hiring to the permanent
establishment.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will achieve 818-million-HK-dollar (105 million U.S.
dollars) productivity gains in the public sector through an
Enhanced Productivity Program in 1999-2000, three quarters of
which will be devoted to new or improved services, according to
Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will also privatize a substantial minority share of
the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation through an initial
public offering, the financial secretary said, adding that the
government will remain the major shareholder of the company.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the government will "critically re-examine" the mode
of delivering public services, and maximize the room for the
private sector participation.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsang, 189,000 civil servants and another 140,000
employees of government-subsidized organizations are subject to
the civil service or equivalent pay scales.
</P>
<P>
"We need to pay public servants reasonably and sufficiently in
order to induce suitable talent to join the service. But we must
also prevent civil service pay outstripping private sector pay,"
Tsang said, adding that a number of measures should be taken
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary explained that the original reasons for
100 percent government ownership of the MTR, a mass transit system
second to none, are no longer valid, and the introduction of
private ownership will reinforce the MTRC's commitment to
competitiveness and efficiency, and will broaden the corporation's
access to funds and reduce its reliance on government equity
injection or loans for future development.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa announced in his 1998
Policy Address that the public sector would embark on an Enhanced
Productivity Program (EPP). Tsang said he is "impressed" by the
public servants' responsiveness to EPP and their enthusiasm in
coming up with productivity gains of over 800 million HK dollars (
103 million U.S. dollars) in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that, like the rest of the community, the
public sector should take full advantage of the recession to
strengthen its fundamentals," Tsang said, adding that "this will
help sharpen Hong Kong's competitiveness."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Won't Get OIC Support: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will not
get the international support it is seeking, particularly from the
influential Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
"Any foreign government that supports the MILF will be
interfering with the internal affairs of the Philippine government
aside from contradicting the position of the OIC," Presidential
Spokesman Jerry Barican said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the OIC will maintain its position against
meddling in the affairs of any country, particularly those that
are not actual members of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The only OIC-recognized Muslim group in the Philippines is the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which signed a peace accord
with the government two years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports indicated that the MILF has been silently
working to gain the support of Islamic governments worldwide, by
approaching diplomats from sympathetic Islamic countries, in an
effort to gain backing for their quest for an independent state in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the OIC will not support the MILF, considering the
international organization's track record in assisting the
Philippines in getting the Muslims to join the mainstream of
society, instead of backing their cause to set up a Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
"We have a peace process in Mindanao that is being implemented
through the 1996 GRP (government of the Republic of the
Philippines)-MNLF Peace Agreement, the signing of which was
facilitated by the OIC," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He added that as the government's peace talks with the MILF are
purely an internal matter of the Philippines, the OIC will respect
the government's policy against treating the Muslim rebellion as
an international issue that requires the intervention of any
international group.

<HEADLINE> Unusual Heat Spells Ruin for S. African Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South African farmers could
face total crop failure if drought conditions continue to persist
across the country, South African media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For two days, Johannesburg, the biggest city in the country,
recorded 32 degrees Celsius, the highest recorded for March since
1973. Pretoria's Monday high of 35.4 degrees was the highest in
the area for March in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The Weather Bureau in Pretoria, which described the high
temperature as a heat wave, said relief in the form of rain was
unlikely for the rest of this month.
</P>
<P>
South African Agricultural Union said Tuesday it was assessing
the situation. It said many farmers would not continue farming if
they have total crop failure.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who relied on summer rainfall for their crops had
initially predicted a good year as there had been good early
summer rains.
</P>
<P>
However, since mid-January there had been almost no rain, and
the dry period has lasted longer than farmers had expected.
</P>
<P>
In the Northern Cape in the west of the country, there has been
no rain for two months and daily high temperatures have virtually
knocked out the cattle grazing area, the union said. Prime crop
areas in the Free State, Gauteng in the northeast, have also been
adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
Total crop failure could have a major impact on economic
activity, resulting in an increase in imports and a loss of
potential exports, and a rise in produce prices, the union said.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said the hot weather being experienced was
originating from Mozambique and central Africa, and the heat was
on a continental-scale.

MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Human rights victims during the

<HEADLINE> New Life of Former Tibetan Serfs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"One year ago, I spent money on building a villa-like house
that is comparable to the manor of any former serf owner," said
the 65-year-old Tibetan woman, pointing to her well decorated 200-
sq-m dwelling.
</P>
<P>
She puts her farm machines in the 100-odd sq m courtyard and
keeps more than 100 head of sheep and seven oxen in the two old
bungalows allotted during the democratic reform in 1959.
</P>
<P>
When recalling her life as a serf before Tibet's democratic
reform in 1959, Cering Zhoigar said that at that time she and her
parents did not have one inch of land belonging to themselves and
had to rely on renting land from the serf owner and borrowing
usurious loans to support the whole family.
</P>
<P>
By 1959, her family was heavily debt-ridden. "Without the
democratic reform, even several generations of my family could
never have repaid those loans," said the Tibetan woman.
</P>
<P>
Cering Zhoigar has a family of six which looks after a 25-mu (
about 1.67 hectares) of farmland and has a harvest of about 10,000
kg of grain annually, coupled with income from rearing livestock
and running other sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"The grain now kept in stock at my house is able to sustain the
whole family for several years running," said Cering Zhoigar. To
celebrate the new year according to the Tibetan calendar, the
family specially slaughtered one yak, two sheep, and made a great
amount of light refreshments and barley wine. Cering Zhoigar also
sent her son to buy new clothes, vegetables and candies from Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"Celebrating the new year is just a traditional practice, we
are actually enjoying similar abundant life every day," added
Cering Zhoigar.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the controllable income of urban families
in Tibet was 5,400 yuan, while per capita net income of farmers
and herdsmen reached 1,100 yuan. And average living space for
farmers and herdsmen is 20 sq m, and 14 sq m for urban residents,
both higher than the national average.

year and solve the demarcation issue on the Beibu Gulf by year
2000, to build a peaceful, friendly and stable border.
</P>
<P>
 China also signed agreements with the three countries on
economic and technological co-operation by exploring new ways of
reinforcing economic and trade ties that will give a new impetus
to economic collaboration with the three in the new international

countries has always been a mainstay of Chinese diplomacy and the

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Powers Ahead on Strong Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Strong growth in the last quarter
of 1998 pleased the Australian dollar Wednesday, helping it put on
almost half a U.S. cent.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product figures indicated the Australian economy
grew by 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter and did not need a push
along from the Reserve Bank of Australia in the form of a rate
cut.
</P>
<P>
The result was well above the market's forecast of a 0.6
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
After jumping to 62.60 U.S. cents in the wake of the figure
release, the Australian dollar closed at 62.53, up from Tuesday
night's close of 62.08.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the risk for the Australian dollar from here is
most likely to the upside although it was having trouble
successfully breaking through the 62.50-U.S.-cent level.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 0.5724 euro from 0.5701 and
the euro was trading at 1.0916 U.S. dollars from 1.0890.

The Australian dollar was also buying 75.53 Japanese yen from

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Criticizes U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. human rights report for
1998 failed to reflect the actual situation in Lebanon, Marwan
Fares, the head of the Lebanese parliament's Human Rights
Committee said.
</P>
<P>
He said the report did not take into consideration the
remarkable progress Lebanon has made in safeguarding human rights,
according to the Daily Star published on Wednesday
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is emerging from a civil war and has been working to
protect and improve the people's human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that of all the Arab countries, only Lebanon and
Kuwait have parliamentary committees to specifically address
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the U.S. State Department Friday
criticized Beirut for human rights violations in many areas,
including substandard prison conditions and excessive Syrian
influence over the country's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Fares said the major problem with the report is what it leaves
out, such as the fact of lower crime incidence in Lebanon than in
most countries, including the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"This was demonstrated during the municipal elections and the
presidential elections which were held last year," he said,
adding that these are a proof of democracy in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the report for neglecting to mention the
"extraordinary job" Lebanon has done in eliminating the
production of drugs in the country's eastern area of Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the U.S. government for failing to honor its
promise to offer support to Lebanese farmers after they gave up
growing drugs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Suffers From Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is suffering from a serious
nationwide water shortage and drought caused by weather changes,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Average temperature in Vietnam in recent months was 0.5-1.5
centigrade degrees higher than usual and average rainfall was 30
percent to 50 percent, and in some places even 70 percent to 80
percent less than the average in previous years, said VNA.
</P>
<P>
Water flows in rivers are still 20 percent to 40 percent less
than the average, thus lowering the water levels in most
reservoirs. The only exception is Vietnam's central and southern
central areas which were hit by repeated tropical storms late last
year and cold spells and heavy rains in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage has mainly affected Vietnam's mountainous
northern provinces of Son La, Hoa Binh, Ha Tay, Vinh Phuc, Ha
Giang, Bac Can, Thai Nguyen and Bac Giang, central provinces of
Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, and the northern central highlands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, VNA said, salt water has strongly affected some
southern provinces due to declining water flow in the region's
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Water flows in rivers nationwide are continuing to fall in
March and are about 20 percent to 50 percent lower than the levels
recorded at this time in previous years.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister/Armed
Forces (ABRI) Chief Gen. Wiranto Wednesday announced that Maluku
Police chief Col. Karyono will be replaced immediately.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, however, did not mention who will replace Karyono or
Karyono's new position.
</P>
<P>
Karyono is the second provincial police chief to be replaced
after that of West Kalimantan province, who was dismissed after
the province was also hit by riots.
</P>
<P>
Ambon, capital of Maluku province, has been rocked by bloody
riots since January 19, which have killed more than 100 people,
injured about 500 others -- many of them were reportedly Muslims
-- and damaged hundreds of public facilities and houses.
</P>
<P>
Reports on Tuesday indicated that some Muslims were shot dead
by police officers during sectarian clashes in Ahuru. Some reports
circulated to the effect that a number of people were shot at dawn
prayers inside a mosque in Ahuru early on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto told reporters that the ABRI will send a brigade
consisting of three battalions and a combat engineer to Ambon to
settle the dispute there which has inclined to religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the brigade would be engaged in a peaceful action. "The
task is to bring peace, and not -- say it -- attacking or
emasculating the people's rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto further said he would investigate the riots erupting in
Ambon.
</P>
<P>
"I ask for a thorough examination. If there is an apparatus
involved or taking sides with a certain group, I ask (the alleged
apparatus be) examined and (served with) stiff measures, including
their leaders," he said before attending a limited cabinet meeting
here Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Geared Up for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police have prepared a
contingency plan in case Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat unilaterally declares an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Wednesday that Israeli
police forces have begun intensive training to prepare for the
possible implementation of the plan, code-named "Magic of the
Melody."
</P>
<P>
The training courses for snipers and border police units
include practice in riot control, the firing of weapons for
dispersing demonstrators and combat in open terrain, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Border policemen will also be trained with armored personnel
carriers and conduct joint maneuvers with the army, it said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly said he will declare a Palestinian state
on May 4, the deadline by which Israel and the Palestinians should
negotiate a permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank still
under its control in response to such declaration.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said Israeli security forces are preparing to deal
with a number of extreme scenarios that could result from a
Palestinian declaration.
</P>
<P>
One of these scenarios is that Palestinian policemen in Area A
which is under their complete control, could open fire on Areas B
and C, which are under partial or complete Israeli control
respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Another scenario envisions shots being fired at Jewish
neighborhoods from Abu Dis in East Jerusalem, where the
Palestinian Parliament is planned.
</P>
<P>
But only sporadic disturbances will occur in East Jerusalem,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Work of Ninth CPPCC National Committee Outstanding (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's top advisory body achieved
outstanding successes in 1998, the first year of its five-year
term, a senior leader of the advisory body said here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the top advisory body of the
ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and the central government,
or the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said this when he addressed the
opening session of the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the National
Committee conscientiously followed the guidelines of the 15th CPC
National Congress and earnestly exercised its functions of
political consultation, democratic supervision and participation
in running state affairs," he said in his work report of the
Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 was a year in which the people of all ethnic
groups in China, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at its core, followed the guidelines of the 15th
CPC National Congress, withstood severe tests and scored new
achievements in reforms and economic development," Ye told the
more than 2,000 members of the CPPCC National Committee at the
opening session of the second annual session, which is expected to
last eight days.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee in the past year has made active
contributions to maintaining stability and promoting China's
reforms, opening-up and the socialist modernization drive through
various means, including participating in running state affairs,
conducting investigations of special issues, taking part in the
country's fight against the worst summer flooding in decades and
in the disaster relief endeavor, and reporting what people are
concered about to the central authorities, said Ye.

<P>
In China's struggle against the devastating flooding last
summer, Ye said, CPPCC organizations at all levels, along with
political parties, organizations and people of all ethnic groups
and circles participating in the CPPCC, had showed their concern
for the people and their eagerness to help solve the country's
problems by taking part in and supporting the fight against the
floods and the relief endeavor in various ways.
</P>
<P>
"During this struggle, the principal leaders of the CPPCC
National Committee went to the forefront of the fight at the
Yangtze River to inspect the flooding-hit areas and salute the
flood-fighting soldiers and civilians, while local CPPCC
committees at all levels in the flooded areas, in accordance with
unified plans made by the local Party committees and government
authorities, took charge of defending designated sections of dikes
of the rivers and led the people in fighting the floods and
dealing with emergencies," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee members residing in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Macao played an active
role in donating money and relief materials to the flood-hit areas,
while the CPPCC National Committee's General Office, along with
other relevant departments, hosted a benefit performance
participated by CPPCC members, bringing in domestic and overseas
donations worth more than 240 million yuan for the flood victims,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye, the Ninth CPPCC National Committee in the past
year has intensified its efforts to report social conditions and
popular sentiments to the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
"Constantly working to improve its information network, the
CPPCC National Committee solicited opinions and suggestions from
its members, as well as from participating organizations and local
committees of the CPPCC, and faithfully reported them to the Party
Central Committee and the State Council via the CPPCC Information
Journal and other channels. This plays an important role in
helping the CPC and the central government to understand popular
sentiment and pool the wisdom of the people," he said.

<P>
During the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee,
Ye said, members attentively listened to and discussed the
Government Work Report, heard the program for restructuring the
institutions under the State Council, and put forward many
important views and suggestions concerning matters of vital
importance in China's reforms and development.
</P>
<P>
"They continued to pay close attention to the major issues of
concern to the government and the people after the session was
concluded, putting forward many constructive ideas concerning
issues such as re-employment of workers laid off from the state-
owned enterprises, implementation of the strategy to reinvigorate
China through science, technology and education, agriculture and
rural work, harnessing of major rivers and lakes, and development
and use of water resources," he added.
</P>
<P>
Many of these ideas have been adopted by the CPC Central
Committee and the central government in their decision-making
process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that giving full play to the basic role of
various special committees under the CPPCC National Committee and
strengthening their regular participation in running state affairs
was a significant feature of the CPPCC work last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a number of former Party and government
leading officials and experts and scholars from various fields
entered the Ninth CPPCC National Committee, various special
committees under the National Committee have been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, in line with the spirit of the 15th CPC
National Congress concerning the adoption of a sustainable
development strategy in China's modernization drive, the National
Committee formed a special Committee of Population, Resources and
Environment.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the Ninth CPPCC Standing Committee,
all the special committees got off to a fast start and began their
work from a higher starting point, rapidly coalescing into a
situation which was both active and orderly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, he said, the special committees have
organized 51 special investigations and submitted 45 investigation
reports to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council for
reference.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sets Deadline for Drawing Year 2000 Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippines critical sectors are
required to submit their respective contingency plans against the
millennium bug to the Presidential Commission on Year 2000
compliance by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Amable R. Aguiluz, chairman of the commission, said on
Wednesday that seven mission critical sectors are the utilities,
telecommunications, transportation, finance, healthcare,
manufacturing and government services.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a national contingency plan will be
formulated on the basis of the individual plans submitted and the
deadline for the national plan is by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Augiluz said that the commission only has a fund of 1.7 million
pesos (about 43.59 million U.S. dollars) but it would be needing
100 million pesos (2.56 million dollars) for all its activities.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that no money will be coming from the
president's contingency funds since the Y2K (year 2000) problem
has been recognized as a national security threat by the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Karim L. Bangcola, executive director of the
Y2K commission, said that all sectors will also be required to set
up an action center to handle complaints and inquiries that may
arise before and during the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern is the awareness of the general public on the
real consequence of the millennium bug," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Motherland Has Roots in Hearts of Tibetan People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Tibet has always been an
indisputable territory of China and the overwhelming majority of
the Tibetan people cherish their motherland.
</P>
<P>
Since ancient times right up to the present day, the Tibetan
people have tied their fate to China's reunification and like the
Himalayas, the diligent and brave Tibetan people have devoted
their efforts to safeguarding the integrity of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the 19th and 20th century, Tibetans in Gyangze
County rose to fight against foreign invaders and many of them
devoted their lives to protect the country.
</P>
<P>
This was especially so during the three-month war which started
in June 1904 when people of various nationalities in Gyangze
united to resist the British invaders. Facing the stronger forces
of the enemy and short of ammunition and food, many of the Gyangze
people preferred to die rather than surrender and thus many did,
heroically.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the Gyangze War, in 1961 the Chinese State
Council declared the site of the struggle against the British
invaders in Gyangze County as a state-class protected area.
</P>
<P>
Gyipug Puncogcedain, vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, said that the Tibetan people have made great contributions
to the reunification of China and to the flourishing of China's
economy."
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old vice-chairman's grandfather Gyipug Ruben was an
officer in the Tibetan frontier guard force in 1904 and was
wounded in the war against the foreign aggressors.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gyipug Puncogcedain added, "Inspired by the heroes of the
Gyangze War, the Tibetan people over many generations have been
determined to safeguard the integrity of China's territory."
</P>
<P>
With peaceful liberation carried out in Tibet in 1951 and
democratic reform in 1959, the Tibetan people finally rid
themselves of the imperialist yoke. China's national flag, the
Five-Starred Red Flag, has become deeply rooted in the hearts of
all Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
In Yadong County, which was invaded by the heinous Brits, on
the third day of every Tibetan Lunar New Year, all local residents
gather with a Hada (white silk, which is a Tibetan greeting gift)
to attend a ceremony where China's national flag is raised.
</P>
<P>
On the northern Tibet Prairie, whenever there is a grand
gathering or ceremony to greet guests, a team of horse-riders with
the national flag is a conspicuous sight right up front.
</P>
<P>
At the midnight on June 30, 1997 when the grand ceremony for
Hong Kong's return to China was taking place, all over the Tibet
Autonomous Region people gathered to watch TV or listen to radio
reports of the event. With singing and dancing, the Tibetans and
the people of other ethnic groups set off firecrackers to
celebrate Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1998 when huge floods devastated the Yangtze
and Songhua rivers, the Tibetan people donated more than 2.3
million yuan to the flood victims in those inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi Zhoima, an official from Lhasa City, donated 300 yuan
alone to the flood-hit areas. She said that her donation
represents the concerns that ordinary Tibetans have for other
people in the inland areas. Tibetans regard the difficulties of
the inland Han people as their own, she noted, adding that both
peoples (Han and Tibetan) should help each other in fighting
natural calamities.

western Uganda by Rwandan Interahamwe rebels, BBC reported
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of information with the U.S. Embassy to
Uganda, who prefers not to be named, confirmed this in a telephone
interview with Xinhua Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. team arrived Tuesday evening, but did not give
the exact number or the whereabouts of the Federal Bureau of
Intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
About 150 heavily-armed Rwandan Interahamwe rebels reportedly
attacked the tourists and abducted 32 of them in the Bwindi
Impenetrable Forest on Monday morning. Seventeen later escaped and
some were released. The foreign tourists mainly came from Britain,
the U.S. and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here said that the rebels targets U.S.
and British nationals because they thought the two countries
backed the Tutsi government of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The BBC report said that some survivors and the bodies of the
dead have been brought to Kampala's main hospital, but it said
that there is not yet information concerning when they will be
flown out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bwindi Impenetrable Forest has been of the few national
parks where tourists can get a glimpse of mountain gorillas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-English, Japanese Versions of Confucius' Analects Printed on Silk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Lun Yu, a collection of major
doctrines and sayings of Confucius (551-479 BC), the prominent
educator and philosopher of ancient China, was printed on silk
with English and Japanese translations respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 2,550 copies of the special silk edition of Lun Yu were
published to mark the 2,550th anniversary of Confucius' birthday.
</P>
<P>
Confucius did not author any books himself. Lun Yu, a book
about his discourses and acts, comprises notes taken by his
disciples when the master was giving lectures and his students'
discussions of his instructions after his death. Many of his
sayings recorded in Lun Yu are on the importance of moral
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The silk edition has been designated as a gift by the
organizing committee of the '99 World Horticulture Exposition to
be held in southwest China's Kunming City.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Like to Supply Blood, Not Enough Marrow Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Residents of China's most
populous city arehappy to freely give their blood but somewhat
hesitate to donate bone marrow, which doctors say slims down the
chances of finding help for leukemia sufferers.
</P>
<P>
 Only 6,381 persons asked to be registered by the Shanghai
Marrow Bank, which tries to find hope for leukemia victims, and
other kinds of blood diseases, by finding a match, and thus, maybe,
a cure.
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, a marrow bank should have a profile of 100,000
to 200,000 donors since China has about 40,000 new leukemia
patients each year," said Zhang Gongliang at the Shanghai Blood
Center.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent poll among 6,400 people in Shanghai found
that 78 percent of them have no problems about donating blood,
considering it a social responsibility or a deed of love, said
today's "Wenhui Daily".
</P>
<P>
Almost half of those surveyed have donated blood, and nearly 90
percent agreed that it was harmless, according to the survey
conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Office of Blood Donation.
</P>
<P>
Like other parts of China, Shanghai has been encouraging more
people to donate blood free since a related national law went into
effect last October. Health authorities hope this will help meet
the demand for clinically-used blood in hospitals and curb
diseases transmitted through unsafe blood, such as hepatitis and
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, the Shanghai residents shun bone marrow donation, even
though it supposedly as harmless an act as giving blood, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Also in Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu, marrow banks have
failed to register enough donors as a result of a long-standing
Chinese belief that donating marrow is harmful to one's health.

NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has taken
over the management of the Lokichoggio airstrip following
President Daniel Moi ordered last week that flights by
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) into the small airport be
monitored.
</P>
<P>
Lokichoggio of Rift Valley Province is the main transit point
for international relief delivered to southern Sudan. More than 50

registered.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the takeover of the airstrip is announced by
Kenyan Minister of State Marsden Madoka Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Iran, UAE Urged to Settle Islands Dispute Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has called for a
peaceful settlement of the dispute between Iran and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) over three islands in the Gulf, the Kuwait
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The protracted question of Iran's occupation of the islands of
Abu Mousa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs should be resolved with
wisdom, Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Defense and Aviation Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony to present awards of
King Faisal charitable institute, Sultan expressed Riyadh's wish
that the outstanding problem would be solved by means "of wisdom,
vision and without causing troubles."
</P>
<P>
He didn't indicate whether the issue was discussed during his
meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi, who arrived
in Saudi Arabia Tuesday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, which are claimed by both Iran and the UAE,
have been the center of a long-standing dispute between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has repeatedly called on Iran to accept dialogue or
international arbitration to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi last Saturday lodged protests against Iran over its
recent opening of a new town hall on Abu Mousa and said that
Tehran was attempting to change the demographic nature of the
island.
</P>
<P>
The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has extended
support to the UAE in its dispute over the islands with Iran.
</P>
<P>
GCC Secretary General Jamil Hujailan said last Saturday that
Iran's fresh move on Abu Mousa is damaging relations with its Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.

<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International Education
Exhibition is scheduled for March 13 to 18 in the cities of
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
It is being sponsored by the Chinese Service Center for
Overseas Study and will accommodate more than 100 colleges and
universities from nearly 20 countries, which will answer inquiries
from Chinese who are interested in studying abroad. They will also
provide information about China's education policies.
</P>
<P>
An official at the center said this is the largest
international education exhibition to be held in China and will
certainly be a good way to help Chinese learn more about education
here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education reports that China has more than 3
million students graduating from high school annually, but only a
third of them have the opportunity to pursue further study in
Chinese institutions of higher learning and experts say that it is
quite natural therefore for high school grads to set their eyes on
university studies overseas.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Japan, Australia, and some other countries have
already held education exhibitions in China previously.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The price of cooking oil has gone
up by 12.5 percent with immediate effect, Zimbabwean Industry and
Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira said that this is a reasonable increase when
considering the hikes in the prices of input costs, the daily
Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said the government will gazette the
prices of bread and flour this week.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet has agreed to lower the prices of bread and
flour but millers and bakers defied the directive not to increase
prices.
</P>
<P>
"We will maintain the price as it was on February 1," he said,
adding that an agreed level of nine percent increase will be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
Millers increased their prices by 16.5 percent on February 1
and by another 20 percent on March 1.
</P>
<P>
The minister ordered all millers and bakers to withdraw the
price increases on flour and bread, saying they had been allowed a
22 percent hike last October.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's inflation rate has gone up by 750 percent over the
past decade, a situation that entailed a fall in the value of the
country's assets and people's living standards, banking officials
warned.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Pests-Disease Experts Call for Disease Control By Getting Rid of Pests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese disease control experts
are warning of the possibility of epidemics caused by an increase
in the number of flies, mosquitoes, and rats due to the warm
winter weather.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Shanghai Disease Control Center have
monitored 200 stations around the city and found flies and
mosquitoes breeding a month earlier than in previous years and say
the numbers could increase dramatically, the Wenhui Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Patriotic Hygiene Campaign Committee also predicts
that the number of rats could increase because temperatures this
winter were much higher than normal and they have urged people to
get rid of pests and rats.
</P>
<P>
Spring is a breeding season for mosquitoes, said Tang Zhenhua,
of the Shanghai Research Institute of Entomology. Because flies
and mosquitoes can produce millions of offspring and a rat can
produce several hundred in the summer time they need to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes can transmit encephalitis B, malaria, dengue fever
and filariasis and flies often carry dysentery bacillus, while
rats could increase the risk of epidemic hemorrhagic fever.
</P>
<P>
Various pesticides are available in the stores of Shanghai and
sales are reported on the rise in recent days, but the newspaper
said that local people should learn the correct method to use
pesticides to avoid environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Tang's institute is doing genetic research on pests' resistance
to certain insecticides, the Shanghai-based newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Travelers Pack Rail Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- This year's massive surge in
festive railway travel has put an end to the rather quiet spell
experienced by the rail network over the last few years at this
particular time of the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that passenger figures broke all records this
traditional Spring Festival when a staggering 4.21 million and 4.
04 million people traveled by train in China on February 22 and 23,
almost 1 million more than on comparable days (in the Chinese
lunar calendar) last year.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival period is always a high season for
traveling within the country and since rail transportation remains
the Chinese people's most favored mode of long-distance travel,
the burden on trains is usually unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
Festive transportation started on February 1, which was
designated by the Ministry of Railways. Today's Economic Daily
reported that in the first 25 days of this hectic period, railway
passengers reached 747 million, an increase of 7.9 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Railway officials project another peak taking place around
today, which is the 16th of the Chinese Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The 15th day after Lunar New Year is considered the end of the
Spring Festival by Chinese people and many who have traveled
outside return to their original departure points shortly after.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reasons for the sudden surge in this year's
festive rail travel, the newspaper noted that people take the week-
long holiday to visit families or travel to tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
As living standards improve, travel and tourism is rising on
the Chinese people's priority lists. Special trains to carry
passengers to and from major tourist attractions in the southern
parts of China, such as Guilin, Shenzhen and Ningbo, were almost
fully booked. As a result, regular trains were even more packed
because some people could not get on a special train.
</P>
<P>
The flow of migrant workers swelled simply because more of them
are working in cities away from their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
As more investments were made in infrastructure and with more
construction going on all over China, the number of such workers
has risen tremendously in the last year. In addition, as a result
of the severe floods occurred at the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze and along the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers in the
northeast last year, many farmers left their hometowns to work in
cities where they hoped there maybe more job opportunities for
them.

JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 foreign observers led
by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, are scheduled to visit
Indonesia from June 3 to 7 to monitor the country's general
election, an Indonesian senior lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Their visit to Indonesia is aimed at monitoring the process of
the implementation of the June 7 general election in the country
as they did in other countries, Indonesian senior lawyer Dr. T.
Mulya Lubis said in Surabaya, capital of East Java province, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Lubis, former chairman of the Indonesian
Foundation of Legal Aid Services, the visit of the international
observers to monitor the general election should have a positive
impact, because if the general election is not conducted in an
honest and fair way, it will have influence on international and
national relationships.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, they are not permitted to make an intervention, but
only monitor the implementation of the general election. However,
their opinion on the result of the implementation of general
elections will have a positive impact," Antara News Agency
Wednesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The June general election will elect a new 500-strong House of
Representatives, whose members will be part of the 700-strong
People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative
body that will select the next president.

<HEADLINE> Writethrough: Thai Official Faces More Obstacles for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi is facing more obstacles to secure the World
Trade Organization (WTO) top post after the United States snubbed
his bid again.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials traveling with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to Thailand said Supachai was not Washington's first
choice for the job.
</P>
<P>
Albright flew into Chiang Mai in northern Thailand from Beijing
on Tuesday. She will arrive in Bangkok later today for talks with
Thai government officials. Thailand's bid for the WTO top post is
expected to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Members of the largest world trade body have been busy choosing
a new director-general to replace Italian Renato Ruggiero, whose
term expires at the end of April. Supachai, also commerce
minister, is reportedly the front-runner but the decision has been
delayed by a lack of consensus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United States had indicated its refusal to back
Supachai despite Thailand's persistent lobbying. Thailand hopes to
use Albright's visit to raise a range of issues and continue to
DPA121SPE007S03PEQL13:3813:381302
lobby Washington to back Supachai, Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the reaffirmation of the U.S. refusal during
Albright's visit to Thailand would make Supachai's bid more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
"We've indicated a preference for Canadian Roy Maclaren and New
Zealand's Mike Moore based on the fact that their policy views and
their vision of the WTO are more 'compatible' with ours," said a
senior U.S. state department official traveling with Albright.
</P>
<P>
"We have told the Thais we have very high regards for Supachai,
but it's a question of policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
News reaching here said former Moroccan trade minister Hassan
Abouyoub, another candidate for the WTO post, was officially
reported to be gaining ground in the four-man contest for the
post.
</P>
<P>
According to preferences expressed by 118 of the WTO's
currently 133 member countries, Abouyoub is the first choice for
35 of them, only four behind Supachai.
</P>
<P>
But in what diplomats said could a better indicator of the
final outcome in a process to be decided by consensus, Moore
surged further ahead at the top of the second choice list.
</P>
<P>
The results of the latest soundings in a contest which has
already missed two deadlines and looks set to miss a third were
delivered to a special session of the WTO's ruling General
Council.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that Supachai, long the seeming favorite,
had lost one first preference to hold 39 while Abouyoub, backed by
DPA122WNE018S02PEQL13:3813:391375
Francophone and many Arab countries, had added a further 12 to his
total of 23 six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Third in the first preference list was Maclaren with 23 and
fourth Moore with 21.
</P>
<P>
But the second preference list was headed by Moore with 32
against 26 in January, followed by Supachai with 23, four up on
the last survey. Both had "a wide base" of support from around the
world, according to a report by the General Council.
</P>
<P>
The General Council Chairman Ali Said Mchumo of Tanzania would
begin efforts immediately to narrow down the candidate list
although none of the four have so far given any indication they
are ready to pull out.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said earlier that he gave himself no more than a 50
percent chance of winning the WTO top post.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, although facing mounting difficulties to win its bid,
will continue its effort for the WTO top post, Thai government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and they are to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote
be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
DPA123SPE010S03PEQL13:3913:390993
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body chief will have to steer the organization
to the expected launch in December of fresh global trade
organizations, to last until 2003.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the WTO and its predecessor the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade have always been headed by a European, and
developing countries have been increasingly vocal in calling for
appointment of a figure from their midst.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has promised to bridge the gap between developing
economies and richer nations if he wins the position.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has already won backing from Japan and other Asian
countries and has earned international respect for his role in
ensuring that Thailand resisted pressure to put up trade barriers
in reaction to the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Grows by 4.7 Percent in 1998: ABS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economy grew by 4.7
percent in 1998 as consumer and government spending buoyed the
economy, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.1 percent in the three
months to December, seasonally adjusted, and 4.7 percent over the
year to December, according to latest figures released by ABS.
</P>
<P>
Economists had expected growth to slow in response to the Asian
financial crisis, with predictions it would wind back to about
four percent from five per cent recorded for the year to
September.
</P>
<P>
The figures were bolstered by a rise in household and
government spending, which offset a dramatic fall in private
capital expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Treasurer Peter Costello welcomed the latest
GDP figure.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great result for Australia."
</P>
<P>
Although economic growth slowed from five percent recorded in
the year to September, Costello said Australia had recorded the
fifth consecutive quarter of GDP growth above one percent.

"Australia's economic growth leads the world," he said, adding
that it was higher than the G7 (industrialized nations) average of
1.5 percent, outdoing Britain, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports to countries outside Asia rose by 43
percent in the seven months to January 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that while Australia had weathered the first 18
months of the Asian crisis better than expected, the challenge was
not over.
</P>
<P>
"We do expect that it will have a dampening effect on
Australia, as it probably already has".
</P>
<P>
"We do expect that ... there will be an effect, and we don't
expect five percent growth to continue, so I would expect things
to slow during the course of 1999/2000."
</P>
<P>
But he said even if it slowed to three percent this would be a
fantastic achievement.
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday's figures reflected policy decisions made
years ago, and signaled a tough budget to be released in May for
the coming fiscal year in an effort to ensure strength continued.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer said the government would keep spending down to
keep the budget in surplus, saying that is crucial to
international confidence in the Australian economy.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President Seeks to Change Election Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga proposed to legally change the date for the
forthcoming five provincial council elections which is set for
April 1, according to a release issued Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The initiative follows representations made by the Catholic
Church and the Muslim community for a change in the date due to
religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Catholics said the date falls on Maundy Thursday in Holy
Week which is of special significance to them while the Muslims
said it clashes with their annual Haj pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
However, a complicated situation has arisen due to the need for
a simultaneous compliance of a recent Supreme Court judgment on
the postponement of elections and the election law itself, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The decision for election dates is at the sole discretion of
the Elections Commissioner and the government does not have a say
in the matter, the president clarified in the release.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted the Commissioner as saying that he had
decided on the April 1 date in order to give maximum campaigning
time to all the contesting political parties within the
constraints of the Supreme Court judgment.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court judgment, delivered on January 27, required
the election date to be announced within two weeks of the
judgment, and the election to be held within a minimum of five
weeks and a maximum of eight weeks after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner accordingly made the announcement on February
8 in which he chose April 1 as the election date, four days before
the deadline of April 5, the release explained.

<HEADLINE> India's Auto Sector Recession Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- India's auto sector continues
its recession trend with a slump both in its domestic sales and
exports, official sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry, which exported 150,127 vehicles during the
April-January period in fiscal 1997-98 (April 1, 1997-March 31,
1998), had exported only 122,468 vehicles in the same period of
1998-99, registering an 18-percent downslide.
</P>
<P>
Among the sub-sectors, the two wheelers segment, including
scooters, motorcycles and mopeds, was badly hit with a negative
23-percent growth during April-January 1998-99 as against a
negative 2-percent growth in the corresponding period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the motorcycles segment, there was a fall of 37 percent in
exports to 26,699 units during April-January 1998-99 from 36,682
vehicles in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The commercial vehicles and the car segments also registered a
negative 21 percent and 19 percent export growth during
April-January 1998-99 as against a negative 6 percent and 10
percent growth respectively during the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 152,829 tons of food
provided by the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) arrived in
Bangladesh during January and February this year.
</P>
<P>
The food, consisting of 120,605 tons of wheat and 32,224 tons
of rice, is part of WFP's pledged assistance of 352,000 tons of
cereals to flood-hit Bangladesh, The Bangladesh Observer reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two ships carrying 32,000 tons of food have been waiting at the
outer anchorage of the southeastern Chittagong Port for discharge,
and 99,454 tons of wheat supplied by the WFP is expected to arrive
in Bangladesh ports in March and April this year.
</P>
<P>
To improve the nutritional status of children of poor families
in the five most severely-affected districts, the first 2,100 tons
of blended food out of 3,500 tons procured by the WFP will arrive
in the country this month.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh experienced a severe flood last year, which lasted
from July to September and hit two-thirds of the country, damaging
1,565,390 hectares of crops and causing an estimated loss of 3.4
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch Brand Campaign to Boost Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Export Promotion Department of
Thailand will help exporters become more aware of the importance
of product brand in world markets by launching a "Qualified
Exporter Logo" campaign among eligible Thai companies, a source
from the Commerce Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first Thai brand project will be launched this month at a
trade show in Japan, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry will inject 500 million baht (13.5
million U.S. dollars) this year into promoting the Thai brand
campaign, in which about 70 locally-developed brand names are
expected to be involved.
</P>
<P>
Although Thai products are quite well-known in the world market
for their quality, the perception abroad of Thailand and Thai
products remains unclear, the source said.
</P>
<P>
This results in lowering of confidence in Thailand and its
products among importers and consumers, and in turn leading to
problems in export promotion, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry hopes that the Thai brand project will
set a clear direction and build confidence in Thai products by
establishing a more unified perception among importers and
consumers abroad.
</P>
<P>
The project is also expected to raise the bargaining power of
local manufacturers and exporters to negotiate better prices with
foreign importers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) recently introduced a program which enables
Shanghai and Tianjin residents to purchase durable goods on credit.
</P>
<P>
ICBC introduced the credit purchase program with the approval
of the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The installment loans enable individual consumers to purchase
expensive durable goods, excluding housing and automobiles, on
credit.
</P>
<P>
ICBC classifies expensive durable goods as commodities which
cost 3,000 yuan or above, with related products including
appliances, personal computers, furniture and musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
Borrowers must have steady income and provide required mortgage
and third party guarantees. Down payments for related purchases
range between 20-30 percent of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
The six-month installment loans can be extended for two years,
with interest rates reviewed once a year in accordance with
related central bank regulations.
</P>
<P>
Loans can either be paid in-full or by installments, according
to the ICBC.
</P>
<P>
Analysts point to the bright future for the new service. They
anticipate a vast potential demand for expensive durable goods and
suggest that installment loans will generate domestic demand and
fuel the nation's economic growth.

WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The struggling San Antonio
Spurs, one of the NBA's biggest disappointments early in the

Wu, who heads a government delegation, spoke highly of the
contributions Meri has made to the development of the relations
and reiterated China's support for Estonia's effort to maintain
its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
She praised Estonia's stance of sticking to the "one China"
policy and said she hoped economic cooperation between the two
countries will be expanded. The two-way trade went up by 37.7
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The two governments should be responsible in boosting direct
contacts between the enterprises of the two nations, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meri said it's Estonia's pride to keep good relations with
China, which treats big and small countries on an equal footing.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Sri Lanka Trade Pact Faces Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The landmark free trade agreement
signed last December between India and Sri Lanka is facing
problems due to differences over items each side wants to exclude
from the pact, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, India has included tea and rubber on its
negative list of goods which will continue to attract import
duties to safeguard local industries, officials sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indian officials said that tea would not be included
in the negative list, which greatly encouraged Sri Lankan tea
industry.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that India's move may have been prompted
by a large negative list put forward by Sri Lanka because of fears
that cheap duty free imports would crush its local industry.
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of Sri Lanka's biggest commodity exports and Sri
Lanka wants to sell it duty free in India with which it currently
competes in the international market.
</P>
<P>
India, whose tea industry is strongly opposed to the move,
imposes a 19 percent duty on tea imports.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are due to meet again this week to iron out
differences over the free trade agreement which provides for India
to phase out import tariffs over three years and Sri Lanka over
eight years.
</P>
<P>
Sources said India will possibly reduce the duties on tea and
rubber but insist their existence in the negative list.
</P>
<P>
India's exports to Sri Lanka are annually around 560 million
U.S. dollars while imports from Sri Lanka are around 42 million
dollars only.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Unprepared for Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- An information technology expert
said that Indonesia had yet to push ahead with programs to
anticipate problems arising from the millennium bug by the turn of
the year, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Microprocessor producer Intel Corp.'s country manager for
Indonesia Werner Sutanto considered Indonesia is lagging behind
neighboring countries in preparing to face up to the problems in
the computer system caused by the Y2k bug in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, the Malaysian government has long set up a
website on the Internet to inform the public about Y2k problems,
the names of companies or agencies which have already taken the
matter in hand, and the names of consultancies which provide
services to prepare computer users for these Y2k problems," Werner
said on the sidelines of the ceremony to launch Intel's latest
microprocessor Pentium III here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said many private companies, including banking corporations,
have prepared their computer systems well in this context but the
general public is still ignorant about the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Most Indonesians still don't know where to go to adapt their
computer systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Werner called on the Indonesian government to disseminate
information regarding the issues and raise public awareness of the
problems.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to more seriously pay attention to the
millennium bug since it would not only affect computer users but
also the living environment.
</P>
<P>
"The millennium bug can affect the operation of traffic lights,
lifts and other utilities, thus our living environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local computer producer Mugen's director Wiriadi Tirtariyadi
also highlighted the government's lack of attention to efforts to
prepare the public for millennium bug problems.
</P>
<P>
"I think the government is not prioritizing Y2k preparation as
it is facing a lot of problems in the economic and political
spheres," Wiriadi said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2k problems arises from the inability of some computers
and computer systems to recognize the date 2000, since they were
programmed to read only the last two digits of a year.
</P>
<P>
This glitch may cause computers to malfunction or shut down.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: As Asia Revives, More Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- With more and more signs of an
economic turnaround in Asia this year, foreign investors, who had
fled a financial crisis in the past two years, are coming back and
the region could see a new investment boom sooner than expected.
</P>
<P>
As the world's most successful developing region, Asia
attracted several hundred billion U.S. dollars of foreign
investments in the earlier part of 1990s. In 1997, foreign direct
investments in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and
South Korea amounted to 19.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional financial crisis, currency devaluation in
particular, touched off capital flight and foreign direct
investments in these countries fell to only 8.5 billion dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Now, the situation is improving with the crisis already
reaching the bottom. A new investment boom is expected in the
region this year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Institute of International
Finance recently, foreign direct investments in Indonesia,
Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines will reach
18.7 billion dollars in 1999, more than double of the figure for
1998.
</P>
<P>
More portfolio investments are also expected to pour into the
region. A survey by the Asian Society shows that 32 percent of
American companies feel that the time is ripe to resume portfolio
investment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Actually, since the beginning of this year, portfolio inflows
have been shooting up in some Asian countries. In the Philippines,
total inflows reached 774.3 million dollars as of February 12,
more than double of the figure a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the Institute of International Finance said,
foreign direct investment and portfolio investment could reach 8
billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the increase of inflows was a sign of
growing investor confidence in the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
It is quite true that it is the brighter economic picture of
Asia that is attracting foreign investors again.
</P>
<P>
Only months ago, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund estimated that most of the
crisis-hit nations would continue to register a negative growth in
1999 after a 1 percent to 8 percent contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But now, many economists, including those in these
international financial institutions, predicted that except
Indonesia, the other economies could start to pull out of a
recession in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
They said that Thailand is likely to see a 1 percent gross
domestic product (GDP) growth this year, Malaysia 2 percent, South
Korea 2-3 percent, and the Philippines 2-3.5.
</P>
<P>
At the time when the Asian economy is recovering, asset prices
in the region have started to climb again, currencies have
stabilized and inflation is under control. The economic
environment seems to be more conducive to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the enhanced investor confidence in the regional
economy, Asian countries are offering more investment
opportunities this year with further economic re-adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that heavily-indebted Asian companies are being
forced to sell stakes to mostly foreign businessmen, to secure
much-needed infusion of capital that will enable them to settle
their debts and grow again.
</P>
<P>
Many state-run industries are being privatized, also offering
opportunities to foreign investors, they said.
</P>
<P>
If an expected investment boom become reality, the Asian
economy could recover much faster this year, economists said.

here Monday, D'Alema accused the Socialists' opponents of being
fatally divided on a range of key issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, British Prime Minister Tony Blair also attacked the
right for ignoring economic and social problems
</P>
<P>
The Socialists have held sway in the European Parliament since
1984 with 214 seats now out of the 626, compared to the 202 held
by the European People's Party (EPP).
</P>
<P>
The June 13 election of the parliament would be a tight duel
between ESP and EPP.
</P>
<P>
The EPP was "divided between two souls, a centrist one and a
conservative one, which are increasingly at odds with each other,"
D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the congress approved the plan presented by
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres to create 10 million
jobs in Europe while confirming Germany's Rudolf Scharping as
chairman of the ESP.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which proposes a new strategy to boost employment,
will be studied by EU leaders at a Bonn summit a week before the
European Parliament election.

<HEADLINE> Long Way to Go Before Signing Agreement: Milutinovic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Republic President Milan
Milutinovic said here on Tuesday that the Kosovo peace talks in
Rambouillet, France, have achieved preliminary progress but still
have a long way to go before signing an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Many items, unilateral in nature, contained in the draft
political agreement in Rambouillet, thoroughly violated the ten
principles of the six-member Contact Group, thus leaving much work
undone, Milutinovic told US envoy Richard Hill here.
</P>
<P>
On his part, however, Hill stressed that the draft agreement
contained neither items on Kosovo's independence nor content
regarding Kosovo as Yugoslavia's third republic.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Yugoslav Vice Premier Vok Draskovic the same day,
the US envoy said the draft said nothing about the change of
Kosovo's autonomous status after a three-year transitional period,
rather adopted almost all suggestions from the Serbian delegation.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Promises to Meet OPEC Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela has promised to abide by
OPEC quotas even though its petroleum-based economy is facing a
slowdown in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A local report Tuesday quoted Energy and Mines Minister Ali
Rodriguez as saying that Venezuela has cut its oil production to
below 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) and soon will bring its
output down to levels agreed to with other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
In February, Venezuela agreed to implement the last phase of a
cut of 525,000 bpd, which will bring its daily production down to
2.845 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said his country will comply with the commitment by
March. Oil ministers from OPEC countries will meet in Vienna on
March 23 to discuss additional oil production cuts to support
slumping oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the third-largest OPEC producer after Saudi Arabia
and Iran; oil accounts for 75 percent of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
However, Venezuela's petroleum-based economy is facing a
recession due to weak oil prices that have hit a 12-year low.
</P>
<P>
Economists forecast that the country's gross domestic product (
GDP) will contract 1.6 percent in 1999, and the budget deficit
will reach 9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister said his country will increase its natural gas
production to narrow the earnings gap caused by the oil price
slump.
</P>
<P>
He said President Hugo Chavez, who took office on February 2,
is seeking to change the constitution to allow private investors
to take part in natural gas exploration and production.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela (
PDVSA), the country's proven energy reserves, including crude oil,
natural gas and coal, are equivalent to 452 billion barrels of oil,
and among them there are 74 billion barrels of proven oil reserves.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Assistance Promotes Tibet Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The central government and various
provinces and municipalities throughout China have pooled efforts
to promote economic growth in the Tibet Autonomous Region since
the accomplishment of its peaceful liberation in 1951.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of construction in the 1950s provided Tibet with
a communications network to the outside world, with highways
linking the region with neighboring Sichuan and Qinghai provinces,
as well as Nepal. In addition, Gonggar Airport opened to service
in the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
In February 1984, the central government organized manpower and
materials from nine interior provinces and municipalities for 43
major construction projects in the region.
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging projects covered the energy, communications,
building materials, trade, culture, sports, education, public
health, tourism and municipal works sectors. The extensive
development effort involved a total investment of 480 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the central government initiated an additional 62
projects scheduled for completion within a four year period.
Various provinces and municipalities once again cooperated in the
projects involving agriculture, animal husbandry, water
conservancy, energy, transportation, telecommunications, industry,
social welfare and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Sixty of the latter group of projects were completed by the end
of 1997 at a cost of 3.67 billion yuan, a figure well above the
planned investment of 2.38 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Says Biennial World Cup Could Start in 2009 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- FIFA President Sepp Blatter said on
Tuesday harmonising the international soccer calendar could not be
done before 2005, making 2009 the first year in which his plan to
stage the World Cup every two years could be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a news conference in Zurich, Blatter said: "We want
to have a master calendar, but it is possible only after 2004.
Contracts have already been signed for competitions."
</P>
<P>
He added that it would not be possible to hold a World Cup in
2008 because the Olympic Games and the Confederations Cup would be
held that year.
</P>
<P>
Blatter has already promised that, if his controversial two-
year plan is enacted, the World Cup would not be held in the same
year as the summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Therefore 2009 would be the first opportunity to
start...and this is a possibility. This is not only an idea, it
has become a possibility if the master calendar is successful."
</P>
<P>
Blatter noted: "Even if we only reach a coordinated calendar
then it is a win for football."
</P>
<P>
The FIFA president also reiterated his view that the World Cup
host nation should be chosen on a rotating basis, making Africa
and Oceania next in line for the competition.

<HEADLINE> More Bank Branches Opened in Myanmar to Help Reclaim Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Two Myanmar leading private banks,
along with a state bank, have opened one more branch office each
in Myitkyina, northern Kachin state of the country, in response
to a call by the government to help national entrepreneurs
financially in reclaiming vacant, virgin, fallow and wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The number of the bank branches opened across the country by
the Asia Wealth Bank and the Yoma Bank, have been brought to 22
and 23 respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the two added bank branch on Monday,
Myanmar Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein urged
other private bankers to take similar initiatives for the
purpose, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 private banks in Myanmar now providing domestic
commercial banking services along with three other state-owned
banks.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of 1998, nearly 60 private bank branches have
been opened throughout the country to enhance the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar government has been implementing a plan
in some five divisions to transform vacant, virgin, fallow and
wetlands into farmlands with high momentum since the beginning of
this year, urging national entrepreneurs to invest in the
undertakings which call for strong financial backings.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 national entrepreneurs groups are reportedly
transforming large stretches of such lands in Ayeyawaddy, Magway,
Yangon, Bago and Tanintharyi divisions.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Still Shroud Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Tensions continued to shroud the
riot-torn Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, on
Tuesday following the discovery of the bodies of a man and a woman
with stab wounds, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They were attacked on Monday night and found in the Galunggung
area Tuesday morning", Maluku Police spokesman Major Jekriel
Philip said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted witnesses as saying that the city was tense as
both Muslims and Christians set up roadblocks in their
neighborhoods, checking passing vehicles in anticipation of the
eruption of renewed violence.
</P>
<P>
"We heard that Muslims were to stage a protest against Monday's
incident in Ahuru, but so far we have not seen any signs of this,"
a witness said.
</P>
<P>
Reports on Tuesday indicated that a number of Muslims were shot
dead by police officers during sectarian clashes in Ahuru.
</P>
<P>
Some reports circulated to the effect that a number of people
were shot at dawn prayers inside a mosque in Ahuru early on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
National Police Chief General Roesmanhadi Tuesday said that the
authorities have started investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
"It (the killing) was conducted by irresponsible policemen.
We've taken them (into custody) for further investigation", he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about allegations that security forces have been taking
sides in their efforts to quell religious riots in Ambon,
Roesmanhadi said: "ABRI (Indonesian Armed Forces) is always
neutral and is still solid."
</P>
<P>
According to the Information Center of the ABRI, two battalions
of the Army's Strategic Reserves Command were sent to Ambon on
Tuesday to support the local people's security measures against a
possible recurrence of riots and violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed more than 200 people
this year and forced thousands to flee the territory.
</P>
<P>
The violence was initially sparked by a dispute between a
Muslim migrant and a local Christian driver of a public minibus on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
It then quickly degenerated into full-scale rioting pitting
members of the two communities against one another.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Gross Reserves Rise to $12.4 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves (GIR) now stood at more than 12.4 billion
U.S. dollars, which is equivalent to roughly six months worth of
import bills, the country's Finance Undersecretary Joel Banares
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This came about as the Philippine Central Bank (BSP) conclude
its Euro-dollar bond offer to 400 million U.S. dollars from the
original volume flotation of only 250 million dollars, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
BSP Governor Gabriel C. Singson said the dollar reserves of the
country continue to be in a healthy position, after it slumped to
a low of 8.5 billion dollars during the outset of the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Governor contributed it to the flowing together of the
proceeds of BSP's float, dollar purchase from the currency spot
market and the disbursement of International Monetary Fund's (IMF)
financial support to the country tied to the Precautionary
Arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The GIR refers to the ability of a country to pay its bills of
imported goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Singson expressed optimism that the BSP could easily reach the
12.9 billion GIR target for the full year as agreed with the IMF
even before his scheduled retirement in July.
</P>
<P>
According to Singson, the BSP is expecting the IMF to disburse
within the week the 127 million dollars, representing the fourth
tranche of the 1.4 billion financial package linked to the
country's passage of the performance criteria under the
precautionary arrangement.

<HEADLINE> China and Switzerland Set up Investment Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China Securities Co established a
partnership with Zurich Financial Services Tuesday with a 10
million US dollars investment fund targeting B-share and H-share
markets.
</P>
<P>
The fund is financed by the Swiss company, with the Beijing-
based China Securities serving as fund manager.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be in operation soon, company officials were
quoted as saying by China's largest English newspaper, but no
specific date was given.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the project will help China Securities
improve services, said Shao Chun of the Beijing-based firm, at the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The deal, the company's second one with foreign counterparts,
is an example of the company's efforts in developing overseas
assets management and establishing its position on international
capital markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company's first such deal was with the Swedish insurance
company Skandia, which set up the China Mainland Equity Fund in
May 1998 and commissioned Shao's firm as manager.
</P>
<P>
Skandia's fund also targeted markets of B shares and H shares,
which had generally been in a bearish mood during the past year.
</P>
<P>
However, yields of the fund has been over the market indices,
which reflected fund managers' expertise, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Zurich Financial Services said that the
sluggishness of the China-related markets had not dampened the
company's interest.
</P>
<P>
"It is a long-term strategy for many of our clients to expand
their presence in China's equity market," Frank Schnewlin,
director of the company's corporate executive board.
</P>
<P>
He also said the falls of the Asian stock markets seen since
the outbreak of the financial crisis will be a short-term
correction. Long-term prospects are positive.
</P>
<P>
China's hard currency B-share market hit record lows in the
past few months because of poor liquidity and performance by B-
share firms.
</P>
<P>
Schnewlin said that he believed the markets will rebound and it
is now an ideal moment to enter the markets.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his company plans to invest more in China's
securities market. He expects the company's move will help attract
more foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two companies said that their partnership will
be long-term one.
</P>
<P>
The project" will represent the first step in the co-operation
of the two companies and I hope there are many steps ahead," said
Schnewlin.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss firm is a financial institution with the Zurich
Insurance Co, the world's second largest insurance company. It
opened its representative office in Beijing in 1993.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Prices Rebound Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) crude basket
rose slightly to 10.17 U.S. dollars a barrel last week, as against
9.73 dollars in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat Tuesday attributed the rise
to the cold weather in some parts of Europe and the U.S. which led
to an increasing demand for the fuel.
</P>
<P>
But the upward trend could hardly be sustained due to the
oversupply in the world market where prices fell sharply in 1998
to 12.28 dollars on average -- a 34 percent drop from 1997's 18.68.
</P>
<P>
The prices averaged 10.74 dollars a barrel in January 1999.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Brazil
reached 8.4 percent in January, the highest figure in 14 years,
Brazil's Geographic and Statistical Institute said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dany Rappaport, economist in charge of the Stantander
Investment Bank, said the sharp increase in unemployment shows the
economy is in a recession and poverty is increasing in this South
American country.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has increased in the past months along with the
financial crisis, which the country is attempting to recover from.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show unemployment in January was 1.3 percent
higher than in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warn that the figures may go up to 12 percent by the
end of the first half of this year, since production has also been
reduced.

<HEADLINE> Venables Denies Possiblity to Return as England Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Former England soccer manager Terry
Venables said on Tuesday that he will not return to the position
he left in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Venables was touted as a firm contender for the job when Glenn
Hoddle was fired by the Football Association last month following
his controversial comments about disabled people.
</P>
<P>
But Venables, who managed England from 1994 to 1996, says he is
no longer interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
"It's too late now," he was quoted as saying in Tuesday's Daily
Mail newspaper. "If I was going to be the next manager it would
have happened by now."
</P>
<P>
Venables coached Australia's soccer team in a failed bid to
reach the France '98 World Cup finals and then returned briefly to
league management at Crystal Palace.

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Water Conservancy Project Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese water officials urged
local authorities Tuesday to intensify management of the
construction of water conservancy projects this year.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) of funds
will be poured into these projects in 1999, Minister of Water
Resources Wang Shucheng told a national conference.
</P>
<P>
"Although the final amount of the investment has yet to be
decided, it is likely to be about four times as much as that in
previous years," Wang was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped such a large sum could be used to ensure
the construction of the most important flood-control projects this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, quality control must be a top priority in water
control projects being constructed or reinforced this year, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Public bidding, supervision by qualified engineers, and
implementation of responsibility system within enterprises in
charge of water projects should be widely adopted in major
projects, he stressed. Last summer, devastating floods swept along
the Yangtze and Songhua rivers.
</P>
<P>
Al least 70 billion yuan will be spent in a three-year period
that began last year on the construction of water conservancy
projects, Wang said. Particular attention will be paid to
thousands of sub-standard flood-control levees along major rivers.
</P>
<P>
The investment may amount to 125 billion yuan during the 1998-
2000 period, according to Vice-Minister Zhang Jiyao.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is impossible for the central government to
continue to invest so heavily in the construction of water
projects as it is doing in the 1998-2000k period," Wang told local
water officials.
</P>
<P>
"Local water authorities must not misuse funds earmarked for
projects," Wang said, warning that "special funds cannot be
diverted to any other purpose nor pocketed by anyone."
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the funds was raised by the central
government through the issue 100 billion of bonds after last
summer's floods.
</P>
<P>
However, diversion of funds has become a serious matter, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Funds for some projects have been diverted to others or even to
none-construction projects such as housing or office buildings for
local authorities.

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers now can file
their complaints through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Sohu, a famous Web search engine, and China Consumer News,
jointly launched a one-month special Internet service from March 1,
for the consumers to forward their discontent and criticism over
products and services. The effort is made to greet the Consumer
Rights Day on March 15 which has been designated by the government
to safeguard the interest of consumers.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that it is the first time that Chinese consumers
resort to high-tech telecommunication means in the protection of
their rights and interest.
</P>
<P>
Besides offering advice on protection of interest, the website
also provides application forms for filing complaints and a
complaint mail box.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the application form, Sohu and China Consumer
News will cooperate in contacting relevant departments to look
into the case according to law, and will inform the consumer of
the results through e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Project Hope to Strengthen Fund Management Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of Project Hope - China'
s most prestigious welfare foundation - pledged yesterday to
strengthen supervision of fund management following the recent
announcement of a reorientation in the project's operating
strategy, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Li Ning, vice-
secretary-general of the China Youth Development Foundation as
saying that enhanced supervision is in line with the foundation's
efforts to shift its focus from rehabilitating poor dropouts to
running "Hope" primary schools and training teachers in poverty-
stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Money donated to Project Hope is currently managed by the
foundation under the overall supervision of the National Project
Hope Supervisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory committee sent 48 inspection groups to
supervise the running of 310 Hope primary schools in 28 provinces
last year.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors resolved more than 280 problems in fund
management, said an official from the committee.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the supervisory committee, no
case of corruption has yet been found among project officials.
</P>
<P>
The foundation and all provincial level youth development
foundations have also established various means of soliciting
supervision from the public on Project Hope, the paper says.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson warned Tuesday if the Serbs resort to force in Kosovo,
NATO would launch strikes on them.
</P>
<P>
Robertson made the remarks in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia,
during his one-day visit to the country, as reports said Serb
forces were lining up near the separatist Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO planes have remained highly alert.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Macedonian President Ljubco Georgievski and
Prime Minister Nikola Kljus, Robertson said his government was
worried about the break-out of violence in Kosovo, especially full-
scale violence.
</P>
<P>
He said the Serbs should know that the international community
was determined to solve the Kosovo crisis while the ethnic
Albanians have realized benefits from the Rambouillet agreement.
</P>
<P>
When inspecting the British troops deployed at Krivolak, south
of Skopje, Robertson said that the possibility of having Russian
troops in Kosovo as NATO peacekeeping forces could not be ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 British troops are stationed in Macedonia, part of
which are members of the NATO rapid reaction force and the others
will join the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Demaci Resigns as KLA Political Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Adem Demaci, political
representative of the "Kosovo Liberation Army," the militant
organization of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo outlawed by Yugoslavia,
resigned in Pristina on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his resignation, Demaci said he decided to give up
the job as the political representative of the KLA because of the
profound differences he has with some KLA leaders over the
expected conclusion of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some KLA leaders for abandoning the basic
principles of the organization because they were prepared to
accept certain terms in the Rambouillet Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Rambouillet Agreement, which is nearly ready to be signed
by Serb leaders in Yugoslavia and the Kosovar Albanians, "will not
guarantee independence for Kosovo," Demaci said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not content with the agreement since it fell
short of making Kosovo an integral unit of the Federation of
Yugoslavia; it also demands the disbanding of the KLA within 120
days after the agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
Whether the agreement is signed or not, the liberation war of
the Kosovar Albanians will not stop, he threatened.

<TEXT>
<P>

standing in Indonesia's Sunda Strait, has been showing increasing
activity since mid-February, national newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anak Krakatau, or "child of Krakatau", the petulant offspring
of the world's most infamous volcano Krakatau, has in recent days
been pumping huge quantie tourists have been banned from
visiting the volcanic island, formed in the crater of Krakatau,
that gained worldwide notoriety in 1883 when it exploded with a
fury that claimed over 36,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ernawaty, an tourism official in West Java, Tuesday confirmed
that her office had warned tour operators along the Sunda straits
not to take tourists anywhere near the volcano, now issuing a
plume of smoke over 100 meters high.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists are only allowed to get within 5 km of the island's
coastline," she said.
</P>
<P>
The fire works produced by the mountain have become a special
attraction for tourists staying overnight at Carita Beach.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the warning had been in response to a recent
report from a monitoring post in the nearby village of Pasauran,
confirming that volcanic activity was increasing.
</P>
<P>
Anak Krakatau has in recent years proved to be a popular
tourist attraction, though the dormant volcano began to stir in
1992, sending lava streaming down it's slopes.

PARIS -- The hijacker of an Air France Airbus 320 plane
surrendered at 19:00, after a three-hour action of air piracy
which is overall bizarre.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the Italian man, who called himself
Stefano Savorani, handed himself over to police without resistance
after holding talks with a public prosecutor of the local city of
Seine-Saint-Denis near the Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were carried out with the help of the pilot
of the plane, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The elite anti-terrorist commando force who arrived at the
airport did not intervene, said the same sources.
</P>

tourism; and in recent years the tourism sector generated 16
billion yuan in earnings.

Dugarry started the move that led to Maurice's winner in the 68

<HEADLINE> EDS-Shandong-Drought Shandong Reports Century's Worst Dry Spell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
experiencing the worst dry spell this century which has affected
over two million hectares of farmland, according to an official
source.
</P>
<P>
Precipitation in most areas of Shandong, one of the leading
grain producers of the country, totaled less than 36 mm between
September and the end of February, about 75 percent less than the
average for normal years, said an official of the Shandong
Provincial Headquarters for Flood and Drought Control.
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst dry spell since 1916 when precipitation data
were first recorded," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The serious dry spell has been caused mainly by the abnormal
weather last autumn and winter, when the average temperature was 2-
3 degrees Celsius higher than in the same seasons in previous
years, according to meteorological experts.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, daily temperature variation reached 15
degrees Celsius during last winter, something rarely seen, the
experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the drought is expected to have a
significant impact on agriculture as 2.1 million hectares of
farmland has been affected, but the supply of water for daily and
industrial use has remained unaffected.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Serfs Benefit from China's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Purpu, a 53-year-old man who lives
in southern Tibet, has a motorcycle, a refrigerator, a tape
recorder, a washing machine, two color TVs, a telephone, and a
mobile phone and explains that these are the benefits of the
reforms and opening up policy China has adopted since late 1978.
</P>
<P>
He says that he used to be a serf and had nothing but the
shadow behind him before the reforms that made his life better.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he and his eldest son started construction projects
and his daughter-in-law began managing a department store and
selling carpets. Purpu's eight-member family made 100,000 yuan and
grew produce on the farmland they got from the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The has a tractor, a harvester, and a horse-drawn cart in their
100-sq.m. courtyard and plans to spend 100,000 yuan to buy a car
this year.
</P>
<P>
Purpu is not the only Tibetan to benefit from the reforms. For
66-year-old Gesang Zhoigar, life 40 years ago doesn't compare with
her present life, and she is "living such a good life, I sometimes
feel that I am in a dream."
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, she rented a 40-sq.m. house to open a store in
downtown Zedang, and could earn 100,000 yuan a year with her
daughter who opened a store in the same town selling children's
clothes, fashionable clothing, leather shoes, hats, Tibetan style
clothing, as well as perfumes, curry powder, and vegetable oil
from Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
She has a two-story building and a direct-dial telephone, and
employs two salesgirls. She says she is satisfied with her present
life and business, but, "four decades ago, I was a serf. I had no
land, no house, not to mention personal freedom."
</P>
<P>
During her spare time, she says she prefers to watch Tibetan TV
programs and drink buttered tea. She also prays for her family
members, for her good life, and for the good central government
policy.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Urged to Promote Global Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said on Tuesday that the European Union (EU) and
Japan must take their shares in promoting the world economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics,
Summers said that "the risks around the world are still very much
tilted toward lack of growth, spare capacity and slowdown --
rather than toward economic overheating."
</P>
<P>
"There is too little growth in the global economy," Summers
said, and added that "there is too little balance in global
growth."
</P>
<P>
Noting that growth in the United States has accounted for the
bulk of industrial country growth, he cautioned that the country's
growth rate, at 4 percent, is "very likely above what would be
considered a long run sustainable trend and is giving rise to very
substantial imbalances."
</P>
<P>
Summers stressed the most important factor in determining how
the next months play out in Asia will be what happens in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He urged Japan to "think creatively about the best use of all
the tools of fiscal and monetary policy to create an expectation
of confidence and renewed growth."
</P>
<P>
Regarding Japan's troubled banking sector, Summers said, "There
is a great deal left to do," especially in regard to banks
reducing high debt levels.
</P>
<P>
Summers said Europe needed to pursue policy reforms that boost
employment and provide more support for global growth.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate European macroeconomic policies and structural
measures will be important for promoting employment and investment
and supporting global growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has been a major source of regional stability
in Asia in the past 18 months, Summers said he would be happy "to
see China play that role in future."
</P>
<P>
Just ending visits to five Asian countries including China,
Summers said that Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines are
notable points of light in the region, but Indonesia and Malaysia
still face uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
On Russia, Summers said it was "far from clear" that the period
of danger has passed, adding that both inflation and political
uncertainty were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia, still struggling after the collapse of
its currency and a partial debt default, must establish a stable
budget environment, secure property rights, and recreate a healthy
financial system.
</P>
<P>
For Brazil, he said it may "take time and perseverance" to
convince investors that Brazil has turned the corner. Brazil has
been battling to cope with the devaluation of its currency, the
real, and the need to cut spending to bring its budget deficit
under control.
</P>
<P>
Summers expressed concern that Brazil's economic problems could
spread through the rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and Russia received billions of dollars from the
International Monetary Fund last year, the latest in a chain of
massive rescue deals which started in Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Regional Organizations' Role in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Charter
allows room for regional organizations and arrangements in the
area of conflict resolution and peacekeeping, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Annan said there had been
concern in some circles that regional organizations and
arrangements were doing more in the conflict resolution and
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
"If they have the capacity and are able to play a role, I think
we should welcome it and we should encourage it," the U.N. chief
said.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulties are that, apart from NATO, regional
organizations do not have that capacity and therefore run into
difficulties once they take on some of these operations," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council itself, after its reluctance following
the Somalia experience to get involved in peacekeeping operations,
is beginning to look at these issues more critically and with a
bit more of an open mind," He said.
</P>
<P>
"Now one of the areas that the Council members have talked
about, and are aware that they may have to become engaged in, is
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And so I am confident the
pendulum will swing back at some future date, and I do not think
we should be unduly worried about that," the Secretary-General
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S Says to Review European Firms' Oil Deal with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States, showing
dispointment and concern over a 1 billion U.S. dollar oil deal
between Iran and European companies, said on Tuesday that it would
review the contract as it violates U.S. sanctions law.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the National Iranian Oil Company, and French oil firm
Elf and Italy's ENI signed the oil deal, under which the
Franco-Italian consortium will re-develop Iran's offshore Doround
oilfield, raising its output to 220,000 barrels per day of crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration was "disappointed and concerned" over the deal.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is strongly opposed to investment in Iran's
petroleum sector and we have repeatedly urged the governments of
France and Iraly at the most senior level to discourage this
investment," a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the deal "will be examined under ILSA," the
Iran-Libya Sanctions Law, which threatens sanctions against any
country investing more than $20 million in either Libya or Iran,
Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he noted that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, discussing last year's decision to waive sanctions on a
$2 billion deal involving France's Total SA and two other firms,
promised more waivers for European Union companies so long as the
EU cooperated with Washington on Iran policy.
</P>
<P>
Foley said he was unaware that EU cooperation had slackened on
either non-proliferation or counter-terrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
Still, he stressed that "this does not mean that waivers will
automatically be granted" in this latest case.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe it would be hard for Washington to impose
ILSA sanctions on the European firms in this Flf case, especially
after it granted a waiver in the earlier deal, which was to
develop Iran's South Pars gas field.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which has signed a string of oil or gas contracts with
foreign companies, on Tuesday hailed the new oil contract as a
triumph for its efforts to attract foreign investment and a defeat
for U.S. attempts to isolate it.
</P>
<P>
"The deal is yet another success for Iran in boosting political
and economic relations with other countries and defeat for the
White House to isolate our country through sanctions," Iranian
state radio said.
</P>
<P>
Many experts say the U.S. policy of isolating Iran has broken
down, but Foley insisted ILSA "has had an effect."
</P>
<P>
"It may not be able to prevent every investment in Iran but at
least in terms of the way international investors look at that
market, it's had to have had a sobering, if not chilling, effect,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Major Stock Indexes Fall on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Major stock indexes fell on Wall
Street Tuesday in fears of raising interest rates after the
Conference Board reported that the leading U.S. economic index
rose 0.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,297.61, down
27.17. The index got as high as 9,420.95, up 96 points in the
session of trading.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 36.15 at
2,259.03 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.66 at
1,225.50.
</P>
<P>
The indexes moved into the negative territory mainly because
the Conference Board, a U.S. prominent research group, reported
that the index of future economic activity rose 0.5 percent to
106.9 in January from 106.4 in December, showing little sign of
cooling off in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The new economic indicators gave investors more evidence that
the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to cool off the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index also fell 2.49 at 582.94 but the American Stock
Exchange index rose 0.92 at 699.21.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was also up 0.04 at
394.43.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Economic Growth in 1998 Lower Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian economic growth was lower
than expected last year at just 1.4 percent but Italy still kept
well inside the euro-area deficit limit of 3 percent with a
Deficit/GDP ratio of 2.7 percent, said the report of Italian
National Statistic Bureau (Istat) issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The low growth figure, one of the worst in Europe, had been
expected but even so it will be disappointing for a government
that had initially predicted 1998 growth of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
That figure was revised downwards twice, until last December
the government said it was expecting growth below 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, had been predicting growth
below 2 percent, and had downgraded that to about 1.5 percent as
the Asian and South American crises bit into Italian exports.
</P>
<P>
Istat also stressed in the report that the deficit/GDP figure
of 2.68 percent was roughly the same as last year and showed that
Italy was keeping up its guard on the public spending front.
</P>
<P>
The overall public debt continued to fall as a ratio of GDP
last year, at 118.7 percent compared to 122.4 percent, which stood
at the end of 1998 at 2,402.8 trillion lire (1.413 trillion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
For this year, the government has now cautiously put growth
between 1.9 percent and 2.5 percent, but recent estimates from
other sources have seen it lower than that.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi recently
admitted that "some extra measures" may be needed if Italy's plan
to get its deficit down to 1.0 percent of GDP is to be achieved in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Italy, like the other euro-area countries, is committed to
balancing its budget by 2002 or thereabouts.

"The security situation in West Africa is not an issue, which

presidential elections won by General Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings congratulated the Institute on its work in
Nigeria and said he hoped the time would come when African
countries would not need to rely on outsiders to ''validate our
elections''. African countries should be working toward a perfect
electoral process, which would not need outside supervision.
</P>

Wollack said Nigerians have demonstrated their desire for
democracy and was hopeful Nigeria's transition process would
succeed.

<HEADLINE> China Making Efforts to Promote Women's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- About 98 percent of urban
women and 70 percent of rural women in China can now have access
to prenatal health checkups due to increasing care for women, a
delegate said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some common ailments and frequently occurring diseases
threatening women's health have been effectively prevented or put
under control, said Shen Shuji.
</P>
<P>
Shen is leading the Chinese Delegation at the 43rd session of
the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women.
</P>
<P>
She told the meeting that the Chinese Government has
intensified efforts in maternal and child health by setting up
over 3000 mother and child health institutions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Summing up China's follow-up activities of the Fourth World
Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, Shen said the government
initiated a national monitoring and evaluation work in 1998 in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
A total of 110 counties have been selected from among over 2000
in China as pilot counties for monitoring and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results show that progress has been made in
attaining the major targets of the Beijing Platform for Action,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the targets set for the year 2000 in the fields of
employment, labor protection, education, health care and the legal
protection of women have been reached or nearly been reached, she
added.
</P>
<P>
The government has broadened the National Working Committee for
Women and Children of the State Council to 28 members, involving
23 governments departments and 5 non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> Leading U.S. Economic Index Rises in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of leading
U.S. economic indicators rose 0.5 percent in January, showing
little sign of cooling off in the economy, the U.S. prominent
research group, Conference Board, said Tuesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
"With the leading index posting three consecutive sharp
increases, the U.S. economy does not seem to be ready to settle
down much from the fast pace of growth it experienced in 1998,"
said Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at the
Board.
</P>
<P>
Boldin said, "over the past six months, the index has increased
1.2 percent, which is far above its historical average, and the
prospects for growth in income and employment are very bright."
</P>
<P>
The report said nine of the ten indicators that make up the
leading index rose in January. The most significant increases are
stock prices, manufactures' new orders of nondefense capital
goods, vendor performance and money supply in 1992 dollars, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said average factory workweek is the only negative
contributor.

<HEADLINE> U.S Concerned over Iran Oil Deal with European Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States, showing
dispointment and concern over a one billion U.S. dollar oil deal
between Iran and European companies, said Tuesday it would examine
closely the contract for that deal and consider appropriate action
against European oil companies' flouts over U.S. sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the National Iranian Oil Company, and French oil firm
Elf and Italy's ENI signed the oil deal, under which the
Franco-Italian consortium will re-develop Iran's offshore Doround
oilfield, raising its output to 220,000 barrels per day of crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is strongly opposed to investment in Iran's
petroleum sector and we have repeatedly urged the governments of
France and Italy at the most senior level to discourage this
investment," a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The administration will assess the implications of the contract
under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which threatens sanctions
against any country investing more than 20 million dollars in
either Libya or Iran.
</P>
<P>
"If sanctionable activity is found to have occurred then we
will decide upon and take appropriate action according to out own
national interests -- whether that is to impose sanctions, waive
them or delay action," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which has signed a string of oil or gas contracts with
foreign companies, on Tuesday hailed the new oil contract as a
triumph for its efforts to attract foreign investment and a defeat
for U.S. attempts to isolate it.
</P>
<P>
"The deal is yet another success for Iran in boosting political
and economic relations with other countries and defeat for the
White House to isolate our country through sanctions," Iranian
state radio said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Loan Measure for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Approved on Tuesday a measure that would make as
much as 500 million U.S. dollars available to guarantee loans for
farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the bill, passed by voice vote, would ease a
farm credit crunch caused by natural disasters and low commodity
prices. The money is not lent to farmers directly -- only used to
back up loans in case of default.
</P>
<P>
The money also is intended to help farmers until Congress has a
chance to vote on whether to grant President Bill Clinton's
request for 153 million dollars in extra money this year for
emergency loans and for hiring temporary government workers to
handle a heavy demand for disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Clinton said that economic turmoil in Asia and
elsewhere in the world continues "to make it difficult for
American farmers and ranchers to export their goods overseas."
</P>
<P>
His proposal would provide 1.1 billion dollars in direct loans
or loan guarantees for an estimated 10,000 producers who can't get
credit from private sources.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department is running out of money to make
loans because of the heavy demand for credit.

KAMPALA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- At least eight of the 15 foreign
tourists abducted by renegade Rwandan army militia Interahamwe
have been confirmed killed by the kidnappers, Radio Uganda
reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said that six have been rescued by Ugandan troops.
</P>
<P>
About 60 armed Interahamwe militiamen attacked Bwindi
Impenetrable National Park in western Uganda Monday morning,

<HEADLINE> German Survives Air Crash in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A German businessman and his
companion narrowly escaped death Monday night when their charter
plane crashed in eastern South Africa, South African Eye News
Service reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plane reportedly crashed into a thicket of trees after
plummeting 500 meters, and the scene of crash was between the
historic gold-rush town of Kaapsehoop and Nelspruit airport, in
Mpumalanga province.
</P>
<P>
The German businessman sustained cuts and other lacerations to
his face and chest, while his companion, a woman, was admitted to
a hospital with internal injuries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The plane's 22-year-old pilot said he had been forced to
execute a controlled emergency landing roughly five kilometers
east of Nelspruit airport after the main engine of his four-seater
Cessna plane stalled.
</P>
<P>
But the pilot, who suffered broken ribs and a broken nose in
the accident, declined to comment on the possible causes of the
crash, saying that civil aviation is conducting a formal
investigation into it.
</P>
<P>
Both police and charter company Leo Air refused to give details
except to say that the plane was flying between Brits and
Nelspruit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Widening Attacks on Iraqi Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States, in defiance
of Iraq's warning of challenging all invading Western warplanes in
both no-fly zones, said Tuesday that it would completely destroy
Iraq's air defense installations there if it keeps trying to shoot
down U.S. and British planes.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy of degrading Iraq's air defenses in recent weeks
isn't new. But Monday's strikes should make it clear that
tit-for-tat is over. The number of bombs and range of targets is
growing," one military official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. F-15E jets used more than 30 500-pound and 2,000-pound
bombs against anti-aircraft guns, command-and-control centers and
radio relay sites in the northern no-fly zone Monday in response
to what Washington claimed was Iraq's anti-aircraft gunfires that
post little threat to U.S. advanced warplanes.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Air Force officer said that Iraq was not going to have
much left in the way of defense in the two no-fly zones as a
result of U.S. attacks against its air defense sites, and that
Iraq had moved most of its surface-to-air missiles out of the
zones and into central Iraq since mid-January.
</P>
<P>
One senior official said there was currently no intention for
U.S. and British fighter jets to fly over central Iraq and attack
anti-aircraft weapons there. But he left open that prospect.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday that attacks would
continue on a widening range of air defense targets in the no-fly
zones, imposed by the United States and Britain since the Gulf War
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Pilots have been given greater flexibility to attack those
systems that place them in jeopardy. They are not simply going to
respond to a triple-A (anti-aircraft artillery) site or to a SAM
(surface-to-air missile) site," he said.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Apologize for Unauthorized Reports of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Ghana Journalists Association
(GJA) Monday apologized to Ashanti traditional rulers for
unauthorized reports on the death of King Asantehene and appealed
to journalists to respect time- honored practices.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Accra by Yaw Boadu-Ayeboafoh, GJA's vice
president, said it regretted any inconveniences that might have
been caused as a result of lack of respect for traditional values
of Asanteman in handling matters about the Golden Stool, the
Ghana News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian tradition demands that the death of a paramount chief
or king could only be reported after an official announcement by
the kingmakers.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to this tradition, some sections of the media reported
the death of Otumfuo Opoku Ware, the occupant of the Ashanti
golden stool ahead of a formal declaration.
</P>
<P>
The King is reported to have died last Thursday at the age of
80.
</P>
<P>
The journalist body said it noted that the reports have created
an embarrassment since they have tended to ignore valued
traditions.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore, appealed to journalists to exercise extreme
caution and accordingly offer an unqualified apology to the
Asanteman Council and plead that the matter be resolved amicably."
</P>
<P>
The GJA said, "the constitution provides for customary law and
 institutions in so far as they are not unconscionable or
offensive to the fundamental rights of individuals," a story
reaching here Tuesday from the Ghanaian News Agency said.

<HEADLINE> IFC Finances Rice Facility in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Fiance
Corporation (IFC) will lend 2.4 million U.S. dollars to Tilda
Uganda Ltd (TUL) for a rice growing and processing facility in
Uganda, the IFC announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project privatizes and rehabilitates the bankrupt Kibimba
rice scheme which was established in 1973 by the governments of
Uganda. TUL, a privately owned company established for the
implementation of the project, acquired the rice operation in 1997
through Uganda's privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The IFC said that TUL plans to produce 3,000 tons of milled
rice, 2,400 tons of maize, and 200 tons of soya each year. The
rice mill will have a capacity of 5 tons per hour, processing rice
grown by small holders in the area as well as the farm's crop.
</P>
<P>
The project will produce high quality rice for the first time
in Uganda and reduce imports, thereby saving foreign exchange,
said Mr. Cesare Calari, IFC's Director for sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Later stages of the project could make Uganda an exporter of
rice to other countries in the region, he added.

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Help Conserve West African Rainforest </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) is leading a close to 1 million U.S.
dollar project to protect the Upper Guinea Rainforest in West
Africa from further degradation, the UNDP said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will identify priority conservation actions at both
national and regional levels and undertake a scientific survey of
the biological resources of the rainforest and support human
resources training.
</P>
<P>
The rainforest covers an area of 420,000 square kilometers
involving five African countries -- Cote D'lvoire, Ghana, Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The area is considered one of the most valuable rainforests in
the world in terms of biological diversity though about 80 percent
of its forest cover has been lost due to human activity.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 percent of plants and 30 percent of mammals in its
ecosystem are believed to be endemic, the UNDP said.

<HEADLINE> Early 1999 Witnesses War in Parts of World, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite the conflicts broke
out in parts of Africa, Afghanistan and the Serbian province of
Kosovo, the United Nations still have a lot to do in maintaining
world peace and security, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference that "the first two months of the
new year have brought renewed or continuing fighting in many parts
of Africa, as well as Kosovo and Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
On December 14, 1998, Annan said that "if people did not abide
by their commitment -- indeed, if they did not redouble their
efforts to find peaceful solutions -- there was every reason to
fear the worst in 1999."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the his first press conference since the beginning
of this year, Annan said, "As it turned out, we did not have to
wait until 1999 to see renewed military action in Iraq. And the
first two months fo the new year have brought renewed or continued
fighting in many parts of Africa, as well as Kosovo and
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
For the United Nations, the withdrawal of peacekeeping forces
from Angola "is especially disappointing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's February 26 decision to close down U.N.
peacekeeping operations constitutes another failure in U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Africa after Somalia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"But we have plenty of work to do, and I'm glad to say there
have been some encouraging development as well -- some of them all
the more welcome for being long overdue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Just this weekend, Eritrea has accepted the proposal put
forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for ending its
war with Ethiopia, there have been peaceful elections in Nigeria,
heralding a return to democracy and civilian rule, and on Tuesday
the bells rang out to celebrate the entry into force of the Ottawa
Convention on landmines.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, in recent weeks there have also been some
promising developments in East Timor," he said, "I continue my
efforts to secure Libya's compliance with Security Council
resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council itself has made some progress on Iraq,
appointing three panels which are now hard at work," he said.
</P>
<P>
In short, "the U.N. is ready to do its part," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Maslyukov Threatens Libel Suit Against Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov said Tuesday that he will press libel charges
against the Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
An article that appeared in the daily newspaper Tuesday accused
several top cabinet members, including Maslyukov, of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov said he is preparing a request with the Prosecutor
General's Office to "pursue libel charges" against the paper,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Attached to the article, by Rustam Nazrikulov and Tatyana
Koshkaryova, the Nezavisimaya Gazeta published a letter from the
general director of Rosvooruzhenie state arms exporter, Grigory
Rapota, to Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin which was written
according to Maslyukov's instructions.
</P>
<P>
Rapota asked Stepashin to control the investigation of a
criminal case on the embezzlement of a total of 130 million U.S.
dollars in budget funds that belonged to Rosvooruzhenie.
</P>
<P>
The article links the letter to the corruption problem, and
Maslyukov's name was mentioned in this context.
</P>
<P>
"Yuri Maslyukov assesses the fact of the appearance of the
article as a political-baiting campaign against the government and
himself and hopes that the Prosecutor General's Office will treat
his complaint in a proper manner," Maslyukov's spokesman, Anton
Surikov, said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the paper printed "malicious libel" alleging
that Maslyukov had done several deals with two of his aides and
had inflicted considerable damage on the state, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
