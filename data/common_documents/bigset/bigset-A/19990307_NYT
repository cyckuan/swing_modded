Texas makes it close but loses 59-57
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The floor at Kemper Arena appears to be flat and
level, but the way Texas and Oklahoma State went at it Saturday you
would think the surface was as slanted as one of the hills
bordering the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Longhorns were the ones contesting the
gravitational pull for the most part and, after a long afternoon of
uphill combat, they came up just shy of the crest by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   Despite holding Oklahoma State to 33-percent shooting and a
measly 18 points in the second half, Texas could not make the
game-winning plays it needed and lost 59-57 in a Big 12 tournament
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 5-seeded Cowboys (22-9) will face the Kansas Jayhawks,
69-58 winners over Kansas State, in the tournament final at 2 p.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied only once, and Texas (19-12) had its only
lead at 23-22 midway through the first half. The Longhorns battled
to stay within an arm's length but never made the move it needed to
take control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an opportunity there for us coming out in the second
half when both teams came out a little bit sluggish, but we needed
to jump on them and we didn't,'' Texas sophomore center Chris Mihm
said. ``We let it slip right there, then we missed some
opportunities later as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost opportunities were costly for the Longhorns, who missed a
wide-open jumper, threw away a pass and missed a layup _ all in the
last 24 seconds _ to finally bring their tournament title dreams to
a close.
</P>
<P>
   The last was a potential game-tying burst up the floor by point
guard Ivan Wagner, but his layup never drew iron. Before Texas
could corral the offensive rebound and get up a follow attempt, the
buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well, and we missed out on a lot of chances to
win the game,'' forward Kris Clack said. ``But it says a lot about
what type of team we are to play terrible and only lose by two
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ``terrible'' in Texas' play came on the offensive
end as the Longhorns elected to launch 20 3-pointers, making only
four, against the zone-dominated Cowboys defense.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot Mihm and power forward Nnadubem ``Gabe'' Muoneke led
Texas with 17 and 16 points, respectively, but neither seemed to
get the ball as often as they are accustomed. Mihm was 5-for-9
shooting and Muoneke 5-for-7.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' shooters took turns misfiring from the outside. Clack,
who was severely hampered by a bruised tail bone, was 1-for-6 from
the 3-point arc, Ivan Wagner 1-for-5, William Clay 1-for-4 and
Chris McColpin 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to shoot those shots if teams are going to give them
to us,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes said, ``But we didn't do a good
job of attacking the gaps of the defense and getting the mid-range
shots. And we took some long shots early (in the possession) that
we don't want to take. Still, teams are gonna sag against our
inside game and we have to knock down some of those to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns fell behind by 11 points with just under nine
minutes remaining before the brawniest steer pulled his team up the
hill once more.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke scored five points, grabbed three rebounds and added a
steal in the next 3{ minutes to spark a 10-0 Texas run.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-7 junior scored on an offensive rebound and, after a
DeJuan Vazquez basket, dropped in two more points with a strong
move down low. Muoneke then made a nifty save under the basket of a
McColpin air ball that led to Clay's lone bucket from long range,
and hit a free throw to cut Oklahoma State's lead to 53-52 with
4:28 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as Texas would get even though it had
several other chances.
</P>
<P>
   After Muoneke threw a beautiful no-look, behind-the-back pass to
Mihm for a dunk to pull Texas within 58-57, Clay got free on a
breakaway after a long rebound but lost the ball and traveled.
</P>
<P>
   A good defensive stand forced Oklahoma State's Adrian Peterson
to attempt a 25-foot bomb as the shot-clock buzzer went off. The
shot banged off the glass, but Mihm could not haul in the rebound,
losing it out of bounds with 57.7 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez got his hands on a pass to force a turnover, but on the
other end he couldn't get his 12-foot jumper from the left baseline
to fall with just more than 20 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Foul-plagued Desmond Mason, a 15.5-points-per-game scorer whom
Texas held in check with only four points, missed the front end of
a one-and-one, giving the Longhorns another opportunity to take the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Wagner's turn to make a mistake, and he threw a
crosscourt skip pass intended for Vazquez that found press row
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who had 13 of his game-high 18 points in the first
half, hit one of two free throws with 9.3 seconds to go, leading to
Wagner's final go at it.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke charged hard at the miss but couldn't get a grip on the
rebound for a flying put-back and ran out of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts to lose any game and we really wanted to win this
tournament, but it could turn out to be for the best as we can get
some rest and get geared up to play next week,'' Mihm said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will not win the Big 12 tournament, but the Longhorns did
claim the regular-season title and felt coming into the tournament
that they would advance to the NCAA Tournament next week regardless
of the outcome here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident before we came here,'' Barnes said of his
team's postseason hopes. ``They're not going to keep the Big 12
champion out of the Tournament. I'm not worried at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes will find out today if his prognostication becomes
reality when the NCAA selection committee, which is sequestered at
a downtown hotel here, announces the 64-team field.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State believed it needed to win some games here to
advance to the NCAA Tournament, and it did that, knocking off
Baylor and exacting revenge on two teams _ Oklahoma and Texas _
that beat the Cowboys twice during the conference season.

<P>
   &UR; THE BOYS OF MY YOUTH &LR;  By Jo Ann Beard. Back Bay/Little, Brown,
$13. These 12 essays about the author's largely uneventful
upbringing in the Midwest and her marriage and divorce are brought
to life by her comfortable voice and acerbic powers of observation.
``Beard remembers (or imagines) her childhood with an uncanny
lucidity that startles,'' Laura Miller wrote in The New York Times
Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WICKED WOMEN: STORIES &LR;  By Fay Weldon. Atlantic Monthly, $12.
With 21 novels and three short-story collections, the author has
perfected her ironic forays into the universe of the discarded wife
who is forced into heroic self-awareness. This time she also takes
aim at insecure househusbands, selfish adult children, therapists
and the culture's infatuation with New Age blather. ``She is a
Yahweh with a profound appreciation of irony,'' Deborah Mason wrote
in 1997. ``Weldon has become one of the most cunning moral
satirists of our time. In her rueful stories, justice is done _
whether we like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAUCASIA &LR;  By Danzy Senna. Riverhead, $12.95. This first novel
tracks the coming of age of the daughter of a white activist and a
black intellectual who struggles to find her identity in a harsh
and confusing world. ``Senna superbly illustrates the emotional
toll that politics and race take on one especially gutsy young
girl's development,'' Elizabeth Schmidt wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SERBS: HISTORY, MYTH AND THE DESTRUCTION OF YUGOSLAVIA &LR;  By
Tim Judah. Yale University, $16. A journalist argues that the Serbs
have been subjected to ``ethnic cleansing'' since medieval times,
making it the driving force behind their national consciousness,
and he links the recent atrocities committed by the Bosnian Serbs
to a collective madness prompted by a desire for revenge. In 1997
the reviewer Aleksa Djilas called this ``a lively and balanced
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale has also reissued  &UR; CROATIA: A NATION FORGED IN WAR &LR; , by
Marcus Tanner ($16), which focuses on a Balkan culture with a
bewildering web of influences and contradictions _ not to mention a
long tradition of close relations with Serbia. The book is
``written with vigor, full of absorbing stories and important
insights,'' Djilas wrote, also in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE KNIFE THROWER AND OTHER STORIES &LR;  By Steven Millhauser.
Vintage Contemporaries, $12. The dreamers, inventors, artists and
illusionists who populate these tales don't know when to stop. The
author reveals ``splendid flashes of absurdity and satire'' and a
``rich, sly sense of humor'' as he explores our complex response to
``the products and projections of our own minds,'' Patrick McGrath
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAGNEY &LR;  By John McCabe. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $14.95. Cagney the man
was hardly the tough guy and ebullient showman he portrayed on
screen: He was a retiring sort with surprisingly refined tastes,
the former ghostwriter of his autobiography maintains. This
``revealing biography'' exceeds ``the half-dozen previous books on
the actor at illuminating the private Cagney,'' David Hajdu wrote
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another iconic entertainer is profiled in  &UR; MAN ON THE FLYING
TRAPEZE: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF W.C. FIELDS &LR; , by Simon Louvish
(Norton, $18), which recalls the actor's early vaudevillian career
as a world-class pantomime juggler and does its best to sift
through the ``acres of flamboyant flim-flam'' that obscured his
past. ``Besides proffering anecdotes, Louvish does a heroic job of
filling in Fields' life,'' Katharine Whittemore wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ALL-TRUE TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES OF LIDIE NEWTON &LR;  By Jane
Smiley. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12.95. The spunky 20-year-old narrator
blossoms into a committed abolitionist when she and her husband
journey to the Kansas Territory in the 1850s and are forced to cope
with hardscrabble prairie life and nasty pro-slavers. Until it
lapses into a ``feminist revenge fantasy,'' the novel is
``consistently entertaining, filled with action and ideas,'' Thomas
Mallon wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EDITH WHARTON MURDERS &LR;  By Lev Raphael. St. Martin's,
$11.95. The moderator of a conference of hostile Wharton scholars
at a Michigan university turns reluctant sleuth when a celebrated
author turns up dead. The result is a ``maliciously funny campus
mystery'' that satirizes ``the intellectual jealousies and
political rivalries ... in academic communities,'' Marilyn Stasio
wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRASSAI: LETTERS TO MY PARENTS &LR;  Translated by Peter Laki and
Barna Kantor. University of Chicago, $16. The Hungarian-born
photographer Brassai (1899-1984) recounts in exuberant fashion his
efforts to support himself as an aspiring young artist in Berlin
and Paris. In 1997 Christine Schwartz Hartley called this a
``delightful volume'' that is ``rich in anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIGHT OF MANY DREAMS &LR;  By Gail Tsukiyama. St. Martin's Griffin,
$12.95. This novel centers on two sisters from Hong Kong growing up
during and after World War II and the family rituals that bind
them. Last year the reviewer Bill Kent admired the ``evocative
scenes of a wonderfully unexotic, warmheartedly domestic Hong
Kong.''

INJURY FORCES AGASSI TO GIVE UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Youth may have been served Saturday in the
semifinals of the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic at the Canadian
Pacific Scottsdale Princess.
</P>
<P>
   But third-seeded Andre Agassi certainly wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Tied, 3-3, with 21-year-old Jan-Michael Gambill in the first
set, Agassi reached for a backhand shot and strained a hamstring in
his right leg. He tried to continue playing. It was evident that
Agassi was in pain and not moving well. He hurt it again when
reaching to return a shot. He fell behind, 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Then to the disappointment of the crowd, Agassi was forced to
resign, sending Gambill into today's 1 p.m. final against
18-year-old Australian Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt beat fellow countryman Mark Woodforde in straight sets,
6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is the youngest player on the ATP Tour. Woodforde, at 33,
was the oldest player in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, of Colbert, Wash., upset the world's top player, Pete
Sampras, in the second round. Hewitt did the same to second-seeded
Patrick Rafter. Hewitt has won one ATP Tour tournament, and this
will be his second final. Gambill never has played in an ATP final.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angelo Mattalino, a Scottsdale orthopedic surgeon, treated
Agassi after the match and said the hamstring strain ``appears at
this time to be mild.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattalino said Agassi will be given anti-swelling and
anti-inflammatory medications, electrical stimulation and ice.
</P>
<P>
   He said Agassi will be treated again this morning, then decide
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a hamstring injury,'' Agassi said. ``It was a
sharp pain, and I knew something was wrong. I walked it off at
first, but when I tried to play again and kind of stepped over on a
pass shot, I felt it again. It's rather stiff and painful now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I tried to go on, something worse could happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said in 48 hours he should know whether he can play at
this week's ATP Tour event at Indian Wells, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to have something good happen,'' Agassi said. ``I was
playing well. I thought it could be a 4-2 (6-4, 6-2) match. ``If I
had gone on I wouldn't have been worth a damn anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill said he never hoped to get to his first final like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to play him,'' he said. ``He's my hero and
always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hollow feeling (winning like this). I was hitting the
ball good. It was a well-played match.'' Gambill said his serve has
improved considerably since he arrived in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practiced it this morning, and I'm getting in a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Hewitt, whom he has never played, will be a different
kind of match, Gambill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have a huge serve,'' Gambill said. ``But I'm going
to run and run and run. He doesn't miss very many balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt and Woodforde are from the same city in Australia,
Adelaide. Woodforde is better know as a doubles player. He and his
partner have won five Wimbledon titles.
</P>
<P>
   This was their second meeting. Hewitt has won both.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can wave the singles flag over Adelaide,'' Woodforde said,
``and I can fly the doubles banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning only four games, Woodforde said he didn't think
it was a whipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically made a lot of errors,'' he said. ``I had to go for
it. The other day I was attacking pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of surprised. He doesn't hit the ball hard at all.
It comes across softly. But he moves so quickly. I didn't move fast
enough to respond. I had no rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great set of legs. He's fast. He's very classy at
that point. The next step is that he has to strengthen up a little
bit.'' Hewitt has been compared to American Michael Chang, a
counterpuncher on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He relies entirely on an opponent's errors,'' Woodforde said.
``He baits you. That's what makes him good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt agreed that the match was better than the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy out there,'' he said. ``Really, it was pretty
tough. I kept him guessing. I lofted a lot of balls.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Gimelstob of Miami and Richey Reneberg of Atlanta
advanced to the doubles final and will meet Mark Knowles of the
Bahamas and Australian Sandon Stolle.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are playing together for the first time in this
tournament. &QL;

TWINS' DOUBLES LOSS DISAPPOINTS CROWD

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - All good things must come to an end, and
they did Saturday afternoon for the doubles team of  &UR; Bob and  &UR; Mike
Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old identical twins were the darlings of this
tournament. It's hard to tell them apart except on the court. Bob
is left-handed, while Mike hits from the right.
</P>
<P>
   When they were junior players, they frequented the Fiesta Bowl
Tournament. They went to college at Stanford for two years, and
they won the NCAA title last season.
</P>
<P>
   They joined the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour last
summer and made the semifinals once before playing in the Franklin
Templeton Tennis Classic here. Again, they reached the semifinals.
Familiar with them because of their play in the West, the tennis
crowd was quick to hop on their bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   They were disappointed Saturday when  &UR; Mark Knowles of the
Bahamas and
 &UR; Sandon Stolle of Australia beat them in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6
(8-6).
</P>
<P>
   The Bryans led, 6-5, in the tiebreaker before dropping the
match. &QL; 
They'll meet again &QL; 
 &UR; Mark Woodforde, the oldest player in the tournament at 33, will get
a chance for revenge again this week after losing to 18-year-old
 &UR; Lleyton
 &UR; Hewitt, the youngest player, in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   They'll meet in the first round of the ATP Tour event at Indian
Wells, Calif., just outside Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, the players will move to Key Biscayne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Both are Mercedes Super 9 tournaments and usually draw the top
30 players in the world because of the purses. The Franklin
Templeton is a warm-up for the next two tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The purse for this tournament is $350,000 plus incentive money
that makes the total about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells has a $2.45 million purse and Key Biscayne $2.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Woodforde and Hewitt both live in Adelaide, Australia. But they
had met only once before, in January 1998 in Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who was 16 at the time, beat Woodforde, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1),
in the second round and ultimately won his only tournament on the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first semifinal in tour history when two players
from Adelaide met in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   After winning in the quarterfinals Friday, Woodforde was out to
even things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we played it was a bit of an upset,''he said,
``and I would like to get a bit of revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get it. &QL;

MIGHTY DUCKS ARE PECKING AT COYOTES' HEELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reality has reached up and smacked the Coyotes square in the
face like an errant high stick. It has cut them badly.
</P>
<P>
   If they manage to lose tonight to the expansion Nashville
Predators, and if Anaheim can find a way to beat Detroit, the
Mighty Ducks will be just one point behind Phoenix in the battle
for the fourth playoff seed in the Western Conference and the
all-important home-ice advantage in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim did it to the Coyotes two years ago, wrestling away the
No. 4 seed in the final week of the regular season and then
dispatching the Coyotes in the opening round in the deciding
seventh game in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Can it happen again, only sooner this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``How many points? Anything's possible,'' Anaheim right wing
 &UR; Teemu
 &UR; Selanne said. ``I don't see any reason why we couldn't do it. But
we haven't even been thinking of catching them because it's been
(such a) hard battle with the teams fighting for playoff spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Ducks were seven points behind the Coyotes last
week, Selanne wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing,'' he said. ``One good week, it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's here already. The Mighty Ducks have gone 12-3-0 in their
past 15 games, climbing four games above .500 for the first time in
franchise history. The Coyotes have gone 5-10-0 in their past 15
and can forget about catching Dallas for first in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim is taking nothing for granted. The Coyotes might be
looking over their shoulders, but Anaheim is doing its best to keep
looking straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't start focusing on what's behind us or really worry
about what's ahead of us,'' Coach  &UR; Craig Hartsburg said. ``But if
we just keep playing and focusing on the next game, we'll have a
chance to compete with Phoenix for that spot. But right now, our
only focus has to continue to be on ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's fellow All-Star linemate, left wing  &UR; Paul Kariya,
couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a long ways away from the end of the season,'' he said.
``Just because we've beaten some teams that are underneath us
doesn't mean we're anything special. We still have a lot of work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim is 3-0-1 against the Coyotes this season. The teams will
meet twice more, including Saturday at America West Arena in what
figures to be a preview of the playoffs. The fourth seed plays the
fifth, and it's almost a foregone conclusion that they will meet in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't bode well for the Coyotes either that the two-referee
system will be used in the postseason. Obstruction penalties will
be called for every hook, hold and stick infraction. And Anaheim
just happens to have the best power-play unit in the NHL, with a
league-high 66 man-advantage goals. The Coyotes? Despite scoring
two during their 7-2 loss to Detroit on Friday, they rank at the
bottom of the league, tied for last with just 32.
</P>
<P>
   What's it all mean? Anaheim in seven, that's what. &QL; 
Trade winds
</P>
<P>
   Next week, we'll try to give you a rundown on all the possible
moves that are shaping up before the March 23rd NHL trading
deadline. Here's just a sampling of what could be on the horizon:
</P>
<P>
   After re-signing  &UR; Trevor Kidd, Carolina is shopping goalie
 &UR; Artus Irbe, perhaps to Edmonton in a multi-player deal. New Jersey
also may want to deal with the Oilers, possibly sending  &UR; Sheldon
Souray and  &UR; Sergei
 &UR; Brylin and a second-round pick for  &UR; Boris Mironov and  &UR; Dean
McAmmond.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, Philadelphia, Dallas and even the Coyotes might be
interested in Rangers physical defenseman  &UR; Ulf Samuelsson. Chicago
wants to trade for a mobile defenseman and a proven goal scorer and
is willing to give up just about anything _ short of  &UR; Tony Amonte.
The Flyers are willing to move recently acquired  &UR; Andrei Kovalenko,
and Carolina's  &UR; Martin Gelinas, a former 35-goal scorer, could also
be on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Other rumors making the circuit include the Oilers willing to
part with veteran backup goalie  &UR; Mikhail Shtalenkov (to Phoenix?)
for a draft pick or a minor-league prospect; Buffalo moving  &UR; Wayne
Primeau in addition to always-on-the-block  &UR; Matthew Barnaby, Derek
Plante and  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Wilson; and the Devils perhaps parting with center  &UR; Jason Arnott to
anyone for the right price. &QL; 
Fuhr not charmed
</P>
<P>
   Repeated injuries to  &UR; Grant Fuhr have just about left the future
Hall of Famer forgotten in St. Louis, where the Blues are now on
their fifth goalie after former Vezina Trophy winner  &UR; Jim Carey was
acquired last week from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr is supposed to be back well before the playoffs, assuming
St. Louis gets there, but there are whispers that the Blues might
squeeze him out of the mix now. Would anybody be interested?
Perhaps even the Coyotes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 36, I'm broken down, and I'm expensive,'' Fuhr said.
``Where do I go?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe nowhere, noted his agent,  &UR; Jay Fee, referring to the
plethora of goalies the Blues have stockpiled for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're collecting them like charms on a bracelet,'' Fee
said. &QL; 
Robinson safe
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continued woes of the Los Angeles Kings, who are
hanging onto the final playoff spot in the West, Coach  &UR; Larry
Robinson's job appears set. Team President  &UR; Tim Leiweke guaranteed
it during a rather animated chat with reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have a death watch,'' he said. ``We don't. We're very
patient. Our coaches are going to finish the year. Our players know
their damn careers are on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's contract, though, expires at the end of this season. &QL; 
Road rage
</P>
<P>
   It took the Edmonton Oilers 17 hours to get to Denver last week
for a game against the Avalanche. Their problems started with fog
in the early morning in the Edmonton area, which scrubbed their
flight the day before the game.
</P>
<P>
   So they chartered a bus to take them to nearby Calgary for the
flight out. That worked fine, until the bus broke down on the way.
By the time a new bus picked them up and got them to Calgary, they
had to wait an additional five hours in the airport for their
flight.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 a.m., the Oilers finally made it, which made them all a
little giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing missing,'' rookie  &UR; Tom Potti said, ``was a
flaming plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Ron Low said, ``With good shoes, I likely could have
walked there faster.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best line of the day might have been delivered by
play-by-play voice  &UR; Rod Phillips, who quipped: ``We knew about this
trip to Denver since August when the schedule first came out, and
 &UR; Theo
 &UR; Fleury beat us to Colorado with three hours' notice after he was
traded.'' &QL;

NETS, SPURS COACHES FIND JOBS IN PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The season is just more than a quarter over, the Lakers already
have fired  &UR; Del Harris, and two more coaches are on shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets and the San Antonio Spurs have been the
league's biggest busts, and coaches  &UR; John Calipari of the Nets and
 &UR; Gregg
 &UR; Popovich of the Spurs are feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, the Spurs have begun to show some life and went
into Saturday night's game against the Clippers at the .500 mark.
It should be noted that the Spurs started last season 10-10 before
going 52-10 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Popovich is being questioned for making second-year
center  &UR; Tim
 &UR; Duncan his first offensive option this season.  &UR; David Robinson, the
club's centerpiece for so long, often has appeared lost. There has
been speculation that Robinson's back isn't completely healthy. His
psyche probably hurts even more.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich's strategy hasn't worked. The Spurs, despite the return
of forward  &UR; Sean Elliott and the additions of  &UR; Mario Elie and
 &UR; Steve Kerr in the off-season, have had a difficult time scoring
points.  &UR; Peter Holt, the chief owner of the club, has pledged
support _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich also is the club's general manager, which complicates
matters. He might be wise to make a move himself rather than risk
losing both jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The man believed to be the likely candidate to replace Popovich
in such a scenario is  &UR; Doc Rivers, who lives in the Alamo City and
works as an analyst for Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   He has an out clause in his broadcasting contract that is
supposed to apply only after the season, but it's unlikely that
Turner, a coaching springboard these days, would stand in the way
of Rivers going to the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The struggles of the Spurs are a mystery, but nothing compared
to what is happening at New Jersey. With a nucleus that includes
 &UR; Jayson Williams, Keith Van Horn and  &UR; Kerry
 &UR; Kittles, the Nets were regarded as one of the up-and-coming clubs.
The team signed Williams to the maximum allowable contract
extension in the off-season, and it appeared the team was ready to
replace the Knicks as the best team in the Gotham area.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they've stumbled. Williams is playing with a torn thumb
ligament that makes it difficult for him to grab rebounds, which is
his strength. He isn't producing any offense. Point guard  &UR; Sam
Cassell has been out with an injury and is rumored to be on his way
to Milwaukee for  &UR; Terrell Brandon. The trading deadline is four
days away.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that the players already have begun to tune
Calipari out. It's unlikely the Nets will fire Calipari, but he has
an option clause that would allow him to escape the remainder of
his contract this summer. He might be tempted to use it. &QL; 
It adds up &QL; 
Is  &UR; George Shinn about to unload the Charlotte Hornets?  &UR; Robert
L. &UR; Johnson, chief executive officer of Black Entertainment
Television, whose company has a value of $1.2 billion, has
expressed interest in purchasing the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely intrigued,'' Johnson told the ``Charlotte
Observer.'' ``But it has to be up for sale. And I don't know if
it's up for sale (in reality) or up for sale to price it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has approached investment bankers to determine whether
they've been contacted by Shinn looking for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn has fueled the speculation by moving his legal residence
to Florida, where he has owned a home for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has no state income tax. North Carolina's state tax is
7.75 percent. Now, if Shinn were about to make a $100 million
windfall from, say, selling an NBA basketball team, it would figure
that he wouldn't want to shell out $7.75 million to North
Carolina. &QL; 
Taking a dive &QL; 
Dallas Mavericks Coach  &UR; Don Nelson has always been a
non-conformist. He drew the league's ire by essentially forfeiting
a game to Utah. He pulled all his starters once the Jazz had a
double-digit first-quarter lead. Utah won, 80-65.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even present a challenge,'' Jazz forward  &UR; Bryon
Russell said. ``I don't even know what tactic Don Nelson was using.
I guess he gave up already.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what he did. Nelson's logic was that, with the
game scheduled between Denver and Sacramento, it was in his best
interest to try to win two of the three. The Mavericks had defeated
Denver and ended up beating Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never coached a game like that, but I've never been in a
season like this, either,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, the NBA office contacted Nelson, but there was no
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Fans pay to see teams give their best effort, at least until the
game is out of reach. A double-digit lead in the first quarter is
common. Resting the starters in the fourth quarter would have been
fine. Giving up in the first quarter is stealing from the paying
public. &QL; 
Not so fast &QL; 
Maybe those predictions of Chicago suffering forever in lottery
land were premature.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Bulls are as bad as expected. But apparently they've
gotten a boss.  &UR; Jerry Krause may hold the title of operations
chief, but it's beginning to sound as if agent  &UR; David Falk is
holding some strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent, among others, three very talented players who
could become free agents this summer,'' Falk said recently ``They
are
 &UR; Stephon Marbury (Timberwolves point guard),  &UR; Kerry Kittles (Nets
shooting guard) and  &UR; Vitaly Potapenko (Cavaliers center). I also
have good relations with (Bulls owner)  &UR; Jerry Reinsdorf and with
Jerry Krause. I like working with them, and we've always worked
some good deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves, Nets and Cavaliers have until March 13 to sign
those players to contract extensions, which might be all Falk is
attempting to leverage. But he may also try to broker all three
into Chicago. Falk argues that under the new collective bargaining
agreement, players will ask for an early termination option clause
in their contracts after five years. Thus, there isn't a big
advantage in re-signing with the club the player is with,
particularly if it's a small-market team.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements and other off-the-court earnings are maximized in a
major market, such as Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to get three or four quality young players to come
to the Bulls at the same time,'' said Falk, sounding a lot more
like GM than agent. ``Forget the names of the players. But I would
love to bring three or four guys to the Bulls at the same time.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ When President Clinton visits
Central America this week, he will witness a region forged by one
tragedy or another over the last several decades and, more often
than not, forgotten in its intervals of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The president is to open a four-day visit to El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala on Monday, the day after
Salvadorans vote on a new president and further cement a remarkable
democratic transformation after 12 years of civil war that left
more than 70,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a miracle what's happened here,'' said Anne
Patterson, the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the clamor of the 1980s, when the region's
upheavals dominated U.S. foreign policy, that change has occurred
nearly silently. Instead, it has taken one of the worst natural
disasters to rampage through the hemisphere in modern times _
Hurricane Mitch late last year _ to refocus attention here.
</P>
<P>
   With this visit, many Central American experts agree, Clinton
has a chance to engage the region once again _ with increased aid,
trade preferences and protected status of Central American
immigrants, for example _ and to nurture young democracies that
emerged only recently from armed conflicts and that remain fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, do we use this moment of political stability
to help strengthen the countries so they don't suck us back into
the whirlpool?'' said Robert Pastor, former national security
adviser for Latin America under President Carter, who now teaches
at Emory University in Atlanta. ``We still have the responsibility
to ensure that these small and vulnerable countries stand on their
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the Cold War concerns that drove Washington's
interest here a decade ago, Clinton's agenda for this visit will
reflect the global issues of today _ free trade, immigration and
drug trafficking, in addition to repairing the damage from
Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   But past interventions and traumas still color the region's
relations with the United States. And they are especially likely to
confront Clinton in places like Guatemala, where just last month a
truth commission blamed Guatemalan military regimes assisted by
Washington for acts of genocide against that country's Maya
population during a 36-year war.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping the armies of El Salvador and Guatemala wage
wars against guerrilla forces, the United States financed the
counterrevolutionary war against the Sandinista rebels, who took
power in Nicaragua in 1979, using Honduras as an operational base
for the contras.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who first visited the region in 1997, when he met with
Central American leaders in Costa Rica, will travel with Hillary
Rodham Clinton and on Monday and Tuesday will tour areas devastated
by the hurricane in Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to give the major address of the visit before El
Salvador's legislative Assembly on Wednesday, and then travel to
Guatemala for a round-table discussion on that country's moves for
peace on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he will meet with the presidents of the four
countries, and leaders from Costa Rica, Belize and the Dominican
Republic, at a summit conference in Antigua, outside Guatemala
City, before heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Of the previously war-torn areas Clinton will visit, El
Salvador, a country of about 5.8 million, has moved the furthest
toward consolidating peace. The former guerrilla movement, the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, is now the country's
leading opposition party, boasts the second-largest bloc in the
national assembly and controls a large and growing number of
mayoral posts, including the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Nationalist Republican Alliance, a party founded
by extreme-right-wing leaders associated with death squads, has
undergone a remarkable transformation of its own and now accepts
the left's gains and negotiates with them on all levels of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the working-class neighborhood of San Jacinto,
several thousand euphoric supporters of the former guerrilla party
marched down a street past auto-body shops and hot-dog vendors,
waving red flags and chanting revolutionary slogans, though it was
clear that the change they sought would come only through the
ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   On a stage set up a few feet from the presidential offices here,
two former guerrilla commanders, Facundo Guardado and Nidia Diaz,
addressed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be indifferent,'' Ms. Diaz, still going by her nom
de guerre, told them, closing out the campaign on Wednesday and
urging supporters to turn out for the vote, which her party is not
expected to win. ``It's your future, it's what's going to happen to
El Salvador, what is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   But peace has not come easily to this country. Since the 1992
political settlement that ended the war, U.S. aid to El Salvador
has dropped dramatically, as it has in the rest of the region, to
$34 million a year compared with $292 million in 1992 and more than
$500 million at the peak of the conflict, U.S. Embassy figures here
show.
</P>
<P>
   The country heavily relies on remittances sent home by
Salvadorans who left during and after the war and now live in the
United States. That money, an average of about $85 million a month,
or more than $1 billion a year, forms El Salvador's largest source
of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the possible deportation of some of the 1.2
million Salvadorans estimated to be living in the United States is
at the top of El Salvador's agenda for Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are seeking legal status for
about 200,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the United States. But
a temporary suspension of deportation proceedings against
undocumented Salvadorans and Guatemalans _ whose numbers surged
after Hurricane Mitch _ expires Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Maria Echaveste, said last week
that the administration saw no need to extend the grace period,
because ``the countries can absorb the return of illegal
immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Zablah-Touche, El Salvador's minister of economy,
disputed that view and said his government would push for inclusion
of Salvadorans in the amnesty benefits granted to Nicaraguans in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are poor, small countries that have suffered internal
conflicts and now have had a decade of doing things right,''
Zablah-Touche said in an interview. ``But it's costing a lot and we
need a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The help Central American governments uniformly want, and
contend best serves the interests of both sides, is a free-trade
agreement that would extend to Central America the benefits Mexico
receives under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced last week that it was
seeking temporary enhancement of the Caribbean Basin Initiative
program for textile and apparel Central American products as
another way to deal with posthurricane recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But the countries say that free-trade-agreement parity is
crucial to compete with Mexico for foreign trade and investment and
to generate jobs, and the topic is sure to dominate discussions at
the regional summit meeting with Clinton in Guatemala.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``These countries have undertaken in the last five years big
reforms _ reducing inflation, trying to put their house in order,''
said Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development
Bank in Washington. ``It'd do a lot of good if they had more
investments and more exports, and that's why cooperation with the
United States is extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of Clinton's trip, though, is to survey firsthand the
damage caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed at least 9,000
people, left thousands more missing, mostly in Honduras and
Nicaragua, wiped out export crops, wrecked roads and wells and
caused damage estimated at $7 billion to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The president has asked Congress for $956 million in emergency
reconstruction funds for Central America and for the Caribbean
countries damaged by Hurricane Georges, in addition to about $300
million already spent on disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said their relief package also includes
a deferral of $600 million in interest payments for Honduras and
Nicaragua, the two severely indebted countries in Central America,
with an external public debt of $3.7 billion and $6.2 billion
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary assessment by international financial institutions
found that Hurricane Mitch affected about one quarter of the total
population of the four countries in one way or another. A sharp
fall in exports like bananas and coffee is expected, while
inflation, unemployment and fiscal deficits are sure to rise, the
institutions said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now people are trying to decide whether they're going to
move to Costa Rica or the United States or whatever, or whether
they think they might have a livelihood for themselves in their own
country,'' the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, Brian Atwood, said at a news briefing in Washington
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency comes at a time when the countries are still
grappling with the political and social effects of the violence
that ripped apart their societies. More than nine years after their
civil war ended, Nicaraguans remain divided to the point of
paralysis on economic and political issues.
</P>
<P>
   In El Salvador, one of the highest crime rates in Latin America
is attributed to the availability of arms after the war, the number
of former combatants without jobs, and the disintegration of
families, which caused many children to grow up without one or both
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But the aftermath is starkest in Guatemala, where a war of over
three decades caused more than 200,000 deaths and disappearances
and the exile or displacement of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Many Guatemalans and Central American experts say Clinton, who
is visiting at a critical moment in the efforts to maintain peace,
should give his unequivocal endorsement to carrying out peace
accords brokered by the United Nations in 1996 and bringing war
criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Some also advocate that Clinton acknowledge U.S. support of
repressive armies and offer an apology in light of the truth
commission's report, which recommended that Guatemala's president
and guerrilla leaders, who have regrouped as a political party, ask
the forgiveness of all Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were keen, he should apologize and declare that his
policy is to never again support deviations such as the ones that
occurred,'' said Alfonso Bauer Paiz, who served in the
administration of President Jacobo Arbenz, a left-leaning elected
president who was removed in a military coup in 1954 engineered by
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a National Security Council spokesman, said he
could not rule out that Clinton would not address the matter. ``We
have to acknowledge the past but also work toward the future,'' he
said. ``We're trying to move forward to deal with issues of the
future.''

DEAL IS FINALLY WORKED OUT FOR ORIOLES-CUBA EXHIBITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete writethru to reflect agreement on Orioles-Cuba
game.)  (js) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAINES CITY, Fla. _ After two days of meetings bogged down in
questions of wording, the Baltimore Orioles are set to play the
Cuban national team in Havana on March 28. A second game in
Baltimore remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming State Department objections, representatives of Major
League Baseball, the Orioles and the Cuban government emerged
Saturday night from a four-hour meeting with an agreement for the
Havana game, a participant in the meeting said. The
representatives, he said, would try to conclude negotiations for a
game in Baltimore as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the participant cautioned that the Cuban representatives at
the meetings Friday and Saturday still had to get final approval
from Cuba _ presumably from Fidel Castro _ and that the Players
Association still had to agree to the Havana game even if a
Baltimore game is not arranged. The Players Association, he said,
wants a two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and Orioles officials thought they had an agreement in
principle Friday, but they learned at a meeting that night that the
State Department thought otherwise. When the approximately
eight-hour meeting ended shortly after 4 a.m. Saturday, no
agreement was in place.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the meetings said the game had been put
on hold by State Department objections to the proposed recipients
of any proceeds from the game. The fate of the proceeds apparently
was not determined definitively at Saturday night's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The first participant said the details of the proceeds would be
worked out to the satisfaction of all parties, but they would be
used mainly for baseball-related endeavors. Much of the
disagreement over the proceeds was centered on wording, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case of everybody getting comfortable with the
language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball people who attended the Friday meeting expected it
to be relatively brief, perhaps an hour and a half, with the topics
of discussion logistics for the game in Cuba and a possible second
game in Baltimore. They expected to put in place the deal in
principle that had been reached earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, one of the participants said, had told the
commissioner's office and the Orioles to make an agreement with the
Cuban government, which they did. ``But then,'' the person said,
``they came in and said conditions had to be changed. That happened
about four times last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those present at the meetings were three representatives
from the State Department; four from the Cuban government; Sandy
Alderson of Major League Baseball; Peter Angelos of the Orioles;
William Schweitzer, the American League lawyer, and Michael Weiner
and Tony Bernazard of the Players Association.

WHO ARE BEST BETS TO LOSE TO DUKE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here's one way to look at today's highly anticipated,
greatly awaited announcement of the teams, seedings and brackets
for the NCAA basketball tournament:
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   Why should it? No one is going to beat Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils, who went unbeaten during the Atlantic Coast
Conference regular season and will wrap up the ACC Tournament when
they beat North Carolina by 30 today, are everybody's choice to win
the last national championship before that Y2K thing wreaks such
havoc with the computer rankings that next year's champ will be
Quinnipiac.
</P>
<P>
   Even Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr agree (or would if they were
asked, probably): Duke is No. 1, and everyone else is way, way
outside college basketball's beltway. So who cares what Digger,
Dick and Billy, not to mention Spanky, Alfalfa and Buckwheat, have
to say about the rest of the field, about who gets in and who
doesn't, about the seedings and the sites?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we all do. That's why we love what has become known as
``Selection Sunday.'' It's why teams have been giving their all
during what we call ``Championship Week,'' and why ``the Big
Dance,'' and ``on the bubble'' have become what are known as
``obnoxious cliches'' that we keep using because there really
aren't any other words in the English language that quite sum it
all up.
</P>
<P>
   So let's start by figuring out the No. 1 seeds, knowing full
well that at least one No. 1 seed has made the Final Four every
year since 1979, but only twice have three No. 1 seeds made it and
never all four. In other words, it's good, but not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   There is Duke, of course, and Connecticut, which destroyed St.
John's to win the Big East Tournament championship Saturday night.
Michigan State has to play the hottest team on the planet, hotter
even than Duke, today in the Big Ten Tournament final. That team,
of course, is Illinois, which has racked up upset after upset.
Until today. The Fighting Illini will fight but lose, and the
Spartans will win and be a No. 1 seed. Should the unheard of happen
and Illinois wins, it doesn't matter who the No. 1 seeds are
because the entire NCAA Tournament will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   One big question regarding the final No. 1 seed _ Stanford or
Auburn? _ apparently was resolved late Saturday night when Stanford
lost at Oregon State. Sorry, folks, but no way the Cardinal should
be a top seed. Losing to the Beavers isn't quite the same as Auburn
losing to Kentucky in the Southeastern Conference Tournament
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Stanford had won, Auburn still deserved it. Why? Think
back to Feb. 6, which technically is less than a month ago because
February has just 28 days (except in a leap year, which this is
not. Nor will next year be, because that Y2K thing will mess up all
the calendars). It was then that Connecticut hopped a plane, flew
3,000 miles to play at Stanford, learned that its best player,
Richard Hamilton, was in too much pain to play and then beat the
Cardinal, 70-59. That was telling.
</P>
<P>
   Or try this: Imagine Auburn and Stanford playing on a neutral
site. Can't you just picture the Auburn players flying past
Stanford's as if they were glued to the floor? Auburn is faster,
quicker, more athletic and ultimately better. Which doesn't mean
the tournament selection committee will see it that way, but it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Now, where will the No. 1 seeds play? The conventional wisdom is
that Duke is headed to the East regional, where it can play its
first- and second-round games in Charlotte, N.C., which is located
three 7-Elevens from its campus. This seems right, because it
sounds so much like something the NCAA would do.
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to geography, that would logically place Auburn in the
South, Michigan State in the Midwest and . . . Connecticut in the
West. OK, look, don't tell Rand McNally.
</P>
<P>
   There were several upsets in the conference tournaments _ North
Carolina over Maryland, North Carolina-Charlotte over Cincinnati,
Illinois over everybody _ that make the rest of the top-seeded
teams a scramble. It will be interesting to see how much weight the
committee places on tournament losses. It also would be interesting
to see the room service bill after nine guys stay cooped up in a
hotel suite for several days.
</P>
<P>
   And what of UCLA, which lost big at Arizona on Saturday and
might have lost its best player, point guard Baron Davis, for the
first two games with an injured toe? Even with the loss, the Bruins
were no worse than a No. 4 seed. Without Davis, or with a wobbly
Davis, they might drop.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the Pac-10, when Oregon lost to Stanford on
Thursday, the Ducks lost out on the tournament. California did the
same _ or should have _ by losing to Oregon on Saturday. But you
never know. The Pac-10 is popular, and Cal might get in. If not,
it's Stanford, Arizona, UCLA and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cal's players and coaches will be engaged in a group
sweat-a-thon awaiting today's announcement. But the Golden Bears
will have company. Purdue and Minnesota, who were supposed to give
the Big Ten seven tournament teams, have lately played like they
couldn't beat Quinnipiac.
</P>
<P>
   Will the mighty ACC only get three teams in? Even though only
three teams really, really deserve it, it's unlikely. North
Carolina State or Wake Forest _ but please, not both _ probably
gets a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma and Nebraska, not long ago considered shoo-ins for the
tournament, are in danger of becoming shoo-outs. Rutgers' prospects
are sinking into the New Jersey swamps. DePaul and
Alabama-Birmingham, Southwest Missouri State and Evansville,
Mississippi State and Mississippi and Toledo probably didn't sleep
well Saturday night. &QL;

SUNS GET BOOED AND DESERVE IT  
 FALL FLAT ON FACES IN LOSS TO KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - That wasn't ``Gooooogs'' you heard emanating from
America West Arena on Saturday night. It wasn't ``Luuuuuuuc,''
either.
</P>
<P>
   Those were boos, baby.
</P>
<P>
   They came as loud and lusty as Suns fans have given it to the
home team since their abysmal 0-13 start in 1996-97. And the Suns
earned every bit of it.
</P>
<P>
   They backed up the most complete game they have played all
season in Seattle on Thursday night with their most complete
disaster in a 111-99 loss to the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings hadn't won in Phoenix in 24 tries before breaking
through earlier this season. Led by Jason Williams, the rookie
point guard with brass and flash, the Kings led by 23 in the first
half and coasted to their second win in a row at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we like this arena now,'' Kings center Vlade Divac
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Suns who don't seem to like it. They fell to 4-5 on
their own floor .
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a damn shame,'' forward George McCloud said. ``In this
league, you've got to play hard every night, and you've got to
protect your home court. We didn't play smart, we jacked up bad
shots, and we played soft.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty fair assessment. And Coach Danny Ainge said the
booing was fair, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show up here for our home fans,'' Ainge said.
``They were booing us, and they should be. If I had paid to see
that game, I would have been very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   While beating the Kings hasn't been a problem for the Suns in
the recent past, it was an important game for the Suns this time.
With the earlier victory in Phoenix and only one more meeting
between the clubs during this lockout-shortened season, Sacramento
already has captured the head-to-head tiebreaker for playoff
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (8-9) figure to be one of the teams the Suns (9-8) are
battling with for one of the final Western Conference postseason
berths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman
said. ``The first half was probably as well as we've played. We
shot it well, we passed it well. We were so active that we got them
back on their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Suns were a step behind in transition
defense, giving layups, dunks, three-point shots, whatever the
Kings wanted in the first half. It wasn't even that the Suns
fumbled along on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't even inbound the ball on a couple of occasions
without throwing it away and finished with a season-high 21
turnovers that led to 20 Sacramento points. The Kings turned it
over 22 times themselves, but they came into the game leading the
league in turnovers with their up-tempo, freewheeling style.
</P>
<P>
   During one miserable second-quarter stretch, the Suns managed to
get only one shot off in six possessions, and missed that one. A
smattering of boos sprinkled the crowd during a timeout with 9:13
to go in the second period after the Kings started on a 7-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   The hoots got a little more intense after Jon Barry stole an
inbound pass from Danny Manning and hit a three-point shot. And
they really let the Suns have it when Barry, now made to look like
an All-Star, hit yet another three with 6:47 to go that gave the
Kings a 23-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the margin remained at halftime, with the Kings
leading, 66-43.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Suns raised their defensive effort,
Tom Gugliotta got going offensively, and they got back into the
game by forcing seven Sacramento turnovers, which the Suns
converted for eight points. The result was a 29-point Phoenix
quarter. A 9-2 finish cut the Kings' lead to 14.
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Kidd playing full out on his way to 21 points, 11
assists, nine rebounds and five steals, the Suns kept the run going
early in the fourth quarter, trimming it to 10 with 10:09 to play
on Clifford Robinson's short jump hook.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Suns cut the Kings lead to eight points on a
couple of occasions, but they expended too much to get back into it
and never came any closer.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said it wasn't just the defense, the passing or the
sloppiness with the ball that were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's an attitude,'' Ainge said. ``It's effort. We can
have any kind of defense we want, if we play it like we did tonight
with no urgency, no pride, we have nights like this. It's not the
first time it's happened to us.'' &QL;

HOLYFIELD MAKES HEARTY CLAIM  
 VOWS KO IN 3RD ROUND VS. LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a quiet man in a very loud place. If it weren't for the
punches he throws and takes, it would be easy to say he doesn't
belong at all.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something else about Evander Holyfield. The
self-proclaimed humble warrior has strung together more surprises
than nearly anybody still active in a conflicted business built on
schlock and shock.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter with a couple of upsets over Mike Tyson at the price
of his ears is noted for his courage. He's said to have a great
heart. That's a cliche, but a diagnosed coronary problem a few
years ago was not. He's a religious man who fathered two children
with a woman other than his wife, Janice.
</P>
<P>
   Humble, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing simple about him or, perhaps, any other
great fighter. Survival isn't always simple. It's often about
throwing the unseen punch or acting in a fashion contrary to what
is assumed or expected.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to his reputation for humility, he said in a
conference call last week that he would knock out Lennox Lewis in
the third round next Saturday at New York's Madison Square Garden
in a bout that will unify the heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not predicting,'' said the preacher-turned-prophet, who
repeated the promise Friday night on the ``Tonight Show with Jay
Leno.'' ``I am telling you and everyone: I am knocking him out in
the third round.''
</P>
<P>
   From a fighter not known to boast, it was matter-of-fact. There
were no flourishes, but it still had the confident ring that used
to come with pronouncements from Muhammad Ali, who will be in the
Valley this week for a benefit on behalf of the Parkinson's
Research Center that stands in his name at the Barrow Neurological
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   From Lewis' perspective, it was a sign of panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fail to see the realism in that,'' Lewis said last week,
also in a conference call. ``Evander Holyfield has never knocked
anybody out in three rounds. Me being his toughest opponent out
there, I still fail to see the realism in that kind of comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's interesting that he is making predictions for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his corner is surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of came as a shock to me,'' Holyfield trainer Don
Turner said in still another conference call. ``But I took it a
step further and asked him: `What are the other two rounds for?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure when he said something like that, Lennox Lewis
changed gears.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Holyfield and Lewis have been verbally sparring in an
attempt to gain a psychological edge before the best heavyweight
clash at Madison Square Garden since Joe Frazier's stirring
decision over Ali on March 8, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been charging Holyfield with hypocrisy for fathering
children out of wedlock while being very public about his religious
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only speaking from reality,'' said Lewis, the World Boxing
Council champion and the underdog in his attempt to take the World
Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation titles from
Holyfield. ``I'm only saying what people think. If I say that I
don't drink, yet I go out and drink, then I am a hypocrite. Simple
as that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just stating the obvious. For him to get upset makes me
believe that the truth hurts. That's actually happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not clear at all. Holyfield has possessed an
almost eerie sense of calm in the moments before his last few
fights. As Tyson raged and glared in the long walk from the
dressing room to the ring, Holyfield smiled and cast his eyes
skyward. It was almost as if he knew he couldn't lose.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of people who believe Holyfield will fall this
time. At 6-foot-2 and a projected 215 pounds, he's had difficulty
against bigger heavyweights. Riddick Bowe and George Foreman are
two examples. At 6-foot-5 and a projected 250, Lewis is big, very
big.
</P>
<P>
   But there are doubts about whether Lewis has more than imposing
size and a powerful punch. His courage _ his willingness to fight _
has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare they question my heart,'' said Lewis, who was knocked
out by Oliver McCall and has never faced Tyson, Bowe or even
Foreman. ``Holyfield doesn't have the monopoly on hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to. One heart _ Holyfield's own _ has been more
than enough for an ever-surprising fighter. &QL;

GOAL DISORIENTED  
 KHABIBULIN'S INJURY LEAVES COYOTES IN JAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As quandaries go, the one the Coyotes face with their
goaltending situation is a beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Nikolai Khabibulin is bothered by a tender groin and any
decision on whether to start him tonight against Nashville will be
made by exercising overwhelming caution. Indications are he will
play because emergency backup Scott Langkow was returned to Utah of
the International Hockey League on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the Coyotes having lost nine of their past 10 games, and
Anaheim breathing down their neck just three points behind in the
race for the Western Conference's No. 4 seed _ including home-ice
advantage in the first round of the playoffs _ an understandable
urge is to rush Khabibulin back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niki is our man. We can't afford to rush him back before he's
ready,'' Keith Tkachuk said. ``We don't want to go into the
playoffs with him hurting, or without him. That would be too
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup goalie Jimmy Waite was sensational while starting the
season with a 6-0-2 record. But he has not won a game since Dec. 9,
when he bested Montreal, 4-2, and has gone 0-5-2 since.
</P>
<P>
   The team sent him to Springfield of the American Hockey League
for six games to work on his sagging confidence. His return Friday
night was greeted by disaster as he allowed Detroit four goals on
10 shots and was pulled in the second period for Langkow, who was
summoned from Utah Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of their goals were pretty good ones,'' Waite said.
``One came on a good deflection and on another one they skated in
two-on-one and put it by me. I don't think anyone would have
stopped those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it definitely wasn't the kind of night I hoped for. It's
been tough on me and tough on the team. I was sent to Springfield
and I was feeling good down there. I didn't give up any bad goals
and it was good to play in a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Langkow is basically untested at the NHL level, which makes him
a reluctant choice for play down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' said Langkow, who started the
season at Las Vegas of the IHL before moving to Utah when the
Coyotes terminated their agreement with Las Vegas. ``If I get a
chance to play, great. If not, I'll be ready if I do get some
action. I can't worry about things I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   But unless Waite steps up, Khabibulin's work load, which saw him
work 22 of 25 games while acquiring his injury, is not going to be
eased. His tender groin will be overly exposed entering the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Is a trade a possibility? League sources say Edmonton is
shopping backup Mikhail Shtalenko, who is 12-16-3 this season with
a 2.61 goals-against average. However, Coyotes General Manager
Bobby Smith said it is difficult to trade for goalies right now.
</P>
<P>
   Each NHL team must expose a goalie in the upcoming expansion
draft. After Jan. 4, to be exposed a goalie must have played 15
games (a minimum of 31 minutes constitutes a game) this season, or
25 in the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say if the Islanders traded Tommy Salo. It would mean they
would have to then acquire a goalie who has played in 15 NHL games,
or expose Felix Potvin to expansion,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   If Shtalenko were dealt, the Oilers would face the same dilemma
with No. 1 goalie Bob Essensa, leaving them without a top goalie.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hoped Waite regains his early season form _ quickly. And
he'll have to do it with a defense missing Gerald Diduck (broken
foot) and Jyrki Lumme (shoulder) for most of the final six weeks of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy had a tough night against Detroit,'' Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said. ``I don't want to throw this whole thing on him
because it's not right to do. He was probably the only person who
felt worse than I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to rally around him the next time
he's in net. Goaltending can give a team a big boost, or take the
life out of it, like it did Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky added, ``We are allowing too many
scoring chances. Sooner or later, any goalie is going to give up
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Khabibulin, he said his groin was sore after Saturday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too bad, but it's in the same spot as last year,''
said Khabibulin, who didn't know if he'll be able to play tonight. &QL;

ANOTHER CLOSE LOSS ENDS ASU'S SEASON  
 EVANS QUESTIONS HIS PLAYERS' WILL TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Arizona State's basketball past was honored
Saturday, after which the present came to an abrupt halt.
</P>
<P>
   On a day the court was named for former Coach Ned Wulk, the Sun
Devils needed to beat Southern California in the last game of the
year to earn consideration for the NIT and prolong their first
season under new Coach Rob Evans.
</P>
<P>
   To pull that off, ASU had to reverse an annoying trend of
getting crunched during crunch time. It needed to find a resolve
and inner strength lacking during many second halves this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils again failed at that and lost, 84-73, to an
athletic but otherwise nondescript USC team in front of 7,308 at
Ned Wulk Court. ASU's seventh defeat in eight games left it with a
14-16 record, 6-12 in the Pac-10, which was better than only
Washington State. There will be no postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   The loss also left Evans relieved the season is over, which
seemed unthinkable considering his competitive drive and spirit.
But therein lies the problem; such drive and spirit probably
exceeded the team's as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's hard to coach when you feel you want it more
than the guys out there,'' he said. ``But those are traits that are
learned. . . .I can't make them want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans certainly tried, however, using heretofore unseen
combinations of players and taking a technical foul to try to
ignite a spark. And it temporarily worked. With walk-on Brad Nahra
and former walk-on Ron DuBois on the floor, and Evans getting T'ed
up right in front of a courtside Booker Turner, the Pac-10
coordinator of officials, the Sun Devils turned a 52-42 deficit
with 11:36 to go into a 55-54 lead over the next four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Evans was concerned he had to resort to the equivalent of
CPR to restore a heartbeat to his club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing everything we could on the sidelines to get them
moving,'' he said. ``They weren't moving very well on the offensive
end. I took every timeout I could to get them to move. And then I
just decided to see if I could fire them up a little bit, by making
some changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought in a couple of guys and I was hoping, like I told
them in the huddle when I got the technical, to make it a them
against us type thing. But it says a little about your situation
when you have two walk-ons that come in, and those are the guys
that get you going. That's difficult for me to understand. I
understand it, but it's difficult to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   And the problem with artificial stimulation is that it's just
that, artificial, and usually doesn't last. So neither did ASU's
lead. On the next USC possession, Eddie House fouled Elias Ayuso on
a three-point attempt. Ayuso made all three foul shots to put the
Trojans up, 57-55. Then, after ASU guard Alton Mason lost the ball,
Adam Spanich was left open to hit a three-point basket, and USC
(15-12, 7-11) led by five.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils twice got to within one, but could not force the
stop they needed. USC, which shot 65.2 percent in the second half
and 60.8 percent for the game, kept making baskets and free throws.
</P>
<P>
   In his final game, ASU senior forward Bobby Lazor had 30 points
and 11 rebounds. His fellow senior, forward Mike Batiste, had 17
points. But the 6-foot-8 Batiste had just two rebounds, three fewer
than House, a 6-1 guard. This also was the last game for DuBois,
who got to start.
</P>
<P>
   House, a junior who leads the Sun Devils in scoring, made just 2
of 8 shots and had five points, a season-low. He suffered a
slightly sprained ankle in the second half, but didn't use that as
a reason. Actually, he had no reason for his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said, letting out a big sigh. ``I'm just
ready to go home to my family, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   House, Batiste and Lazor all made the 10-player All Pac-10 team,
and no other team had three players on it. One left off was Ayuso,
a senior guard who made 9 of 13 shots for 25 points. That tied a
career-high set last year, also against the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   USC sophomore forward Brian Scalabrine made 9 of 10 shots and
scored 21 points, two days after he was scoreless against Arizona.
Evans said keeping the ball away from Scalabrine and double-teaming
when he did get it was stressed in practice, but failed to

   ``He's a nice basketball player, but you get out and attack him,
battle him, he's not the most versatile, agile player,'' Evans
said. ``But you don't get to him, he's a very skilled player.''

BELL LIKELY TO FOLLOW WOM ACK IN LINEUP

   TUCSON _ It is a virtual certainty that  &UR; Tony Womack will be the
Diamondbacks' leadoff hitter most of the season. But who will draw
the No. 2 assignment of moving him along and setting the table for
the heavy hitters _  &UR; Steve Finley, Travis Lee and  &UR; Matt Williams?
</P>
<P>
   The man most likely to be in that spot is veteran  &UR; Jay Bell, who
also is moving from shortstop to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has four hits in his first eight at-bats while hitting
second this spring, including two in Saturday's 11-6 victory over
the Chicago White Sox at Tucson Electric Park. It was Arizona's
second straight win after dropping its opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of different scenarios, depending on
match-ups and so forth, but Jay seems to be a good fit there,''
Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter said. ``He knows how to handle the bat, usually takes a
lot of pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell began the 1998 season in the No. 2 spot but struggled a bit
and spent most of the second half in the No. 6 spot. He hit at No.
6 57 times, No. 2 47 times, No. 3 30 times and No. 5 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable hitting there,'' Bell said. ``I can work the
hit-and-run pretty well, I can bunt the ball, and I walk a lot (81
times last season). I like to drive in runs, but scoring them is
equally important. I'm hoping I can have the best of both worlds,
setting the guys up and maybe driving Tony in if he doubles or gets
on and steals second.'' &QL; 
Kim update &QL; 
General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. returned to Phoenix late Friday
night and was at Saturday's game after a long trip to South Korea
to set up the move of right-hander  &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim to the
Diamondbacks. The 20-year-old signed Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola visited the U.S. Consulate to get assistance with
paperwork. Once that is completed, Kim will be able to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Kim will join the 40-man roster, Garagiola said, ``When
he arrives, we will watch him and assess where he is, his pitching
shape, and then make a determination on his assignment.'' &QL; 
Short stops &QL; 
The team sent right-handed pitchers  &UR; Brad Penny and  &UR; John Patterson
and left-hander  &UR; Nick Bierbrodt to its minor league camp for
reassignment. Minor league pitchers and catchers will work out
today for the first time. Three more players are expected to be
reassigned today and three more Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander  &UR; Randy Johnson is scheduled to make his first
official Cactus League start today against the Chicago White Sox at
Tucson Electric Park. He pitched two innings against the University
of Arizona on Wednesday and struck out four of the six batters he
faced. There is a chance of showers today, and Showalter said that
if the game is canceled, Johnson likely will throw in simulated
game conditions in one of the covered batting cages. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN EARN NCAA BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps when one thinks of big-time Division I
athletics, one doesn't think of Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when an athlete gets recruited by a Division I
institution that promises big-time exposure and a chance to play in
the NCAA Tournament, Northridge doesn't come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this group of 11 women's basketball players bought into the
dream first presented by Michael Abraham and furthered by Frozena
Jerro: That Northridge can be a school in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   And it is, by virtue of its 79-65 victory Saturday over Portland
State in the Big Sky Conference tournament final at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone came from big, winning teams,'' guard LaShaunda
Fowler said. ``All of us had the skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all fighters,'' post player Neda Milic said. ``We don't
give up.''
</P>
<P>
   From a drug trafficking arrest to two coaching changes to a slow
start, Northridge has seen the lows. Now, it's one of 64 teams in
the penthouse after achieving what many thought was unachievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 11 people on a team that is strong,'' tournament MVP
Edniesha Curry said. ``We've been a family, from preseason to now.
If someone's in trouble, you know you can lean left or right, and
someone's going to be on your back.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA bracket will be announced today on ESPN at 2:15 p.m.
Sources close to Northridge believe the Matadors (21-7) will be
seeded 16th in the West and travel to Colorado State, the expected
top seed in the West Region, for a first-round matchup Thursday or
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the men's tournament, the first two rounds of the women's
tournament are at on-campus sites.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the Matadors' custom, they started slowly before
exploding in the second half Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, also keeping with custom, led the charge, scoring five
points in 19 seconds and 10 points in 3:27 to key a 15-4 Northridge
run that turned a 33-31 lead into a 48-35 advantage with 13:44 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's semifinal victory over Northern Arizona, she scored
17 points in 5:07.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let the game come to me,'' Curry said. ``If I score 20
points in two minutes or 20 points the whole game, it doesn't
matter. I feel the energy from (teammates' defense). That helps me
excel in the offensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry finished with a game-high 23 points. Lynda Amari also made
the all-tournament team with a 14-point, nine-rebound effort. Milic
came off the bench to score 13 points and guard Tina Greer had 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   Portland State (18-10) got 15 points from sophomore forward
Robbie Nix, the conference's Sixth Man Award winner, and 13 points
from guard Monique Zampera. Nix and forward Carrie Hawes (8 points,
8 rebounds) made all-tournament.
</P>
<P>
   PSU coach Jenny Yopp said Northridge's defense played a role
down the stretch. The Vikings were within striking distance,
trailing 67-62, with 3:57 to play, only to be outscored 12-0 in the
next 3:53. The team finished shooting 38.8 percent from the field,
compared to 46.2 percent for Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit goes to Northridge's defense,'' Yopp said. ``They kept
the heat on defensively. The pressure they put on our guards took
us out of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Big Dance awaits. Jerro has been to the NCAAs, as a
player on the 1992 Arizona State team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great when you lay it on the line and you get what you
want,'' she said. ``When you get into the NCAA Tournament, it's one
of the greatest experiences for a college athlete. I'm glad the
girls can experience it.''

WAITING FOR SEASON TO START IS THE HARDEST PART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By POALA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - April 5.  &UR; Randy Johnson. Kevin Brown. Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Are we there yet?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Russ Davis' error-prone ways last season (34 in 141 games)
prompted fans to offer the Seattle third baseman some possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   One came up with the idea that Davis should play without a, er,
protective cup, suggesting that the sheer terror of such an injury
would help him react.
</P>
<P>
   Position battle of the week: Keep an eye on how things shake out
in center field for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; Ellis Burks re-signed with the team, he insisted on a move
from center to right. That leaves a battle for center among  &UR; Marvin
Benard, who batted .322 as a leadoff hitter last season, veteran
 &UR; Stan Javier and rookie  &UR; Armando Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Only three players on the White Sox spring training roster have
reached their 30th birthdays: designated hitter  &UR; Frank
 &UR; Thomas, pitcher  &UR; Jaime Navarro and pitcher  &UR; Darren Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' fifth starting spot remains open, with left-hander
 &UR; Terry Mulholland and free-agent acquisition  &UR; Scott Sanders among
the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle outfielder  &UR; Butch Huskey is petitioning Major League
Baseball for the right to wear 42, the number his idol,  &UR; Jackie
 &UR; Robinson, wore while breaking baseball's color barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey always wore 42 but has 36 in camp because Robinson's
number was retired last season. He has 42 on the back of his
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects worth keeping an eye on:
</P>
<P>
   Angels right-hander  &UR; Ramon Ortiz, whose 94 mph fastball belies
his 6-foot, 165-pound frame, and White Sox pitcher  &UR; Kip Wells, a
6-3, 195-pound right-hander who struck out five of the eight
hitters he faced in a recent intrasquad game.
</P>
<P>
   We're predicting a big year from Cubs outfielder  &UR; Henry
 &UR; Rodriguez, who was slowed by a severe ankle sprain late last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez will be the first left fielder to start consecutive
opening days for the Cubs since  &UR; Brian Dayett 1986 and '87.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor making the Cactus League rounds: The White Sox will send
Navarro to San Diego for closer  &UR; Randy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to see Colorado's  &UR; Larry Walker, the Most Valuable
Player in 1997 and the National League batting champion in '98,
secure a long-term, big-money deal. Watch for another huge season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume pitcher  &UR; Jim Abbott is a gimme when he steps to the
plate this season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Abbott, who was born without a right hand, will be
asked to bunt on occasion, he is more than capable of swinging the
bat and looks better at the plate than some pitchers who were
shellshocked by the offensive requirements of interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott flew out to center in his first spring at-bat Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fire sale in the off-season, let's not forget who
the Padres have at the heart of their order:  &UR; Tony Gwynn,
 &UR; Greg Vaughn and  &UR; Wally Joyner. Add closer  &UR; Trevor Hoffman, and the
team is clearly still competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Only four active players have been with the same teams longer
than the underappreciated and unassuming  &UR; Edgar Martinez, who has
played 12 with Seattle: Baltimore's  &UR; Cal Ripken (18 years), Gwynn
(17), Cincinnati's  &UR; Barry Larkin (13) and Anaheim's  &UR; Chuck Finley
(13).
</P>
<P>
   Words of wisdom:
</P>
<P>
   Chicago White Sox General Manager  &UR; Ron Schueler, on Navarro
missing his first day of camp: ``Maybe he had a visa problem
getting out of Wisconsin where he lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs first baseman  &UR; Mark Grace: ``We're not an old team. Well,
(40-year-old infielder Gary) Gaetti is old.''
</P>
<P>
   This and that:
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a young Cactus League pitcher facing this Seattle order:
 &UR; Alex
 &UR; Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., Martinez,  &UR; David Segui and  &UR; Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs Manager  &UR; Jim Riggleman has set 200 as the maximum number of
innings he'd like to see  &UR; Kerry Wood throw in 1999. Wood was
bothered by elbow problems late last season. &QL;

BASEBALL MISSES CHANCE TO TAKE TOBACCO STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent legislation against the tobacco industry brought one
significant change in major league baseball clubhouses everywhere.
Tobacco companies will no longer be allowed to send free samples of
their products (mostly smokeless tobacco) to players.
</P>
<P>
   With all the information we have on the dangers of using chewing
tobacco, you would think Major League Baseball officials would have
taken an equally strong stance. But a recent memo sent by
Commissioner Bud Selig fell way short of what it could have done.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the memo signed by Selig, reads ``This office strongly
recommends that you not permit your clubhouse attendant to purchase
products for players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strongly recommends?'' Ooooohhh! Strong stuff there. Selig and
baseball could have taken a cutting edge stance, yet failed.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Diamondbacks, who have the strongest
anti-tobacco campaign of the 30 clubs, went one step further and
issued their own memo, signed by General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola
Jr., that includes termination for any clubhouse employee who
purchases tobacco for players.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have even gone so far as to offer nicotine
patches and/or whatever type of help is necessary for players
wanting to quit. Doctors from the National Spit Tobacco Education
Program (NSTEP) performed oral examinations on 141 willing players
who use tobacco last spring and found an astonishingly-high 83 with
tobacco-related lesions in their mouths. For 15 of them, diagnostic
biopsies were recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask them to think about their wife or girlfriend or
children,'' said  &UR; Joe Garagiola, chairman of NSTEP who has seen
several close friends die due to oral cancer. ``Smokeless does not
mean harmless. It's like taking it intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the players all the time that it's not a failure if
they fall off the wagon. It's part of the quitting process. If they
fall off, try again. I'm not here to tell them to quit; just make
the right choice. All I want them to know is, `Here's what can
happen to you.' It's a decision they all make on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying players should eliminate the use of tobacco all
together (although that would not be such a bad idea). However, if
they want to use tobacco, players are more than free to bring their
own into the clubhouse. Asking a clubhouse attendant to buy it is
inappropriate and unfair to the employee.
</P>
<P>
   On this note, the Diamondbacks deserve credit for taking a
strong proactive stance. Baseball should be watching and doing the
same. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Last year's Cleveland Indians became the seventh club in major
league history to lead their division/league every single day from
opening day to the final game. Name the other six? &QL; 
Pudge, oh Pudge &QL; 
As if Texas catcher  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez hadn't already dug himself a
bit of a hole when he missed the first eight days of workouts _
without ever having called the Rangers to alert them to his
situation _ the perennial All-Star now says the club is paying him
to play and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a leader,'' said Rodriguez, who will
start the second year of a five-year $42 million deal this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates, who must play the diplomat in
this scenario, tried to put as positive a spin as he could on the
situation with Rodriguez, who is upset that the Rangers are
disappointed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a multi-Gold Glove winner, you're looked up to,''
Oates said. ``You don't have any choice about that. In two years,
we're probably not going to remember that Pudge showed up late this
year. We're just disappointed in it.'' &QL; 
Someone who knows &QL; 
Several Los Angeles players were joking about a friendly bet made
last year that still had not been paid off when  &UR; Pete Rose Jr., who
is in the Dodgers camp as a non-roster invitee, approached the
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys better be careful,'' said Rose, holding back a smirk,
``you can get in trouble for that betting stuff.'' &QL; 
Was Hank Cy considered? &QL; 
 &UR; Tom and  &UR; Donna Candiotti had a son last October, naming him  &UR; Casey
 &UR; Koufax Candiotti. The Oakland Athletics pitcher, who grew up in
California a big fan of  &UR; Sandy Koufax and  &UR; Don Drysdale, eventually
got to know Koufax during his days with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   After the birth, the Candiottis sent Koufax, a Hall of Famer, a
letter to inform him of the baby's name. Koufax responded with a
note of his own that read: ``I hope he hits like Casey and pitches
like me.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Starting chronologically, the 1923 New York Giants, the '27 New
York Yankees, the '55 Brooklyn Dodgers, the '84 Detroit Tigers, the
'90 Cincinnati Reds and the 1997 Baltimore Orioles. Of those, the
'27 Yankees, the '55 Dodgers, the '84 Tigers and the '90 Reds went
on to win the World Series. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Talk about filling a guy's shoes: Pitcher &UR; David Wells, who
reluctantly accepted his trade from the Yankees to Toronto last
month, is literally wearing the uniform pants of the pitcher he was
traded for,  &UR; Roger Clemens. ``They fit,'' Wells said of the pants.
``He's got big legs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And now, a special sneak preview?: The Montreal Expos, who are
perilously close to playing their final season in Montreal, will
play two exhibition games at Washington's RFK Stadium on April 2-3.
Officials from the D.C. area and northern Virginia plan to battle
over the right to purchase the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Dave Goltz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One ringing endorsement: Florida pitcher  &UR; A.J.
 &UR; Burnett, considered one of the Marlins top prospects, caused quite
a stir when he arrived at camp bearing a pair of pierced nipples.
Florida minor leaguers are prohibited from wearing facial hair or
earrings. Nipple rings, however, are not covered. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
One of new Atlanta hitting coach  &UR; Don Baylor's primary goals for
the 1999 season is to make  &UR; Chipper Jones a more imposing
right-handed hitter. Of Jones' 108 career home runs, only 12 have
been hit from the right side. ``Opposing managers want to flip him
around to the other side,'' said Baylor, who served as Colorado's
manager the past six years. ``We just want to make them think.''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously worried that the Toronto Blue Jays may be looking for
another spring training home, the town of Dunedin, Fla., is
searching for ways to keep the Blue Jays in the area. One direction
Toronto is looking at is sharing a spring home with Los Angeles in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Manager  &UR; Gene Lamont is thinking of hitting catcher
 &UR; Jason Kendall in the leadoff spot, a place rarely seen by
catchers. But Kendall, who has a career .393 on-base percentage, is
no ordinary catcher. He set the NL record for stolen bases by a
catcher with 26 last season. The big league record is 36 by  &UR; John
 &UR; Wathan in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Manager  &UR; Davey Johnson received a box last week that
contained his 1997 ``The Sporting News'' manager of the year award
for the job he did in directing Baltimore to the playoffs. It
appears the magazine had no forwarding address for Johnson last
season. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Atlanta special assistant  &UR; Bill Lajoie has been spotted at several
of Cincinnati's workouts in recent days. The Braves are apparently
interested in one of the following: First baseman  &UR; Hal &UR; Morris,
pinch hitter  &UR; Mark Sweeney or outfielder  &UR; Jon Nunnally.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon appears to have tipped his hand
as to what kind of club he plans to field this season and running
will be a big part of it. In two intrasquad games last week, the
Reds attempted 10 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems official that Heisman Trophy winner
 &UR; Ricky Williams will not participate in Texas' spring training camp.
Williams' baseball contract was purchased from Montreal by the
Rangers in December for $100,000. In addition, Williams is said to
be about 20 pounds heavier than when his college football career
ended in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Boston first baseman  &UR; Reggie Jefferson is suffering from severe
back pains and has actually floated the idea that his career may be
over. One name the Red Sox may be looking at is Kansas City's  &UR; Jeff
King. Boston's current alternatives would be  &UR; Bob Hamelin or  &UR; Midre
Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Boston, the Red Sox and  &UR; Carlton Fisk may be
reunited once again. Nearly 19 years after he became a free agent
through a technicality, Fisk and the club are talking about having
him return in some capacity. &QL;

<P>
   Jim Calhoun stood in a corridor of Madison Square Garden
Saturday night, holding court after his Connecticut team's 82-63
victory over St. John's for the Big East championship.
</P>
<P>
   This was the matchup, but not the result, that the Big East
wanted to culminate its 20th anniversary season. In January, St.
John's came within a breath of upsetting UConn on this very court,
fueling speculation that the championship game would be a classic
and the dawn of a new conference rivalry. Instead the Huskies burst
St. John's bubble with a sustained ferocity that seemed to surprise
even Calhoun. From the opening player introductions, when UConn
fans transformed the Garden into Gampel Pavilion South, Connecticut
stripped St. John's of any notion it could win this game. The
victory was more dominating, by octaves, than the 19-point margin
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy,'' Calhoun said. ``We talked to the kids a great deal
about playing with a great deal of passion this time of year
because if, in fact, someone is good enough to beat you, make sure
they beat you; don't lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in four years, Connecticut was the Big East
champion. The Huskies joined Georgetown as the only teams to win
back-to-back Big East tournament championships and became the only
team to win regular season and tournament championships twice in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, UConn was an afterthought in the league. Now
it is virtually in a league of its own. And until further notice,
the Garden belongs to the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean?'' Calhoun asked. ``It means an awful lot of
good players come to Connecticut.'' He nodded in the direction of
Scott Burrell, the Nets forward who played for Calhoun. ``I've been
blessed with having some tremendous players play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Connecticut sails off to try to win an elusive national
championship, the Big East is left still trying to rekindle the
sort of rivalries that used to be its backbone.
</P>
<P>
   When Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese kicked off Big East
Tournament week he acknowledged Pearl Washington, the former
Syracuse star. Then Tranghese recalled the Big East championship
game in 1984 between Syracuse and Georgetown, a game still
remembered as one of the fiercest championship games in Big East
history with Michael Graham decking Syracuse's Andre Hawkins, the
game going into overtime and Jim Boeheim storming off the podium,
knocking over a folding chair as he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really had to be there,'' Tranghese said. Like many fans
of the era, the commissioner longed for that time when the Big East
was legendary.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalries were forged not by teams or institutions but by
personalities. John Thompson and Rick Pitino going at it, with
Thompson calling Pitino a ``young punk'' and Pitino shouting:
``Grow up, John.'' Or Lou Carnesecca calling Rollie Massimino a
``Hollywood Hotdog'' a year after Massimino led Villanova to the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities faded and the thrill was gone as well. But
there was a resurgence of bad blood and angst over the last week.
The tension was back, largely because St. John's was back. At least
before Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In January UConn overcame a 12-point deficit and handed St.
John's a 78-74 defeat at Madison Square Garden. After that loss,
Jarvis said: ``We can play with them _ and we can beat them. And
they know it. The day will come, I hope sooner than later. We will
beat them. In our house. Madison Square Garden. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing friendly about this rivalry. The tension
between the coaches has deep roots. Calhoun, 56, and Jarvis, 53,
first met as players: Jarvis at Northeastern, Calhoun at American
International. In 1972, Calhoun was hired to coach Northeastern,
effectively passing over Jarvis, who had been an assistant at
Northeastern since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis left after a season and took a job as assistant coach at
Harvard then got his first head coaching job in 1985 when he became
head coach at Boston University. Saturday night's championship game
marked the eighth time Calhoun and Jarvis have met. Calhoun leads
the series 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the two grew out of Calhoun's one loss _ an
80-71 defeat in December 1986 in a game at B.U. It was Calhoun's
fifth game at UConn.
</P>
<P>
   The team bus was involved in an accident beforehand and UConn
wanted to postpone the game. B.U. told the Huskies they would have
to forfeit if they didn't show. Calhoun said Jarvis did not give
his team enough time to warm up and vowed never to play B.U. again.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship took another turn last year when Jarvis and
Calhoun were honored at the America East Conference 20th
anniversary banquet. Jarvis spoke first, offering insights and
comments about his accomplishments. When Calhoun stepped up to
podium that was close to a wall, he said he was surprised there was
enough room to accommodate Jarvis and his ego. Will the Big East
ever recapture its glow of the 1980s? If Calhoun's relationship
with Jarvis is any indication, the answer is a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese put his finger on it earlier this week. What makes the
Big East so tantalizing is the mix and clash of personalities. It's
never business, it's personal.

ROBITAILLE HAS SENSE OF URGENCY

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ As far as Luc Robitaille is concerned, the
finals have arrived, and those of his teammates not ready to
contribute in this premature pursuit of Lord Stanley's Cup would be
well-advised to take a seat at the end of the nearest bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, unfortunately, we don't have time to wait for guys
that are struggling,'' Robitaille said before Saturday night's game
at the Forum against the Calgary Flames. ``We've got to go with the
guys that are just saying, `Screw it, I'm going to do whatever it
takes to win.' If you're in the Stanley Cup finals and you had a
guy struggling a little bit, you can't just keep giving him ice
time to get him out of his slump. You've got to go with whoever is
hot or whoever is working hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our Stanley Cup finals right now for this season.
That's what everybody has to understand. It goes from the players,
the trainers, equipment manager, the coach, everybody. This is our
playoffs, this next week. It's not time to do anything outside the
ice. It's time to get ready. These are the most important games of
our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille said the time has come for the coaching staff to
become undemocratic in the distribution of ice time. He insisted
that he hasn't given up hope, even though a playoff berth is
starting to look remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, it's frustrating right now,'' he said. ``But I'm a
positive guy. I still believe. ... There's no excuse, guys that are
tired, whatever. It's time to play the guys that want to win, and
even guys that aren't playing as much, it's time for guys to pick
it up a notch. There's no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand reward (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after he played in his 1,000th NHL game, Kings
defenseman Garry Galley's wife decorated their home with 1,000
roses.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, when Ray Ferraro returned home from Dallas after
playing in his 1,000th game, his wife, Tracey, led him into the
garage. Awaiting him was a red 1965 Mustang convertible in mint
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' Ferraro said. ``I just always liked it. I
always thought it looked sharp. I'd been hoping to find one, one
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got home and the kids were sitting in it. I took it for a
spin (Friday). I can hardly wait to drive it home this summer (to
British Columbia).''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was looking forward to getting under the hood and
tinkering with his new car, Ferraro said, ``If I take a wrench
anywhere, I'm worried that it will fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Entering play Saturday, the Flames were 1-1 since trading Theo
Fleury to Colorado for winger Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak, a
draft choice and future considerations. Belak is playing in the
American Hockey League. ... General Manager Dave Taylor, who has
been scouting in Europe, is scheduled to return to Los Angeles
today. Coach Larry Robinson is scheduled to return Monday from
Ontario, where he attended the funeral of his mother, Isobel, who
died this week.

SHEIK ISA BIN SALMAN AL-KHALIFA, EMIR OF BAHRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BAHRAIN-EMIR, filed in category ``i'')

 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ The emir of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman
al-Khalifa, who collapsed and died Saturday at 65, shaped his
country into an important ally of the West during nearly four
decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini officials said the cause of death was a heart attack,
which the emir suffered at his palace in Manama, the capital, just
minutes after a meeting with the visiting U.S. defense secretary,
William S. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   A diminutive man with twinkling eyes, Sheik Isa was very much a
man who enjoyed life, ruling with a mischievous touch.
</P>
<P>
   He had dozens of wives _ though never more than four at a time,
in keeping with his Muslim religion, and presided until late in
life at what was known as emir's beach, to which foreigners but not
Bahrainis were welcomed. Female beachgoers who caught his eye were
routinely invited to join the emir for coffee, on a terrace
overlooking the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Even Saturday, in their last conversation, Cohen said later, he
had chided Sheik Isa, a longtime friend, telling him that his next
destination in the United States should be Las Vegas, not New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was with a similar impetuousness that Sheik Isa ruled Bahrain
since 1961, winning his country many friends and considerable
wealth but sometimes offending people in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He declared Bahrain's independence from Britain in 1971, then
maintained a pro-Western line in foreign policy. The country is now
the base of the U. S. Fifth Fleet, which has also provoked
resentment at home against the foreign military presence.
</P>
<P>
   The emir's policies also angered Iraq, the tiny emirate's giant
neighbor, whose leaders remember that Sheik Isa allowed Bahrain to
be used as a Western air base for attacks on Iraq during the
Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   With an early eye to economic diversification, Sheik Isa also
presided over bold changes that established Bahrain as a major
financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Though oil was discovered in Bahrain as early as the 1930s, it
was never found in large quantities, and as a headquarters to
foreign banks and other businesses, Bahrain became proof that it
was possible to prosper in the Middle East without vast energy
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheik Isa was careful also to maintain an alliance with the
region's economic and military powerhouse, Saudi Arabia, with which
it is connected by a causeway and from which it receives oil from a
shared field.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to sharing power, however, Sheik Isa was often at
his most mercurial. A Constitution adopted in 1973 established
Bahrain as only the second gulf Arab state, after Kuwait, to have
an elected Parliament. But Sheik Isa dissolved Parliament in August
1975 after a showdown with left-wing members over domestic and
regional policies. The Constitution was also suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Sheik Isa consolidated the retreat away from even
limited democracy by issuing a decree that replaced the National
Assembly with a 30-member consultative council, with its members to
be appointed by the emir.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of heavy hand often served to maintain an atmosphere
of domestic tranquillity in Bahrain, even as the Iranian revolution
of 1979 and instability in Iraq served to underscore the dangers of
the region.
</P>
<P>
   But it never fully capped the anger felt by many Bahrainis,
particularly the majority population of Shiite Muslims, toward
Sheik Isa and his ruling Khalifa family, who are Sunnis.
</P>
<P>
   In the emir's final years, that bitterness was exposed in a
significant way, through a low-level campaign of violence that
claimed some two dozen lives after 1994 and resulted in the jailing
of hundreds of Shiite Muslim activists.
</P>
<P>
   Many government opponents said their only demand was that
Parliament be re-established. But Sheik Isa preferred to remain
impervious, greeting visitors to his palace with generous gifts
while his aides advised them not to try to question him on domestic
political subjects.

ACTIVIST SLAIN IN COLOMBIA UPHELD BELIEFS TO END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA WEISS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Terence Freitas, ``Save the Rain Forest'' was
much more than a slogan; it was his life's work, and it eventually
led him to his death.
</P>
<P>
   The man from the North Hollywood community of Los Angeles,
described by friends as a dedicated activist, was found slain with
two companions Thursday in Venezuela, a week after they had been
kidnapped in the Colombian rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived the life that he wanted to live,'' said Freitas'
mother, Julie, of North Hollywood. ``I'm grateful that his life was
so full of passion and that . ... he did what he believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Freitas and his two friends had traveled to the rain forest at
the invitation of the U'wa, a group of indigenous people whose
land, about 200 miles from Bogota, has been targeted for oil
exploration by Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   A rancher found Freitas' body, along with those of his
companions Ingrid Washinawatok of New York and Lahe'ena'e Gay of
Hawaii, in his cow pasture in Venezuela, just across the border
from Colombia. The three travelers were members of the Hawaii-based
Pacific Cultural Conservancy International.
</P>
<P>
   The victims had been shot with 9 mm weapons, the women four
times each in the face and chest, and Freitas six times, according
to Venezuelan police. No group has claimed responsibility for the
killings, but Washington has blamed them on the 15,000-member
leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas graduated from the University of California at Santa
Cruz with a degree in biology and worked in various environmental
law projects after college. In May 1997, he had just started
working with the Santa Monica-based Amazon Watch when the U'wa's
elected leader, Roberto Cobaria, came to speak to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry was very moved by their struggle,'' said Atossa Soltani,
the director of Amazon Watch. Three weeks later, the U'wa had an
assembly in Colombia, and Freitas traveled there. ``He came back
inspired and committed. He was incredibly bright, and in a very
quick time, he became an expert. No one outside Colombia has done
more to support the U'wa's struggle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He had an immense love for nature, she said, and would become
animated when he showed slides he took of frogs and other forest
creatures while visiting U'wa territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U'wa are of such strong spirit,'' Soltani said. ``They
believe that oil is the blood of Mother Earth and that they were
put on the earth to defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Freitas mirrored that passion in his work, putting in long hours
for little or no money and financing his own trips to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Before his trip, he was in the process of moving to New York to
become the director of the U'wa Defense Working Group, an umbrella
group of nine environmental and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Freitas knew of the dangers of traveling to
Colombia, where violence perpetrated by leftist guerrillas,
right-wing paramilitary groups and drug traffickers is common.
</P>
<P>
   Melina Selverston, director of the Coalition for Amazonian
Peoples and their Environment, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group,
said Freitas had received death threats on his telephone answering
machine. She said they came from the right-wing paramilitary groups
that operate in the Arauca area of Colombia where the Americans
were abducted.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement released by the U'wa Defense Working
Group, Freitas was forced to sign a statement by the Colombian
military that absolved them of any responsibility for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confused and don't understand the motives behind
the killings. We have been in touch with the State Department,
pressing our interest in finding the truth. We want to see that
Terry's death was not in vain,'' Soltani said. ``We're very proud
of him. He was a warrior and a brother. This only strengthens our
resolve to carry on his work.'' &QL;

KINGS WASTE OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ From the out-of-town scoreboards at both
ends of the Forum, the news almost screamed down at the Kings. San
Jose had lost to Chicago. Edmonton had lost to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This was the opportunity the Kings were looking for, the chance
to gain ground in the race for a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Kings, they either didn't see the
scoreboard, didn't hear its scream or, most likely, simply weren't
equipped to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a Calgary Flames team in a similar position in the
standings, a Calgary team that had traded star forward Theoren
Fleury six days earlier, a tired Calgary team that had played the
night before in Vancouver, the Kings couldn't help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They lost 4-1 before a disgruntled Forum crowd of 14,451, and
with 18 games left, the Kings (23-36-5) remained seven points
behind the Sharks and nine behind the Oilers in the race for one of
the bottom playoff spots in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are 0-2 on a seven-game home stand that was supposed
to be their salvation but is turning into their final downfall. The
Flames (23-30-10), adjusting to life without Fleury, moved within
two points of the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake's third-period lapse of judgment added one
more page to his team's miserable season.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings shorthanded and trailing by two goals with 16:10
left, Blake took a high stick to the jaw from Calgary center Clarke
Wilm.
</P>
<P>
   If Blake had simply stayed down, Wilm would have been penalized,
and the Kings eventually would have gone on the power play.
Instead, the Kings' captain arose, skated to Wilm, and began
throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Mick McGeough assessed Wilm high-sticking and fighting
penalties, and gave Blake two minutes for instigating, five for
fighting and an automatic 10-minute misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   So the Kings remained shorthanded and Jarome Iginla's power-play
goal gave the Flames an insurmountable 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings played physically at the start Saturday, but in
typical fashion, one mistake knocked them out of the game mentally,
if not on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a Kings scoring chance, a blast from the slot by
Ian Laperriere three minutes into the game. Calgary goalie Fred
Brathwaite made the save, and on a clearing attempt by the Flames,
Kings defenseman Sean O'Donnell misplayed the puck at the blue
line.
</P>
<P>
   Valeri Bure burst past O'Donnell on a breakaway. O'Donnell
hooked Bure, but not enough to bring him down or keep him from
shooting or keep him from slipping the puck past goalie Stephane
Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and wanted to have a good start,'' Kings center
Ray Ferraro said. ``The first two shifts, we got some momentum, and
the puck jumps over O'Donnell's stick and Bure scores on a
breakaway. We're down, 1-0, and we didn't seem to get it going
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings could have gotten a lift when they killed a
four-minute shorthanded situation after Russ Courtnall high-sticked
Calgary's Todd Simpson at 9:31. Instead, five seconds after
Courtnall stepped out of the penalty box, the Flames' Cory Stillman
made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bodger put the Kings on the scoreboard in the final minute
of the second period with his first goal of the season, but
Iginla's power-play goal quelled comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games, we have been saying for a month, are way too
important not to have,'' Ferraro said. ``We have to find a way to
get back into this pretty quickly.''

<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rafael Palmeiro, feeling more pain in his
right knee, returned to Texas last night for further tests.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro is expecting to be examined by Dr. John Conway today
and undergo a magnetic resonance imaging exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never happened to me before so yeah, I'm a little
worried,'' Palmeiro said. ``But not too much, it's just that this
is all new to me. Hopefully it will be the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro felt the pain come back while jogging on Thursday. He
originally injured the knee running the steps at The Ballpark in
Arlington and underwent arthroscopic surgery on Feb. 10. He has
been limited to rehabilitation work and has yet to join the
workouts or play in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to the point where we're concerned,'' Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``If anything, this might be
something new. We just won't know until he goes back and gets it
re-evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro is still hoping to start playing in games within a
week, depending on what happens with today's examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just probably part of the rehabilitation process,''
Palmeiro said. ``I'm not sure if this is a setback. I just want to
get it taken care of so I can go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has never been on the disabled list and has played more
games than anybody this decade expect Baltimore third baseman Cal
Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens has been playing first base during Palmeiro's
absence, but the Rangers are also without Mike Simms. He is
sidelined for 3-4 weeks with a partial tear of his left achilles
tendon.

KINGS MISS OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ROGER PHILLIPS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ From the out-of-town scoreboards at both
ends of the Forum, the news almost screamed down at the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose had lost to Chicago. Edmonton had lost to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This was the opportunity the Kings had awaited, the chance to
gain ground in the race for a playoff berth. Unfortunately for the
Kings, they either didn't see the scoreboard, didn't hear its
scream or, most likely, simply aren't equipped to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings may remember Saturday night for an undisciplined
third-period outburst by their captain, Rob Blake. They won't
remember it as the night they resuscitated their fading season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seize the moment,'' assistant coach Jay Leach said, ``and I
think initially they tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the Kings failed against a Calgary Flames
team that had traded star forward Theo Fleury six days earlier and
played in Vancouver the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Before a disgruntled Forum crowd of 14,451, the Kings lost, 4-1,
and with 18 games left, they remained seven points behind the
Sharks and nine behind the Oilers in the race for one of the bottom
playoff spots in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (23-36-5) are 0-2 on a seven-game home stand that was
supposed to be their salvation but is turning into their final
downfall. The Flames (23-30-10) moved to within two points of the
Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's third-period lapse of judgment added one more gloomy
chapter to his team's miserable season.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings shorthanded and trailing by two goals with 16:10
left, Blake took a high stick to the jaw from Calgary rookie Clarke
Wilm. Blake arose and skated to Wilm, and a fight ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Mick McGeough assessed Wilm high-sticking and fighting
penalties, and gave Blake two minutes for instigating, five for
fighting and an automatic 10-minute misconduct. Blake disputed the
instigator call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we squared off,'' he said. ``He dropped his gloves
the same time I did. I think it was a pretty (expletive) call by
the ref. ... The kid sticks me on a faceoff. Then he dropped his
gloves the same time I did. If you look at my history, I have one
fight a year. It's not like I'm looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indisputable, however, that if Blake had simply stayed
down, the 22-year-old Wilm would have been penalized, and the Kings
eventually would have gone on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit down,'' Blake said. ``We're far enough
out of the playoff hunt that you're not going to sit there and take
that stuff. I'm not going to take that. I'm not going to sit there
and take that from a kid, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on the fact that his reaction cost the Kings an
eventual power play, Blake said, ``Would you like me to take (the
stick to the jaw)? If you'd like me to, then I'll take it. It was
my fault that we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake then stalked off.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Blake had shown a lack of discipline on the ice, Leach
responded, ``I would say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Blake's play hardly was the reason the Kings lost,
though their chances of rallying would have been better if he'd
been on the ice for the final 16:10 instead of in the dressing
room.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings remained shorthanded after the incident, and Jarome
Iginla's goal on the power play just after the Blake incident gave
the Flames an insurmountable 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The game had been lost much earlier, when Valeri Bure and Cory
Stillman scored in the first period and Denis Gauthier scored late
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bodger's first goal of the season, in the final minute of
the second period, gave the Kings hope, but Iginla's power-play
goal snuffed it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games, we have been saying for a month, are way too
important not to have,'' center Ray Ferraro said. ``We have to find
a way to get back into this pretty quickly.''

 &HT;    'ED-FLEX' BILL BECOMES A SCHOOL POLICY BATTLEGROUND
 &HT;    730&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside the cramped but friendly office of Garrison
Elementary hangs a photo of President Clinton reading ``The
Tortoise and the Hare'' to students at the District of Columbia
public school, where test scores have long been low.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since that presidential visit, Garrison's
administrators, like the tortoise in the fable, have plugged away
at securing federal education grants. It's part of what Principal
P. Dianne Worthy calls a ``mission'' to catch up to better-funded
schools in reading and math skills.
</P>
<P>
   The federal assistance has paid for teaching aides, workshops
for teachers, and Saturday remedial reading classes for students.
</P>
<P>
   But applying for the grants consumes a vast amount of time, and
requires an entire school district office to monitor tight
restrictions on how the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republicans in Congress are trying to compete with Clinton
and the Democrats by offering remedies for the nation's education
problems that would cut out some of that red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leadership has scheduled a test vote Monday on the
Educational Flexibility Partnership Act, which would provide
broader flexibility to states and school districts in six major
programs, including the $8 billion Title I supplements for
low-income students. The House is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a
similar ``Ed-Flex'' measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support this bill,'' Clinton said in his Saturday radio
address. But at the same time, the president turned up the heat on
Republicans to fully fund the Democrats' goal of hiring 100,000 new
teachers over the next six years to cut class sizes in the first
three grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the first big test,'' Clinton said, ``of whether
the Congress is serious about giving our children the education
they need and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doubt whether either party's proposed federal solutions
will restore the luster to America's school system, whose students
rank near the bottom of the industrial world in international
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public attention to federal aid, it accounts for
only about 6 percent of all funding for elementary and secondary
education. Most funding comes from localities and states.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is uncertain whether school officials, if loosed
from some of the chains of regulation, will make much better use of
the federal money. The Department of Education has already
experimented with the ``Ed-Flex'' idea, allowing a dozen states to
seek waivers from some federal rules that govern education aid, but
results have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last fall by the General Accounting Office, the
investigating arm of Congress, reported that some states found the
program ``useful for creating a climate that encourages
innovation,'' but others said the program still had too many
restrictions and was ``of limited value.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the states, Texas made the greatest use of the new
flexible rule, with Ohio, Massachusetts, Maryland and Kansas making
modest use of the program. Others requested few if any waivers from
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal would extend that experimental program to
all 50 states. However, for some education reformers, that is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing Ed-Flex idea doesn't go very far at all in terms
of empowering states to use the federal money for their own
purposes,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., a former education official
in the Reagan administration, at a briefing sponsored last month by
the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation. ``It does not, for example, allow
them to redirect money from one purpose to another purpose. It just
simplifies the regulations within a program.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the federal government should give each state
``five years of freedom'' with its federal education money and then
insist on proven academic results at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, are expressing concern that the
states might stint on low-income students if the federal government
no longer sets the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP bill ``turns over 35 years of important history,
legislation that has really worked well for children,'' said Sen.
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said he was concerned that the pilot program did not
measure how the redirection of Title I funds affected poor and
disadvantaged students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they used this ``Ed-Flex'' to improve the opportunity for
poor
</P>
<P>
   children?'' he asked. ``We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, led by Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, are trying
to tack the Clinton teacher plan onto the Republican education
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration points to a wide range of studies
showing that smaller classes lead to higher student achievement and
fewer discipline problems. Vice President Al Gore, in his travels,
reminds each state of how many new teachers it would be entitled to
under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's seize the moment to make a commitment to our children's
education and America's future,'' Gore said last week in a
campaign-style stop at a New York school.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans last fall went along with funding for
hiring about 30,000 new teachers for the fall of 1999, the program
has encountered a growing teacher shortage in many big areas.
</P>
<P>
   California, under a state mandate to reduce class size, has
hired teachers who lack proper credentials and recruited teachers
from Mexico. New York City, desperate for qualified math and
science teachers, recruited two dozen Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of lowering class size is very attractive and a way
to get news,'' said Paul T. Hill, co-author of the book ``Fixing
Urban Education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are some places where that's not appropriate for
that,'' he said, adding that in regions with a shortage of
qualified teachers, the danger could be hiring less desirable
teachers who will then have tenure in three years.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Managed care meets its match
 &HT;    (EDs: The following editorial is from Monday's Atlanta Journal.)
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia will soon be the second state in the nation to
impose liability on HMOs. In Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes, the highly
paid health insurance lobbyists have met their match. Barnes' three
reform bills _ doctor choice, HMO liability and the creation of an
insurance consumer office _ appear headed for legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The latest of the governor's savvy moves was to fire off a
letter to a local radio station when an outfit named ``Georgians
for Affordable Health Care'' started running opposition ads. Barnes
pointed out the organization hadn't filed as a lobbying group and
hadn't registered as a business with the secretary of state. The
ads were pulled _ and haven't reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, apparently funded by managed care companies, listed an
interesting telephone number for citizens to call _ the same as
that of insurance giant CIGNA Healthcare. But it's doubtful that
top officers at CIGNA or any other health care megacorporation
relate to ``affordable'' anything. CIGNA CEO Wilson Taylor's 1997
salary was $12.5 million, $1 million more than the previous year,
despite industry losses. Plus almost $10 million in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor isn't even the highest paid of the for-profit HMO
executives. Oxford Health Plans Inc., which has suffered serious
financial setbacks, paid former CEO Stephen Wiggins $30.7 million.
The stock option champ, though, is United Healthcare CEO William
McGuire, with $61.2 million. Families USA, a nonprofit organization
that researches health care issues, compiled the data on salaries
and stock options from Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
The Crystal Report, which regularly surveys executives'
compensation, found that managed care executives make two to three
times more than CEOs in 31 comparable industries. No wonder the
general public is disgusted with warnings that premiums must rise
for companies to make a go of it if reforms become law.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the governor's success with the liability bill, which
allows consumers to sue managed care companies (after third-party
reviews), is its prohibition against punitive damages. The
legislation bars ``pain and suffering'' claims that often produce
exorbitant jury awards. No question that's a reason the managed
care industry has been willing to work with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Barnes has pulled the rug out from under insurance
lobbyists, the head-shaking about increased health care premiums
continues. But there's no real data to support those claims _ and
plenty to indicate increases will be minimal. Four independent
firms, including the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated the cost
of reforms more extreme than the modest ones before the Georgia
Legislature at less than $2 per month per person.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is one of 17 states clamping down on managed care
abuses. State regulation is just the first step in assuring
for-profit companies give proper weight to patient concerns about
quality. The next is national reform to guarantee state-enacted
patients' rights apply to the approximately 60 percent of Georgia
workers (40 percent to 60 percent of workers nationally) whose
employers' benefit plans are self-insured. Federal law exempts them
from state regulation _ though that's being challenged in Texas,
the only other state with an HMO liability law.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that managed care reform knows no party bounds.
Georgia Rep. Charlie Norwood, a conservative Republican, is in the
forefront of HMO reforms in Washington. There's nothing wrong with
making a profit, but patient needs deserve more clout. Fortunately,
politicians are responding to the people's outcry.

 &HT;    In this court, dad and son bond as they fight for rebounds
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I've always wanted a bald spot.
</P>
<P>
   The thought came to me at an unusual time, as my 11-year-old
gained an H-O advantage against me in a game of HORSE.
</P>
<P>
   This year I proudly noticed the bald spot. No, not the vacancy
atop my skull. I did not invite that. What I greeted was the
wearing out of the grass just a few feet beyond the driveway, a
long jumper from our basketball hoop.
</P>
<P>
   I know I should fret about the grass that bit the dust there.
It's unsightly by certain standards. In Yard of the Month scoring,
we foul out.
</P>
<P>
   But by my recollection, this is the way a yard is supposed to
look _ not a sea of dirt, mind you, just a bald spot.
</P>
<P>
   Driveway basketball courts are like snowflakes, unique and
apart. Each has its hazards and wrinkles _ an angular crack here,
an overhang there.
</P>
<P>
   Our court is suitably odd. The goal is to the side of the
slightly sloping, one-car driveway. To stay on the concrete, play
must be tight to the goal or way off on either wing. But play
migrates outward, and the grass is gone past the concrete, roughly
out to where the top of the key would be.
</P>
<P>
   The bald spot of my youth was different, a pie slice out from
where the lip of the porch met our driveway. The basket was _ still
is _ over the garage. The porch is elevated three inches above the
driveway. Only inches away from the basket, it's amazing that lip
didn't break half a dozen ankles in all the sweaty games we played,
brothers, neighbors, Dad and I.
</P>
<P>
   Dad and I had a particular spot, behind a crack past the gutter
drain, from which we would have long contests. Shoot till you hit.
Shoot till you miss.
</P>
<P>
   You want bonding? It comes in all forms. One is the bounce pass.
Then there's the chest pass. You and your old man can even bond
when he's giving you the hip and trying to take you down with a
scoop shot, one-on-one. Nice try, old man.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this bonding is without a word, only the cadence of the
ball, a satisfying slap against a surface you know well. I love
that sound on my own driveway.
</P>
<P>
   This year our youngest son really discovered basketball,
bringing a smile to my face and, simultaneously, causing me to
hitch up my britches. Each new game, HORSE, one-on-one, or
two-on-two with Rob's big brother and a friend, picks up topspin.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the narrowness of our driveway, one of our home-court
factors is the tree overhanging it, an Arizona ash. I have it
trimmed so in cold months it plays no factor. But when it buds and
the limbs get heavy with green, it decides it must play, too.
</P>
<P>
   In these early weeks of green, if you launch one from a certain
angle you'll get it swatted by the tree. A collision between ball
and branches sends foliar casings fluttering down like sleet, and
with them the smell of spring.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, as headlights from our van supplemented a
porchlight so we could keep shooting, Robert noticed the tree shed
after one such rejected shot. He started lofting the basketball up
into the boughs, singing, ``Let it snow, let it snow.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day Jeff, one of the boys' friends, hit a shot from
behind the tree, actually through the cross-hairs where its torso
splits into biceps. I might place a plaque there.
</P>
<P>
   You want to remember stuff like this, because bald spots, games
of HORSE and childhood don't last forever. At my boyhood home
there's grass where once there was dirt near the basket. Dad's lawn
is unblemished now. It looks good. I know he'd rather have it worn.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball comes out, though, when we visit. I know it will
this summer when the hotshot grandson shows up and wants to show
off.
</P>
<P>
   If we hang around the house long enough there's certain to be
some wear there. The old spot will feel like family again.

</P>
<P>
   LOST-PLAYS (New York) _ Most writers have a long apprenticeship
and years of struggle before they break through, and even the most
accomplished have early plays that have not been produced. In many
cases the authors simply forget their apprentice work. Currently
theater goers have an opportunity to see lost plays by two diverse
writers, ``Not About Nightingales,'' by Tennessee Williams, and
``The Hothouse,'' by Harold Pinter. Each followed a different path
to production. By Mel Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MUSIC (New York) _ Visionaries, hopefuls, hucksters and
self-described geeks mingled over the weekend at the first New York
Music and Internet Expo. While Web pages flickered on monitors and
cellular phones beeped, musicians and computer entrepreneurs
swapped business cards and ideas about how the Internet could
revolutionize the music business. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   EVENSONG-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The title of Gail Godwin's rich
new novel, ``Evensong,'' refers, according to its epigraph, to ``a
worship service said or sung at the onset of evening to mark the
close of day and to compose the mind and renew the spirit for the
coming day.'' As you read ``Evensong,'' however, you find its title
taking on an ironic edge. For its story is not about the close of a
day but rather about the end of the old millennium and the coming
of the new. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt reviews.
</P>
<P>
   BAND-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ ``Band in Berlin'' is not so
much a play as a kind of docu-cabaret. Through slide projections,
re-enactments of newsreel clips and the jukebox-style performances
of a stream of Teutonic folk songs and American pop standards, the
show recounts the rise and fall of the Comedian Harmonists, the
renowned German singing group forced by the Nazis to disband
because three of its members were Jewish. Peter Marks reviews.
</P>
<P>
   SUE-MILLER-INTERVIEW (Undated) _ In her fiction, from her first
novel, ``The Good Mother,'' to her latest, ``While I Was Gone,''
Sue Miller is the doyenne of domesticity. Probing beneath the
surface of marriages, she uncovers the disharmony as well as an
individual's urge to find an alternative life. During a recent
interview she acknowledged that the search for another self was a
continuous theme in her work. She characterized it as ``the
difference between the self we present to people and the self we
feel ourselves to be,'' leading to the eternal question ``how much
we can truly know another person.'' By Mel Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   TV-STRANGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here's a new television series
with a mission statement. In the pilot episode of ``Strange World''
the central character, Dr. Paul Turner, works up a righteous head
of steam and declares: ``Why are people more afraid of aliens from
outer space than they are of the monsters we're creating ourselves?
From genetically engineered animals, viruses . . . .'' Ron
Wertheimer reviews.

   INTERNET-PHONES (Undated) _ As it halts decades of investing in
the traditional gear that makes up most of the global telephone
system _ AT&AMP;T is starting to retool its network around a new
generation of technologies inspired by the Internet. For consumers,
this evolution could lead to lower prices. And in the future, as
the new technologies expand from the core of the network to homes
and businesses, consumers could also benefit from new sorts of
features and services. A news analysis by Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   INTEL-TRIAL (Washington) _ At the heart of the government's
antitrust case that goes on trial against Intel Corp. on Tuesday is
a meeting nearly five-and-a-half years ago at the industry's annual
Comdex convention in Las Vegas. There, in November 1993, the
chairman of the giant chipmaker cut a fateful deal with his
counterpart at a small but leading maker of highly specialized
computer workstations, Intergraph Corp. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   CABLE-TV-DEREGULATE (Washington) _ Cable television, one of the
last industries to have its prices controlled by the government, is
about to become almost completely deregulated. But while the
prospect of competition was supposed to drive prices down, the
opposite has happened. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   BUYING-ELECTRONICS (Undated) _ Buoyed by strong holiday sales of
large screen television sets, video cassette recorders and Sony
PlayStation video games, and signs pointing to strong first-quarter
sales, the makers and sellers of consumer electronics products are
predicting that 1999 could be the industry's best year ever. Rather
than scaring off consumers, they are counting on a dazzling _
skeptics might say dizzying _ array of new and enhanced products to
stimulate sales. By Sharon R. King.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV-INTERACTIVE (Washington) _ Results of a recent study by the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, the industry's main
trade group, showed that consumers are at least as interested in
using digital television sets for interactive services as for
watching high-definition programming. By Joel Brinkley. (With
BUYING-ELECTRONICS)
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-MONITORS (Undated) _ Corporations have long paid
so-called clipping services to monitor their appearances in the
conventional news media. But several companies have taken the
practice online and a step further. This new generation of monitors
goes beyond news publishers and instead trolls for rumor and
innuendo in the Net's virtual back alleys _ in thousands of chat
rooms and discussion forums where, some say, unchecked scuttlebutt
can damage corporate reputations and stock prices. By Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   ECOMMERCE-DROPOUTS (Undated) _ Internet shoppers may be at the
vanguard of a retail revolution, but as with anyone on the front
lines, they are a jittery bunch. Those who shop on the Internet
abandon one-half to two-thirds of the purchases they begin,
industry executives and analysts say. By Bob Tedeschi.

   FOXTV-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ One way those networks can try to
retain the viewers they had attracted with the ``all Monica, all
the time'' formats is to promote their regular programs and the
anchors, reporters and correspondents who work for them. The goal:
tempt channel surfers to tune in whether or not there is a major
continuing news story being covered. One network, MNC _ er, FNC,
Fox News Channel _ has begun doing just that with a $4 million

   (Coding varies.)

   WEB-WARNINGS-MEDIA (Undated) _ A year after the gossipy Web site
run by Matt Drudge became a bookmark in Washington computers,
other, more partisan Web sites are becoming early warning systems
for the mainstream press. Like talk radio, they are filled with
free-form invective. Like trailers from a new X-Files movie, they
offer previews of coming attractions from places where conspiracy
is king. By Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   SAT-TV-MEDIA (Undated) _ Basketball fans in Denver know that to
see local television broadcasts of Nuggets games, they had better
stay home. A signal from a network affiliate in the city cannot be
picked up in Vail, 100 miles away, even though special maps used by
regulators to predict a television signal's reach say it should.
Drawn in the 1950s to prevent signal interference, the maps are at
the center of a legal battle between broadcasters and the satellite
television industry that resulted in 750,000 viewers nationwide
losing programming from CBS and Fox last weekend. By Andrea
Adelson.

E-COMMERCE: INTERNET RETAILERS WORK TO TURN SHOPPERS INTO BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet shoppers may be at the vanguard of a retail
revolution, but as with anyone on the front lines, they are a
jittery bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Those who shop on the Internet abandon one-half to two-thirds of
the purchases they begin, industry executives and analysts say. One
way that sites can measure the dropouts is through ``shopping
cart'' technology, which, as the name suggests, allows users to
gather items at a site for a one-stop checkout.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that online shoppers often start filling a cart,
but then leave the site without buying anything.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of such almost-sales, e-commerce sites have begun looking
at the problem and are feverishly devising methods to convert these
browsers into buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there widespread concern in the industry about this?'' said
Arno Harris, vice president for marketing at 911gifts.com, whose
site has seen 45 percent of its potential transactions abandoned
before checkout. ``I think there is.'' Of those who bail out,
Harris said, 30 percent drop off at the first page of the billing
process. ``We're still in the early phase of e-commerce adoption,
so a lot of people just get into the process and panic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives cite various reasons why customers bail out.
</P>
<P>
   First, some consumers are just trying out the online shopping
experience, without intending to make a purchase. Others abandon
the process when confronted with often-hefty shipping and handling
charges at the end of the transaction, or with registration forms
that ask for personal information, like a home address, e-mail
address or phone number. Finally, a significant _ but diminishing _
number of users remain unsure about giving out their credit card
information online.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Hyde, vice president of online sales for REI.com, an
outdoor goods retailer, conjectures that many Internet users are
simply playing with sites that have e-commerce capabilities, just
as people try out anything new before seriously considering
spending money on it. ``I put stuff in the cart all the time and
then leave, don't you?'' Hyde said. ``I did it three times on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Cassar, an e-commerce analyst for Jupiter
Communications, a New York-based research firm, said a big problem
was shipping and handling costs, which many sites do not disclose
until late in the buying process. ``It's sticker shock,'' Cassar
said. ``A lot of people just aren't willing to pay what is
essentially a 30 to 40 percent markup.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassar and other analysts said that security was less of an
issue than it was last year, when many in the industry were
predicting that such fears would slow the growth of e-commerce. To
date, there have been few actual reported instances of online
credit card fraud. And many consumers have chosen to shop online at
sites operated by established companies, perhaps further reducing
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   More Internet retailers are also designing their Web sites to
convey the image of a secure store, with an abundance of credit
card logos and other seals of approval adorning many companies'
home pages. Though some shoppers still balk at using their credit
cards online, Cassar said that many more were put off by
registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   William Bryant, chairman of Qpass, a company that has developed
a billing system for e-commerce sites, understands consumer
resistance to registering. ``Imagine going to a 7-Eleven to buy a
can of Coke, and having to fill out a registration form that asks
you about marital status,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect registration forms to disappear any time soon.
Internet companies love them, because they help retailers refine
their marketing efforts and aim advertisements on the site more
precisely (and thus charge more to advertisers). Even so, online
merchants are exploring ways to make registering less of a
hindrance, such as systems that would let users register one time
for multiple Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Excite, for example, lets users type in their credit card
information once and then shop at a number of merchants within the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Halliday, vice president for Excite's commerce division,
said the system not only eliminated registration redundancies, but
also gave shoppers fewer opportunities to abandon a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly important, he said, because the Internet
has been a medium for impulse spending. ``You have to make a
consumer's purchase decision as slippery a slope as possible,''
referring to the speed with which sites should finalize sales.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, of 911Gifts.com, said that his company recently started
a similar system and that he expected it to reduce the number of
lost purchases at his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that people have pretty much figured out the economics of
getting customers to their sites, the focus is on conversion,'' he
said, noting that e-commerce sites typically convert less than 2
percent of their visitors into customers. ``This is a really
critical way merchants can improve economics without spending a lot
more money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most aggressive approach to the problem is
represented by Cybershop, an online department store that actually
pursues shoppers who abandon large purchases. Jeffrey Tauber,
Cybershop's chief executive, says that even when a shopper fills
and flees, the company can still ``capture a pretty good level of
information'' about who the consumer was. ``And if it's a nice-size
order, we'll call or e-mail them and try to close the sale,''
Tauber said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of the customers the company pursues ultimately
complete the sale, Tauber said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the best antidote for shopping jitters is, simply, more
practice. Industry executives and analysts predict that if the
Internet's flagship merchants continue to provide positive shopping
experiences, fewer customers will hesitate about making a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the industry is going to get past its
abandonment issues, companies will have to allay customers'
concerns. The e-merchants, meanwhile, will also have to stock up on
the one commodity rarely found in cyberspace: patience.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, the E-Commerce Report will appear on alternate
Mondays in Business Day, and every Monday in the Technology section

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a new television series with a mission statement. In the
pilot episode of ``Strange World,'' to be seen Monday night on ABC,
the central character, Dr. Paul Turner, works up a righteous head
of steam and declares: ``Why are people more afraid of aliens from
outer space than they are of the monsters we're creating ourselves?
From genetically engineered animals, viruses . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He's too excited to complete the list, or perhaps to limit the
scope of future plot lines. But a moment later he announces:
``Science is changing a lot faster than we expected. Faster than
anyone realizes.''
</P>
<P>
   There. A warning has been issued: You've been wasting your time
on ``The X-Files.'' The fault, dear viewer, is not in our stars,
but in ourselves. Earthbound science has run amok, and Turner
(played by Tim Guinee), whose life is threatened by a devastating
man-made disease he acquired in the Persian Gulf War, is pledging
to uncover its excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Network television, on the other hand, is not changing any
faster than expected. So, especially in the pilot, this new entry
pays further homage to the addictive ``X-Files,'' a show with which
``Strange World'' obviously hopes to share an audience. The two
already share some genetic material. (That sci-fi lingo burrows
right into your brain, doesn't it?) One of the new show's creators,
Howard Gordon, was an ``X-Files'' producer and writer.
</P>
<P>
   So here's another warning: Although the drama that Gordon and
his colleagues offer Monday night borrows the ominous darkness and
portentous music of ``The X-Files'' and provides a dogged hero,
mysterious villains and conspiracies within conspiracies within
conspiracies, it does not match the other show's imagination. More
damaging, it lacks the deadpan wit that keeps ``The X-Files''
teetering disorientingly between spoof and melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   One more problem: ABC has scheduled four more ``Strange World''
episodes that will pre-empt ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' for the remaining
Tuesdays in March, starting Tuesday, thus running the risk of
alienating another army of potential fans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, viewers who give ``Strange World'' a chance may find its
mind games satisfying. Monday night's drama introduces Turner, who
agrees to work for some kind of hazily defined Pentagon agency that
battles medical miscreants and other scientific villains. But
there's a twist. The kind of evil network that Turner has pledged
to fight is keeping him alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, Turner watches his old Army buddy, who contracted
the dread disease with him, die from it. Turner lives only because
a shadowy woman appears periodically to give him a vial of serum.
Who is she? Whom is she working for? What does she expect from
Turner? If you think you might wonder about the answers, then you
might fall under the spell of ``Strange World.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Guinee, the series' regular cast includes three
women: Kristin Lehman as Turner's love interest, Dr. Sydney
MacMillan; Saundra Quarterman as his boss, Maj. Lynne Reese, and
Vivian Wu as the woman with the life-saving drug. All four actors
seem to be appropriately professional; they approach the material
with unremitting earnestness.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's tale establishes the premise and has something to
do with cloning humans. In Tuesday's show, which seems a bit less
ponderous in tone, the focus is on a medical conspiracy that hides
its true designs while claiming to be about surrogate motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   What are the true designs of ``Strange World?'' To return to the
network in its own permanent time slot? That's not beyond
imagining. But, like its hero, this show risks a quick demise
unless it finds a few doses of magic.

TURNING THE HUMAN CONDITION UPSIDE DOWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Czech Republic)   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four performers from Prague who hang upside down to
tell us something about the human condition might even tell us
something we do not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Man,'' a bare-bones but imaginative production
presented on Friday night at the Kitchen by Alfred in the
Courtyard, a Czech movement-theater troupe, is another
manifestation of the suspended-in-the-air mania that has gripped
dance and theater groups worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States most of the current aerial choreography
comes from modern-dance troupes, a belated follow-up on the
off-the-ground experiments of the early 1970s by a variety of
choreographers, including Trisha Brown. But ``Hanging Man'' offers
a different sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly this is because Ctibor Turba, the founder and
director of Alfred in the Courtyard, comes out of the time-honored
Czech mime tradition that produced experimental companies like
Laterna Magika and the Black Theater of Prague. Pioneers in
mixed-media productions, these groups used technology to create
illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hanging Man,'' Turba, who collaborated with his performers,
openly presents mechanical devices and props. Halka Tresnakova and
three men, Kamil Bystricky, Petr Kruselnicky and Ondrej Lipovsky,
often hang head down on ropes that are raised, pulley fashion, by a
technician. Occasionally, the performer wears an ice skate with a
closed hook around its blade.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, these performers are mimes, attuned to the nuances of
physical effort and expression. A corporeal image of the body
functions on two levels here. We see the blood rush not only to the
men's heads but also to their bare chests and empathize kinetically
with their endurance as they curl upward, twist and delineate
shapes in the air against a gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a few exceptions, like the segments called
``Separations,'' formal design is not Tibor's concern. He has
replaced the dreamlike poetry of early Czech mime with a
neo-Expressionist strain that also has influenced Japanese Butoh
dance. His men have shaved heads, Butoh-style; the head-down image
was once popularized by the Butoh troupe, Sankai Juko. Beauty here
is in the grotesque and dislocated body.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis is on muscular control and nuance, especially in a
segment in which Ms. Tresnakova sits upright on a trapeze and moves
her tongue inside her mouth or thrusts it out at various and
amazing lengths. It is a tour de force of physical manipulation as
a range of emotion passes over her changing face.
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Stivin's eclectic music, incorporating flute solos and cool
jazz, serves as background for a series of encounters. One is
increasingly passionate as Ms. Tresnakova is positioned head-down
to a man whose feet are attached to a platform.
</P>
<P>
   Later, two men, with carapaces on their backs, become combative
insects. At another time, a hanging man, in a rite of initiation,
knocks down a pile of giant pickup sticks. Three men hang, their
entangled bodies twisted in an existential embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Man'' does not have a consistent metaphoric dimension,
but its search for joining the metaphysical and the physical is
well worth following.

HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION INDUSTRY STILL ON THE DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When several hundred executives from the consumer
electronics industry gathered here for a conference on digital
television last week, the leaders of their trade group greeted them
with a rude surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a recent study by the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association, the industry's main trade group, showed
that consumers are at least as interested in using digital
television sets for interactive services as for watching
high-definition programming.
</P>
<P>
   In simplest form, interactive services might include the ability
for a viewer to watch a television commercial and then click the
remote control to download more information about the product being
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   But because the new HDTV sets already on the market do not offer
even such rudimentary interactive services, the trade group's
tentative finding raised new questions about how rapidly consumers
might embrace HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that only about 20,000 of the HDTV sets, which
cost between $3,000 and $12,000, have been sold since the new
television came on the market last August.
</P>
<P>
   The television industry has bet the farm on HDTV, hoping that
vivid pictures and crystal-clear sound will, over time, prompt
Americans to trade in 250 million conventional sets for new,
high-definition models. Some manufacturers are even paying
television networks to broadcast HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the survey set off skeptical grumbling among the
manufacturers and retailers at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know what questions they asked to get that
result,'' groused one senior executive for a major manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the survey showed that the consumers were enthusiastic
about both HDTV and interactivity. ``People want a high-quality
picture and data at the same time, and they want us to figure out
how to do it,'' Todd Thibodeaux, a vice president with the
manufacturers' association, said in his presentation of the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   And as it turned out, the report was based on the reactions of
only about 70 people in focus groups assembled by the association a
few weeks ago. Nonetheless, the tentative findings set off a day of
questions and defensive explanations about the industry's strategy
as the manufacturers introduce the most important new product they
have offered in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the promise'' of interactivity ``and then there's the
physical logistics,'' said Bruce Babcock, a vice president with
Thomson Consumer Electronics, &UR;  &LR; the nation's largest seller of
televisions. ``We're waiting for standards. First a standards
document has to be proposed and commented on and approved. And then
we can build to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus groups were shown high-definition broadcasts as well
as ``data-streaming and multicasting capabilities,'' an association
document explains. The multicasting demonstration _ in which
several lower resolution shows were offered in place of one
high-definition program _ seemed to garner the least interest among
viewers. But they were quite enthusiastic about interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was simply an advertisement for a BMW that
ended with an on-screen prompt telling viewers that they could
print out more information about the car by pressing a button on
the remote control. The printer was attached to the digital set.
</P>
<P>
   That simple form of interactivity can be accomplished easily
with the nation's existing digital-television standard. But none of
the digital televisions on sale today, or announced for the coming
year, are equipped to handle even this.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with more ambitious interactivity is the lack of
standards. At the same time, most manufacturers had enough trouble
last year simply producing a high-definition set that worked in
time for the launch of the product last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a second-generation feature,'' Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, HDTV sets are barely selling. Of the estimated
20,000 that have been sold so far, most seem to be high-definition
monitors, lacking the digital tuner needed to pick up the
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the public is embracing high-definition is not
true,'' Noah Herschman, a vice president of the Tweeter Home
Entertainment Group, &UR;  &LR; a chain of stores in New England, told the
conference. ``Out of 60 stores, we have sold 200 HD-ready sets _
and only nine digital receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Myer, president of Myer-Emco, &UR;  &LR; a chain of audio-video stores
in the Washington area, where five digital stations are now
broadcasting, said, ``We've sold 10 tuner boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   One huge hurdle is the price. Even for those willing to pay
$3,000 or more, there is only the tiniest amount of high-definition
programming _ generally only three or four hours a week from the
television networks and none from cable. Satellite television
services have promised to offer it but not before late summer or
fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, HBO began broadcasting one channel of
high-definition programming, beginning with the movie ``U.S.
Marshals.'' But the show had no viewers because within the cable
industry, only HBO's owner, Time Warner, has offered to carry it on
its cable franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner cable, said engineers
had scrambled to complete the necessary technical upgrades by
Friday so that Time Warner could make the high-definition service
available to any customers in New York City who requested it. So
far, however, Time Warner has not received a single request.
</P>
<P>
   ABC &UR;  &LR; continues to broadcast several hours of high-definition
programming a week. But NBC &UR;  &LR; has broadcast none and has announced
no plans to do so before the network begins airing ``The Tonight
Show'' in high definition later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   CBS &UR;  &LR; aired several football games in high definition, the last
in early January. And last week the network announced that the news
show ``48 Hours'' would be broadcast in high definition beginning
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied with that, several television manufacturers are
negotiating with CBS and other networks to underwrite more
high-definition broadcasts, principally movies, beginning in the
fall, network and industry executives said. The manufacturers would
pay the cost of converting a movie to high definition _ between
$15,000 and $50,000 an hour, depending on the format.
</P>
<P>
   A Sony &UR;  &LR; executive pointed out that Sony has already put more
than $1 million into CBS' football broadcasts, primarily in
subsidized goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   But even with additional programming, the manufacturers face
another stumbling block. They acknowledge that many retailers are
making little effort to sell the HDTVs they have on their sales
floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be a technological leader,'' Herschman said.
``But we still have to sell television sets every day because if we
stop selling TVs, we stop selling everything else too _ home
theater systems, speakers. So we walk a fine line between telling
people that digital television is coming _ but we don't know when _
so buy an analog set today.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Murder exerts a peculiar hold on the American
imagination, and murder that appears to have been got away with is
particularly potent. The O.J. Simpson trial and perennial interest
in conspiracy theories about the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy are modern manifestations of this fascination, and anyone
who thinks they will fade into the pages of history books might
consider the fate of Lizzie Borden, still infamous as the ax
murderer of her father and stepmother more than a century after she
was acquitted of the 1892 double murder.
</P>
<P>
   Her story has been revived regularly as a subject for books,
plays and television movies, as well as a ballet, Agnes de Mille's
1954 ``Fall River Legend,'' with music by Morton Gould. But if
there's one art form in which murderous psychopaths really shine,
it's opera; the surprising thing is that it wasn't until 1965 that
this story made its operatic debut.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the New York City Opera gave the premiere of Jack
Beeson's ``Lizzie Borden,'' and on Saturday evening the company
revisited it in a new staging that was co-produced with the
Glimmerglass Opera and first seen there in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Beeson; his librettist, Kenward Elmslie, and Richard Plant, who
wrote the scenario for the opera, recognized that the Borden story
actually was too dull to hold the stage unvarnished, even if one
were to assume _ as all tellings of the Lizzie Borden story do _
that Lizzie committed the murders, which were apparently the one
remarkable moment in a drab life.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, Beeson and company made Lizzie the eldest of two
children (rather than the youngest of three), renamed her sister
Margret (from Emma), invented Capt. Jason MacFarlane as Margret's
love interest and gave Abigail, the girls' stepmother, a fictitious
back story in which she had been a servant in the Borden house
before the first Mrs. Borden's death.
</P>
<P>
   What this version offers, in addition to stageworthy characters,
is a psychological dimension, borrowed partly from Electra and
partly from a Freudian view of the tensions between Lizzie and her
father. It points up the bleakness that causes Lizzie to snap, but
it refuses to make any of the characters a villain.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Borden, the father, is painted as miserly and
overprotective, but not entirely mean-spirited. His response to
Abigail, for one thing, hints that there is a human heart within
him, something that Stephen West brought out in his finely sung
portrayal. If Abigail reacts testily to Lizzie and Margret, it is
not without provocation.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue, Lizzie is shown as a mirror of her father,
fixated on business, with the world at arm's length. But an
interesting touch of parallelism shows that this is not entirely
her choice: at the start of the opera, the reverend begs Andrew for
a donation to his church, to no avail; at the end, the reverend
returns Lizzie's donation because the parishioners won't accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Levine's thoughtful production keeps the psychological
interplay in focus, but also gives the action a low-key New England
naturalism. She is abetted in this by John Conklin's spare set,
with its puritanically clean lines; Constance Hoffman's 1890s
costumes and lighting by Robert Wierzel that changes subtly to suit
the text until the murder scene, when subtlety is exchanged for
starkness.
</P>
<P>
   Beeson's score, regarded as on the edge of atonality in 1965,
sounds eclectic and mild today. There are declamatory, angular
gestures that give some of the vocal lines an Expressionistic
accent, but there are also hymn tunes and flights of lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   The cast moved easily within this free-spirited musical
language, although in the first act most of the singers had trouble
projecting over the orchestra. The range of vocal color that
Phyllis Pancella brought to the title role conveyed Lizzie's
bitterness and anger, as well as the degree to which the hopes of
her inner life had been gradually crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters describe her as stone-faced, but Ms. Pancella
showed other sides of her as well, from the engaged hostess of the
choir practice at the start of the work, to a woman terrified by
her lack of options.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking aspects of Lauren Flanigan's vocally
powerful performance as Abigail was her ability to reveal the
insecurities beneath the imperious surface, particularly when
dealing with the girls. Ms. Flanigan has the subtlety to project
both Abigail's tentative attempts to make peace and her desire to
have full charge of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Blitch Wiper sang Margret's music with sufficient charm
and painted Margaret as Lizzie's timid subordinate. Dean Ely made a
strong contribution in the brief but catalytic role of MacFarlane,
and Dennis Petersen, making his house debut, sang the small role of
Harrington sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   The balance between the stage and the pit was not always ideal:
during the first act, particularly, the singers had a hard time
projecting over the orchestra. There were occasional glitches in
the playing as well, but for the most part George Manahan led a
trim, tight performance.
</P>
<P>
   The production runs through March 24, and its final evening is
to be broadcast by PBS as part of the ``Live From Lincoln Center''
series.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Think of ``Beatlemania'' as performed by six lesser
Victor Borges, and you have some idea of the theatrical impact of
``Band in Berlin,'' the engagingly sung, dramatically inert new
musical play that opened last night at the Helen Hayes Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Band in Berlin'' is not so much a play as a kind of
docu-cabaret. Through slide projections, re-enactments of newsreel
clips and the jukebox-style performances of a stream of Teutonic
folk songs and American pop standards, the show recounts the rise
and fall of the Comedian Harmonists, the renowned German singing
group forced by the Nazis to disband because three of its members
were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The story of a troupe of entertainers caught in the path of the
Nazi campaign of anti-Semitic propaganda and terror certainly has
the makings of compelling theater. (The singer Barry Manilow has
written his own musical, ``Harmony,'' based on the group's
travails, and a new movie about it, ``The Harmonists,'' opens on
Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But as directed by Susan Feldman and Patricia Birch, ``Band
in Berlin'' reduces the value of this material to the level of idle
curiosity. And I do mean idle. Midway through a musically
monotonous, 90-minute program, during which 22 numbers are
performed in German and English by five singers and a pianist, you
may begin to feel like a heavy-lidded motorist, struggling against
the effects of highway hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The show is, unintentionally, the lullaby of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman, artistic director of the St. Ann Center for
Restoration and the Arts in Brooklyn Heights, has been quoted in
interviews as expressing doubt as to whether ``Band in Berlin''
belongs on Broadway. Her skepticism is well founded. The production
cries out for a more intimate environment. That's because the scope
of the piece is so limited; it's rarely anything more than a
skillful impressionists' act.
 &UR;  &LR;  Hopscotching from one precious number to the next _ the singers
became famous for their meticulous harmonies, their uncanny ability
to mimic musical instruments and their gentle clowning _ the show
steadfastly refuses to engage some of the most fascinating issues
it raises: Who exactly were these performers? How did they feel
when the Nazis drove a wedge among them? What impact did that have
on their relationships and the rest of their lives?
</P>
<P>
   Casting singers rather than actors probably precluded this type
of exploration. To a large degree the show's creators rely on a
seventh character, an older version of one of the Harmonists,
played by Herbert Rubens, to supply emotional context. Portraying
the group member Roman Cycowski, Rubens appears in a
black-and-white mock documentary that is projected onto a screen at
the back of the stage and relates in broad outline the group's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt is to provide the story with a touchstone, but it
has the opposite effect; the film makes the performers onstage seem
duller and all the more remote. The narration rarely pierces the
play's placid surface. (``It was wonderful fun, and we thought
nothing could happen to us because we were famous'' is about as
candid and probing as the commentary gets.) In some instances the
phony documentary only succeeds in wasting time, as when it depicts
the group members on tour, clutching suitcases and dashing this way
and that.
</P>
<P>
   At other times Rubens' disembodied voice is broadcast in the
theater, and this, too, can be a clunky device. For example, as he
describes each of the group members, a spotlight is trained on that
vocalist, who is forced to stand there like a statue, smiling and
nodding in strained silence. The performers fare no better in a
scene that depicts an incident in Stuttgart, where a Nazi effort to
shut the group down is thwarted by their devoted fans; it fails to
impart any sense of the Harmonists' turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   One of the points of ``Band in Berlin'' may be that the Comedian
Harmonists were at some remove from reality through much of the
Nazi era, oblivious, like much of the German public that revered
them, to the magnitude of the threat they faced. (It may also be
intentional that it's almost impossible to remember which men
onstage are supposed to be Jewish.)
</P>
<P>
   But turning them all into singing shadows is not a particularly
effective way of unlocking an audience's empathy, except perhaps
for those who have warm memories of the group or a special
admiration for their style of singing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On this last score, at least, the creators of ``Band in Berlin''
have done their homework. The five vocalists, played by Mark
Bleeke, Timothy Leigh Evans, Hugo Munday, Peter Becker and Wilbur
Pauley, and the pianist, Robert Wolinsky (all members of an actual
musical group, Hudson Shad), are adroit with the Harmonists'
material. In their top hats, tails and shimmering harmonies, they
have no trouble convincing us they are the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The performers may not be given a chance to emote, but they are
certainly unassailable as trombones and violins. In the evening's
most pleasing number, the overture to ``The Barber of Seville'' is
recreated entirely through impersonations of musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remainder of the program puts you in mind of that
alpine talent show in ``The Sound of Music'': the Comedian
Harmonists might have been the group that went on just before the
Trapp family. Their repertory ranges from covers of hits like Duke
Ellington's ``It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got That Swing'' to
saccharine renditions of novelty songs like ``Mein Kleine Gruner
Kaktus'' (``My Little Green Cactus''), for which the singers slip
on green oven mitts with little yellow protruding spines.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the Comedian Harmonists' story, you have to feel
something for their unique predicament, otherwise they're just
Deutsche Beach Boys. Ms. Birch, the Broadway choreographer, and Ms.
Feldman, who wrote and conceived the piece, provide the bass notes
and the footnotes. But they never strike more resonant human
chords.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Alexander is the bearer of bad news for
hundreds of corporations. And now, Alexander's clients can take
heart that he intends to bring them more negative tidings more
quickly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, 30, and his brother, Charles Lukaszewski, 32, are
co-founders and operators of Ewatch, a company that scours the
Internet on behalf of corporate clients who want to know what the
rest of the world is saying behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman is a pedophile; the chairman is arrested; the
chairman has checked into a hospital under an assumed name,''
Alexander said, rattling off recent examples of false rumors from
the dark corners of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have long paid so-called clipping services to
monitor their appearances in the conventional news media. But
Ewatch and its several competitors have taken the practice online
and a step further.
</P>
<P>
   This new generation of monitors goes beyond news publishers and
instead trolls for rumor and innuendo in the Net's virtual back
alleys _ in thousands of chat rooms and discussion forums where,
Ewatch executives say, unchecked scuttlebutt can damage corporate
reputations and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   These brothers grim _ Lukaszewski a programmer by training and
Alexander a former television producer _ started Ewatch in 1994
from their home offices in Minneapolis and New York, respectively.
With help from friends and family, they spent days searching the
Internet for venom spewed against corporations, trying to convince
potential clients of the need for online rumor detection and
control.
</P>
<P>
   But bad news for corporate America meant good public relations
for Ewatch. After O.J. Simpson's acquittal on murder charges in
October 1995, for example, a false rumor _ first reported on the
tabloid television show ``Hard Copy,'' and then spread on the
Internet _ said that Mrs. Field's Cookies had underwritten a party
for the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales dipped, Alexander said, and Ewatch was hired
to help Mrs. Fields find online discussion groups where the rumor
had appeared, and then post corrective messages. Cookie sales soon
returned to normal levels, Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as cyberspace has grown, so have Ewatch's methods.
As its client list expanded, the company scrapped manual monitoring
for automated ``spiders'' _ search tools that scour chat groups for
key-word phrases.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, Ewatch began a more fundamental
overhaul, upgrading its software and server computers to quadruple
the speed at which they scan and process information. The company
also replaced its home-brewed search engine with search software
from Excalibur Technology, which will be coupled with a new Oracle
data base management system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is experiencing uncontrollable growth, and we
have to be prepared for it,'' said Alexander, who also said that
the upgrade would cost $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Ewatch combs through more than 250,000 postings from
the sprawling online discussion forum known as Usenet. It also
monitors thousands of other postings from the financial chat rooms
on leading Web sites, including Yahoo and Motley Fool, while also
scanning discussion areas on the leading proprietary online
services like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the challenge of keeping apace of Internet growth,
Ewatch has another concern: competition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the handful of competitors offering monitoring services
are Cybercheck, a Denver company that says it can search for key
words in 150,000 online sources, and Cyveillance, an Alexandria,
Va., company that scans the bit stream for rumors, trademark
infringements and e-commerce developments that might affect its
corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis M. Thompson, president and chief executive of the
National Investor Relations Institute, a trade group based in
Vienna, Va., said that among Internet monitoring companies, Ewatch
``seems to be the big one on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewatch serves about 130 clients full time, including US West,
H.J. Heinz, Owens Corning and Northwest Airlines. It is no longer
independent, having been acquired by Wavephore Inc., a publicly
held data broadcasting company based in Phoenix. But it is still
operated by the brothers, with Alexander overseeing marketing from
New York and Lukaszewski operating the technology side from
Minneapolis, where the brothers were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that corporations had come to realize that the
same attributes that make the Internet a valuable commercial medium
_ such as the ability to quickly and cheaply spread information to
the masses _ can be a liability, too. That is especially true as
the rising popularity of online stock trading has placed a
fast-twitch premium on corporate information, often with little
regard to its accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as more companies come to recognize the perils of the
electronic grapevine, Ewatch and other monitoring agents are
finding that their real competitors are often their would-be
clients. Many companies use in-house resources to monitor the
Internet, or ask their public relations firms to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Even if companies acknowledge that Ewatch may have superior
surveillance capabilities, they may not always be convinced that
the $13,000-a-year service is worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Take Itex Corp., a small, publicly held financial record-keeping
company in Portland, Ore., which has filed a lawsuit against
several people whom Itex accuses of making defamatory remarks
against the company in a Yahoo chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company filed its suit, the burden of trolling the
Internet for corporate gossip is being borne by the company's
assistant general counsel, Stephen C. Pearson. He said the small
public company _ which was recently delisted from the Nasdaq stock
market after the Securities and Exchange Commission said Itex had
failed to submit its annual report on time _ could not afford the
likes of Ewatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at Ewatch in particular and did a brief analysis of
their systems,'' Pearson said. ``We came to the conclusion that it
was pretty expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ewatch's better capitalized bigger clients say the
service has proved valuable, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a loose and free exchange of information on the
Internet,'' said Tom Pinto, spokesman for the giant pension system
TIAA-CREF, which manages more than $250 billion in assets.
``Anything that is inaccurate or harmful, we want to know
immediately about it and respond.''
</P>
<P>
   One day last October, for example, a visitor to a Compuserve
discussion room wrote that a TIAA-CREF pension fund called Global
Equities held 25 percent of its assets in Asia. In fact, the fund
held only 5 percent of its assets in the region, and it was a
potentially devastating error, coming amid the Asian economic
crisis. Had the rumor spread, Pinto recalled, it might have caused
investors to flee the $6 billion pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, an Ewatch report landed on Pinto's desk. Two days
later, the TIAA-CREF manager of media relations sent e-mail to the
mediator of the chat group, who posted a correction.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of messages posted daily to tens of
thousands of Internet message boards, it might seem humanly
impossible to patrol even a fraction of cyberspace. But Ewatch
relies on its search spiders and computers to do most of the
culling, before handing off to the half-dozen people Ewatch employs
to do the final winnowing before passing along the information to
clients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the searches have periodically turned up some
juicy material. Take the episode, for instance, when a group of
restive shareholders plotted online to disrupt an annual corporate
meeting _ even agreeing to the clothes they would wear so they
could identify one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Ewatch clients are not necessarily looking for bad
tidings, but simply any news or discussions that might be relevant
to the company. Owens Corning, based in Toledo, Ohio, instructs
Ewatch to search not just for its name, but also for the words
``fiberglass,'' ``insulation'' and ``asphalt,'' Jim Worden, an
Owens Corning spokesman, said. Such searches, he said, help the
company stay abreast of consumer sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Ewatch will be offered for an extra fee to subscribers of
Wavephore's primary product, Newscast, which gives corporations
tailored news feeds from thousands of sources like Dow Jones,
Reuters and PR Newswire. And Ewatch subscribers, in turn, will be
given access to Newscast Lite, a significantly slimmed-down version
of Newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Alexander said he would like to create a service
that would help a company analyze the combined impact of Internet
rumors, media coverage and the client's own public relations
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that plenty of details still need to be
worked out, he envisions the day when a client could type in a
natural-language query like ``Why are sales lagging in Minnesota?''
and receive reports about marketing, media and mendacity that might
help explain the problem.
</P>
<P>
   And on the assumption that no news is not necessarily good news,
the company plans eventually to monitor not only for gossip and
innuendo, but for the absence of chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a company that's spent $100 million on a launch
campaign and no one's talking about you _ why is that?'' Alexander
said. ``If there's nothing about you online, isn't that valuable
information to know?''

RODRIGUEZ HAS NEW CHALLENGER FOR GOLD GLOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez faces his
first Gold Glove challenge this year. Charles Johnson has come to
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles traded for Johnson this winter after he
spent the past four seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the
Florida Marlins. He was the National League's Gold Glove winner at
catcher all four years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has been the American League winner in each of his
seven full seasons. Only Hall of Famer Johnny Bench, with 10 Gold
Glove awards, has won more among catchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both outstanding players,'' Boston manager Jimy
Williams said. ``To be voted by your peers that many times, it's
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a lifetime .295 hitter, is easily the better
offensive player. He has also been an All-Star the past seven
seasons. Johnson, a career .234 hitter, has never made an All-Star
team.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gold Glove, voted on by league managers and coaches, is
only about defense, and Rodriguez faces a formidable challenge this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about that,'' Rodriguez said. ``Goals ...
that's for the end of the year. I'm going to do my job, he's going
to do his job. I just play hard to make this team make the playoffs
and the World Series, that's the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I say to him is good luck, I hope he stays
injury free and hope he has a good season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Glove offers an interesting contrast because, as
Rangers pitcher Rick Helling said, ``They're both similar, but they
are both different.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarity is in ability. The difference is style.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is big and strong. Rodriguez is short and quick. Both
have fabulous throwing arms, still the most important asset for any
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarities end there.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball people who have watched them both say Rodriguez is
better at throwing out runners and getting to balls hit in front of
the plate. Johnson is given the edge when it comes to fewer passed
balls and blocking wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Former Marlins reliever Robb Nen, commenting on Johnson's
ability to block pitches in the dirt, said throwing to Johnson ``is
like throwing to a brick wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Witt, a former Ranger and Marlin who, like Nen and
Helling, has thrown to both Rodriguez and Johnson, said, ``Charles,
as far as blocking balls, he's the best. He gets mad if the ball
gets by him. He can't stand it. No matter what you throw, he feels
he shouldn't let it get by.''
</P>
<P>
   A major-league scout said, ``Johnson is fundamentally sound. He
always goes to his knees and blocks the ball properly. Pudge has
great quickness but sometimes he reaches for balls rather than
blocking them. He gets lazy and balls get away that shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's tremendous concentration was evident in 1997, when he
went the entire season with no errors and only one passed ball. He
holds the major-league record with 172 consecutive errorless games.
Rodriguez's best is 61 consecutive errorless games.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, Johnson has allowed only 18 passed
balls and committed 17 errors. Rodriguez, in the same span, has
allowed 31 passed balls and committed 31 errors. But Rodriguez has
also played in 104 more games _ 578 to 474 _ than Johnson during
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of pride in my defense, but I'm not going to get
caught up in the Gold Glove thing,'' Johnson said. ``As a player,
you want to win it, no doubt. But you want to be judged fairly and
hope they take into consideration everything _ errors, passed
balls, wild pitches, runners caught stealing, everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you're judged across the board, if his numbers are
better than mine, he deserves it. If my numbers are better than
his, I hope I'm deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has been more successful than Rodriguez at throwing out
basestealers in recent years. He has led the major leagues in
throwing out basestealers the past four seasons, nailing 49.3
percent, compared to Johnson's 43.3 percent during the same
stretch. Runners tried stealing 53 more times against Johnson even
though he played 104 less games than Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better pick your spots with both of them if you're going
to go because they've got a good chance of throwing you out,'' said
Red Sox center fielder Darren Lewis, a former National Leaguer with
215 career steals. ``You look at both those guys on defense, it
doesn't get any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has another advantage over Johnson as a thrower and
that's his ability to pick off base runners. His aggressiveness
leads to more errors, but he has also picked off 27 baserunners the
past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just freezes runners,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild
said. ``You sit there and say before the game, he's going to throw
through, he's going to throw to first, he's going to throw to
second, he's going to throw to third. Be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you can see, when he gets set to throw and it's so quick,
the runner freezes. Then his arm is so strong, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Physical statistics do not alone determine a catcher's defensive
worth. Calling games and handling pitchers also comes into play.
Houston Astros pitchers, for instance, give Brad Ausmus much of the
credit for their recent success.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is considered adept at calling a game. Rodriguez is
considered to be improving, although it's long been considered an
area where he needs the most work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely gotten better,'' Witt said. ``A lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, however, said, ``To me it doesn't matter. I pretty much
call my own gme. If I don't like what they put down, I just shake
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to who is the best overall catcher, Helling makes
the best point. ``I'd take either one of them. There's no question
they're the two best catchers in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But only one can win the Gold Glove this year.

RANGERS GM DIDN'T PANIC AFTER WINTER REBUFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ After a winter of being rejected,
spurned, stood-up and cold-shouldered, Doug Melvin could have:
</P>
<P>
   (a) Dropped a note to Dear Abby. (Signed, Desperate Doug in
Arlington).
</P>
<P>
   (b) Taken the cheesy route by shedding a tear on The Jerry
Springer Show.
</P>
<P>
   (c) Written a country song.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Melvin did the manly thing. He refused to take ``no''
for an insult, even as that Randy Johnson-Roger Clemens-Todd
Stottlemyre echo pounded his eardrums.
</P>
<P>
   By regrouping, what Melvin eventually ended up with is the best
overall Rangers' team in history _ if you don't count the pitching
rotation. Yeah, just that.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin: ``I don't mind matching our everyday lineup against
anybody's, based on offensive production, offensive balance,
defensive skill and defensive balance up the middle. Plus, there's
enough of a speed factor. It's only my opinion, but we've got a
chance to be real good.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, is a so-so rotation surviving behind run
support and defense. It might work. It would work much better if
Randy or Roger were included, or maybe even Todd. But that's
yesterday's heartbreak. Baseball life moves on.
</P>
<P>
   And for those of us who claim the Rangers flunked their No. 1
off-season priority _ corraling a rotation ace _ manager Johnny
Oates has this message:
</P>
<P>
   Get a baseball grip.
</P>
<P>
   Oates waived his Miranda rights the other day, and also
volunteered to be strapped to a polygraph. His version of the
truth, even without legal counsel being present, is he never asked
Melvin or owner Tom Hicks to make Johnson or Clemens the top winter
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortstop,'' said Oates. ``I requested they make sure we were
strong at shortstop. As strong as we were once Royce Clayton joined
us \Rin late July '98).\S
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, as it turned out, didn't say ``no.'' He re-enlisted in
Arlington. And then a pleasant surprise for Oates was when Rafael
Palmeiro refused to take from the Rangers any other answer except
``yes.'' Rafael wanted to come back, and made it happen. What also
happened was an instant offensive and defensive upgrade at first
base, plus the perfect No. 5 hitter behind Juan Gonzalez, a
seldom-mentioned area where the Rangers were lacking.
</P>
<P>
   An ailing knee has limited Palmeiro thus far, and as a
precaution, Rafael returned to Texas yesterday for a medical check.
When healthy, however, this is a premier hitter and glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' said Oates, ``I think we had a great winter. You
can talk all you want about the pitcher we didn't get, but Randy
Johnson made a family decision \Rto sign with Arizona and live at
home in Phoenix\S, and Roger Clemens simply wanted to pitch for the
Yankees. I can't hold that against him.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Rangers certainly wanted to re-sign Stottlemyre,
they had a financial ceiling on him. ``What'd he get in Arizona?''
asked Oates, knowing the answer was $8 million a season. ``Well,
that was a heck of a lot more than we were gonna pay. There are
exceptions like Rafael and Pudge \RRodriguez\S and Randy
\RJohnson\S. But mainly these guys don't care where they live.
Waive a few extra million in their face, and they will live on the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates found last season he couldn't live without an established
shortstop. ``Put Randy Johnson or Roger Clemens on our team last
season and we don't win the division without Royce Clayton,'' he
said. ``We wouldn't have caught enough balls. Look at everybody
that wins in our league _ they have a tremendous shortstop. You can
have an ace, but you still won't win without a shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton hadn't been in Arlington three weeks when it was already
safe to declare him the best defensive shortstop in franchise
history. That is not necessarily a compliment, considering the
misadventures of past job holders. But actually, Clayton may be
twice as good as the Rangers have ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Stottlemyre, Clayton was also liking what he was seeing
during his two-plus months with the Rangers. ``Other teams were
calling \Rover the winter\S,'' he said, ``but I kept telling my
parents, where was I going to find a better place to live, a better
ballpark, or a better chance to be on a winner. These people,
starting with the owner, want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the emphasis, and rightfully so, has been on pitchers the
Rangers couldn't land over the winter. But what they did get in
Clayton and Palmeiro was much more than consolation prizes. They
are both key ingredients to success.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Doug Melvin, if he had so desired, could have written in
that country song this winter:
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit me below the belt, darlin', but I was wearing my
Wranglers higher than you thought.''

GONZALEZ'S DEAL COULD BE EXTENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers are expected to discuss a
long-term contract extension for outfielder Juan Gonzalez when club
president Tom Schieffer arrives in camp later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's agent, Jim Bronner, also is expected to be in Port
Charlotte at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll sit down and talk about it then,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said. ``We'll be able to tell after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has two years left on the seven-year, $45.45 million
contract he signed before the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to play baseball,'' Gonzalez said. ``My contract is
up to my agent, Mr. Schieffer and Doug.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got an idea of how much it will take to keep
Gonzalez when the Rockies signed Larry Walker to a six-year, $75
million contract last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``His signing is somewhere in there,'' Melvin said. ``Mo Vaughn
is right there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn signed a six-year, $80 million contract with the Angels
in the off-season, making him the highest-paid position player in
baseball. The highest-paid player is Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown,
who signed a seven-year, $105 million contract.
SIMMS OUT
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Mike Simms has a torn Achilles tendon and is
expected to be sidelined three to four weeks. Simms injured his
foot running last week.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league pitcher Corey Lee also is out indefinitely after
cutting his left index finger with a knife when he was slicing a
bagel.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers good news concerns pitcher John Wetteland, who is
sidelined with an ankle injury. He threw 20 minutes in the bullpen
yesterday and is expected to pitch batting practice tomorrow.
Pirates 15, Rangers 6
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitchers gave up 18 hits and walked seven against the
Pirates at Charlotte County Stadium yesterday, throwing 182
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's way too many pitches,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``We need to throw more strikes, get ahead of hitters, let
them hit it and see if we can catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the plate: First baseman Lee Stevens went 2-for-3 yesterday
with three runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound: Aaron Sele breezed through the first inning, but
couldn't get out of the second, allowing six runs on six hits and a
walk. Oates said Sele was throwing mainly fastballs in the second
inning. Mike Morgan took over and threw 21/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the field: Second baseman Mark McLemore and shortstop Royce
Clayton failed to turn an inning-ending double play with the bases
loaded in the fifth. Instead they got just one, and the Pirates
ended up with four runs off pitcher Mike Munoz.

WEST TOPS FIRST-ROUND FIELD AT ST. LOUIS SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For the past year, Terry Don West has patiently
waited for a match against the bucking bull Gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, West's wishes were fulfilled in a big way as the
former world champion won the first round of the St. Louis Open
with a score of 91.5 at the Kiel Center.
</P>
<P>
   West topped the spinning bull at the Professional Bull Riders
Bud Light Cup Series' 10th stop of the 1999 season. The two-day
show is scheduled to conclude this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the tour is scheduled to stop in Fort Worth for the
Tuff Hedeman Championship Challenge, scheduled Friday through March
14, at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis this weekend, West, a Henryetta, Okla., resident,
said he was elated to learn that he would face Gusto, which is
owned H.D. Page of Ardmore, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen him before and I had wanted to draw him, and
tonight was my night,'' West said. ``He was a hard bucker, but I
got in time with him and he felt good to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time world champion Jim Sharp, who returned this weekend
after being sidelined for 10 months with a dislocated shoulder,
finished second in the round with a 90.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on a couple of practice bulls last week, and my shoulder
felt good,'' Sharp said. ``I needed to practice because when you
come to one of these shows, you'll get a good bucker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp topped Magic Carpet Ride, owned by Jerry Nelson. ``After
laying off, I feel really healthy,'' Sharp said.
MURRAY'S ABSENCE
</P>
<P>
   Though seven-time world all-around champion Ty Murray will not
qualify for tonight's Houston Livestock Show Rodeo final round, the
Stephenville cowboy could win Houston's $25,000 prize, which is
presented to the two-week rodeo's all-around winner. Murray could
win the all-around title on the basis of strong finishes in
preliminary rounds during the Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association show.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is scheduled to compete in this afternoon's PBR show in
St. Louis. Last night, Murray, who leads the 1999 cup series race,
finished sixth in the first round with an 85.5.
MORAES' ABSENCE
</P>
<P>
   Adriano Moraes, the PBR's 1994 Bud Light Cup Series champion,
said he will decline to compete on the 1999 tour. Moraes, who lives
near Sao Paulo, Brazil, said he plans to spend most of his time at
his home tending to his year-old son, working on his ranch and
doing church work.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Moraes was sidelined for about six months after
breaking his leg at the PBR show in Fort Worth. He has recently
recovered from being sidelined for about three months; Moraes
suffered a broken clavicle at the November PBR World championships
in Las Vegas.

OLYMPIC MESS SHAKES UTAH'S PRIDE, MAYBE ITS FAITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Sanctuaried by high walls and serenaded by the
11,000 pipes of the Mormon Tabernacle organ, Temple Square has long
been a tranquil retreat in this decidedly godly city.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, on the home grounds of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, there are signs.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of intruders, like the massive road work taking place
beyond the north gate. Sounds of jackhammers, crumbling what was
old to make way for the new.
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 Winter Olympics is lapping at Temple Square's saintly
heels.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Utah, Mike Leavitt, is a Mormon. The new head of
the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee, Mitt Romney, is a
Mormon. The former head of the bid committee, Tom Welch, is a
Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 percent of Utah's 2 million residents are
Mormons, which is not presented here to imply anything about the
denomination or about Olympic corruption, but rather to give an
idea of the communion of souls that make up this valley of the
Wasatch Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city grows, and people move here each year from places
like California,'' said Catherine Collins, a mother of five and
lifelong resident. ``But I'd like to think that we've stayed a
simple and honest people. We have a high sense of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, yes, I worry about the damage that the Olympic mess has
done to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state where image matters, Utahns' pride has been shaken as
well as maybe even their faith. Welch was a former church bishop.
He resigned in 1997 after spousal abuse charges were filed, and he
was the ground-zero target of accusations rendered in a February
300-page ethics report.
</P>
<P>
   Utahns bear each day's news, wondering what will be next. They
wince. They wait. They want to move on.
UNDER INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   Last week in New York, a special commission of the U.S. Olympic
Committee blamed the USOC itself for not exercising more stringent
oversight of the Salt Lake bid committee. Chaired by former senator
George J. Mitchell, the USOC panel also called on President Clinton
to declare the International Olympic Committee a ``public
international organization,'' a designation that would make bribing
its officials a crime punishable under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   The next in a series of reports from five separate probes into
Salt Lake-related improper spending and unethical conduct will come
when the IOC convenes March 17 in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Twenty-four IOC members have either already resigned or are under
suspicion and could eventually be recommended for expulsion at that
special session.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be released are the findings of an investigation by the
Utah state attorney general's office and a probe by the FBI and
U.S. Justice Department. The latter, which is expected to be
released late this month, could lead to criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The report that the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) Board
of Ethics presented is 2 1/2 inches thick. It details a pattern of
excessive gift-giving and favor-rendering to members of the IOC and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges: Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo Republic
soaked the Salt Lake committee for gifts estimated at $250,000,
including plastic surgery for his wife and shopping sprees at
Wal-Mart. Other charges border on potentially criminal. General
Zein El Abdin Mohamed Abdel Gadir, IOC member from Sudan, once
faxed the bid committee requesting that $1,000 per month be sent to
``Zema Gadir,'' the general's supposed daughter. The general, as it
turned out, has no daughter named Zema. The name is a pseudonym for
Gadir himself. He simply put the first letters of all his names
together.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the SLOC report charged that 24 IOC members or their
associates received, either directly or indirectly, an estimated
$1.2 million in cash, scholarships, free trips, medical care and
sundry improper inducements from the Utah bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in last week's USOC findings, however, there was no
smoking gun in the SLOC report. Nothing to link a direct payment
with an explicit promise of a vote. Rather, according to attorney
David Jordan, the evidence shows that, ``There was an explicit goal
of establishing long-term, vote-influencing relationships with IOC
members.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLOC board even cited a date _ June 15, 1991, the day that
Salt Lake City, bidding for the 1998 Olympic Winter Games, lost on
the final ballot to Nagano, Japan, by four votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering for the vote in Birmingham, England, the Salt Lake
contingent distributed ``goodie bags'' to IOC members of Utah
souvenirs and home-grown products. Among the token gifts were
disposable cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagano committee gave the IOC voters Sony camcorders. It
hosted lavish parties.
</P>
<P>
   As the report later read, ``The exposure to Nagano's well-oiled
bid machine and to the excessive demands of certain IOC members
would prove to be a watershed event that shaped the approach of Mr.
Welch and Mr. \RDave\S Johnson to the campaign for the 2002
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning from England, Welch and Johnson, the bid
committee's former vice president, met with board trustees and
civic leaders to analyze what went wrong. They decided to press
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There would be more fund-raising. Staff was increased. There was
a successful push to the Utah legislature to approve infrastructure
projects and build facilities that would be used should Salt Lake
City get the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   With the increased commitment came added pressure for Welch and
Johnson. This time, they had to deliver the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the excesses that followed filled the 300 pages of last
month's report. The U.S. Justice Department report, however, could
have far more serious repercussions. FBI investigators, for one
thing, have been able to use their power of subpoena to examine
bank records and interview individuals not available to the SLOC,
USOC and IOC panels. Four separate prosecutors and 15 FBI agents
have been assigned to the federal government's Salt Lake City
probe.
</P>
<P>
   For Utahns, however, the damage already is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to look at the newspapers,'' said Mary
Stringham, a bank clerk from Bountiful, Utah. ``To me, it's no
longer the Olympics the way I always thought they were. It's greed.
It's people I don't even want to be associated with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, some of those people are . . . us.''
`WHAT'S WRONG IS WRONG'
</P>
<P>
   In Crossroads Plaza, the downtown shopping mall directly across
the street from Temple Square, sales of Olympic souvenirs have not
slowed, store managers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not allowed to talk about that,'' said a young store
clerk, a student at nearby University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being an honest person,'' said a shopper who would only
give her name as ``Lea.'' ``What's happened here, as far as I'm
concerned, isn't any better than the Clinton thing. What's wrong is
wrong. What's right is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial fears here were that in the wake of the scandal, the
Games would be taken from Salt Lake City and moved elsewhere. IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch was quick to assure that that
would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch himself remains under a veritable public relations
siege. Editorial writers around the globe have called for his
resignation. Corporations, including advertising's 5,000-pound
gorilla _ Coca-Cola _ said two weeks ago that are re-evaluating
their investment in the Olympics. One of the Salt Lake sponsors, US
West, temporarily withheld a $5 million payment in January until it
felt that steps were being taken toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, the USOC turned a chilly shoulder when asked
whether it would endorse the notion of Samaranch continuing after
the IOC special session next week.
</P>
<P>
   The new head of SLOC, Romney, has been summoned home from
Massachusetts to mend some of those corporate and diplomatic
fences. Romney said last week that he sees ``no alarm'' in raising
the private funds to meet the Games' $1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude has re-energized the local community, some say.
</P>
<P>
   A survey whose results were published last week in the ``Salt
Lake Tribune'' says that two-thirds of Utah residents still believe
that the area can host a scandal-free and successful 2002 Olympics.
The same survey also said that 75 percent of those polled want
former trustees of the bid committee who are still on the SLOC
board to publicly acknowledge some responsibility for the
misconduct and/or resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons are proud of being moral people and abiding by the
commandments,'' said Darien Fry, a computer consultant from Salt
Lake City. ``So all this has been a deep jolt to what we believe in
and what we feel we stand for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embarrassed? Yes, I would say so. But recovering? I would say
that we are recovering, too.''
SCANDAL THERAPY
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days before the scandal broke last December, the LDS
church had publicly endorsed the idea of the Olympics coming to
Utah. Church spokesmen have avoided most comment on the ensuing
troubles, other than to describe the bribes and payments as ``a
terrible lapse in moral judgment'' and to remind reporters sternly
that these are not the ``Mormon Olympics.'' One LDS spokesman
likened the queries to calling the Vatican every time there was
news of a Mafia slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs of Olympic-scandal therapy in the works. A
stone's throw from SLOC headquarters and from Temple Square, a
local photofinishing company owner decided to put a wry twist on
the Olympic scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Green of Creative Color hosted ``Schmooze Day,'' and
invited downtown business people to come in and be wined and dined
like a true IOC committee member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bribery,'' Green concluded, tongue in cheek, ``is an effective
tool in attracting business.''
</P>
<P>
   While a piano player tickled the keyboard with free ``Olympic
songs'' like ``Love With A Proper Stranger'' and ``Something to
Remember You By'', customers were schmoozed with free manicures,
massages and shoe shines. A suitcase filled with Monopoly money
added to the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can read only so much without saying enough already,''
said Wendy Ripley, the company's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   As Ripley noted, the Salt Lake City Games are still three years
away. That is ample time, she said, for images to be repaired and
for wounded souls to heal.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, Utahns hope _ and maybe pray _ the
investigations will be over and the winter athletes will finally
take over the newspapers and the television reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep reminding myself,'' Stringham said, ``that this is all
about the athletes. But it's hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when this is all over, what we'll remember are them
and the medals they won. I pray for that. I really do.''

BAYLOR TO GET A BIG-NAME BASKETBALL COACH? DREAM ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ This space is normally reserved for ``another
view.'' And that perhaps is entirely appropriate for today's
subject.
</P>
<P>
   It will be some time before a lot of people have any other view
of Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton and university president
Robert Sloan other than that of the pair of them bolting from
Kemper Arena on Thursday while their basketball team was still
playing on the court below.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation offered by another Baylor staff member was that
they had a plane to catch. OK, I'll accept that. So let's just say
the two of them _ especially Stanton _ were guilty of nothing more
than short-sighted and abysmally bad judgment and exhibited a total
lack of public relations awareness. Which is nothing new at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Where should they have been? Well, for my money they should have
either taken a later flight or delayed departure until the next day
to have been present in the postgame dressing room _ where other
Big 12 administrators frequently appear in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they had not given now former coach Harry Miller the
time of day, they should have been there to console and _ yeah _
congratulate a basketball team that could have but did not go
belly-up on Miller and the university a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there on Thursday were the Bears, overmatched again but
playing to the last minute. The temptation is to imagine that as a
courageous Kish Lewis was tearing across the Kemper floor in quest
of a loose ball during the last minute of a 26-point loss, that his
university's administration was in a rental car squealing out of
the parking lot for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   This is a way to treat a team, a coach they've repeatedly
referred to as one with a great deal of character and integrity?
Those qualities _ on that day at least _ were lacking at the top.
</P>
<P>
   What does that have to do with the next coach? Maybe nothing. Or
maybe it becomes yet another reason for some qualified candidate to
doubt the wisdom of interest in a job that could be a ticket to
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has some illusions of grandeur. I keep hearing that we'll
all be surprised at the quality of the man who is chosen to succeed
Miller. But all I can think of is the number of coaches I talked to
last spring who were not interested in the Texas A&AMP;M job _ a
position with more available resources and at least the appearance
of a greater chance for success _ though the Aggies got a gem in
Melvin Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   You've possibly heard some of the names already being tossed
around. Names like deposed Iowa coach Tom Davis. Or Tulsa's Bill
Self. Southwest Missouri's Steve Alford. Former Michigan coach
Steve Fisher? Get real.
</P>
<P>
   Would Davis, at 60, want to tackle the chore of building a
program with little foundation and any modicum of success
realistically inside of three seasons?
</P>
<P>
   Self has a good young team and plays in a new arena where he
gets good support and makes good money. He has told friends he's
not interested in Baylor. The long-range speculation is that Self
has eyes on succeeding former boss Eddie Sutton someday at Oklahoma
State.
</P>
<P>
   Alford reportedly has worn out his welcome in some circles at
Southwest Missouri and may be interested in succeeding Davis at
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Baylor and its deep-pocket program backer indeed have a
prized candidate. I hope so. But realistically, this search may
turn to another tier. One that might include promising young guys
like Dickey Nutt at Arkansas State or Barry Hinson at Oral Roberts.
Or, a guy like Oklahoma State assistant Paul Graham _ a sharp guy
with Sutton-Dave Bliss bloodlines who won't have to introduce
himself to Texas high school coaches. Graham has proven he can
recruit the state, where he was formerly a state championship high
school coach at Dallas Kimball.
</P>
<P>
   Will Baylor pay a basketball coach more than the guessed
$400,000 ceiling for new football coach Kevin Steele? Good
question. If their purported big name is a big name, they'll have
to.

MAVERICKS' NOWITZKI STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ From a rookie of the year candidate to
project of the year. That's where the Mavericks stand with Dirk
Nowitzki.
</P>
<P>
   The German native has struggled so much in his first NBA season
that Mavericks coach Don Nelson has reluctantly reduced Nowitzki's
playing time. Instead of showcasing Nowitzki as a starter and
watching him get torched on the defensive end, the Mavericks have
instead decided to spoon-feed minutes to the 7-foot forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll pick his spots for him,'' Nelson said. ``We'll take a
step back, breathe, take a look, do some practices and see how he
goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely in over his head right now, but he's got to
work his way out of it. I read where he's tired, but it's just so
different for him. It's a bigger step than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   But not a bigger step than what Nowitzki thought.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Nowitzki repeatedly said he didn't think he was
ready to play pro basketball at the NBA level. Nelson nevertheless
convinced him to make the jump. He even had Mavericks owner Ross
Perot Jr. travel to Germany to meet Nowitzki's parents.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like Nowitzki was a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable for a rookie to go through periods for
which they don't quite have a feel for the situation,'' guard Steve
Nash said. ``He's only 20, so he's a young rookie and he's been a
long way away from the NBA before this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another stumbling block that'll make him a better
player once he overcomes it, and he'll overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki has averaged only seven points and 3.8 rebounds in 18.8
minutes per game. From the field, he's making only 33.9 percent of
his shots.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, while playing for DJK Wurzburg, Nowitzki averaged
28.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and made 56.1 percent of his shots. .561
percent.]
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought my shot would be going so badly,'' Nowitzki
said. ``But I'm trying to stay cool and keep my head up.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to beef up his body so he can handle the constant
bumping and pounding from opponents, Nowitzki has gone on a
weight-training program and gained 10 pounds in the past three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made improvements,'' Nelson said. ``But he's just
swamped with a little of everything. Physicality is probably a big
part of \Rhis struggles\S, but he hasn't made his outside shot and
we know he's just a fantastic shooter. It's just a learning
process.''
</P>
<P>
   For every poor game Nowitzki has, Mavericks fans scan the box
scores and continue to remind management that they passed up a
known quantity in Kansas forward Paul Pierce, drafted one spot
later by the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Paul Pierce,'' Nelson said. ``But I think in the long
run, we like our guy \RNowitzki\S better.''

CITY OPERA ' S SEASON BEGINS WITH `BOHEME'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the spring offerings of the New York City
Opera will feature some much-anticipated productions of less-known
works, including Strauss' ``Intermezzo'' and a Ravel double bill of
``L'Heure Espagnole'' and ``L'Enfant et les Sortileges,'' the
season officially began on Friday night with the most familiar of
all operas, Puccini's ``Boheme.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the City Opera has worked hard, and by most
measures successfully, to distinguish itself from its Lincoln
Center neighbor. Obviously this is easier to do when the company
presents unusual repertory, like Handel's ``Partenope'' and
Carlisle Floyd's ``Of Mice and Men,'' that the Metropolitan Opera
would not be interested in.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night's performance was a reminder of why the City
Opera has something to offer when it comes to the staples. The
company may not be able to cast ``Don Giovanni'' or ``Tosca'' with
world-class voices, but when things go right, it presents young,
ardent singers who plausibly resemble the characters they are
portraying in intimate, freshly rethought productions.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is right about the company's production of ``La Boheme,''
gracefully directed with a eye for telling detail by the former
soprano Graziella Sciutti. The designer John Conklin is credited
with having revised the spare, colorful sets that Michael Anania
created for this 1995 production.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sets are even more spare. For example, the bohemians'
garret in Act I is suggested by a wall-less platform with a chair
here, a table there, and the requisite battered old sofa that Mimi
will come to die on in the last act. But behind them, on a lovely
painted backdrop, is the expanse of Paris in the twilight.
</P>
<P>
   The cast was youthful and appealing. As Mimi, Pamela Armstrong
sang with plaintive tone and unmannered phrasing, though her lyric
soprano voice was not consistently secure. But there was much
beauty in her singing, and her poignant death scene was affectingly
done.
</P>
<P>
   A New York-born tenor, Emmanuel di Villarosa, made his company
debut as Rodolfo. He has a sweet lyric tenor voice and good musical
instincts. His sound is not large, though this is a characteristic,
not a shortcoming. He may not feel the same way, however, for here
and there he pushed his voice to fill out Rodolfo's arching
climactic phrases, and when he did, his sound turned shaky.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest ovation of the night went to the lanky baritone John
Hancock, who, as Marcello, gave the most accomplished performance.
Indira Mahajan brought her bright soprano voice and vitality to the
role of Musetta, but in overdoing Musetta's bundle-of-trouble
willfulness, she let her voice turn shrill at times. Peter Volpe, a
robust bass also making his debut, was a solid Colline; the
baritone James Bobick was an amiable Schaunard.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Mosteller, the conductor, was trying to be sensitive to
the needs of his young singers. But they might have been better off
had he kept the music moving more strictly. The performance was
sometimes languid. The ensemble between the orchestra and singers
was not always together, though this should improve as the run
continues in the spring season.

FOR ETHNIC ALBANIANS   IN KOSOVO, A SEPARATE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The vibrant cafe scene in Pristina can
make one forget there is a war going on in Kosovo. Through a fog of
cigarette smoke and against the pounding of pop music, fashionably
dressed students drink small cups of strong coffee or glasses of
local cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the upheavals of the last decade, a year of fighting and
Kosovo's relentless ethnic divide dictate even where the young go
to drink their coffee. Ethnic Albanians frequent Albanian-run cafes
and local Serbs Serb-run cafes. The two almost never mix, socially
or otherwise, coexisting in a sort of silent, sullen apartheid that
first took root in the 1980s and is now the hallmark of this
forlorn region of southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Slobodan Milosevic stripped away Kosovo's
autonomy in March 1989, and especially since his security forces
started cracking down a year ago against the armed Albanian rebels
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, both ethnic groups accept segregated
life as inevitable, and permanent. The estimated 2 million people
of Kosovo, 90 percent of them ethnic Albanian, conduct their lives
entirely within their own ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Mimoza, a dark-haired 22-year-old piano student who declined to
give her last name, studies at the music faculty in the Albanian
university in Pristina. ``The alternative university,'' she
stressed, tapping ash off her cigarette at the bar of a busy cafe.
She was referring to the university set up by ethnic Albanians for
ethnic Albanians after the Serbian authorities expelled teachers
and professors from state-run schools and the university in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was repeated in all state institutions, from
hospitals to most factories. Ethnic Albanians who were not fired
from such jobs simply quit, and joined the ``alternative''
institutions funded by the Albanian diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   The university has various faculties, all crammed into one
building in central Pristina. The hundreds of Albanian schools are
mostly located in houses dotted across the province. A rudimentary
alternative health system functions out of small one-room clinics
built with donations.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Glogovac, for example, Bedin Halilaj works in a
tiny room sponsored by the local Mother Theresa charity. The only
doctor in miles for the local Albanians, he writes prescriptions on
scraps of paper even though he has virtually no drugs to give out.
</P>
<P>
   Mimoza says she has no ethnic Serb friends, or even
acquaintances. ``It is because I went to an Albanian school and now
the Albanian university. I would not want them anyway, after all
that has happened,'' she said. Like many others in the Albanians'
clannish, tight-knit society with its ces large emphasis on
extended family, she has lost a relative in the fighting in Kosovo
last year that killed some 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The older generation in Kosovo, brought up under communism in
the old Yugoslavia, tended to mix more. Most education was in the
Serbian language, and those who did their military service or
worked in state organizations were thrown together with other
ethnic groups of the state created by Josip Broz Tito, which
severely punished any expressions of nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   But today's students, like Mimoza, were separated throughout
their schooling, attending either Albanian-language or
Serbian-language schools. Most Albanians can speak Serbian and many
local Serbs know at least a little Albanian. But both ethnic groups
insist on only speaking their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Asllan Murati, the imam of the main mosque in the town
of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo, says that while segregation was
forced upon ethnic Albanians by Serbian government policy, it in
fact merely consolidated natural differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Serbian authorities threw them out of their state
jobs, the Albanians were forced to organize their lives as they
could, creating schools in houses and setting up private clinics,''
he said. ``And because of that, Albanians and Serbs are now living
in separate worlds. The Albanian majority is ruled by a minority.
And we Albanians have no connection to them, we have a different
culture, a different religion and a different language.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged on the carpeted floor of his mosque, a tall
red hat wound with white cloth on his head, the imam said the
current war in Kosovo is a national, and not a religious struggle
pitting Muslims against the Eastern Orthodox Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   `'Although 90 percent of the people in Kosovo are Muslim, we
want a national government and to give the same rights to all
religious confessions and minorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible to live again together,'' he added, noting
however that ``those people who have blood on their hands must be
charged and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   But few ordinary people believe that they can return to any
state of good neighborliness. People flooded out of the mosque at
the end of prayers, old men in traditional white felt caps, wound
round with a colored scarf, and young men, dressed in new jeans and
down jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Vedat, a 20-year-old ethnic Albanian from the village of Prekaze
in northern Kosovo who also declined to give his last name, said he
does not know any Serbs and never mixes with them. He had walked an
hour and a half to attend Friday prayers at the mosque. Even if
chance threw him together with an ethnic Serb on the way, he would
not chat to him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the villages of Kosovo, the ethnic divisions are only too
evident. There are few mixed settlements. Even if a Serb village
lies close to an Albanian one, there is little contact between the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Serb villagers like the residents of Velika Hoca in central
Kosovo say they live in fear of the Albanians' rebel army, which
they said had sent written warnings not to leave the village even
to till their fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians in turn say they fear to travel because of
constant checks by the Serbian police. Police in dark blue
camouflage uniforms, armed with automatic weapons, are a frequent
sight on the roads as they check the papers of men of all ages.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Always among the poorest regions of the former Yugoslavia,
Kosovo has a low standard of living. Few villagers seem to own
cars. Most people get around on foot or by tractor or horse cart.
The men come in to sell chopped logs from their horse carts or
potatoes from wheelbarrows in the town markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the main market in the northern town of Mitrovica last week,
ethnic Serbs stood in a separate line. They are refugees from the
Serb-Croat war in Croatia, driven from the homes they and their
ancestors had for centuries in lands known as the Krajina that the
Serbs seized, then lost, earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   They were selling a few belongings laid out on the ground.
Milica Skrobouga, a 71-year-old woman, had a pitiful collection of
tinned food, part of her refugee rations, spread out on a piece of
sacking.
</P>
<P>
   She said she lived in an old barracks on the edge of town along
with 60 other refugees and was past caring if war would make her
move again. ``I am not in my own home so it does not matter,'' she
said. She said she had had no problems with local Albanians, but
more than half the refugees from her barracks had left for Serbia
proper in the last few years. ``I do not trust anyone anymore after
what happened in Krajina,'' she said with a dark look.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica is an ugly industrial town, full of communist-era
apartment blocks and dominated by a grotesque Soviet-style monument
to the local zinc mines on a hill above.
</P>
<P>
   Blerin Gjota, the co-owner of a cafe on the main shopping
street, said business was bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to close at 5:30 in the evening because there are no
customers. No one goes out because people are afraid,'' he said.
``They are afraid of the police, afraid of kidnapping, it is a
difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mitrovica is 80 percent Albanian, Serbs dominate the
police and the government offices. A few days before, the local
Serb reservists had been mobilized, Gjota said, and for several
hours hundreds of them, armed and in uniforms, paraded from the
town barracks past his cafe to a Serb district of the town,
drinking and singing nationalist songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 1989, we lived together, but since then we have split
apart,'' he sighed. ``It would be really hard to live together
again. We cannot be indifferent to the war.''

NEW DEVICE FOR PLAYING MUSIC FROM THE INTERNET  
 PIXEL AIMS TO EXPLOIT FRINGES OF THE DESKTOP 
SOFTWARE TURNS COMPUTERS INTO DESKTOP LIE DETECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Wash.)  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recording industry's recognition that the Internet is
changing the music business is coming none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Music and Internet Expo on Saturday, Creative
Technology Ltd., long the leading seller of audio circuitry for
personal computers, showed off a line of products to help meet the
pent-up demand for devices that can retrieve and play music from
the Internet. The devices use the MP3 software format, which is the
most popular way to transmit audio files.
</P>
<P>
   Creative, a Singapore company whose U.S. operations are based in
Milpitas, Calif., said that it would start selling its portable MP3
player this spring for less than $200, roughly the same price as
the Rio MP3 player from Diamond Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rio, which was announced in October to much fanfare
along with a lawsuit from record companies, Creative's device,
called the Nomad, is about the size of pack of cigarettes and holds
as much music as an audio CD.
</P>
<P>
   Creative's announcement came a week after a group of recording
and technology companies, which have formed the Secure Digital
Music Initiative, announced a leader and an ambitious timetable for
their effort to create a technical standard for the copyrighted
sale and digital delivery of music over the Internet. The group's
effort is an implicit attack on MP3, which has no copyright
protections and is the popular choice of Internet music pirates.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the main business opportunity for MP3 appears to be the
hardware for playing the music. The Recording Industry Association
of America went to court last year in an attempt to block Diamond
from selling the Rio. But the judge sided with Diamond, paving the
road for other companies, like Creative, to enter the MP3 filed.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics of Korea has also announced plans to bring a
device called the Yepp MP3 player to the U.S. market sometime this
year. Several other consumer electronics companies are also said to
be well along in MP3 development, even as they worry that the
devices could cannibalize sales of their own portable cassette and
CD players.
</P>
<P>
   Creative brings an established brand name to the digital music
market. Its Sound Blaster audio card for use in PCs has been among
the most popular computer peripheral products of the decade. And
its Inspire music Web site (www.creativeinspire.com) already has a
large following.

   Pixel Aims to Exploit Fringes of the Desktop  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its antitrust trial, Microsoft Corp. has repeatedly said that
it had granted personal computer makers greater freedom to do as
they please with the Windows desktop screen, which pops into view
when a machine is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   One of Microsoft's old adversaries, Robert Steinberg, an
intellectual property lawyer, has noticed the same thing _ and sees
a business opportunity. ``There is some loosening up and,
frankly,'' he said, ``that is one of the reasons I'm coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Steinberg will become the chief executive of Pixel Co.,
a Seattle start-up. Its business plan is to exploit some of the
valuable real estate on computer desktops that Pixel insists is
technically and legally beyond Microsoft's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's software grabs a slender band of unused screen space,
called the overscan area, about one-quarter to one-half inch along
each edge of the screen. Its first product is a control bar, called
My Space, that sits on the bottom edge of the screen, just below
the Windows 98 task bar. By clicking on a My Space icon, a user can
be linked to a site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC, a large PC maker, has installed My Space on
its new consumer machines, which will begin arriving in stores in a
couple of weeks. Pixel's next product is a more robust software
engine _ an as-yet unnamed control bar that will reside along the
right-hand side of the screen. Available later this year, the new
software will be able to start other programs, like browsers and
spreadsheets. Steinberg hopes it will be attractive to the large
all-in-one portal sites, like Yahoo, that are fighting for
placement and attention on the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, a partner at Irell &AMP; Manella in Los Angeles, wrote
the patent for the data-compression technology that became the
center of a legal dispute between Microsoft and Stac Electronics
Inc., which Steinberg represented. In 1994, a jury ordered
Microsoft to pay Stac $120 million for patent infringement, though
Microsoft later settled the case for an estimated $50 million and
took a 15 percent stake in Stac.

   Software Turns Computers Into Desktop Lie Detectors
</P>
<P>
   Don't fudge that expense account. Not if the people in Accounts
Payable have been in touch with B. Francis Camis, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For about the price of a business lunch, Camis' new company,
Digital Robotics Inc., of Westmont, Ill., offers a lie detector
program designed to work on any PC equipped with a microphone. Like
polygraph equipment used by law enforcement agencies, the Fortress
Personal Lie Detector analyzes the stress levels in a person's
voice to determine whether they are telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortress is just one program in an arsenal of security
programs from Digital Robotics (www.digitalrobotics.com), which
Camis founded after leaving his job as a network administrator for
a unit of Lucent Technologies and a brief stint as a computer
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   His company's other digital subterfuge tools include Digital
Dynomite, a program that wipes out the audit trail of activities on
your PC, and a personal firewall program for keeping out viruses
and other interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   Camis said he was initially aiming the Fortress at home users
for ``personal experimentation,'' although he would happily sell it
to anybody who was interested. Hoping to protect himself and
Digital Robotics from lawsuits stemming from misuse of the program,
Camis emphasizes that anyone using Fortress must first get the
written consent of the person whose voice is being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortress is available through Digital Robotics' Web site and
other online stores for $29.95, with a free 15-day tryout.
</P>
<P>
   The program works by analyzing subliminal levels of stress
expressed through changes in the voice, such as the frequency
range. Camis said that the more that a person has emotionally at
stake in a statement, the easier a lie is to detect. ``For somebody
who's sociopathic, it probably wouldn't work,'' he said. Everybody
else _ 'fess up.

THE REALITY OF PARIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn.)   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Paris always has loomed large in the American
imagination: Thomas Jefferson, Henry James, Ernest Hemingway and
James Baldwin all fell under its spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Americans, when they die, go to Paris,'' wrote Thomas
Appleton, Longfellow's brother-in-law. Oscar Wilde said he had it
all wrong: ``When bad Americans die, they go to Paris,'' Wilde
said.
</P>
<P>
   Myth and countermyth have all illuminated and obscured the
historical reality of the city through the centuries, says Patrice
Higonnet, a French-born Harvard professor who has devoted a lecture
series to the subject this year at the College de France.
</P>
<P>
   This prestigious institution has been constructing and
deconstructing myths since 1530, and this year one of its vast
renovated lecture halls, next to the Sorbonne, has been filling
Thursday afternoons with Parisians who come to hear Higonnet
explain how the idea of Paris has changed over the years, not only
in the French but also in the American mind.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway and his friends in the ``lost generation'' were truly
lost in Paris, he says. They did not speak French and were not
interested in the art or culture of the French people around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Hemingway and most of his friends, Paris was one long
binge, all the more enjoyable because it wasn't very expensive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may go to Europe to be Americanized, as Ralph Waldo
Emerson put it more than a century ago. But Higonnet, whose father
was French and his mother French and Hungarian, often comes to
Paris to renew his French roots. He was born here 60 years ago but
has taught at Harvard since getting his doctorate there in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The College de France invites some of the finest students of
Europe to do research and then share their findings in lectures and
seminars that are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the audience here is retired people who have an
interest in culture,'' Higonnet said, ``but there are also
students, and colleagues who are professors. You can't say stupid
things, but it's impossible to satisfy everybody in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what this specialist in 18th-century French history has
to say sounds almost new. Think of the Louvre, for example, as the
royal palace of French kings and he will remind you that Louis XIV,
the greatest of them all, could not tolerate Paris and did not
consider it the French capital at all. For the Sun King, that was
the vast palace he built in Versailles, from which he ventured
forth to Paris only 24 times in 44 years. He did not spend the
night in the city if he could help it.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Paris as Notre Dame, and his lectures remind you that
the Enlightenment considered Medieval Paris filthy and barbaric,
and the Cathedral a monstrosity. Desecrated by the Revolution,
Notre Dame de Paris nearly fell to ruins before Victor Hugo took up
its cause and helped to save it in the late 19th century _ as the
centerpiece of a new myth, ``le vieux Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   That myth took root only after the Second Empire Prefect Baron
Georges Eugene Haussmann pierced wide boulevards through the
Quartier Latin and other crowded, ancient neighborhoods to create
the Paris that so many people so love today.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Baudelaire complained to Victor Hugo in 1859 that
Baron Haussmann had ruined the city. ``Paris-New York,'' Baudelaire
called the transformed capital, while Haussmann defensively
riposted that the people who professed admiration for ``old Paris''
knew it only from books.
</P>
<P>
   Other prefects also have their uses, and one, named Poubelle,
even gave his name to the public trash cans that the city began
putting out in the 19th century to try to keep the city clean.
</P>
<P>
   Haussmann's intent actually was to counter another powerful
myth, that of Paris as caldron of revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier for the police to clear crowds from Haussmann's
wide boulevards than from the narrow, twisting and cobbled streets
whose cobblestones were used by Parisians in revolt to build
barricades in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   Students did tear the cobblestones out of the Boulevard
St.-Germain in 1968, Higonnet reported, so the authorities replaced
them with a tarred surface that is difficult to turn into
projectiles. The ``pave'' or cobblestone has a powerful mythology
all its own in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Higonnet's Harvard connection started with his father, Rene A.
Higonnet, who came to the United States in 1920s on a Harvard
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fell in love with America, which at the time had no
national police force, no military draft, and hardly any income
taxes,'' his son said with a laugh. Later, Rene Higonnet and a
partner invented the photocomposition process, which replaced
Linotypes at newspapers. In 1968 he returned to Europe, and he
ended his days in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Higonnet's wife, Margaret, professor of comparative literature
at the University of Connecticut, is American and enjoying the
academic year with her husband in a house on the
Mont-Ste.-Genevieve a cobblestone's throw from where Rene Descartes
once lived.
</P>
<P>
   Higonnet's latest book, ``Goodness Beyond Virtue,'' is about the
Jacobin movement during the Revolution, and after his last lecture
April 15, he said, he planned to write another book about the
Revolution. But, shattering the myth that all the French are
natural-born chefs, he said, ``I'm going to cooking school as soon
as this is over.''

A WOMAN ' S SERMONS AND SEARCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of Gail Godwin's rich new novel, ``Evensong,'' refers,
its epigraph says, to ``a worship service said or sung at the onset
of evening to mark the close of day and to compose the mind and
renew the spirit for the coming day.'' The sense of calm and beauty
this evokes is reinforced by the book's dust jacket, a moonlit
landscape of the Great Smoky Mountains, presumably in western North
Carolina where the novel is set.
</P>
<P>
   As you read ``Evensong,'' however, you find its title taking on
an ironic edge. For its story is not about the close of a day but
rather about the end of the old millennium and the coming of the
new. (One clever character correctly points out that the transition
doesn't actually occur until 2001. But like most of us, Ms.
Godwin's people consider the last midnight of 1999 as the turning
point.) What is happening at the close of 1999 to the Rev. Margaret
Bonner, the story's protagonist and narrator, is very far from
beautiful and calming.
</P>
<P>
   The young pastor of the All Saints Episcopal Church in the Smoky
Mountain town of High Balsam, Margaret feels alienated from her
gloomy husband, Adrian, who is undergoing a depressing crisis of
his own. (Readers will recognize these two from Ms. Godwin's
earlier novel ``Father Melancholy's Daughter.'')
</P>
<P>
   The chaplain of a boarding school for troubled children, Adrian
not only has to stand in for the recently deceased headmaster until
a new one is hired, but also must expel a student he particularly
cares for, Chase Zorn, for once again breaking into the school's
chapel and drinking the communion wine. Partly as a result of these
pressures, Adrian has not slept with Margaret for some six months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Margaret is struggling to fend off the zealous efforts
of one Grace Munger to enlist All Saints in a Millennium Birthday
March for Jesus intended to heal certain socioeconomic rifts that
have developed in High Balsam. Realizing that by not joining in she
risks making her church seem as elitist as many consider it anyway,
Margaret nevertheless refuses to get caught up in Christian
crusading.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this turmoil a strange old man arrives at the
Bonners' doorstep, identifying himself as Tony, from the Abbey of
the Transfiguration, up in Esopus, N.Y., traveling the country on
``one of the Greyhound Millennium Passes.'' Margaret, who knows
that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah were punished as much for
their inhospitality as for their sexual practices, feels that she
has to take Tony in.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Godwin handles these crises with the narrative verve and
moral gravity that made earlier novels of hers like ``Glass
People,'' ``A Mother and Two Daughters'' and ``The Finishing
School,'' among her 11 previous works of fiction, so appealing.
Exploring Adrian's melancholy, Margaret reveals his childhood stay
in an orphanage where he became the disciple first of an alcoholic
and then of a man who taught him how to discipline himself (and
achieve orgasm) by self-flagellation.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret's dilemma over joining the parade for Jesus may sound
trivial, but Grace Munger is a formidable woman, the very soul of
manipulative zealotry, and the mischief she makes through her
passionate hypocrisy is real and damaging. Finally, Tony the monk,
while not as fully realized a character as some of the others,
nevertheless bears with him a real bombshell of information that
alters the Bonners' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of Ms. Godwin's skill you can't help feeling that
there's something soap-operatic about her narrative, that the
sequence of dramatic events is just one thing after another,
especially when it comes to the ending, which while striving for
tragedy very nearly stumbles into farce.
</P>
<P>
   You resist this conclusion, even chastise yourself for thinking
it, because her story is always reaching beyond itself by means of
references, anecdotes, significant incidents and even humor. For
instance, one evening prayer Margaret knows by heart ends with the
words: ``Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless
the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the
joyous; and all for your love's sake. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``shield the joyous'' makes Margaret feel ``joy's end
even as you're evoking pictures of its many manifestations.'' She
recalls once enjoying a Yorkshire landscape ``dotted with newborn
lambs,'' only to be told when she stops at an inn that ``you might
well make the acquaintance of one on your dinner plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambs suggest Jesus, whose birthday is anticipated in the story
and whose ways, along with God's, are continually being questioned.
Margaret even fantasizes a visit by Jesus to her church, but
instead Tony the monk shows up. But who knows? As she asks in one
of her sermons, ``Who of us can say we're not in the process of
being used right now, this first Sunday in Advent, to fulfill some
purpose whose grace and goodness would boggle our imagination if we
could even begin to get our minds around it?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all this spiritual play, Ms. Godwin's story never
transcends its realism. ``A field theory style of narrative, rather
than linear, would be useful here, whatever that might be like,''
Margaret muses when introducing what happens at her story's end.
``What I mean to say is, things that had been stealthily ripening
in a few separate souls now came to a head and `for better for
worse' found outward expression, more or less at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   But she can't avail herself of a field theory style of
narrative, so events have to stay in line and on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an interesting Greek word, kalchaino,'' one of Ms.
Godwin's characters announces in a typically entertaining aside.
``Literally, it means, `to search for the purple fish,' '' he says.
``The literal purple fish was a shellfish highly prized by the
Greeks for its rich purple dye,'' he continues. ``Divers went to
the bottom of the sea in search of this elusive fish. That's how
`searching for purple fish' came to be the Greeks' expression for
plumbing the depths of one's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Through its prose, ``Evensong'' searches for the purple fish.
But because of its single-character point of view and its realistic
form, it comes up short of a real catch.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Basketball fans in Denver know that to see local television
broadcasts of Nuggets games, they had better stay home. A signal
from a network affiliate in the city cannot be picked up in Vail,
100 miles away, even though special maps used by regulators to
predict a television signal's reach say it should.
</P>
<P>
   The signal-coverage maps unaccountably view the world as flat,
failing to account for the 14,000-foot Rocky Mountains, among other
obstructions. Designed in the 1950s to prevent signal interference,
the maps are at the center of a legal battle between broadcasters
and the satellite television industry that resulted in 750,000
viewers nationwide losing programming from CBS and Fox last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The cutoff in programming followed a ruling last year by a
federal judge who said that Prime Time 24, a contractor of DirecTV,
the nation's largest satellite television provider, had violated
federal law by illegally delivering network signals to homes in
areas where coverage maps indicate that customers can receive
programming from local stations. Satellite transmission of network
signals is allowed only in areas where local signals are poor.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Lenore Nesbitt of U.S. District Court in Miami, had
set a deadline of Feb. 28 for the satellite transmissions to stop.
On Feb. 26, some DirecTV subscribers who pay extra for network
programs but live in ineligible areas started seeing a static
screen with a brief explanation about the court order. By April 30,
1.5 million more viewers may be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The court order resulted from a suit brought by CBS Corp. and
Fox Entertainment Group Inc., which contended that the satellite
transmissions were illegal and were taking away advertising revenue
and ratings from their local affiliates by providing network shows
from distant cities.
</P>
<P>
   The cutoff in programming is something of a setback for DirecTV,
which is a unit of Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of General
Motors Corp. By offering as many as 100 channels, including the
History Channel and HBO, as well as prime-time programming from
eight network affiliates around the nation, DirecTV, and the other
leading satellite television company, the Echostar Communications
Corp., have together attracted 8.5 million subscribers. (Echostar,
which operates Dishnetwork, with two million subscribers, also
transmits network signals; the networks have a suit pending against
the provider.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of these subscribers live behind mountains or tall
buildings, or in rural areas without cable television, and are
willing to pay as much as $50 a month for a large menu of channels
delivered by satellite to $200 pizza-size home receivers. In 10
mostly rural states, like Montana, Maine and Texas, more than 20
percent of television households use satellite dishes, according to
Bruce Leichtman, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a market
research firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Most satellite subscribers, however, are in urban areas. Even
where cable is available, they choose satellite to receive
out-of-town sports broadcasts, to watch David Letterman three hours
early, or to get programming from their old hometown.
</P>
<P>
   During the court dispute in Miami, maps were introduced to show
that a majority of Prime Time 24 subscribers in Los Angeles, New
York, San Francisco, Dallas and Philadelphia live in the forbidden
zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks don't get an acceptable network picture,'' said
Patrick Morrisey, a Washington lawyer for Prime Time 24. ``There
are buildings, planes. The network maps don't tell the true
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellite transmission of network programming is clearly a
profitable business. Under the Satellite Home Viewers Act of 1994,
satellite companies can broadcast a network's programming to
unserved households at a cost of 27 cents a subscriber. For a
package of eight network signals, which cost the satellite
companies $2.16 a subscriber, Echostar charged $7.99 and DirecTV
charged $6.67.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Satellite subscribers, meanwhile, are not taking the cutoff in
silence. ``We've been inundated with 3,000 letters and postcards in
the last month,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is the
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the
satellite television industry.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation introduced by McCain would allow satellite
subscribers to continue to receive network signals for six months
while the Federal Communications Commission figures out whether
local affiliates are being harmed. It would also permit satellite
broadcasters, for the first time, to carry local signals in local
markets.
</P>
<P>
   A separate bill approved last month by the Senate Judiciary
Committee would enable satellite television companies to get the
copyright licenses they need to transmit local broadcasts, as cable
operators do. And on Thursday, the House Commerce Committee's
telecommunications subcommittee approved legislation calling for a
180-day moratorium on the cutoff order.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters oppose the proposed measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should not be in the business of rewarding industries
that willfully and repeatedly violate the law,'' Andrew S. Fisher,
an executive vice president at Cox Broadcasting, said in a recent
Senate hearing. He added that most affected subscribers could get
network reception with a properly installed antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Still, securities analysts expect some sort of revisions to the
satellite broadcasting laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one battle in a long war,'' said Thomas W. Watts, a
satellite analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``It's difficult to
understand what is gained by cutting off 700,000 subscribers for
something that probably will be allowed in six months.''

REPUBLICAN POWER SHIFTS FROM HOUSE TO SENATE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: R.I., Ind., Ky., Okla., Texas, Idaho)   (ms) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four years in which House Republicans
dominated Congress, bringing their party its legislative energy as
well as its public-relations disasters and the impeachment drive,
power has shifted on Capitol Hill. In the 106th Congress, Trent
Lott and his Senate majority have become the ascendant Republican
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of change are everywhere. When the congressional
leadership met with President Clinton recently, the new speaker, J.
Dennis Hastert, said little _ Lott talked far more, participants in
the meeting said. Outside on the White House driveway, the pair
fell into the same pattern in front of reporters. Lott, more
polished and more practiced, even jumped in and answered questions
directed to the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In the first congressional recess after the Senate impeachment
trial, there was Lott at a high-profile town meeting in Detroit
promoting tax cuts. With House Republicans little prepared to
conduct a post-impeachment policy offensive, Senate Republicans
gave them the recess packages that they had prepared for their own
members, instructing them on the issues to highlight and explaining
how to talk about them.
</P>
<P>
   And last week it was the Senate that prevailed in budget talks
among Republican leaders. The group agreed to a budget framework
that embraced the Senate Republican position on Social Security and
strategy to counter the Democratic assault on the potent retirement
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans attribute the shift, in part, to Lott's skillful
handling of the Senate impeachment trial, which senators from both
parties say increased his stature. At the same time, the House
Republicans have been weakened by the November elections and the
self-immolation of Newt Gingrich, and then Robert L. Livingston,
the first person selected to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Republican majority down to only six members
(five, at the moment, with the retirement of Livingston), Hastert's
deputies concede they barely have control over the House, let alone
the leeway to lead in crafting new themes.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown into the job when Livingston resigned in December,
Hastert, an Illinois Republican, is still trying to sort out how to
govern under such difficult circumstances and how to hold his once
raucous, now shaken flock together.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is trying to rein in the impulsive Republican
firebrands and keep them from taking public stands that make it
more difficult to pull together legislative compromises.
Republicans say he recently told them not to commit themselves
completely to any specific tax cut, in order to give the House and
Senate more flexibility in deciding which proposal they will
ultimately back.
</P>
<P>
   And where once Gingrich was such an overpowering presence that
no other leader could emerge, Hastert, a former high school
teacher, is the rambunctious Georgian's polar opposite. He is most
comfortable outside the limelight and wants to avoid any showy
missteps, his advisers and colleagues say. His public appearances
tend to be risk-free. Last week, he read Dr. Seuss to school
children, welcomed the Boy Scouts to the Capitol and talked about
making ``the future better for all of our nation's children'' in
the weekly Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his style is more low-profile and behind the scenes,''
said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who formerly
served in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the natural flow of things places Trent in more
of a spokesman's role than Denny even desires to have,'' Hutchinson
said. ``It's not what Denny wants for himself and he doesn't see
this as a primary goal and that moves the center of gravity to
Trent Lott. And until we have a presidential nominee come to the
fore, Trent will be the primary spokesman for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics could change once again, as Hastert gains
experience. House Republicans are hoping he will turn out to be a
more effective leader than Gingrich, who was a font of ideas but
also of controversy. But for now, congressional Republicans have an
enormous amount riding on how well their senators and Lott, an
order-obsessed Mississippi conservative with a pragmatic streak,
can lead them. House Republicans have lost seats for two elections
in a row and the impeachment proceedings left the party at new lows
in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, moreover, believe strongly that the policy terrain
has shifted since the Republicans took control of the House and now
tilts in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94 it was abortion, guns and welfare and we were on the
defensive,'' said Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, the Rhode Island
Democrat and Kennedy scion who has taken over the House Democrats'
election effort. Now, he said, ``it's Social Security, Medicare and
education. Those are Democratic issues and we are on the offensive
_ and they are on the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans fear that if they do not come up with a
compelling agenda this year and soften their avenging image, even a
charismatic presidential candidate will not be able to help them
hold their House majority in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run as a team with whoever gets the nomination,''
said Rep. David M. McIntosh, R-Ind. ``I'd hate to see a situation
where we elect a President and not a Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, has warned the congressional leaders that they have to
end the disarray that left them without a platform to run on in
1998, and trying instead to ride to victory on Clinton's scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody understands that we need a unity agenda,''
said Clifford D. May, director of communications for the Republican
National Committee. ``There needs to be a message from Congress, a
reason for governors to support Republicans in Washington and for
our candidates not to run against Washington,'' he said, expressing
the hope that Republican presidential candidates will not want to
distance themselves from the Republican Congress.  &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Lott took the first step toward giving Republicans a new
definition by holding the impeachment trial to five weeks and
working closely with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, to preserve civility in the Senate. He did so,
even though it irked conservative groups who are his natural
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That strengthened him with the American people as a whole,''
said Hutchinson, ``but if you look at the core constituencies of
the GOP, they are not happy with how the process went in the
Senate. They do not feel the House managers got a fair shake and
they lay that at Lott's doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Hutchinson added, ``He'll never face a bigger challenge
than he did on impeachment. He walked his way through a
minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and his leadership team also prepared Senate Republicans
for a fast start with legislation, aware that the party had to
blunt the effects of impeachment as soon as the trial ended. ``He
was ready to go right after the trial,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell,
a Kentucky Republican.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the first week back from the recess that followed the
impeachment trial, the Senate approved a pay raise for the military
_ part of a Republican effort to strike a Reaganesque posture on
defense. Last week, the Senate debated legislation to give states
more flexibility in spending federal education money.
</P>
<P>
   The House, by contrast, has been wiling away its time by passing
uncontroversial measures like a nonbinding proclamation that
Congress should strengthen Social Security and a measure giving
leeway to Amish parents to employ their teen-agers in family
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Lott and Hastert took a large step toward ameliorating
last year's disarray when they and their budget committee chairmen
agreed on a budget framework. But not everyone is sure Lott will be
able to sustain his quick start and his influence. Some Senate
Republicans privately criticize him for being indecisive and too
watchful of potential conservative rivals such as his
second-in-command, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, or of the strong-willed
Phil Gramm of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also could soon become as bogged down as the House.
Fifty-five senators make up the Republican majority but that is not
enough to break the filibusters that the opposition can mount on
any issue. The education bill on the Senate floor, to the dismay of
some Republicans, has already become a vehicle for an amendment war
and a fierce partisan battle over education priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and Hastert, despite last week's agreement on budget
principles, still face the daunting task of assembling the votes
for the components of a budget plan that will require them to make
deep reductions in domestic programs. They may very well find the
spending bills are too lean to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans who believe they have taken too much of
the blame for their party's failures say that keeping warring
conservatives and moderates united is a taxing, no-win task. ``They
are going to have a headache every day between now and Election
Day,'' said one influential House Republican aide of the Senate
Republicans. ``Because it isn't easy and if they really get into
this role, they will be responsible, with no one else in the party
to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans say they are prepared to play a more
aggressive role, when needed, to help their House counterparts.
``We may be asked to take some of the tough votes first and work
things through to help with the momentum in the House,'' said Sen.
Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican in the Senate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said: ``Clearly there's an understanding on the
Senate side that the House is in a precarious position, that they
are not in a strong position to move forward aggressively. That
does create a kind of vacuum that you will find senators ready to
step up to.''

FOR ETHNIC ALBANIANS IN KOSOVO, A SEPARATE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The vibrant cafe scene in Pristina can
make one forget there is a war going on in Kosovo. Through a fog of
cigarette smoke and against the pounding of pop music, fashionably
dressed students drink small cups of strong coffee or glasses of
local cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the upheavals of the last decade, a year of fighting and
Kosovo's relentless ethnic divide dictate even where the young go
to drink their coffee. Ethnic Albanians frequent Albanian-run cafes
and local Serbs Serb-run cafes. The two almost never mix, socially
or otherwise, coexisting in a sort of silent, sullen apartheid that
first took root in the 1980s and is now the hallmark of this
forlorn region of southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Slobodan Milosevic stripped away Kosovo's
autonomy in March 1989, and especially since his security forces
started cracking down a year ago against the armed Albanian rebels
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, both ethnic groups accept segregated
life as inevitable, and permanent. The estimated 2 million people
of Kosovo, 90 percent of them ethnic Albanian, conduct their lives
entirely within their own ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Mimoza, a dark-haired 22-year-old piano student who declined to
give her last name, studies at the music faculty in the Albanian
university in Pristina. ``The alternative university,'' she
stressed, tapping ash off her cigarette at the bar of a busy cafe.
She was referring to the university set up by ethnic Albanians for
ethnic Albanians after the Serbian authorities expelled teachers
and professors from state-run schools and the university in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mimoza says she has no ethnic Serb friends, or even
acquaintances. ``It is because I went to an Albanian school and now
the Albanian university. I would not want them anyway, after all
that has happened,'' she said. Like many others in the Albanians'
clannish, tight-knit society with its large emphasis on extended
family, she has lost a relative in the fighting in Kosovo last year
that killed some 2,000 people.

 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her fiction, from her first novel, ``The Good Mother,'' to
her latest, ``While I Was Gone,'' Sue Miller is the doyenne of
domesticity. Probing beneath the surface of marriages, she uncovers
the disharmony as well as an individual's urge to find an
alternative life.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Becker, the protagonist of the new novel, a veterinarian
happily married to a minister and the mother of three grown
daughters, is content in her present until a man from her past
suddenly reappears. She is forced to come to terms with her
previous life and with a personal trauma, the unsolved murder of
her best friend, a woman of great magnetism who influenced others
through ``a sort of phototropism.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of her short stories, ``Travel,'' Ms. Miller says about a
character, ``She wasn't who she thought she was.'' During a recent
interview she acknowledged that the search for another self was a
continuous theme in her work. She characterized it as ``the
difference between the self we present to people and the self we
feel ourselves to be,'' leading to the eternal question of ``how
much we can truly know another person.''
</P>
<P>
   During her own life Ms. Miller has gone through substantial
changes. Now 55, she came rather late to her career. She was 43, a
wife and mother, when she published her first novel.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Chicago (as Susan Nichols), the daughter of a
university professor, she was by her own description an
overachiever but one without direction or intention. At 16 she went
to Radcliffe College and married soon after graduation. While her
husband was in medical school at Yale University and with a child
to support, she worked at a variety of jobs. She taught high school
and did psychological testing of Yale students and also of rats.
(She liked the rats better, she said.) Although she had written
poetry and stories, a literary career seemed only a distant
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a teen-ager her parents had rented a basement room
in their house to Robert Coover, then a graduate student in
philosophy and history at the University of Chicago. In 1966 while
working as a cocktail waitress in West Haven, Conn., Ms. Miller
read an enthusiastic review for Coover's first novel, ``The Origin
of the Brunists,'' and realized the artist who had lived among
them.
</P>
<P>
   As she said, ``It was encouraging to me to see that someone who
seemed as unlikely as I did to myself could write a book that was
so well received and was so wonderful.'' Coover's metafiction is,
she realized, oceans away from her own naturalistic writing, but
that does not lessen her admiration. ``It's a very brave kind of
writing,'' she said. ``I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   After discarding an early novel, she turned to short stories,
which she began selling to literary quarterlies. When the Atlantic
Monthly accepted one, an editor recommended that she use her full
name, Susan Miller, because ``at a certain point we all have to
grow up.'' She refused: ``I don't mind growing up, but I mind being
told that I ought to. I'm Sue Miller.'' She remained Sue Miller
after she divorced her husband, who is now a psychiatrist. The
divorce, she said, was central to her ``in terms of claiming my own
life, and that allowed me to grow up.'' Fourteen years ago she
married Douglas Bauer, also a novelist; they live in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Winning a grant from the Bunting Institute, a research center
for women at Radcliffe, she was able to have an office and to
devote a year to writing full time. Before then, she said, ``I had
always worked at the dining room table and then cleared it off when
it was time to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, that year her son chose to go to boarding
school: ``I thought he was too young to begin his life away from
home, and I was sad about that. A lot of my sorrow entered `The
Good Mother.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Published by Dell in 1986, this novel about a custody battle
after a divorce, was a phenomenal success, both artistically and
commercially. It remains her signature work. That was followed by
four other novels and a collection of stories. ``The Good Mother''
was the first of her works to be filmed (with Diane Keaton and Liam
Neeson); the most recent, in 1997, was an adaptation of her story
``Inventing the Abbotts.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had not seen any of the movies. ``Everything I've
written I see in a very precise way and I hear in my inner ear,''
she said. ``I know that no matter how carefully people try, it
wouldn't be possible to reproduce what I have in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she wrote what she did, she replied: ``By default!
It's my default mode. Henry James said we all have our donnee, our
gift. We're confined by it and privileged with it.'' Defending her
particular area, she deferred again to James: ``He said why should
you write about war, why not parturition?'' Parturition is one of
her many subjects, along with sibling and spousal rivalry and the
quest for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally she is criticized for limiting herself to a
domestic world. ``They say that less to men,'' she said. ``In a way
Raymond Carver was always doing marriages and families, and Updike
certainly, with a few exceptions.'' Along with Anne Tyler, Alice
Munro, Carol Shields and other contemporary woman writers she has
found this a rich territory for characters in conflict, with others
and with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always thinking that I'm the main character in my
books,'' she said, ``but each one has been different and sometimes
they've been men.'' Then she admitted that half of her fiction
``centers on some episode or event in my life,'' one definite
exception being ``Inventing the Abbotts,'' which deals with two
brothers, one of whom has sequential affairs with three sisters.
The original of that story was told to her by a former boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Becker in ``While I Was Gone'' (Alfred A. Knopf) is, and is
not, Sue Miller. The facts diverge: unlike her character, the
author never lived in a communal house in Cambridge, Mass., during
the 1960s, but she had friends in the counterculture. Character
traits overlap. In the book Jo and her housemates play a game of
labeling one another with adjectives. Jo is described as
``reserved, sexy, curious, fragile, blue and opaque.'' The
adjectives, especially the first three, apply equally to Ms.
Miller, although, she said, she disguises her natural reserve by
pushing herself to be outgoing.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the book is the murder and the mystery that
endures as Jo moves into another life. The inspiration for that
aspect came partly from the trial of Katherine Ann Power, a 1960s
political activist who was involved in a robbery and the killing of
a policeman in Boston. Escaping punishment, she led a secret life
until she came out of hiding to accept her responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another side to the story. ``You don't
change anything by changing your life dramatically,'' she said.
``There's the sense that you haul it all along with you. You're
accountable finally for your life. I think that's been a kind of
preoccupation in my fiction. In my work, people pay for things.''  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enthusiastic members of Congress gather outside the
Capitol for a pep rally and proudly pledge fealty to their party's
specific legislative agenda. A few months later they grab control
of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pulled off that feat in 1994 with their famous
``Contract with America.'' Now Democrats hope they can do the same
with last Wednesday's party unity rally, which looked suspiciously
like the kickoff to the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would probably classify it as that,'' conceded Rep. Allen
Boyd, a moderate Florida Democrat on hand for the event featuring
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democratic
congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that Republicans are on the ropes from the impeachment
fight, Democrats are pressing their advantage, presenting
themselves as solidly behind a ``families first'' platform that
would protect Social Security and Medicare, reduce the national
debt and bolster education and health care. They even called on
Republicans to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrats want to prove, since this impeachment
trial is over, that we can work across party lines and get
something done for the American people, things they really care
about,'' said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans staged their own small tax-cut rally and dismissed
the Democratic proposals as more tired Washington ideas. But they
are on the defensive, feuding among themselves over their own
approach to the main issues.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have not always been so cohesive. Early in the Clinton
administration, Southern moderates and conservatives complained
that the White House was veering too far left to appease the
liberal wing of the party. Some bolted to the GOP. Later, liberal
Democrats claimed that Clinton was selling them out on issues such
as welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Now Democrats claim to be one big happy family, though several
Southerners, citing scheduling conflicts, declined to attend the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Good Neighbor Howard
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble follows that Southern tradition of being a
good neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   So it stands to reason that when presidential hopeful Elizabeth
Dole, a Tar Heel native, came calling to ask the senior North
Carolina Republican for his support, Coble quickly said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wants me to go somewhere for her, I'll be glad to do
it,'' Coble said.
</P>
<P>
   Coble had previously spoken excitedly of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's likely candidacy, but said he would endorse Bush only if Ms.
Dole declined to run.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Coble expressed surprise that so many North Carolina
state legislators had already publicly endorsed Bush, saying he
thought ``state pride alone'' would have encouraged them to rally
behind Ms. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Until new district lines were drawn recently, Coble's district
included Ms. Dole's hometown of Salisbury. ``She's my neighbor down
the road,'' Coble said. ``And she's fully qualified and
competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatherhood I
</P>
<P>
   As one of the House impeachment managers, Florida GOP Rep.
Charles Canady has not had many nice things to say about President
Clinton over the past few months. But he has finally found
something to compliment the president on _ his stance on infant car
seats.
</P>
<P>
   As a brand-new dad, Canady admits to his share of struggles with
the carriers. Like many parents, he has found that the varied seat
styles are not always compatible with car restraints, leaving one
uncertain if the chair is properly installed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a solution _ a standard three-point
attachment system in new cars and trucks by next year _ and Canady
has seen the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with what the president's doing about safety seats,''
said Canady.
</P>
<P>
   Now about that job search for Monica Lewinsky ....
</P>
<P>
   Fatherhood II
</P>
<P>
   The television event of the week was Ms. Lewinsky's interview,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Not for Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C., co-chairman of the
congressional Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion. He's upset with
the way television networks portray dear old dad.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report, only 15 of the 102 shows on network
television feature a father as a regular character. And only four
of those shows portray Pop in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, who has two school-aged sons of his own, said that at
a time when millions of American children lack a father in their
home, television needs to do a better job of depicting fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television cannot be expected to solve this national problem,
but I challenge those at the networks to think about their
permeating influence on whether children in our nation see fathers
as positive role models,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   Faced with mounting evidence that the routine use of antibiotics
in livestock may diminish the drugs' power to cure infections in
people, the Food and Drug Administration has begun a major revision
of its guidelines for approving new antibiotics for animals and for
monitoring the effects of old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the revision is to minimize the emergence of
bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotics. Such
resistance makes them difficult or even impossible to kill.
Drug-resistant infections, some fatal, have been increasing in
people in the United States, and many scientists attribute the
problem to the misuse of antibiotics in both humans and
animals. &UR;  &LR; Of particular concern to scientists is that recent
studies have found bacteria in chickens that are resistant to
fluoroquinolones, the most recently approved class of antibiotics
and one that scientists had been hoping would remain effective for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial component of the new guidelines will be the
requirement that manufacturers test certain new livestock drugs for
a tendency to foster the growth of resistant bacteria that could
prove harmful to people. Testing will be required both before a
drug is approved and after.
</P>
<P>
   The types of antibiotics that would get special scrutiny are
those that are also used by humans or are related to drugs used by
humans. If the antibiotics are shown to foster bacterial
resistance, they could be banned from use as growth promoters in
animals. If scientists became aware of a problem with older
antibiotics, they too could be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed guidelines have drawn criticism from both sides of
a bitter debate that has been going on for three decades. At issue
is the extensive use of antibiotics in livestock: of the 50 million
pounds of antibiotics produced every year in the United States,
about 40 percent is given to animals, mostly as feed additives to
promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, the drug and agriculture industries say the FDA is
going too far toward restricting access to antibiotics, which they
insist are essential to produce safe and affordable meat and
poultry. The industries also say the proposed rules will make drug
development, already difficult and expensive, even more so.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting held by the FDA in late January to discuss the
proposed changes, Dr. Brendan Fox, president of Elanco Animal
Health, a division of the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly and Co.,
said, ``We believe the agency is greatly overstating the
conclusiveness and the implications of the data and has put forth a
seriously flawed proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, public-health and consumer advocates, as well
as some scientists, say the FDA is not going far enough, because
antibiotics are a precious medical resource that should not be
squandered to fatten animals. On Tuesday, a coalition of 37 groups,
led by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit
group based in Washington, will petition the FDA to separately rule
that if a drug is used to treat diseases in people, it can no
longer be given to animals as a growth promoter.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's working proposal, or ``framework,'' which is open
for public comment until April 6, will not be translated into new
regulations for about two years. But Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof,
director of the center for veterinary medicine at the FDA, said the
agency was acting now because the nation is in a vulnerable period,
with no new classes of antibiotics expected to come onto the market
for several years. That makes it all the more important to preserve
the potency of existing drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason there are no new types of antibiotics in the pipeline
is that during the 1980s there seemed to be more than enough, and
drug companies stopped making new ones, Sundlof said. They have
since resumed working on new antibiotics, but it can take 10 years
to bring a new drug to market.
</P>
<P>
   The last new class of antibiotics approved, fluoroquinolones,
came into use in 1986. One of the most common brand names is
Ciprofloxacin. They are the best treatment for certain infections,
like gastrointestinal illness caused by salmonella bacteria.
Sundlof said the agency was especially concerned about averting the
development of widespread resistance to this class of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resistance has always been a problem in human medicine,''
Sundlof said. ``The way we had avoided any catastrophic events was
to continue to develop new products. But it became apparent in the
1990s that there weren't any new classes at the stage of
development where they'd be approved and available in the near
future, and there was great concern that if resistance developed to
this last class of drugs, it could have very bad ramifications for
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition by the Center for Science in the Public Interest
and other groups will ask the United States to follow the lead of
Europe, where antibiotics used to treat people cannot be given to
animals to promote growth. They were given to livestock in the
past, but the European Union banned the practice, on the
recommendation of the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, six of the 17 classes of antibiotics
given to animals for growth promotion are also used to treat sick
people. Even though people in this country need a prescription to
get the drugs, farmers can buy many of them, including penicillin
and tetracycline, over the counter in feed stores. Some antibiotics
used in humans are also sprayed on crops as pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Sundlof said that it was beyond the authority of the FDA to pass
a blanket ban like the one the advocacy groups wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart B. Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation
Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in Boston, said
that he did not think it was necessary to ban all antibiotics for
growth promotion. But he also said, ``I would very rapidly remove
human antibiotics from growth promotion. The U.S. has to join the
European Union on that. We look a little silly.''

</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic resistance develops from repeated exposure to the
drugs. Initially, some bacteria may be naturally resistant, and
they will survive treatment and multiply. When antibiotics are
given again, more of the bacterial population may become resistant,
and as that proportion increases over time, the drugs may become
less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that giving low doses to animals over
long periods brings out resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that resistant bacteria from animals can make
people sick in several ways. A person can become ill from contact
with an animal carrying a disease-causing resistant germ, or from
handling contaminated meat or eating it when it has not been cooked
enough to kill the bacteria. The infection may be difficult or even
impossible to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the resistant bacteria may themselves be
harmless, but live on in the gut and cause trouble later by passing
their genes for antibiotic resistance to other bacteria, ones that
cause disease. Or, if a person's immune system is weakened by
illness or chemotherapy, the otherwise harmless bacteria can turn
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers
said they had been detecting increases in the levels of
drug-resistant bacteria found in people with gastrointestinal
illness from the microbes salmonella and campylobacter, which are
most commonly contracted from contaminated meat or eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a team from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that the
prevalence of a salmonella strain resistant to five different
antibiotics increased from 0.6 percent of all specimens from around
country tested by the centers in 1980 to 34 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, drug resistance in campylobacter bacteria rose from
zero in 1991 to 13 percent in 1997 and 14 percent in 1998, said Dr.
Fred Angulo, a medical epidemiologist in the foodborne and
diarrheal disease branch at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. He said epidemiologists were ``alarmed'' by the
campylobacter figures, because the resistance is to
fluoroquinolones, the very class of drug that the FDA is trying
hardest to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Angulo said that he and his colleagues blamed much of the
increase in fluoroquinolone resistance on the FDA's approval of the
drugs to treat a respiratory infection in chickens in 1995. It was
an approval that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
opposed, because it would lead to extensive use of the drugs on
chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Angulo said he thought the rising levels of resistance in
bacteria taken from sick people were due to the heavy use of
antibiotics in livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public health is united in the conclusion,'' he said. ``There
is no controversy about where antibiotic resistance in foodborne
pathogens comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study, scheduled to appear in the New England Journal
of Medicine, offers strong evidence that people pick up
drug-resistant bacteria from chickens. In that study, researchers
at the state Health Department in Minnesota found that
fluoroquinolone resistant campylobacter had increased from 1.3
percent of cases in 1992 to 10.2 percent in 1998. The sharpest rise
began in 1996, a year after fluoroquinolones were approved for
chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Osterholm, the former state epidemiologist in
Minnesota, said in a telephone interview that the health department
also found campylobacter in 88 percent of the chickens they bought
in supermarkets in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Twenty percent of the
chickens had a resistant strain.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy people recover from campylobacter, often without even
being treated, Osterholm said. But in patients whose immunity has
been lowered by AIDS or treatment for cancer or other illnesses,
the infection can be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   And the proportion of society in that vulnerable category is
increasing, because of the aging population, Osterholm said. ``One
of the things we're beginning to understand is that we'll see a
major change in the implications of foodborne disease in our
population,'' he said. ``As we get a little older, it has a much
more serious implication.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the widespread availability of antibiotics on farms and
the long entrenched habit of using them, Angulo said that
regulation alone probably would not bring about the changes that
are needed. ``People would have to accept that there is a
problem,'' he said. ``Many don't. It's a societal change, and we
have the same problems in human medicine.'' Many people, he said,
demand antibiotics for viral infections and other problems that the
drugs cannot help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we will make major progress, unfortunately, is when
there is continuing emergence of treatment problems, not just in
humans, but when these drugs don't work in sick animals,'' Angulo
said. ``As that increases, the realization might come.''

UNPREPARED NATIONS POSE Y2K THREAT IN U.S.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Two-thirds of businesses in some developing
countries will be hit by major computer failures after Jan. 1,
according to one study.
</P>
<P>
   Even some traditionally strong European countries will see one
in three of their businesses affected by Year 2000 computer
problems, says the GartnerGroup, a Stamford, Conn., technology
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict some countries also will experience power
failures, water-service shutdowns and civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who study the Year 2000 problem overseas say they believe
many countries outside the United States did not take the problem
seriously until 1997, or even later. There is some concern that
some still have not.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany, in particular, have been low-key, said
Martha Bennett, a London-based vice president with the Giga
Information Group, a Cambridge, Mass., research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``German officials are saying, `All this Y2K stuff is all
American hype,''' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Europe has been distracted by the euro monetary
conversion, which required extensive computer reprogramming.
</P>
<P>
   With 299 days remaining before the new year, Y2K already has
caused problems overseas.
</P>
<P>
   At John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, a Year 2000
computer test knocked out most of the hospital's emergency phone
lines for a weekend last November. Had there been a major
emergency, people would have died, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Many more failures are likely, say authors of a Jan. 26 report
from the World Bank, the financial offshoot of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing problems of incorrect projections in loan
payments, lost patient records, and prematurely canceled orders for
supplies, such as food, oil, machine parts and microcomputer
chips,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank officials will not identify where the problems have
occurred, for fear of undermining efforts to fix Year 2000 problems
and eroding confidence among global trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   In January an international group of banks, securities firms and
insurers even decided not to release a report rating the computer
readiness of the world's trading nations. The Global 2000
Coordinating Group was concerned that the ratings would cause a
``flight of capital'' from low-rated nations and make the Y2K
problem even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Although international discussions focus on industrialized
countries, the developing countries, many of which rely on U.S.
hand-me-down technology, are not immune from Y2K problems. Even the
poorest have computerized essential services such as banking,
telecommunications, power, manufacturing, health care and
government services.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of January, a World Bank survey found that of 139
developing countries, only 15 percent were taking steps to fix
their Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's what experts don't know that causes them the most concern.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who studies Year 2000 issues for Giga, said she saw
three countries with a Y2K information black hole _ Japan, France
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is rated low for its Y2K efforts not necessarily because
its efforts are lagging _ although some say that is the case _ but
because no information is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told by Japan to `take it on trust; we'll be OK,' ''
Bennett said. ``And it would be a huge cultural affront to the
Japanese for the world to turn around and say, `Look, we don't
believe you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Japanese officials say they have the Year 2000
problem in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But they are threatening to suspend financial agencies after a
government survey found that half of the nation's top 19 banks had
completed updates to only a quarter of their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Russia have been more forthcoming, but the news has
not been good.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have warned that everything from the country's rail
system to its nuclear reactors is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``To guarantee that we will be ready is impossible,'' said
Alexander Krupnov, director of the agency coordinating government
Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts are particularly worried about Russia's large
nuclear arsenal and nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Last month U.S. and Russian military experts agreed to work
together to tackle the Y2K problem, and they plan to meet again
this month. The cash-strapped Russians estimate that solving the
country's Y2K problem could cost up to $3 billion. They have asked
for help from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The story is not much different in China, which is flooded with
bootleg software. Y2K updates probably are not possible.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of China's businesses surveyed by the government
did not know how to find the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have ordered Chinese airline executives to
take a flight Jan. 1, an added incentive to make sure the country's
airline industry takes the problem seriously.

   (Kansas City, Mo.: country's airline industry takes the problem
seriously.)
</P>
<P>
   Experts also are concerned about the Arab states of the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things break down, then the action taken is usually
spur-of-the-moment, unorganized and takes time,'' said Mohammed
Mrayati, an adviser for the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Western Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Airports, Egypt's Suez Canal and electric networks could take a
hit, U.N. officials said. Highly computerized oil refineries and
water desalination plants are a big concern, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they should stop,'' Mrayati said, ``then millions of people
would have no power and no water to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa returned to the Dominican
Republic last year, much of the island nation had been without
power three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations outside the United States could be in for a
similar experience after Jan. 1, said Matt Hotle, a GartnerGroup
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But he sees no reason for panic. With the exception of Western
European countries, many parts of the world are accustomed to
occasional service failures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've dealt with this before, and they'll deal with it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences of unpreparedness in any one country can
rapidly spill over to other parts of the world,'' said Ahmad Kamal
of Pakistan, who organized a Dec. 11 meeting of 120 national Y2K
coordinators at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in
New York, believes the Year 2000 problem will lead to a global
recession that will last through much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that individual countries can get through
occasional catastrophes, he said, the world has never faced a
problem like Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a lot of these disruptions in the bottle at the
same time, you're going to shatter the glass,'' Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem is forcing companies to rethink how they do
business overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For the International Division of Hallmark Cards, addressing the
problem means dealing with hundreds of suppliers in a dozen or more
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallmark is fortunate. Our major international operations are
in countries where there is the least risk,'' said Kim Westerfield,
coordinator of Hallmark's Year 2000 effort overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to take the stance of understanding what the
infrastructure risk is and focus on things within our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other Kansas City area companies, most of which are
small and medium-size firms, are taking similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon Industries in Blue Springs is working with customers
around the globe to update Harmon-manufactured railroad equipment
that otherwise might malfunction after Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Diamant Boart Inc. of Lenexa, a subsidiary of a Belgium
corporation, is stocking up on diamond saw parts and other critical
components to make sure it can continue assembling saws in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni said the problem for many U.S. companies could be traced
to how American manufacturers did business.
</P>
<P>
   Most American companies rely on ``just in time'' manufacturing,
in which factories receive vital components as they are needed for
assembly. Most of the labor-intensive parts are manufactured
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those parts don't get made in time, there would be some
very significant employment reductions,'' Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry is especially vulnerable, Scott McNealy,
chief executive of computer maker Sun Microsystems, told a global
Y2K gathering in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Asia is way, way behind,'' he said. ``It might be
difficult to buy computer hardware in the first half of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Automotive Industry Action Group, a nonprofit coalition, is
helping Ford, General Motors, Daimler-Chrysler, Toyota and Volvo
keep international supply lines open.
</P>
<P>
   There are few parts on an automobile assembly line that are not
crucial, said Fred Craig, Year 2000 program manager for the group.
If a foreign supplier shuts down, it could have a ripple effect
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   An industry SWAT team of sorts is prepared to help suppliers
that are falling behind in Y2K repair efforts, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting a few hiccups. But we're not expecting to see
a lot of major disasters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some global companies, such as Kansas City engineering firm
Black &AMP; Veatch, are hesitant to discuss the worldwide implications
of the Year 2000 problem for fear of ``compromising the
confidentiality of our foreign customers,'' spokesman John Allen
said.
</P>
<P>
   International pharmaceuticals maker Hoechst Marion Roussel took
a similar approach. Spokesman Charles Rouse of the company's North
American branch in Kansas City said only that the company was aware
of the Year 2000 problem and was making ``continued progress''
toward fixing the bug.

FUTURISTS HAVE A MIXED RECORD IN FORCASTING HUMAN PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- It's 1999 and, yes, rats still exist.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago the futurists figured otherwise. An optimistic and
self-assured bunch, they issued papers, gave speeches and sketched
diagrams that dared to portray life ``a hundred years hence,'' or
at the close of the century they were entering.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ladies' Home Journal joined the chorus in December
1900, it predicted this for the year 2000:
</P>
<P>
   ``Insect screens will be unnecessary. Mosquitoes, house-flies
and roaches will have been practically exterminated. ... The
extermination of the horse and its stable will reduce the
house-fly. ... There will be no wild animals except in menageries.
Rats and mice will have been exterminated.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that this report and several others of the
era proved accurate _ if rather clumsy _ in forecasting the advent
of TV, of airships and mass-produced cars, of air conditioning
(``cold air from spigots''), of skyscrapers, of school buses and of
the physical-fitness phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Many envisioned America at the dawn of the third millennium as
an electric utopia void of hunger and wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life in those times will be as nearly a holiday as it is
possible to make it,'' the Brooklyn Daily Eagle asserted on the
last Sunday of 1899. ``Work will be reduced to a minimum by
machinery. Nobody who is anybody (will lack) his automobile and his
air yacht.''
</P>
<P>
   The dreams defined the times. People at the turn of the century
were just learning the complex art of telephoning. A burst of other
innovations had them bedazzled: electric lights; moving pictures;
phonographs; the earliest motor cars. By 1903 the Wright brothers'
flying machine would bolster the argument that anything was
possible by the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these forecasters ended up with was a picture of their
own community perfected,'' said Carolyn Marvin, author of ``When
Old Technologies Were New: Thinking About Communication in the Late
19th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics had their say, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899 the British scientist William Thomson declared: ``Radio
has no future. Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.
X-rays will prove to be a hoax.'' As for the submarine, even
science fiction author H.G. Wells said he couldn't imagine such a
vessel ``doing anything but suffocating its crew and floundering at
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the era belonged to optimists. John Bates Clark was one.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote an essay, ``Recollections of the Twentieth Century,''
that appeared in the January 1902 issue of Atlantic Monthly.
Assuming the role of a toastmaster at millennium celebrations in
the year 2000, Clark imagined city streets and storefronts stacked
high upon each other, ``translating the whole life of the people,
in a literal way, to a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejoiced the end of poverty. He described the ``unfamiliar
sight'' of a passing parade displaying obsolete weapons of war.
``The quick-firing cannon and the machine guns made (spectators)
shudder, by showing them to what purpose much of the ingenuity of
our people was formerly devoted.''
</P>
<P>
   These turn-of-the-century soothsayers hailed electricity as
society today hails the personal computer. Electricity would change
everything, they believed, and they were right. But on the details,
some strayed off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist for the Knoxville Journal suggested that electrical
currents by the year 2000 ``will silence squalling babies'' and
that ``drunken, wife-beating husbands who fail to provide for their
families (will be) promptly drawn into submission'' by a few
well-placed jolts.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, by century's end ``a lady can touch a button and
thoroughly clean a room within 15 minutes.'' Credit the columnist
for predicting the vacuum cleaner, but deduct points for overdoing
it. Housekeeping today, he insisted, would be ``fun ... a real,
joyful picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity meant better medicine _ so much better that ``few
drugs will be swallowed.'' So said the Ladies' Home Journal.
Electricity also would produce strawberries the size of apples and
``peas as large as beets,'' the magazine promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most bizarre predictions,'' said historian Marvin,
``was that electricity could be used to make everybody's skin
white. Naturally, these were white people doing the predicting, and
to them, everyone desired to be white.''
</P>
<P>
   Some forecasters spoke of racial equality by century's end, but
hardly any predicted the rise of women in business. Instead, women
homemakers would benefit from electrical appliances, allowing them
more time to nurture children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was progress,'' said Jeff Moran, assistant professor of
history at the University of Kansas. ``The height of achievement,
for many people at the time, would be that more women stay in the
home instead of heading out each day to slop the hogs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, John Elfreth Watkins Jr. consulted ``the wisest and
most careful men in our greatest institutions of science and
learning.'' He concluded:

   (Kansas City, Mo.: greatest institutions of science and
learning.'' He concluded:)
</P>
<P>
   -- C, X and Q would be dropped from the English alphabet by
1999. ``They will be abandoned because unnecessary. Spelling by
sound will have been adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A gymnasium in every school. This good guess offsets Watkins'
bad guess: ``A man or woman unable to walk ten miles at a stretch
will be regarded as a weakling.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Pneumatic tubes would deliver packages and groceries to
homes.
</P>
<P>
   -- The 2000 federal census would record between 350 to 500
million Americans. This estimate was too high, as about 270 million
people live in the United States today.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The trip from suburban home to office will require a few
minutes only. A penny will pay the fare.''
</P>
<P>
   A hit-and-miss thing, prognostication. Watkins did manage some
hits by predicting snowmobiles (``automobile sleighs in the
winter''), live video broadcasts (``American audiences in their
theaters will view upon huge curtains before them the coronations
of kings in Europ'') and direct dialing ``by an automatic signal
... without the intervention of a `hello girl.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cars would replace horse-drawn buggies in the 20th century, the
oracles agreed. One, however, ventured so far as to predict that
the absence of slow-moving horses would mean pristine roads and no
more traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Planes would turn the sky ``almost black'' with criss-crossing
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Telephones would allow Americans to converse not only with
people in other countries, but also with ``inhabitants of Mars and
many other worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy would be tapped from the wind, sun rays and ocean waves.
</P>
<P>
   Political corruption, gone. Industrial monopolies, banished.
Labor strife, eliminated by collective bargaining for all.
</P>
<P>
   So now with our modern conveniences and push-button technology,
why do so many people foresee gloom in the next century?
</P>
<P>
   According to historian Moran, three things happened to dim a
once-bright future: the atomic bomb, the Holocaust and the
environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   These events _ hardly on anyone's intellectual radar in 1900 _
``made people question whether technological progress equated with
moral progress.'' Progress made life easier, perhaps; it also could
destroy life.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago the upbeat Clark offered but one warning about
life ``at the portal of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought progress might weaken individual morality. Wealth and
whiz-bang gadgets at home might spur the ``sore temptations'' of
materialism, isolation and loss of community, Clark wrote. ``In
this direction the strongest effort is needed. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You have work before you, children of the twenty-first
century; but my hope is that the area of greatest danger has been
passed.''

ANOTHER GENERATION FROM RUFUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people hold that no dog or cat should be allowed to breed,
because there already are too many of them in the world.
</P>
<P>
   I respect that view, even if I don't share it.
</P>
<P>
   My own opinion is that what there are too many of is us, and if
the planet is to be saved, it's people who need to be prevented
from breeding.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there'll be the devil to pay for confessing it, but the
Brittany bird dog, Bear, will be siring a litter any day now. We're
waiting, Bear and I, for the phone call that will alert him to his
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie is the female's name. Her owner is a friend, and we've
hunted the two of them together several times.
</P>
<P>
   They're both liver and white, and so alike you'd almost think
them brother and sister. We've sometimes momentarily mistaken one
for the other as they bounded through the weeds and high grass.
</P>
<P>
   Bear's a bit on the short and sturdy side. Maggie's more svelte,
and stands perhaps a half-inch taller at the shoulder. She'll put a
little more leg in the pups they make together.
</P>
<P>
   And what's certain is they'll be good dogs _ fine companions in
the house, hard and capable workers in the field. With dogs, as
with anything else alive, bloodlines count for much. Not
everything, but a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Bear's grandsire was Winchester Repeater Seeley, and his
granddam was Rosanna, both of hunting stock, both with good names
behind them. Out of a litter by those two came Rufus, who was my
partner for nearly 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life, Rufus, whose coat was white and
orange, was paired with a small liver and white female, Holly. And
the get of those two was a litter of 10, five orange, five liver.
We kept one of each.
</P>
<P>
   Bear is Holly's Bear, because he favors his mother. Pete, being
orange, is Rufus Repeater. At not quite 6 months of age, on their
first morning afield, those two honored the first point they saw
their father make _ froze in place behind him as steady as seasoned
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, they were pointing quail independently, honoring
one another's points, finding and fetching the downed birds. A
couple of years later, the first time we were out together with
Maggie, she was hardly older than they'd been then, but already as
precocious.
</P>
<P>
   I'd meant to keep only one out of those last Rufus pups. We
ended up with two. There almost was a third, another liver one. My
wife had even named him already _ Cyrus, a kingly moniker for the
runt of the litter.
</P>
<P>
   Three seemed an awful lot of pups, though. So we hesitated. Then
some other man fancied him, and the chance was lost.
</P>
<P>
   The other day the question came up of what I'd do with the pup
out of this prospective new litter, the customary compensation for
the sire's service. My compensation, that is. Bear's reward will be
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   There were several friends, I told my wife, who might be glad to
have a pup from Rufus stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``But won't you be keeping him?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well ...''
</P>
<P>
   I'd wanted to, of course. But I'd considered it the remotest of
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a Cyrus after all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it's settled.
</P>
<P>
   For the man who follows bird dogs, it's important to be careful
about their pedigrees.
</P>
<P>
   It's even more important to marry well.

SO WINTHROP'S A GIMME, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 62?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   Somone figured out that the odds of picking a perfect NCAA
Tournament bracket of all 63 games is less than one in 9.25
quintillion.
</P>
<P>
   That's 9.25 followed by 18 zeros.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, do it at the Insight.com $1 million challenge on
the FANSonly Network (www.fansonly.com/ challenge or
http://insight.com) and you'll win a million (that's one with six
zeros). And there's no entry fee.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the prize for doing it on Wall Street Sports Inc.'s
site (http://itsmadness.com).
</P>
<P>
   Warning: In their contest rules, they say the odds of winning
depend upon the number of entries. Each expect between 150,000 and
200,000 players.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever picked a perfect NCAA Tournament bracket in one
of these contests, said SCA Promotions, a Dallas-based insurer
that's backing Wall Street Sports' offer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the closest was Michael Horton of Portland, Maine, who
won last year's ESPN's challenge (http://espn.go.com), but the best
he could do was 35 picks.
</P>
<P>
   A record 2.5 million people will play NCAA Tournament office
pools online this year and it'll swell to about 10 million by 2001,
said Michael Sweeney, director of marketing for Wall Street Sports
Inc. The Internet also has live audio from each game on
Broadcast.com (http://www.broadcast.com).

<P>
   __ With baseball exhibition games started, one place to consider
if planning a spring-training trip should be Major League
Baseball's official site (http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/

</P>
<P>
   However, for Arizona sightseers, there's a better bet that just
went up. Pete's Cactus League Planner
(www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/7566/ cactus/index.htm) has much
more street-wise advice and better maps to all the teams in the
desert. By the way, Pete says he'll make his ``spiritual retreat''

   (Kansas City, Mo.: statistics that say pulling a gun increases
the likelihood of suffering an injury.)
</P>
<P>
   The Koch Crime Institute of Topeka, a nonpartisan organization
that studies crime and juvenile justice, concluded in a January
study that much of the data are ``subjective and based on anecdotal
information, opinions and speculation that make seemingly
compelling arguments for each side of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Jaworsky, the Koch Institute's director of research, said
advocates and opponents of concealed weapons sometimes used the
same data to support different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, opponents of Proposition B are attacking details of
the proposal that they say would make it particularly lax. They
warn that it would allow permit-holders to carry guns into bars,
Little League games and even into Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants would have to complete training but would not have to
demonstrate that they knew how to handle a firearm. Even people who
are legally blind or too weak to safely lift a gun could get a
permit, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would allow people to obtain permits even
after convictions for serious misdemeanors, such as sexual
misconduct or receiving stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Boone County Sheriff Ted Boehm, president of the Missouri
Sheriffs' Association, said he opposed Proposition B because people
who committed crimes that could require a year in jail should not
carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   Gun advocates argue that Proposition B includes enough
safeguards to protect the public. Applicants would have to submit
fingerprints and authorize a review of their juvenile and medical
records. Property owners could post signs prohibiting guns in their
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriffs could refuse to issue a concealed-carry permit to
drunks, drug abusers or the mentally ill. Applicants could be
denied if they had threatened or attacked anyone in the preceding
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the background checks are inadequate to
prevent dangerous people from carrying guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no foolproof system,'' said Robert Gartner, the
Missouri Highway Patrol's director of criminal records. ``The movie
version of Big Brother, where with one entry you can check
everything in a computer, is not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding juvenile and mental-health records sounds good _ if
you can find them,'' he said. ``What if the applicant doesn't
truthfully tell the sheriff where he grew up? Or what if a person
wasn't committed to an institution?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also warn that inadequate training will lead to
accidental shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to know mechanically how to load a gun, aim and
pull the trigger,'' said Liberty Police Chief Arthur Chevalier.
``But the judgmental decisions on when to shoot and when not to,
they don't require enough training.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some supporters acknowledge that additional training should
be required when permits come up for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But they scoff at the idea that permits would be issued to
criminals or lunatics. They point out that citizens could challenge
a person's permit by filing a complaint with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Experience in other states indicates that fears of inadvertent
shootings and criminals' getting permits are overblown.
</P>
<P>
   The Koch Crime Institute found that fewer than 1 percent of
permit holders nationwide lost their permits because they had
committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Withers, associate director of the Firearms Injury
Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin, said his organization
concluded that laws allowing concealed weapons did not put
additional guns on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hypothesis is that many people carry illegally until the
law changes,'' Withers said. ``People who are motivated by fear to
carry a gun aren't deterred by laws that prohibit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cases of shootings over minor altercations have been ruled
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, for example, a Texas man was charged with murder
for shooting another motorist after a traffic accident. The grand
jury refused to indict him, because he shot after the other man
began punching him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Accidental shootings do happen. In November 1997 two women in an
Indianapolis restaurant were shot when a gun fell out of a man's
pocket as he bent over to help a waitress pick up a broken
necklace.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet went through one woman's hand as she applied lip balm
and then entered the other woman's arm.
</P>
<P>
   But cases like that have proved to be highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   While more states were adopting concealed-carry laws, the number
of accidental shooting deaths dropped from 1,416 in 1990 to 1,134
in 1996, the latest figures available.
</P>
<P>
   A search of national newspapers and court filings failed to turn
up a case of bystanders' having been shot by people legally
carrying concealed weapons. Even Handgun Control could not come up
with any.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, however, bystanders were shot by robbers
returning fire after victims pulled concealed weapons.

VOTERS IN MISSOURI HEAR LOTS OF RHETORIC IN DEBATE OVER CONCEALED
WEAPONS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The public appears to have a growing
infatuation with the idea of carrying hidden handguns.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 years, the number of states allowing concealed
weapons has more than tripled. When Missouri voters go to the polls
next month, they will decide whether their state will follow the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure has divided law enforcement groups, civil
libertarians and even gun advocates. And it has sparked sometimes
angry debate over what happens when the government lets the public
carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional rhetoric has obscured two major trends:
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what many gun advocates say, legal concealed weapons
appear to have a negligible effect on violent crime, most studies
have shown.
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to what gun-control proponents say, concealed
firearms have not led to more accidental shootings, vigilante
actions or cases of road rage ending in gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to the people on either side of the campaign to
legalize concealed weapons in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McGhee, president of the gun-advocacy group Missourians
for Personal Safety, said he is convinced that concealed weapons
reduce crime because criminals don't know who might shoot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right-to-carry puts a question mark in their minds,'' McGhee
said. ``They can't assume their next victim is helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun opponents, including Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, said
concealed weapons put everyone at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a gun may provide a psychological sense of security, it
actually makes people more vulnerable,'' Cleaver said. ``When you
bring out a weapon, it increases the chances that you will be
killed by a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides share little common ground, they agree that
the leading adversaries in the national gun-rights debate _ the
National Rifle Association and Handgun Control Inc. _ have a lot
riding on the April 6 vote in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The election will mark the first time a state's voters will have
decided whether to allow concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The winning side will walk away with political momentum in the
fight over gun control. And the vote could pave the way for ballot
initiatives or legislative efforts in states where politicians have
balked at authorizing concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   While Handgun Control has achieved modest victories in Congress,
the NRA has won a series of votes in the nation's statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s eight states allowed residents to obtain
permits to carry concealed guns without demonstrating a need. One
other _ Vermont _ allows concealed weapons without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the NRA, state legislatures started authorizing
concealed weapons. The issue gained credibility when Florida
approved hidden guns in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Today 30 states have laws similar to the Missouri proposal,
according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The
District of Columbia and 13 states tightly control who gets
permits. Only seven states _ including Missouri and Kansas _ still
ban concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Legislature passed a right-to-carry bill two years
ago, but Gov. Bill Graves vetoed it. A new effort this year has
been endorsed by a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gun advocates in the Missouri General Assembly tried
unsuccessfully for years to get a law allowing concealed weapons.
Unable to overcome the opposition of Gov. Mel Carnahan, lawmakers
last year approved a measure that bypassed the governor and set up
a statewide vote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal _ Proposition B _ would allow people to apply for
three-year permits to carry concealed weapons. Applicants would
have to be 21, be Missouri residents and undergo a criminal
background check. They also would have to have 12 hours of firearms
training.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is shaping up as a classic urban vs. rural issue.
Both sides agree that rural parts of the state, where hunting and
shooting are a part of the culture, appear to be supporting
concealed weapons. Opposition is expected to be strongest in Kansas
City and St. Louis, where guns are often associated with a culture
of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Urban opposition is one of the biggest ironies in a debate
fraught with irony.
</P>
<P>
   Self-defense is the reason most often cited to justify concealed
weapons. Yet urban residents, who are more likely to be crime
victims, are less enthusiastic about legally carrying guns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in states that allow concealed guns, elderly people
tend to obtain permits even though they make up the group least
often victimized by violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in concealed weapons is driven by the public's
gut-wrenching fear of violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``An armed society,'' former NRA President Tom Washington once
said, ``is a polite society.''
</P>
<P>
   But do concealed weapons really reduce crime?
</P>
<P>
   Each side cites a slew of statistics and academic studies to
support its position. Gun advocates point to declining crime rates
in states, such as Florida, that have legalized concealed weapons.
Opponents point to violent-crime rates that have dropped even
faster in California, New York and other states that prohibit or
strictly control concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Gun advocates point to studies that say crime victims who pull a
gun are far less likely to be injured than victims who don't have a
gun. Opponents point to statistics that say pulling a gun increases
the likelihood of suffering an injury.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a decade of record expansion, New York City's
police force remains among the least racially diverse of the
nation's 10 largest police departments, with the lack of black and
Hispanic representation most pronounced in the higher ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The department does not come close to reflecting the diversity
of the city it serves: whites are 67.4 percent of the force, but
only 43.4 percent of the population. Among the 10 largest cities,
the only two with a higher percentage of white officers are San
Diego and Phoenix, where a far greater percentage of residents are
white.
</P>
<P>
   And the disparity is even worse among the brass. Of the 449
captains, 94 percent are white. Among the 237 inspectors and chiefs
who run the force, only nine are black and 10 Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since four white officers killed Amadou Diallo, an
unarmed West African immigrant, in a barrage of 41 bullets,
politicians and protesters have stepped up their calls for more
minority representation on the force and better treatment of black
and Hispanic officers already on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir recently announced the
largest-ever recruitment drive focused on city residents as an
effort to diversify the department. But coming at the end of a
decade in which the force swelled by more than 25 percent, the new
drive cannot have much impact: Even if all of the approximately
1,200 recruits the city plans to hire in July were members of
minorities, the force would still be 65 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have done this a long time ago,'' said Samuel
Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska
who has studied affirmative action in police departments. ``It is
25 years late. Where have they been?''
</P>
<P>
   Some black and Hispanic officers, as well as experts on
affirmative action and policing, said that during the Giuliani
administration, the department lost prominent minority chiefs and
watered down the commitment to diversity seen during the eight
years when New York had black police commissioners, Benjamin Ward
and Lee P. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel like the commitment is not there that
once was,'' said Dr. Elsie Scott, who was New York's deputy
commissioner for training from 1990 to 1994, and now is an
executive in the Washington Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lee Brown and Ben Ward were there,'' Dr. Scott said,
``they constantly looked at numbers and looked at assignments:
Where did we have blacks assigned? Are they in positions where they
could move up? How many blacks are being put into the detective
list? How many blacks are going to the FBI academy?'' Dr. Scott,
who is also coordinator of education and training for the National
Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, added, ``I'm not
sure anybody is doing that now to make sure there is an equal
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cities with more diverse departments, including Los
Angeles, were forced to hire and promote specific numbers of black
and Hispanic officers through court orders. In New York City,
applicants from racial and ethnic minorities successfully
challenged the department's hiring and promotional exams in the
early 1980s, but the resulting quota system was much narrower and
shorter-lived than those in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, police officials say that while they would like the force
to better reflect the community, they run the police department as
a strict meritocracy, and they say the falling crime rate validates
that philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Officers, sergeants, lieutenants and captains are chosen from
the candidates with the highest scores on multiple-choice tests.
The police commissioner can tap any captain for the top 236 posts
in the department, and Safir said recently that he does not take
race or city residency into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to select the most talented people,'' he said. So
the department's efforts to attract more minorities have boiled
down to this: it pitches the advantages of the job, and hopes
people sign up. But the visits to churches, job fairs at city
colleges and leafleting at subway stations have produced recruit
classes only marginally more diverse than the department as a
whole. Of the 4,706 officers hired in the four police academy
classes since April 1997, 65 percent were white, 11 percent black
and 20 percent Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to encourage diversity as much as possible,'' said
Michael A. Markman, chief of personnel, in an interview last week.
``It's an open, competitive examination _ everyone can see it's
fair. Whether everybody takes advantage of it is something else.''

NEW YORK: something else.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once in the department, minority recruits contend they have a
harder time rising through ranks. Departmental records show that
black and Hispanic officers have not done as well as whites on
promotional exams. On the most recent exams to become a sergeant,
lieutenant and captain, whites passed at more than twice the rate
of their black counterparts, while Hispanic officers fared
somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the discrepancy, Markman said he had no explanation
for why any one group would perform better than another. He pointed
out that a diverse group of officers writes each exam and that the
questions are based on readily available materials and are not
``tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to fool people,'' he said. ``The test
measures what's in the book here. We're not looking at any esoteric
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority officers say the figures on hiring and promotion signal
deeper, more complicated problems within the department.
</P>
<P>
   They maintain that black and Hispanic officers are disciplined
more frequently than their white counterparts in the trial room on
the fourth floor of police headquarters, and say that resulting
blemishes on their records can delay or prevent their promotion
even if they pass the exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under-represented on the job,'' said one black officer
who passed a promotional exam and is waiting to see if he will be
selected, ``but over-represented on the fourth floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Others complain that their best path to a detective's shield is
to work in dangerous, undercover narcotics assignments while their
white counterparts get more prestigious roles as investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do a close examination of the various prestigious
units in the police department, you will see that there is an
unwritten rule that African-Americans are kept out,'' said Lieut.
Eric Adams of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, a fraternal
organization of black officers.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he planned to address such concerns by turning other
units into paths to promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents like the Diallo shooting, the 1997 police assault on
Abner Louima and the 1994 choking death of Anthony Baez, minority
officers say, only heighten the perception that New York has a
police department run by whites hostile to minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have failed in recruitment, in trying to make the
department look appealing to different groups,'' Adams said. The
lack of diversity in the upper ranks, meanwhile, means that there
are few role models to show recruits and young officers the range
of opportunity available in the department, and that minority
perspectives are absent from policy-making discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott recalled an executive staff meeting while she was a
deputy commissioner in New York where there was a discussion of
whether to allow 13-year-olds to stand in lineups without parental
permission. ``Being a black person, to me, this was a red flag: I
wouldn't want my child to be brought in for a lineup _ there have
been a lot of mistaken identities,'' she said. ``Whites in the room
had never thought about it. They were used to receiving equal
justice. You grow up as a black person in the United States, you're
used to unequal justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to integrate New York's police force span more than a
century. The city's first black officer, Wiley G. Overton, joined
the Brooklyn Police Department in 1891, before the consolidation of
the city, said Roger L. Abel, a retired detective and former leader
of the Guardians, a black officer's group. Officer Overton left
after a year because of an unwelcome reception from his colleagues,
said Abel, who is writing a history of black police officers in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic officers first came in numbers after World
War II. In the fiscal crisis of 1975, many blacks were laid off,
and sued the department, Abel said. In 1979, when a class of 415
new recruits included only 45 minorities, there was another
lawsuit. That ended in a court decree outlining hiring quotas for
black and Hispanic applicants, which the Koch administration
reluctantly accepted, but the system waned after a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in the last 10 years, we're going backwards,'' Abel
said. ``In every aspect _ recruitment, retention, promotions, the
whole gamut. It's just reversing itself. The leaps and bounds that
we should have taken have not materialized.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest influx of minorities came in 1995, when the
transit and housing police, smaller agencies long seen as friendly
to minorities, were merged into the New York Police Department.
More than 2,500 black and Hispanic officers joined the rolls, and
the department went from being 72 percent white to 69 percent
white.
</P>
<P>
   As the city has grown more heavily Hispanic, the department has
attracted Hispanic officers more quickly than blacks. In 1992, the
department was 11.4 percent black and 13.6 percent Hispanic; now,
it is 13.4 percent black and 17.4 percent Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between the percentage of police officers who are
black and the percentage of residents who are black is wider in New
York than in any of the nation's 10 largest cities, according to an
analysis by The New York Times. New York is 25.6 percent black,
according to 1990 census figures, the latest available, but
African-Americans make up on 13.4 percent of the department.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are better represented on the force. New York ranks
fifth among the 10 cities: The city is 23.7 percent Hispanic, the
department 17.4 percent. The only departments with a larger
over-representation of whites than New York are Detroit, where the
population is just 20.7 percent white and white officers are 35.4
percent of the department, and Chicago, which is 38.2 percent white
and where white officers are 61.9 percent of the department.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities are also better represented in the upper echelons of
other departments than New York. In Los Angeles, 26 percent of
those ranked captain and higher are black, Hispanic or
Asian-American, compared to 7 percent in New York. In Philadelphia,
23 percent of sergeants are black, compared to 8.3 percent in New
York. Whites are 70 percent of the lieutenants in San Diego, 80
percent in Houston and 87.5 percent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the issue is that there are not people who are prepared to
take these positions, it begs the question of development,'' said
Bob Stewart, executive director of the National Organization of
Black Law Enforcement Executives. ``What's happening throughout the
ranks of the department, that the department is not preparing
people? I can't believe it's because people don't want those
positions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZHANLONG, China _ Villagers here say they were not entirely
surprised when on the night of Aug. 7, 1997, public security
officers piled four farmers deemed troublemakers into a van, drove
them to an isolated rice field in front of a copse of trees and
riddled them with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were quickly cremated, and the policemen probably
assumed that the case was closed. After all, local residents say,
police harassment and even summary executions have for years been
an occasional fact of life in this rural town in the southeastern
province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   And villagers say they dare not complain, knowing that policemen
receive praise from above, and at times even $1,200 bonuses, for
such swift ``justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But China is changing, and in this case the four dead men's
cause did not disappear. Their relatives, all barely literate
farmers, waged a yearlong campaign for redress.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered Beijing lawyer agreed to represent the families,
pro bono, in a lawsuit against the police. And a reporter from
China's increasingly vigorous press helped expose a harrowing tale
of police brutality that local officials had kept under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``As ordinary Chinese we felt we had the legal right to have
this case heard,'' said Zheng Canming, the younger brother of one
of the dead men.
</P>
<P>
   Later in March, seven police officers are due to stand trial on
murder charges, in a case that casts a rare spotlight on widespread
abuses by China's local police _ as well as the fledgling efforts
to control them.
</P>
<P>
   Such abuses, from torture to ``extrajudicial killings,'' have
been attacked recently in human-rights reports and implicitly
criticized by top Beijing officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case shows a problem of law enforcement across the
country,'' said Gu Xianping, the lawyer. ``It is typical: The
farmers are victims and don't get protection from the law. We are
gradually improving our legal system, but I'm very concerned about
why the police thought they could get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   China's state-owned law journals and newspapers now often
publish hair-raising exposes of torture and other forms of police
brutality, although such stories rarely seep into the mainstream
press. But experts say it is significant that such a delicate
subject is raised publicly at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese officials are clearly getting more serious about
police and security abuses,'' said Scot Tanner, a professor at
Western Michigan University. ``They know it is a very serious
problem.'' Tanner has done extensive research on Chinese law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the government's legal publishing house came out
with a new series of books about legal abuses, with titles
including ``The Crime of Confession Obtained by Torture'' and ``The
Crime of Illegal Detention.''
</P>
<P>
   The books estimated that hundreds, if not thousands, of Chinese
were illegally detained each year and that 250 people were tortured
to death in police custody in 1993 and 1994. It was the first time
such figures had been publicly released and was an extraordinary
admission, even though experts said the true numbers were certainly
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Although Westerners tend to focus on more abstract rights like
freedom of speech, Chinese officials know that arbitrary harassment
and punishment by local public security officials are far more
gripping issues for ordinary people in this country and threaten to
undermine the government's authority.
</P>
<P>
   So, to help control abuses in its far-flung law-enforcement
system, the central government has recently allowed and even
encouraged press coverage of abuses and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains great ambivalence about the new openness,
Tanner said. On one hand it deters wayward police officers, but on
the other it fuels criticism by Western human-rights groups. And
the desire to provide more even-handed justice does not extend to
those who threaten communist rule, like democracy activists, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are moving to a two-track legal system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 miles from Beijing, on the freewheeling southern
coast of Guangdong province, Zhanlong and its neighboring villages
exude lawlessness. In these once-poor rice-growing towns, many
villagers have become prosperous in the last five years by
reselling fabric, cigarettes and liquor smuggled from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In an area where family-planning regulations allow at most two
children, many families have four or five. Drugs and prostitution
are growing problems. The narrow roads lined by pressed-clay and
tile homes are filled with a strange jumble of ancient tractors,
motorcycles and contraband Mercedes Benzes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlessness also reigns at the local Public Security Bureau,
villagers said, where officers are quick to fine, confiscate,
detain _ and sometimes physically punish _ with little provocation.
Taxi drivers from the nearby cities of Shantou and Shenzhen refuse
to enter places like Puning, the county seat that encompasses
Zhanlong, where they say the police stop taxis and hold licenses or
even cars if they feel the driver has no business in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is afraid of the police here _ everyone,'' said a
farmer-turned-cloth-salesman who gave his surname as Chen. ``We all
know of the killings. These kinds of incidents have happened a lot
here before. The police like to deal on the spot with people they
consider hoodlums.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most people in Zhanlong, the four men who were killed that
night in August 1997 were legally registered as farmers but in
reality made most of their money in small business _ though none
was very successful at it. All were between 20 and 35, had
grade-school education and were married with children. One, Zheng
Canyan, who was either 29 or 30 (his family is unsure when he was
born), had five children aged 6 months to 9 years when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the killings, the local government-owned
television station broadcast the official version of the night's
events: Four ``vicious thugs with guns'' had threatened a villager,
looted his home, and were shot dead after they escaped from
officers who had arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, the men's relatives felt something was
amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng Canming said he became suspicious the moment he nervously
went to the police station to report that his brother Zheng Canyan,
a homebody, had not returned to his house. The police sent him to
fetch his brother's photo. When he returned, they confirmed that
his brother had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock, crying and wailing,'' said Zheng, who agreed
to speak about the killings, but would not talk generally about the
police. ``He was one of the most simple, honest men in the village.
The police who had shot him couldn't even identify him, since he
didn't have a record.''
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Zheng immediately went to the county morgue, in Puning,
where he persuaded someone to let him see the body, which was about
to be cremated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for a cloth to clean him, since he was covered with
bullet holes and blood,'' he recalled. ``I spent some time there
trying to close the eyes _ one wouldn't go down. And I noticed all
the bullets had entered from the front, and I thought: `That's
strange. Why would it be this way if he was fleeing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The families ultimately pieced together a different story, which
was supported by an intensive investigation by the state-owned
Legal Daily, and later by provincial law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the killings, one of the four farmers, Chen
Guanfeng, had gone to another villager's house to demand money that
he said he was owed. The two argued, and the villager, who was
related to a former Zhanlong police chief, went to the Public
Security Bureau claiming that Chen had tried to extort money from
him at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy police chief immediately sent six officers to Chen's
small paper factory and arrested him as well as three other men,
all casual acquaintances who were there drinking tea. Witnesses
said the men had been led into a van with their hands bound with
belts and strips of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to a local farmer who lived near the field, who said
that night he heard sounds like firecrackers, then crying and then
more firecrackers and then more crying,'' Zheng said. ``How could
four men with their hands tied escape from six policemen with
guns?''
</P>
<P>
   Days after the killings, 200 friends and relatives descended on
the Puning prosecutor's office demanding an investigation, Zheng
said. Two weeks later, when that investigation concluded that the
police had acted lawfully, indignant families fanned out to
Guangzhou, the provincial capital, and to Beijing to present their
findings to officials.
</P>
<P>
   Later they contacted a reporter at Legal Daily and decided to
retain a lawyer as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always believed that the party and the government would
abide by the Chinese people,'' said Zheng. ``But at that point I'd
already spent a lot of time and money on fruitless visits to
Beijing. And life was so hard for my sister-in-law with five
children to feed. I felt we needed a top-class lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   He found Gu Xianping, who has a reputation as one of the best
lawyers in China and was originally from a rural area.
</P>
<P>
   Gu credits the families' persistence with turning their tragedy
into a test case. ``In the last 10 years there have been campaigns
to raise legal consciousness among ordinary Chinese, and so the
families came convinced that China was a country with the rule of
law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a yearlong investigation by Legal Daily ``broke
the case'' and pushed the Guangdong authorities to conduct their
own inquiry. On Sept. 10, 1998 _ more than a year after the
killings _ two deputy police chiefs and five policemen were
arrested. The Guangdong prosecutor's office concluded that one
deputy chief had ordered the killings while most of the officers
had taken part reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   The case, however extreme, clearly reflects systemic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In February, China Consumer Journal reported the case of Wang
Chonggao, a model worker and head of a local electricity-supply
bureau in Hubei province, who died after 29 hours of continuous
interrogation and extensive torture that included beatings around
the ears, painful handcuffing and more. The local prosecutor's
office had suspected him of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Chinese Lawyer recently reported on Zhao Yi, a
young engineer, who suffered brain injuries and a ruptured eardrum
after she endured four hours of beatings at the hands of police
interrogators in Liaoning province who suspected her of theft.
Although the police concluded that she was innocent, she sued. A
number of reporters attended the trial, but wrote that there had
been efforts in court to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhanlong trial, originally scheduled for early February, has
been ``postponed'' because of intense public interest, said Gu, who
is now fielding interview requests from the mainstream press.
``Before this, cases like this wouldn't have been reported,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking the $12,000 that each family could
receive under the state compensation law, Gu has filed a civil suit
demanding further damages for the victims' families. Zheng's widow
now supports her five children by selling sundries like toilet
paper and pens out of her mother-in-law's house, her brother-in-law
said, and is buoyed by the prospect of justice and money.
</P>
<P>
   But other villagers remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a court case, but I don't expect them to be
punished,'' said the cloth salesman, Chen. ``The police they are
bigwigs. We are not. It is hard for me to take the trial
seriously.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the heart of the government's antitrust case
against Intel Corp &UR; . &LR;  that goes on trial Tuesday is a meeting
nearly five-and-a-half years ago at the annual Comdex computer
industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   There, in November 1993, the chairman of Intel cut a fateful
deal with his counterpart at a small but leading maker of highly
specialized computer work stations, Intergraph Corp.
</P>
<P>
   During the half-hour meeting, according to interviews and court
papers, Andrew Grove, Intel's top executive, persuaded James
Meadlock, Intergraph's chairman and chief executive, to use Intel
as the sole supplier of chips for Intergraph's work stations _
high-performance computers aimed at engineers, architects and
others requiring powerful graphics, design and animation
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For Intergraph, casting its lot with Intel would mean abandoning
its own chip technology and scrapping plans to use Sun Microsystems
as an alternate chip supplier. But it would also mean turning to
the world's most advanced developer of computer chips, and at the
time, a company that had been committed to making products that
could be used interchangeably with those made by others.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few years, the relationship flourished. Intergraph
work stations were even featured in Intel's annual reports and in
product rollout events like the debut of the Pentium Pro chip, as
Intel's efforts to produce ever more powerful chips for customers
like Intergraph burnished the chip maker's reputation for being on
the cutting edge of technology.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1997 the ties between the companies had become frayed,
amid bitter charges and countercharges of patent infringement,
fraud and misappropriation of trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Intergraph executives say that Intel's decision to withhold
technological data in a market that changes as quickly as the
computer industry has been a serious corporate setback. In the wake
of the falling-out, as Intel racked up ever-higher revenues and
profits and saw its share price continue its seemingly inexorable
climb, Intergraph has labored under mounting losses. And
Intergraph's share price now languishes in the $5 range _ about
half its level when Meadlock made his Comdex pact with Grove.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the Federal Trade Commission's charges that Intel had
``sought to extort'' technology from its customers ``in order to
preserve its monopoly,'' none are more revealing of the strengths
and weaknesses of the government's case than the accusations by
Intergraph. And Meadlock and Grove, both pioneers in their
respective fields, expect to feature prominently in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government plans to call Meadlock as its first
witness this week. And Meadlock will be followed to the witness
stand by Wade Patterson, the president of the company's hardware
division.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, expected to last up to two months, will be heard by
an administrative law judge whose decision, either way, is all but
certain to be appealed to the next level _ the four members of the
FTC. The agency's lawyers have asked for an order that would bar
Intel from withholding technical information from customers with
which it has disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Meadlock and Grove, both respected pioneers in their fields,
expect to feature prominently in the trial. Meadlock would seem to
present a sympathetic figure, an engineer's engineer who was a
recipient of the Congressional High Technology Award in 1985,
following his work in the 1960s as a top software developer for the
Apollo space program and for military systems.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Grove, whatever his reputation for tough bargaining,
hardly comes across as a plundering monopolist. A native of Hungary
who as a boy during World War II was forced to hide from the Nazis
and later fled Soviet domination of his country by emigrating to
the United States in the 1950s, is the embodiment of the American
success story.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with odd jobs that included busboy in a Catskills
resort, he rose to become the senior executive of the world's
largest chip maker and one of the most profitable companies in
history.
</P>
<P>
   And so aware is he of the responsibilities and potential
pitfalls of Intel's industry dominance that Grove requires
employees to receive training in antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, by all accounts, his management style is embodied by the
title of his 1996 book, an aggressive executive's guide to consumer
trends, rival technology and regulatory threats and opportunities:
``Only the Paranoid Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel declined to make Grove available for an interview, saying
that he cannot comment while the company is in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The government, besides presenting the Intergraph accusations,
has also cited Intel's decision to cut off technology to two other
companies _ Compaq Computer and Digital Equipment _ as evidence
that the chip maker coerced its major customers into surrendering
technology so that Intel could maintain its market dominance. But
neither of those companies, which are much bigger than Intergraph
and merged last year, has suffered as badly as Intergraph,
according to government officials and Intergraph executives.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge Edwin L. Nelson concluded last year, in a
separate, continuing suit in which he ordered Intel to resume
supplying Intergraph with crucial technology and sample chips while
the litigation proceeds, that Intel ``violated its affirmative
duties as a monopolist not to misuse its monopoly power and to
compete in a manner that does not unreasonably or unfairly harm
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion, which also ordered Intel to resume supplying
technical information to Intergraph, is now on appeal. Intel's
lawyers have maintained that its decisions to sharply reduce
customer access to technology were lawful and proper. And they
contend that even the government's own expert economist has been
unable to find any evidence that Intel's actions harmed either
innovation or competition _ a central criteria of federal antitrust
law, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's actions were nothing more than a response to the
assertion of infringement claims against it,'' the company said in
its trial brief in the FTC case. ``Intel's withholding of the right
to use its intellectual property from companies that had done the
same to Intel was an appropriate and perfectly normal response to
the actions of Digital, Intergraph, and Compaq.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meadlock, in a recent interview, as well as court papers in the
FTC case and one of the related lawsuits between the two companies,
has said that Grove assured him at the 1993 Comdex meeting that
Intergraph did not need to worry about using Intel as its sole
supplier of chips because ``Intel would treat Intergraph fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was basically an effort to sell Intergraph on
designing with Intel,'' Meadlock said. He said Grove ``had told me
that the openness of the architecture had helped Intel to dominate
the industry and that they had no intention of changing that
strategy.'' Chips designed with an open architecture are
interchangeable with those made by rivals, while those of closed
architecture are not.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that assurance, Meadlock said, Intergraph decided
to forgo further development of its own high-end chip, called
Clipper, and to abandon plans to use Sun Microsystems as a supplier
along with Intel. It also spent months redesigning its work
stations to make them compatible with Intel products.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between Intergraph and Intel started
fraying in late 1996, amid growing complaints from Intergraph that
some computer makers that were rivals of Intergraph were infringing
on Clipper chip patents by using Intel chips. Intel contended that
the Pentium chips had relied on some of the same memory technology
in the Clipper chips. When Intergraph threatened to enforce those
patents, the companies turned to Intel and asked to be indemnified.
</P>
<P>
   Meadlock said that since Intergraph recognized it was ``locked
in'' to Intel products, his company did not initially confront
Intel about the patent issues, but instead tried to obtain
royalties from the computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was a sensitive issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Intergraph rivals turned to Intel for help, Intel
responded by seeking a cross-licensing arrangement that would
enable the two partners to each have access to certain patent
rights held by the other.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations went nowhere, and in 1997 Intel began
responding to Intergraph's requests by withholding technical
specifications and samples of new chips that were crucial for
Intergraph to design updated versions of its work stations.
</P>
<P>
   Making things even more difficult for Intergraph was the fact
that its work stations were now based on Intel products that were
no longer interchangeable with other companies' chips. That placed
significant obstacles to Intergraph's turning to an alternate
supplier. In the years after the 1993 Comdex meeting, in which
Meadlock recalls receiving Grove's assurances about Intel's open
architecture, Intel began executing plans to move away from an open
design in its newer chips to develop its own graphics functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to control more and more of the electronics,''
Meadlock said. ``They want the Compaqs and Dells of the world to be
nothing more than their marketing arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to reach a settlement with Intergraph, Intel retaliated
by withholding vital technical information and support, limiting
Intergraph's supply of chip samples, and according to Nelson,
blacklisting Intergraph in the digital media market by offering
Intergraph customers financing and other support on the condition
that those customers not deal with Intergraph.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've done to us is totally unethical and illegal,''
Meadlock said, ``and I don't think people realize it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives are expected to dispute the blacklisting
charges and say there was nothing wrong with withholding chip
technology from Intergraph, Compaq and Digital. The company's
lawyers point out that even Meadlock has conceded that Grove never
suggested that Intel would be Intergraph's ``perpetual supplier of
chips.''
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down, Intel executives say, to the countervailing
rights of business partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the facts in the three instances are
similar,'' said Peter N. Detkin, an assistant general counsel at
Intel who is overseeing its defense in the FTC proceeding, said of
the Intergraph, Compaq and Digital disputes. ``A customer of Intel
asserted an intellectual property claim, claimed that it was
entitled to a larger part of Intel's profits and decided to
withhold patents from Intel. In response, we said we have
intellectual property rights of our own and asserted them.''

RISING PRICES ACCOMPANY CABLE DEREGULATION

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cable television, one of the last industries to
have its prices controlled by the government, is about to become
almost completely deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   But while the prospect of competition was supposed to drive
prices down, the opposite has happened. Cable rates continue to
rise, with many companies announcing increases for this year
averaging 5 percent, more than twice the projected inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 65 million cable subscribers have already seen
rates climb about 22 percent _ more than four times the rate of
inflation _ since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, which set the end of this month as the deadline for removing
nearly all government price controls. The limits were imposed by
Congress in 1992, over President George Bush's veto. It was his
only veto to be overridden, following enormous public complaints
about price gouging and poor service.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 repeal set a three-year waiting period on the
assumption that by now the cable industry would be facing far more
competition for home viewers from satellite broadcasters and
telephone companies, according to many experts, regulators and
lawmakers. But since that has not happened, the deregulation on
March 31 has raised deep concerns, even among Republicans
philosophically opposed to regulation. The fear is that cable
companies unshackled from price controls and not threatened by
competition will continue to impose rate increases that far outpace
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may now be facing the worst of all worlds, which is an
unregulated monopoly,'' said John McCain, R-Ariz., who heads the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Tauzin, R-La., who is chairman of the House Subcommittee
on Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection, said, ``It's
a date that's arising somewhat prematurely in terms of competitive
opportunities for consumers, and that's troublesome for a lot of
folks, me included.''
</P>
<P>
   But cable operators and their Washington lobbyists say the
higher prices, which now average $30 monthly nationwide, have
helped pay for better programming, more channels and expanded
services. They also note their progress in making upgrades that
will permit digital signals and significantly faster Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact of life that programs are just getting a lot more
expensive,'' said Joe Waz, a vice president at Comcast Corp., which
has 4.4 million customers in 20 states, including Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, California and Florida. Comcast expects to raise its rates
this year by 5 to 6 percent. ``We've invested very aggressively in
systems upgrades,'' Waz said.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision Systems Corp., which provides service to 2.7 million
households in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has announced
price increases for 1999 averaging about 5 percent. Charles
Schueler, a vice president, said the company was spending more than
$1 billion to upgrade the system to offer new telephone, digital
and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable rates were set last fall based on our costs to provide
cable service as well as market conditions,'' Schueler said. He
also said Cablevision had begun to feel strong competition from
satellite broadcasters and others.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have disputed industry claims that there is
significant competition, and that price increases, which have
varied in different regions, are justified by better programming
and more channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government data proves their argument false on the face of
it,'' said Gene Kimmelman, a co-director of the Washington office
of Consumers Union. ``In those few areas where there has been
competition, cable companies charge 10 to 15 percent less than
where there's a monopoly to provide the exact same quality
programming. And government data show cable rates going up twice as
fast as programming cost increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have complained that the price increases are being
used to pay for new channels and programs that few consumers want
and for advanced services that remain many years away.
</P>
<P>
   For the cable companies, licensing fees and programming expenses
each rose about 20 percent last year, according to a recent
government study. The industry also spent an estimated $4 billion
on upgrades and improved technology.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of a possible political backlash if prices rise too much
this year, Decker Anstrom, the cable industry's top lobbyist in
Washington, has spent the last few months imploring companies not
to take advantage of the new regulatory climate by spiking rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk every day to companies in the industry to remind them
that policy makers are and have been sensitive to cable prices,''
said Anstrom, the president of the National Cable Television
Association. ``If there's one message I hear from every member of
Congress, it's that the industry has to be very careful about
pricing and services.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   He said the marketplace was highly competitive and was becoming
more so every day, noting that the percentage of television viewers
who subscribe to cable was steadily declining. Government figures
show that 85 percent of all households with television now
subscribe to cable, down from 87 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After March 31, the government will continue to regulate prices
for only basic cable service, consisting primarily of stations that
broadcast over the air. More than 90 percent of cable subscribers
receive expanded service, and often premium channels as well,
Anstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan consensus has developed in Washington over the last
few years that the most effective way to keep cable rates down is
not through regulation but by encouraging competition from
alternatives like satellites and wireless cable, which uses radio
frequencies to deliver video signals. While those technologies have
begun to make inroads in the marketplace, lawmakers and regulators
say they have been unable to truly compete because they cannot
offer the same services as cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite broadcasters, for instance, are restricted from
offering local news and many other programs found on local stations
and on the networks.
</P>
<P>
   While legislation has been introduced in Congress to change
those rules, McCain, one of the main sponsors of the legislation,
said in a recent interview that he was not optimistic about its
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional broadcasters oppose removing the restrictions on
the satellite companies, fearing that this will drain advertising
revenues from local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Court decisions have also discouraged competition. A federal
judge in Florida, for instance, recently ordered DirecTV Inc., the
nation's largest satellite television company, to shut off CBS and
Fox programming to 300,000 customers. The judge ruled that DirecTV
was violating the law that allows the satellite systems to provide
network programming only to viewers who cannot receive a local
network affiliate using a conventional antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and administration officials said they believed the
cable industry would now have the discipline to hold rates down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has said that it will exercise restraint, and
we're willing to accept their view on this,'' said Larry Irving,
assistant commerce secretary for communications and information.
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, said that while cable companies ``have had a history of
taking increases whenever they can, they are also mindful of the
political ramifications of increases that will raise the ire of
Congress, which will be watching the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the companies continue to pour billions of dollars
into upgrading their systems, some analysts say temptation will be
great for a deregulated cable industry to turn to rates as a
vehicle to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be enormous internal pressure,'' said Scott
Cleland, an analyst with the Legg Mason Precursor Group. ``The
industry carries a lot of debt. They are trying to upgrade for
digital TV and interactive services, and it's expensive. Will cable
be restrained? They haven't been in the past. For some of them, it
will take a personality transplant.''

   A broad flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the
eastern Plains and Mississippi Valley will precede low pressure
emerging from the Rocky Mountain states. Snow will be widespread in
the central and northern Plains as the moist air is forced to rise
over the colder air covering the region. While most of the snow
will be light in the northern parts of the Plains and the
Mississippi Valley, a band of heavy snow is expected near a jet
stream disturbance as it moves from eastern Nebraska early Monday
across Iowa into northern Illinois and Indiana Monday night. The
snow will change to sleet and rain over northern Missouri and
central Illinois. The snow and rain will move into the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt in the increasingly moist air
over the lower Mississippi Valley. Shifting winds between the
surface and 10,000 feet will impart rotation to some of the
thunderstorm raising the risk of tornadoes later Monday from
eastern Oklahoma to southern Mississippi and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling high pressure will promote abundant sunshine and
rather chilly conditions in most of the East Coast states. Gusty
winds from the north will persist over New England as low pressure
stalls south of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, patchy clouds and snow showers will occur along
west-facing slopes in the central Rockies. Otherwise, partly to
mostly sunny skies will prevail in much of the interior. Meanwhile,
a cold front will reach the Northwest Coast accompanied by rain and
mountain snow.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Signals From Snow
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of storms that have left parts of the interior
Northeast a blanket of white, there are subtle signals in the snow
that spring is on the way. With the strengthening March sun, solar
energy received at the ground is steadily increasing. While the
snow reflects much of the sunlight, dark trees and roads do not. As
trees absorb the light, they warm and give off more infrared
radiation. Since snow absorbs infrared energy, it melts around
trees, forming depressions. Also, snow falling during the day has
difficulty sticking to roads, which are exposed to more of the
sun's energy, even through thick clouds.

FRUSTRATED OVER STRAINED IMF NEGOTIATIONS, YELTSIN WARNS HIS PRIME
MINISTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin has delivered a stern
warning to Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, accusing him of
being too ``complacent'' about the nation's economic course and
threatening yet another government shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's unusual public riposte was expressed through a senior
aide, Oleg Sysuyev, the president's deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   It represents Yeltsin's sharpest critique of the Primakov team
and reflects mounting frustration over the country's stalemated
talks with the International Monetary Fund over the country's
appeal for additional credits.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs that Primakov was about to be replaced, but
the same could not be said of the prime minister's aides.
</P>
<P>
   The comments underscored the tensions that have developed in the
relations between the two leaders, already strained by Primakov's
efforts to position himself as a potential successor to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Russia's political developments, this one took
place on television _ specifically, during a late Saturday night
interview on the ORT television channel, which is partly owned by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual bromides about the president and the prime
minister working together in harmony, Sysuyev expressed Yeltsin's
anxiety over Primakov's failure to come to terms with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is very worried about the future of the
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund,'' Sysuyev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yevgeny Maximovich should be advised to be more critical of
the performance of the government,'' Sysuyev added, using the prime
minister's first name and patronymic. ``Such a complacent position
can make the prime minister and ourselves miss something of key
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov enjoys a ``very big reserve of confidence on the part
of the population,'' Sysuyev said pointedly. ``But this does not
mean that this confidence is endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there has been growing criticism over how the
Primakov government has handled the talks with the IMF. Much of the
negative talk has centered on Primakov's top economic aide, the
Communist first deputy prime minister, Yuri D. Maslyukov.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped government is obliged to repay $4.5 billion in
IMF loans this year, and the Kremlin has been anxious to avoid a
humiliating default.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is of supreme political importance for Yeltsin, who
has cast the fund's seal of approval as a sign his nation is still
on a reform course.
</P>
<P>
   But as Primakov prepares for a critical trip to Washington later
this month, the quest for new aid from the fund appears to be as
elusive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has yet to produce an economic plan to pull the nation
out of its slump. He has managed to win parliamentary approval of a
budget for 1999. But the fund has complained that the budget is
based on unrealistic assumptions about the government's ability to
collect tax revenue and to limit spending.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, critics say, has compounded the problem by engaging
in a public duel with the fund. After Michel Camdessus, the fund's
managing director, warned last week that the fund would stick to
its tough stance, Maslyukov complained that the fund was being
``indecent'' by trying to pressure Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been increasing demands that Primakov
fire Maslyukov. Boris Fyodorov, a pro-capitalist former economic
aide, has lambasted the Primakov economic team as ``incompetent.''
Even former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has criticized
Maslyukov for creating conflict with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we make threats when we need loans?'' Chernomyrdin
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's move last week to oust the tycoon Boris A. Berezovsky
from his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a group of former Soviet republics, kindled
speculation that a broader shake-up might be under way.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, however, has been loath to discharge Maslyukov. The
Communist-led Parliament approved Primakov's nomination as prime
minister in September but insisted in return that his government
team include leading Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov flew on Friday to Sochi, where Primakov is on a
working vacation, in an apparent effort to save his job. Yevgeny K.
Svanidze, the host of the Zerkalo news interview program on the
government RTR channel, said that Primakov had reconfirmed his
support for Maslyukov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of the prime minister _ not to replace even the
most odious figures in the Cabinet _ has a clear political
explanation: the Red majority in the parliament,'' Svanidze said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is not likely to correspond to the president's point of
view, which was explicitly expressed by Sysuyev. Even now, we can
talk about a quite serious government crisis.''

HOLYFIELD'S SECRET: RISING AFTER A FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHALd  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight days before his title-unification bout with Lennox Lewis
on Saturday, Evander Holyfield sat on the patio of a Burbank
restaurant with a few riveted reporters and did what he plans to do
when his boxing career is over: preach.
</P>
<P>
   The born-again Christian didn't spew mundane religious doctrine.
That's not what an inspiring preacher does. No, he sounded more
like a philosopher than a zealot as he explained how an unruly
child born into a dirt-poor family in Atmore, Alabama found success
in and out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Holyfield's secret has less to do with knocking
opponents down than getting up himself when HE falls. That's how he
fights. That's how he lives. And that's the message he hopes to
deliver to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has fallen many times.
</P>
<P>
   In the ring, there was the 1984 Olympics, when, in the
semifinals, he knocked out his opponent with one punch, after the
referee ordered the fighters to stop, and was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   There were his three professional losses, two unforgettable
setbacks in his three bouts with Riddick Bowe and a close decision
to Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   And there was an uncharacteristically poor performance in a
knockout victory over underequipped opponent Bobby Czyz in May of
1996 _ subsequent to the second loss to Bowe _ that had even the
experts believing Holyfield was through as a fighter at 34.
</P>
<P>
   His response?
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic turnarounds in boxing history: two
victories over Mike Tyson and a brutal knockout of Moorer in their
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   For Holyfield, the most painful and significant defeat was the
first to Bowe, in November of 1992. Before that, he hadn't lost
since the Olympics and had convinced himself he was unbeatable. The
manner in which he went on from there was typical of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son (Evander Jr.) was about 8 and he was crying because I'd
lost. He'd never seen me lose,'' Holyfield said. ``Well, sometimes
you do your best and still fall short. He was 8. He was going to
fall short a lot. So the only way to prove that to him was to go
back and fight this guy again.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . My son played football. And a team that had already beat
his team, my son's team was playing them for the championship. Guys
from that team were saying, `Your daddy got whooped by Riddick
Bowe, now we're gonna whoop you for the championship.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to hold my son's team to the past. Well, I whooped
Bowe before the game and told my son, ``What'd I tell you. Don't
let anyone hold you to the past.' They went out and beat them boys.
How? Encouragement. I let them know you can't let the fact they
beat you be the reason they beat you the next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what life's about, always overcoming obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has had a few of those outside the ring recently.
</P>
<P>
   A week after his second wife, Janice, gave birth to their first
child, in September, he admitted that he had fathered two children
out of wedlock with former girlfriends in the preceding year. That
brought the total of children born out of wedlock to five with four
women.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many reacted to that news by calling Holyfield
a hypocrite: He preaches one way of living and lives another. Lewis
was among those who made that comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only saying what people are thinking,'' Lewis said. ``If I
say I don't drink and I drink, I'm a hypocrite. Simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield admits he erred in a big way, blaming his latest
problems on his inability to handle the pressures of a bad marriage
he has said he wants to end but continues to work on. However, he
doesn't accept the hypocrite label for a simple reason: Everyone
makes mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell short, but I'm not a hypocrite,'' he said. ``A
hypocrite is a person who quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . When things didn't go well in the marriage, there was
pressure. My shortcoming was going back to see girls I used to see.
I never beat no one, I never did drugs, I've never been violent,
but when there's pressure, you get bitter and you do things you
might've done in the past. You look for comfort in the wrong place.
``. . . My problems started when I was a kid and sometimes they
stay with you longer than you want them to. But you don't quit. . .
. Sometimes, embarrassment makes you work harder to change. I thank
God for allowing me to change.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lewis' fate: If Holyfield loses to Lewis on Saturday, he'll
still be remembered as one of the best heavyweights of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis isn't in that position: This is THE turning point in his
career. If he wins, his value soars. If he loses, he's just another
good heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his whole career right here,'' said Emanuel Steward,
his trainer. ``. . . You can say he's a two-time champion, an
Olympic gold medalist, it don't mean nothin' today unless he wins
this title.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . He realizes he must win this fight so in the public's
mind, and mine, he'll be a real heavyweight champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has beaten some big-name fighters: Ray Mercer, Oliver
McCall, Andrew Golota and Henry Akinwande among them. However, only
Mercer came to fight; the others folded before a fight developed.
So, in effect, Mercer, who was outpointed in a competitive bout,
provided his only opportunity to show what he's made of _ until
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think this is my time,'' Lewis said. ``There were
reasons I wasn't able to put my stamp on (the heavyweight division)
before, whether it was politics or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, finally, I have a chance to make my mark and create
history.''
</P>
<P>
   __ He'll be back: Lance Whitaker of Northridge lost his first
fight on Saturday, a split-decision setback to Lou Savarese. He
feels he was robbed by a long count when he knocked Savarese down
in the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   So where was his head later that night?
</P>
<P>
   He was disappointed but saw a bright side. He had given a pretty
good heavyweight all he could handle on national TV, which he
believes made a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I think it's a positive,'' he said. ``The guy's a
10-year pro. I've been fighting 2{ years. He's had 30-some fights.
I have (19).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I showed the world `Mount' Whitaker can fight.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly did in the sixth, when he landed 61 of an
incredible 122 punches and almost took out Savarese. He didn't have
much after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how in the (Oscar) De La Hoya-(Ike) Quartey fight
they threw so many punches in the last round and couldn't lift
their arms? That's how I felt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ De La Hoya-Trinidad?: Now, word is that a De La Hoya-Felix
Trinidad matchup could take place in September _ although it
remains unlikely. Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, and Don King,
Trinidad's, don't work well together and the fighters might be
demanding too much money.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely candidate for September reportedly is Quartey,
whom De La Hoya outpointed in February.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champ, will face Oba Carr in
May in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   __ WBO follies: The WBO should revoke Naseem Hamed's
featherweight title if he continues to refuse to fight Juan Manuel
Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez, the No. 1 contender since December of 1997, is long
overdue his shot at the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez, promoted by Forum Boxing, was negotiating to fight on
the April 10 Hamed-Paul Ingle card with the winner of the bouts to
meet within 90 days. Now, Marquez has been left off the card and
Hamed reportedly is negotiating to fight Vuyani Bungu.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pond card: Dwain ``Tyger'' Williams faces Tito Mendoza in for
the vacant NABO title tonight at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, Rafael Marquez, Juan Manuel's brother, takes
on Guadalupe Gastelum in a 10-round bantamweight fight.

   MIAMI _ The three Haitian men who rescuers found in cold, rough
seas are apparently the only survivors of two boats that sank this
weekend off the South Florida coast, leaving as many as 40 dead in
what may be the worst smuggling disaster in this state's history.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard, which had found only the three survivors
and four bodies in its sweep of the open ocean from Cape Canaveral
to Palm Beach, called off its search Sunday as hope faded of
finding anyone still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty are presumed dead,'' said Art Bullock, a U.S. Border
Patrol officer in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The two boats, with most of their human cargo, vanished about 30
miles east of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no debris, no vessels,'' Jeff Hall, petty
officer with the Coast Guard in Miami. Even if survivors had
something to cling onto, it was unlikely they could have survived,
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water temperature was 70 to 72 degrees,'' he said. ``We
factored in the water temperature to gauge their chances of
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state that has seen bodies and makeshift rafts wash up on
its beaches for as long as most people here can remember, this sea
disaster is almost certainly the most costly, in lives, in the
seemingly never-ending crossings from Haiti and Cuba, rescuers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest disappearance of a boatload of refugees that
I've heard of,'' in Florida waters, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians, trying to escape the latest rounds of violence and
persecution and a endless poverty, were apparently making their
crossing with the help of a for-profit smuggling ring,
law-enforcement officials said, after speaking with the three
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The two vessels, a 17-foot boat and a 20-foot boat, were
believed to have cast off from the western end of Grand Bahama, and
headed straight for Palm Beach, a usual smuggling route, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, such boats carry about nine people at most, Hall said.
These boats had at least twice that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, sometime just after midnight, one of the
boats began to sink, and the second boat came alongside to help.
But as the terrified passengers crossed over on the second boat,
it, too, began to sink, one of the survivors told rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2 a.m. Saturday, about 30 miles off Palm Beach, crewmen
aboard the passing freighter Tomas Faith heard screams in the
water, and radioed the Coast Guard. The sinking might have gone
unreported, if crewmen aboard the Tomas Faith had not heard people
screaming. As it turned out, only a few people, dead or alive, were
found on the surface as dawn broke.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter found the first survivor, weakly trying to stay
afloat as he grasped a propane tank, at about at about 5 a.m., and
two others were found clinging to a barrel at about 8 a.m. All
three survivors, one man in his late 30s, one in his early 40s and
another in his 20s, were treated for hypothermia, and questioned by
the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Although rescuers used helicopters, planes and seagoing boats to
search an area of 2,600 square miles, they found only four bodies.
</P>
<P>
   They found no life jackets, either on the survivors, on the
bodies, or floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bahamas, smugglers tell them it's easy to get here,''
said Samedi Florvil, who works with the Haitian Refugee Center in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Haitians here in Miami said, those who can afford the
costs _some pay hundreds of dollars, or more, a small fortune in
that poor country _ are loaded onto unsafe boats, and risk their
lives in crossings in the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   It is happening, immigration officials said, more and more, in
both Haiti and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the two vessels on Saturday follows a December
incident, in which a larger vessel sank in high seas just off
Elliott Key, about 20 miles south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that 14 Cubans perished, although only
nine bodies were recovered and the rest are believed to have been
lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nine survivors were charged with smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   As conditions in those Haiti and Cuba worsen, the number of
rafters and smuggled people is expected to rise. In 1998, the Coast
Guard intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 1,206 Haitians as they tried to
enter the country, said Petty Officer Hall. In 1997, only 406
Cubans and 587 Haitians were intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 112 Cubans and 258 Haitians have been
intercepted at sea, said Petty Officer Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's Little Haiti, where many of the Haitian refugees have
settled after fleeing a history of dictators and chaos, the news of
the disaster saddened many people, but surprised no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are hurting, day after day after day,'' said
Gerard Joseph, a radio commentator, of deteriorating economic and
political conditions in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   All three survivors will eventually be taken to Krome Detention
Center in Miami, and could be deported back to Haiti.

<P>
   Cambodian officials said Sunday they will conduct a trial in
Phnom Penh for Ta Mok, the last fugitive Khmer Rouge leader, who
was captured on Saturday. Their statements raised further doubts
about their commitment to produce other Khmer Rouge leaders for an
international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, who is believed to be about 72, led the dwindling rebel
force after its former leader, Pol Pot, was purged in 1997. He
remained on the run even after other fugitive leaders surrendered
to the government, along with virtually all their fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Ta Mok had few friends, and a number of political
analysts were predicting that the Cambodian government would seek
to make him a scapegoat for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge. The
brutal communist movement was responsible for the deaths of more
than a million people when it held power from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure we will try him in Cambodia,'' said Om Yentieng, a
top adviser to Prime Minister Hun Sen. ``We have everything here,
why should we try him abroad?''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has been much more ambiguous about the fate of other
former Khmer Rouge leaders _ notably two top officials who defected
last December, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea. He has warned that a
trial could endanger an ill-defined process that he calls
``national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their surrender, Khieu Samphan and Muon Chea have been
allowed to live freely in a remote enclave populated by former
rebels and guarded by former Khmer Rouge fighters. They have urged
the world to ``let bygones be bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is prosecuted, Ta Mok would be the first Khmer Rouge
leader to appear in court. Immediately after their ouster from
power, Pol Pot and his Foreign Minister, Ieng Sary, were tried and
convicted in absentia by a newly installed Cambodian government in
a proceeding that is not generally recognized as having been valid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Sunday that Ta Mok was being held in shackles in
a prison in downtown Phnom Penh, almost within sight of Tuol Sleng,
the former prison and torture house where at least 14,000 people
were sent to their deaths by the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   A team of lawyers has recommended to the United Nations that 20
to 30 former leaders of the Khmer Rouge be tried in an
international court. The lawyers said Cambodia's judicial system is
not adequate to handle such a complex and politically volatile
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director of the New York-based group
Human Rights Watch, said it would be unlikely that Hun Sen's
government could defuse pressure for an international tribunal by
putting Ta Mok on trial at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that even by having some kind of show trial in
Cambodia, pressure for an international tribunal is going to go
away,'' she said. ``I think things have already gone too far. In
fact, any attempt to try Ta Mok in Cambodia could provide more
momentum for having an international tribunal simply because it
will focus attention on all the problems of holding a trial inside
Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still in tatters 20 years after the ouster of the Khmer Rouge by
a Vietnamese invasion, Cambodia's legal system is primitive,
unschooled and riven with graft and political influence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cambodian researchers who have been compiling
evidence against leading Khmer Rouge figures say that despite Ta
Mok's widespread reputation for brutality, the documentary evidence
that he participated in the crimes of the Khmer Rouge is slim.
</P>
<P>
   A jungle fighter since his youth, Ta Mok was a resistance
soldier against the French colonial government in the 1940s. There
is some uncertainty about his given name, but historians say he was
born Ek Chhoen. Well before old age, he was using the revolutionary
alias that includes the honorific ``Ta,'' meaning ``grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a regional commander in the Khmer Rouge's fight for power
in the 1960s and 1970s _ known for his brutality even against
fellow revolutionaries with whom he disagreed. After the movement
came to power, he was a member of the nine-member Standing
Committee that ruled the country under Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
   He led what amounted to a coup within the Khmer Rouge in June
1997, ousting Pol Pot from leadership of what had again become a
guerrilla movement and engineering a show trial and house arrest
for the former leader.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, he had close relations with military commanders
just across Cambodia's northern border in Thailand and is widely
believed to have become a millionaire through cross-border business
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in prison in Phnom Penh, a Cambodian official said, ``He is
looking very tired, very frail and, of course, he is looking sad
that he has been arrested.''

ESPIONAGE ASSERTIONS UNFOUNDED, CHINA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China said Sunday that accusations that its spies had
stolen nuclear weapons designs from the United States were
``unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan gave the first official response
to accusations of nuclear espionage Sunday at a previously
scheduled news conference. The assertions, circulating within the
U.S. government, were reported in The New York Times on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. security officials, the report said, believe that in the
1980s Chinese spies learned the U.S. design of an advanced, small
nuclear warhead, used for hitting multiple targets with a single
rocket. U.S. officials believe that the spying effort, centered on
national weapons laboratories, has continued, it said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Tang said, ``I think the report by The New York Times
was irresponsible and unfounded.'' The espionage assertions, Tang
noted, followed other recent accusations that China has gained
military technologies through commercial satellite transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always some people trying to obstruct normal trade
relations between the United States and China, including the export
of high-technology items,'' he said. ``This will not be beneficial
to the interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, held during the annual session of the
national Parliament, Tang also said any effort to condemn China's
human rights record at a U.N. meeting this month would fail, and he
repeated China's vehement opposition to research by the United
States and Japan on anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those problems, Tang said, he is hopeful that the
planned visit to Washington in April by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
will aid progress toward a Chinese-American ``constructive
strategic partnership.'' It has become clear to both sides, he
said, that ``friendly and cooperative relations serve the interests
of our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is under strong pressure from
Congress to sponsor a resolution censuring China at an annual U.N.
human rights meeting in Geneva this month.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have described past efforts to condemn
China in the Geneva meetings as futile and counterproductive, and
last year the United States did not offer a resolution. But
recently, after China gave harsh sentences to several democracy
advocates, the Senate voted 99-0 to urge the White House to again
sponsor a condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Should that occur, Tang said Sunday, ``I think the outcome will
not be different than in the previous seven times.'' Tang said he
told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during her visit earlier
this week that ``On the question of human rights there will be no
way out if you replace dialogue with confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang asserted that research on missile defenses for U.S. allies
in Asia reflected Cold War thinking and would destabilize the
region. China is particularly alarmed by discussion of including
Taiwan, which it considers a part of China, in a missile-defense
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tang warned of an unspecified ``strong reaction'' to any U.S.
extension of missile defenses to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would amount to an encroachment on China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and also be an obstruction to the great
cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland,'' Tang said.

   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders said Sunday that the report that
the Chinese had obtained U.S. nuclear secrets could make it
difficult for the United States to support Beijing's efforts to
gain entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In talks in Beijing last week, Albright was encouraging to the
Chinese about their prospects for joining the trade group, although
China has done little to meet international demands that it do more
to open its market to imports.

BUSH UNVEILS DIVERSE COMMITTEE TO EXPLORE HIS CANDIDACY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a grand pageant of political might, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas rolled out the 10 members of his
presidential exploratory committee Sunday, an ethnically and
ideologically diverse tableau of some of the Republican Party's
biggest names and most promising stars.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully choreographed juggernaut was intended to convey a
sense of inevitability about Bush's presidential quest, a move that
could help him lock up crucial financial and political support in
the next few months. With each speaker offering a crisp testimonial
explaining why the governor was destined for the White House, the
accolades sounded as if they were for a beloved leader who was
about to be handed his gold watch _ not a man who had never been
elected to any office until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The assemblage, which Bush introduced as ``the best of the
Republican Party,'' included George P. Shultz, secretary of state
under President Ronald Reagan; Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, the
first Mexican-American Republican elected to the House; Condoleeza
Rice, the provost of Stanford University who was a national
security official for President George Bush; Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of
Oklahoma, a conservative who is the only black Republican in
Congress, and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, who, unlike
Governor Bush, supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   For added heft, Bush's advisers distributed a list of elected
officials backing the governor, including 72 House members and six
senators.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring was all the more striking because Bush has yet to
stake out public stands on pressing matters that his rivals are
already debating. Questioned by reporters at the event about issues
ranging from whether he favored a tax cut to what he would do in
Kosovo to the economic crisis in Asia, Bush offered the same
answer: that he would not articulate his positions until he
formally declared his candidacy, which would be in June, after the
state Legislature adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't have specific remedies or specific suggestions until I
start moving around the country,'' Bush, in a common refrain, said
when asked about Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, a former Republican Party chairman who is one of
the heavyweights in the party, said no candidate _ not even Reagan
in 1980, or Richard M. Nixon in 1968, after toiling for years in
Republican politics _ had assembled such an early powerhouse of
support when they sought the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can ever remember there being such a
widespread interest in a candidacy that hasn't even been decided or
announced yet,'' said Barbour, a member of the Bush steering
committee.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is not expected to formally declare his candidacy
until June, he is dominating the polls. This announcement of his
committee to raise money drew such attention, even in the foreign
press, that it had to be held in a large ballroom at the convention
center here. As Bush and his wife, Laura, sat on a stage lined with
Texas and American flags, members of his committee, one by one,
spoke emphatically about his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene offstage was perhaps as significant. As many as
three dozen financial and political advisers flew to Austin to
lunch with Bush and offer counsel. Among them were three of the
party's most successful fund-raisers, Wayne L. Berman, Heinz C.
Prechter and Mel Sembler. Sembler is supposed to be uncommitted
because he is finance chairman of the Republican National
Committee. He insisted, with a smile, that he has not signed on
yet.

STUDY FINDS 49,000 CARJACKINGS ANNUALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are an estimated 49,000 carjackings a year, a far
higher figure than criminologists had believed, the Justice
Department reported Sunday in the first comprehensive study of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the carjackings involved the use of a gun, and in
16 percent of the cases a victim was injured, according to the
report, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a branch of the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the large number of carjackings, only an estimated
average of 27 people were killed each year in the 1990s in
carjackings. About 58 percent of the carjackers were black,
according to their victims, while 19 percent were white, the report
said. There are no data on the race of the others, because such
percentages are based on victim data, not arrest data.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate, of an average of 48,787 carjackings annually from
1992 to 1996, amounts to 10 percent of the average of 500,000
reported robberies a year, said Alfred Blumstein, a professor of
criminology at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   Since only about half of all robberies are reported to the
police, there are actually about 1 million robberies a year, and
carjackings would thus account for 5 percent of all robberies,
Blumstein said. But even this percentage, he added, ``suggests that
carjackings are a more serious problem than most people, including
me, anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor noted that the most common place for robberies,
outside the home, is convenience stores, the site for 5.7 percent
of robberies each year, about equal to the proportion of
carjackings. The next-most-frequent location is gas stations, the
site for 2.4 percent of robberies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the rise in the number of carjackings, Blumstein
said, is that in recent years automobile manufacturers have made
major improvements in ``hardening the ignition of cars, making them
less easy to hot-wire and steal.'' As a result, more thieves have
had to get the key from the owner of the car to steal it, he said.
``This is an unintended consequence of a successful form of crime
control,'' making cars harder to steal, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile theft reached a peak of 1.66 million stolen vehicles
in 1991 and has fallen since then, dropping to 1.35 million stolen
vehicles in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings first came to national attention with the surge of
crack cocaine and semiautomatic handguns in the 1980s. Another
reason for the increase in recent years, Blumstein said, is that
drug dealers did not want to risk being caught in their own cars,
which could be seized by the police if drugs were found in them. So
drug dealers began hijacking occupied cars.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of the number of carjackings was derived from the
National Crime Victimization Survey, a nationally representative
sample of households that are questioned by the Census Bureau. The
survey is one of two national databases on crime, the other being
the Uniform Crime Report, which is maintained by the FBI and is
based on arrests reported by police agencies around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The survey does not ask about homicides, so the estimate of an
average of 27 people murdered a year in carjackings is from the FBI
statistics. The estimate that 58 percent of carjackers were black
is virtually identical with the proportion of offenders in all
robberies who are black, 57 percent.

BROWN SOLID IN DODGERS DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Kevin Brown was neither sensational nor
sloppy, but he was satisfied, which is the most important thing
when it comes to the first spring-training start.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you feel healthy, that's the main thing,'' the
Dodgers right-hander said. ``I would have liked to have been a
little sharper. The arm strength is pretty good, but the timing is
a little off.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his reputation as a guy who will constantly push
himself, Brown didn't settle for the traditional two innings of
work that usually accompanies a pitcher's spring debut. He also
pitched the third Sunday against the Mets. He threw 45 pitches in
all, allowing two hits, including a first-inning homer to Edgardo
Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit his spots but left one ball out,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``I think he felt satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Brown is throwing more curveballs and
re-establishing his pinpoint accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you get into it the more you work on the breaking
ball,'' Brown said. ``I haven't thrown many yet.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Classic moment I: Catcher Todd Hundley and his reconstructed
right elbow appeared in his first spring game _ or quasi-game since
it was a five-inning ``B'' squad affair _ and went 0 for 3 with a
walk as the designated hitter. But the most surreal scene took
place after he broke his bat in his first plate appearance. He
headed back to the clubhouse, accompanied by a team physician and
doctor, and followed by a horde of media. Hundley went to his
locker, pulled out a bat and walked back through the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Didn't you see the last at-bat?'' Hundley said with a
laugh. ``I need a new bat.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Pedro's push: It's one outing, but with the Dodgers in need
of finding a stabilizing lefty in the bullpen, Pedro Borbon's
11-pitch eighth inning was enough to gain attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time out, he was relatively sharp,'' Dodgers
pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``That's a nice little step
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the mend from elbow surgery that's kept him out of the majors
the past two seasons, Borbon said it was the best he's thrown since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a real big step for me,'' Borbon said. ``Last year my
first outing (in spring training) I hurt myself. I came out of this
with a good feeling about my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Beltre banter: Third baseman Adrian Beltre is being touted
not only for his bat but also his glove, and it took him eight
batters to impress pitcher Kevin Brown with his fielding. The Mets'
Rey Ordonez hit a slow roller down the third-base line, which
Beltre barehanded and threw to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable. He sold me,'' Brown said. ``I was going to make
the play. When he called me off, I didn't think he had a chance. It
was a great play, and not on a slow guy, either.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shaw back Friday: The saga is over. Julie Shaw, the wife of
Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw, gave birth to the couple's third child
Saturday evening, six hours after Shaw left Vero Beach to return to
his Washington Court House, Ohio, home. Griffin Lee Shaw weighed 10
pounds, 10 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials said Shaw is expected to return to Dodgertown
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Catching on: The bat isn't the concern. What Gary Sheffield
wants to prove to everyone, including himself, is that playing left
field will create no dramas. It's why Sheffield was anxious in
making his first appearance of the spring. Though he went 0 for 1,
he also made plays without incident in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get a couple out of the way, especially against
the left-handed hitters with the ball slicing away,'' Sheffield
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Scott walked up to a display of digital cameras inside the
Wiz consumer electronics store in Carle Place, N.Y., last Thursday
evening with a single purpose: purchasing a gift for his wife's
50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott peered inside the gleaming display case, a slightly
perplexed look on his face, trying to decide which of the more than
a dozen models of digital cameras he would buy. He quickly accepted
help when a salesman, David Levine, questioned him whom the camera
was for and how it would be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a little direction, I wouldn't know the first thing;
I'm a total impulse shopper,'' Scott conceded after paying $800 for
a Sony Mavica model, which stores photos on a 3.5-inch computer
floppy disk, instead of one of the models using an even smaller,
oblong-shaped memory card. ``After looking at all the bells and
whistles,'' he said, newly confident, ``I opted for the best one.''
</P>
<P>
   But the flush of victory was short-lived. Scott is already
dreading his next planned consumer electronics foray: stalking the
large-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming,'' he said, anticipating the task of hacking
through the features-and-options jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he seemed more concerned about choosing which one to buy
than the likelihood that he will pay $1,500 or more, once he
decides.
</P>
<P>
   And Scott hardly seems to be a unique consumer. Buoyed by strong
holiday sales of large-screen television sets, videocassette
recorders and Sony Playstation video games, and signs pointing to
strong first-quarter sales, the makers and sellers of consumer
electronics products are predicting that 1999 could be the
industry's best year ever. Rather than scaring off consumers, they
are counting on a dazzling _ skeptics might say dizzying _ array of
new and enhanced products to stimulate sales.
</P>
<P>
   The new products include digital television sets with 60-inch
screens and promises of sharper pictures, better sound and new
features like embedded program guides. Add an outdoor surveillance
camera and a set-top box, and a TV can let a person see who's
knocking at the front door without ever leaving the Barcalounger.
And enhanced versions of other electronic products, like
wireless-messaging Palm Pilots and recordable compact disk players,
are expected to keep shoppers pouring out cash to stay on the crest
of the digital product improvement wave.
</P>
<P>
   After declining in 1991, sales of consumer electronics have
since been growing at an average of 3 percent to 5 percent a year,
according to the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association,
the industry's main trade group. And this year, the association
expects sales to reach almost $80 billion _ an increase of more
than 6 percent and up from a record $75 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In discretionary-spending terms, Americans now shell out more on
consumer electronics each year than on furniture, jewelry,
household appliances or sporting goods. The rise in sales is
attributed in part to what the trend watcher Faith Popcorn has
called the ``cocooning'' and ``burrowing'' stay-at-home habits of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers come through to meet the industry's optimistic
forecast, of course, depends on where householders draw the line.
It's one thing to pay $350 to $500 for a 27-inch television set for
the children's room to keep up with the burrowing Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   But with high-definition television programs still scarce on the
airwaves, are consumers really ready to hand over $800 to $1,500
for a set-top box that will translate digital signals into enhanced
pictures on their conventional TV's _ or pay up to $12,000 for a
completely new HDTV set?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Terry Webb, a mother of two in Virginia Beach,
Va. ``I know someone who bought a video disk player, and they paid
a lot of money for it. I wouldn't buy any new product in the first
year that it's out. It's too expensive and you want to make certain
they've gotten all the kinks out first.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers like Mrs. Webb could prove the industry's toughest
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we see, consumers haven't figured out why they need
to own any of this stuff,'' said Nick Donatiello, president and
chief executive of Odyssey, a San Francisco-based market research
firm. And for retailers and manufacturers alike, ringing up high
volumes of sales will be the key to profitability because of the
tight profit margins on all but the biggest-ticket products.
</P>
<P>
   Donatiello said that so far interest in some of the other newer
products, like digital video disk players for watching movies, had
been limited. Still, industry executives are excited because sales
of DVD players, introduced in 1997, topped one million units last
year, rising to that level quicker than sales of the industry's
last entirely new product _ audio compact disk players, which were
introduced in the early 80s.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of movies on DVD is growing, with retailers
like Best Buy, Borders and Blockbuster now carrying many of the
2,800 titles available. And while Hollywood is moving quicker to
make new releases available in the DVD format when they come out on
videocassette, copy-protection issues are keeping some studios from
offering some of the hottest titles on disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the digital video disk player is going to represent a
sea change in the way consumers watch television at home,''
Donatiello said. ``But not this year, and not next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even industry leaders acknowledge that the newest, high-priced
products may be a tough sell. One reason is that while
manufacturers are pushing HDTV, there are few broadcast programs
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first two to three years, it's going to be the early
adopters who are going to be customers'' for HDTV, David Arland, a
spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics, the nation's
top-selling television set maker, acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry officials bring a World's Fair optimism to the
issue, reasoning that curiosity about the newfangled could help
stimulate sales of the older-fangled products.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going into retail outlets to see what the
excitement is about,'' said Jeff Joseph, a spokesman for the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Association. ``They are not
walking out with a new digital television. but they may walk out
with a new VCR or a television.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 1998's strong sales were fueled by purchases of items
like large-screen conventional television sets, videocassette
recorders and video games _ and in many cases, as the second or
third TV set, VCR or game console in the household.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the number of American households owning three or
more television sets reached 49 percent, according to Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   The typical supply-and-demand curves for new types of consumer
electronics products would indicate that sales volume will pick up
as prices decline. And past patterns indicate that as prices fall,
the products themselves will become more functional.
</P>
<P>
   Digital video disk players, for example, had a price tag of
about $1,000 when they first reached the market in 1997. Since
then, prices on some models have dropped below $300, even with
several video disk movies thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, $100 can fetch a VCR with many more features
than the models costing more than $1,000 when the machines first
came on the market in the late 70s. Even the compact disk player
continues to evolve; this year's portable models offer improvements
in the anti-skip features that are popular with joggers and
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history also factors into the industry's current
optimism. Repeatedly in the last 20 years, new types of consumer
electronics have caught on much faster than analysts expected. When
compact disk players were introduced in 1983, for instance, many
market forecasts called for a player to be found in only one in 10
homes within a decade. At this point, 54 percent of households own
them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And in 1984, when the nascent cellular telephone industry was
lobbying for radio airwave space, advocates said that by 1995 more
than 900,000 people would own the devices. ``They were off by about
17 million,'' remarked Richard F. Doherty, director of research at
the Envisioneering Group, a market research firm in Seaford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Video games are the fastest-growing category of consumer
electronics, with sales rising 22 percent, to $6.3 billion last
year. And these, too, are on the verge of a major product overhaul
_ even if the first of the new devices, the Dreamcast from Sega, is
not expected to reach the market until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of game machines use chips that process
information in 64-bit chunks. But the Sega Dreamcast, which is
already available in Japan, will have a 128-bit chip and give
players access to the Internet for group play on line _ a
capability that has so far been limited to PC games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sony announced plans for release early next year of a
128-bit version of its Playstation, which may also play CDs and DVD
movies. Nintendo's 128-bit upgrade is not expected before 2001.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the consumer electronics bazaar may be offering
bewildering new wonders. And consumers may be forced to become
familiar with computer terms like convergence and networking,
whether they want to or not.
</P>
<P>
   Working with chip makers like Intel and computer companies like
Sun Microsystems, consumer electronics makers including Sony,
Toshiba, Thomson, Sharp, Panasonic and Philips are developing
consumer products that could be joined in home networks.
</P>
<P>
   And new alliances between such companies as Bell Atlantic and
IBM are paving the way for home appliances like microwaves and
heating systems to link with computers, VCR' and home security
systems for remote access via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, Scott _ probably not this year. Such
consumer-electronics convergence is ``a trend that's just taking
shape,'' said Jim Hirschberg, director of Intelect ASW, a market
research firm. ``Unless you're Bill Gates,'' he said, ``it's a
little bit down the road.''

IN CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAQ, U.S. OFFERS SAUDI ARABIA NEW MISSILES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ As Iraq accused the United States of
resorting to ``pressure and blackmail'' in the region, Defense
Secretary William Cohen offered Saudi Arabia new weapons and
military training Sunday to help shore up its defenses against any
threat from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The offer came on what may be the most important stop in a
nine-nation tour in which Cohen is seeking to solidify anti-Iraq
sentiment among friendly Arab governments. Some Saudi officials are
uncomfortable with the ongoing American air attacks on Iraq, and
Cohen has said an important goal of his trip is to persuade Arab
allies that the United States is ``acting appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement has prompted mockery from Iraq, where
government-controlled newspapers predicted Sunday that Cohen would
fail to win Arab support. But in the country that is the main base
for American warplanes in the region, Saudi officials voiced no
public dissent.
</P>
<P>
   An American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that Cohen had held a ``very productive meeting'' with Prince
Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz, the king's brother and Cohen's Saudi
counterpart, who has in the recent past objected to the hard-line
American stand.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's offer to sell Saudi Arabia an undisclosed number of
sophisticated air-to-air missiles making it only the third Arab
country to be granted that opportunity, was a clear sweetener in
the American diplomatic campaign. The missiles have a range of more
than 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United Arab Emirates was the first country in the
region to be promised the missiles, which cost $380,000 each. The
second was Bahrain, which was promised the missiles on Saturday,
during the first stop on Cohen's current tour.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq appeared to have those weapons sales in mind Sunday as it
accused the United States of trying once again to buy favor in
region. ``The tour by Zionist Cohen in the region is part of a
continuous American policy of pressure and blackmail,'' the ruling
Baath party newspaper, Al Thawra, wrote in an editorial Sunday. It
said the two states that ``submit to American blackmail are Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain carried out four days of intensive
air raids against Iraq last December. In the weeks since, the
American-led attacks have continued in response to Iraqi attempts
to target American and British pilots patrolling no-flight zones
over northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has mounted an aggressive campaign to persuade fellow Arabs
that the American-led attacks are unjust and that accounts provided
by Washington are nothing more than a pretext for what amounts to a
low-level war.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to reassure uneasy Arab leaders, Cohen contends that
Iraq is leaving the United States little choice but to shoot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure that we are acting appropriately,''
Cohen said at the outset of his trip in a reference to friendly
Arab governments. ``And I think that we can demonstrate very
clearly'' that Iraq ``has been consistently violating the no-fly
zones,'' which were imposed by Western powers after the Persian
Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very dangerous mission flying over the north and the
south, so we intend to take whatever measures we can to insure the
safety of those pilots,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his offer of air-to-air missiles, Cohen agreed with
the prince on a plan to increase joint American-Saudi army training
exercises in Saudi Arabia, a senior American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia was the second stop on Cohen's Persian Gulf and
Middle East tour, which began on Friday. He flew to Oman on Sunday
night and is scheduled to travel on to the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt and Israel before flying home next
Friday.

MEXICO'S OPPOSITION PARTY LOOKS FOR SOLID CHALLENGE TO ZEDILLO
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's center-right opposition party chalked up
major election gains during the early 1990s but has lost momentum
recently as a result of squabbles between the party's doctrinaire
conservatives and a new generation of more pragmatic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Now that may change. Late Saturday, the party, National Action,
elected a new party president, Sen. Luis Felipe Bravo Mena.
Analysts described him as a conciliator, with cordial ties to the
party's old guard as well as excellent relations with the campaign
of Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive from the
party's younger, more pragmatic wing who has been campaigning since
last year for the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo's credentials could help him attempt to unite the party
behind Fox's candidacy, which would be an important development as
the race takes shape for the presidential election in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the infighting has centered on whether the party, known
by its Spanish initials, PAN, should support Fox, the governor of
Guanajuato state, for the presidency. Fox is building such force in
national polls that he is an early front-runner. But some of the
party's traditional leaders, including several descendants of the
Roman Catholic politicians who founded the party in 1938, have been
quietly undercutting Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bravo is a bridging figure,'' said Federico Estevez, a
political scientist. ``He's an intellectual who's close in
temperament to the PAN's old guard, but who knows that his function
must be to put the party at Fox's disposition. He'll make sure that
the party will dovetail smoothly with the Fox campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bravo faced his first major political decision minutes after he
was sworn in late Saturday at a party convention in a Mexico City
hotel. Reporters pressed him for his position on recent proposals
by several opposition politicians, including some old-guard leaders
of his party, to support a common opposition candidate with the
main leftist party to run next year against President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo was noncommittal. Several Mexican newspapers interpreted
his remarks as an endorsement of the initiative to form an
opposition alliance, but he said only that he would organize a
serious discussion within his party of these proposals, which have
dominated politics here in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, he has stressed the legal, ideological and
practical obstacles to uniting the opposition behind a single
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the proposal for an opposition alliance
appeared to be, at least in part, an attempt by Fox's rivals to
undercut his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Mexico City's leftist mayor, who is a
likely presidential candidate himself but is slumping in the polls,
has endorsed the proposals and suggested that Fox should slow his
campaign to negotiate rules that could govern the opposition
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action's
presidential candidate in 1994, who is perhaps Fox's greatest rival
within the party, floated a new idea, urging opposition parties to
unite around an alliance candidate with no ties to any of the major
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Fox called Fernandez's proposal ``a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diego is in the habit of saying strange things to capture the
media's attention,'' Fox said on Saturday.

CAMBODIA PLANS TRIAL FOR JAILED KHMER ROUGE LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating to eliminate art advisory. No other changes.)   (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cambodian officials said Sunday they will conduct a trial in
Phnom Penh for Ta Mok, the last fugitive Khmer Rouge leader, who
was captured on Saturday. Their statements raised further doubts
about their commitment to produce other Khmer Rouge leaders for an
international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, who is believed to be about 72, led the dwindling rebel
force after its former leader, Pol Pot, was purged in 1997. He
remained on the run even after other fugitive leaders surrendered
to the government, along with virtually all their fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Ta Mok had few friends, and a number of political
analysts were predicting that the Cambodian government would seek
to make him a scapegoat for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge. The
brutal communist movement was responsible for the deaths of more
than a million people when it held power from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure we will try him in Cambodia,'' said Om Yentieng, a
top adviser to Prime Minister Hun Sen. ``We have everything here,
why should we try him abroad?''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has been much more ambiguous about the fate of other
former Khmer Rouge leaders _ notably two top officials who defected
last December, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea. He has warned that a
trial could endanger an ill-defined process that he calls
``national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their surrender, Khieu Samphan and Muon Chea have been
allowed to live freely in a remote enclave populated by former
rebels and guarded by former Khmer Rouge fighters. They have urged
the world to ``let bygones be bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is prosecuted, Ta Mok would be the first Khmer Rouge
leader to appear in court. Immediately after their ouster from
power, Pol Pot and his Foreign Minister, Ieng Sary, were tried and
convicted in absentia by a newly installed Cambodian government in
a proceeding that is not generally recognized as having been valid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Sunday that Ta Mok was being held in shackles in
a prison in downtown Phnom Penh, almost within sight of Tuol Sleng,
the former prison and torture house where at least 14,000 people
were sent to their deaths by the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   A team of lawyers has recommended to the United Nations that 20
to 30 former leaders of the Khmer Rouge be tried in an
international court. The lawyers said Cambodia's judicial system is
not adequate to handle such a complex and politically volatile
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director of the New York-based group
Human Rights Watch, said it would be unlikely that Hun Sen's
government could defuse pressure for an international tribunal by
putting Ta Mok on trial at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that even by having some kind of show trial in
Cambodia, pressure for an international tribunal is going to go
away,'' she said. ``I think things have already gone too far. In
fact, any attempt to try Ta Mok in Cambodia could provide more
momentum for having an international tribunal simply because it
will focus attention on all the problems of holding a trial inside
Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still in tatters 20 years after the ouster of the Khmer Rouge by
a Vietnamese invasion, Cambodia's legal system is primitive,
unschooled and riven with graft and political influence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cambodian researchers who have been compiling
evidence against leading Khmer Rouge figures say that despite Ta
Mok's widespread reputation for brutality, the documentary evidence
that he participated in the crimes of the Khmer Rouge is slim.
</P>
<P>
   A jungle fighter since his youth, Ta Mok was a resistance
soldier against the French colonial government in the 1940s. There
is some uncertainty about his given name, but historians say he was
born Ek Chhoen. Well before old age, he was using the revolutionary
alias that includes the honorific ``Ta,'' meaning ``grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a regional commander in the Khmer Rouge's fight for power
in the 1960s and 1970s _ known for his brutality even against
fellow revolutionaries with whom he disagreed. After the movement
came to power, he was a member of the nine-member Standing
Committee that ruled the country under Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
   He led what amounted to a coup within the Khmer Rouge in June
1997, ousting Pol Pot from leadership of what had again become a
guerrilla movement and engineering a show trial and house arrest
for the former leader.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, he had close relations with military commanders
just across Cambodia's northern border in Thailand and is widely
believed to have become a millionaire through cross-border business
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in prison in Phnom Penh, a Cambodian official said, ``He is
looking very tired, very frail and, of course, he is looking sad
that he has been arrested.''

<P>
   Paul Scott walked up to a display of digital cameras inside the
Wiz consumer electronics store in Carle Place, N.Y., last Thursday
evening with a single purpose: purchasing a gift for his wife's
50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott peered inside the gleaming display case, a slightly
perplexed look on his face, trying to decide which of the more than
a dozen models of digital cameras he would buy. He quickly accepted
help when a salesman, David Levine, questioned him whom the camera
was for and how it would be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a little direction, I wouldn't know the first thing;
I'm a total impulse shopper,'' Scott conceded after paying $800 for
a Sony Mavica model, which stores photos on a 3.5-inch computer
floppy disk, instead of one of the models using an even smaller,
oblong-shaped memory card. ``After looking at all the bells and
whistles,'' he said, newly confident, ``I opted for the best one.''
</P>
<P>
   But the flush of victory was short-lived. Scott is already
dreading his next planned consumer electronics foray: stalking the
large-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming,'' he said, anticipating the task of hacking
through the features-and-options jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he seemed more concerned about choosing which one to buy
than the likelihood that he will pay $1,500 or more, once he
decides.
</P>
<P>
   And Scott hardly seems to be a unique consumer. Buoyed by strong
holiday sales of large-screen television sets, videocassette
recorders and Sony Playstation video games, and signs pointing to
strong first-quarter sales, the makers and sellers of consumer
electronics products are predicting that 1999 could be the
industry's best year ever. Rather than scaring off consumers, they
are counting on a dazzling _ skeptics might say dizzying _ array of
new and enhanced products to stimulate sales.
</P>
<P>
   The new products include digital television sets with 60-inch
screens and promises of sharper pictures, better sound and new
features like embedded program guides. Add an outdoor surveillance
camera and a set-top box, and a TV can let a person see who's
knocking at the front door without ever leaving the Barcalounger.
And enhanced versions of other electronic products, like
wireless-messaging Palm Pilots and recordable compact disk players,
are expected to keep shoppers pouring out cash to stay on the crest
of the digital product improvement wave.
</P>
<P>
   After declining in 1991, sales of consumer electronics have
since been growing at an average of 3 percent to 5 percent a year,
according to the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association,
the industry's main trade group. And this year, the association
expects sales to reach almost $80 billion _ an increase of more
than 6 percent and up from a record $75 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In discretionary-spending terms, Americans now shell out more on
consumer electronics each year than on furniture, jewelry,
household appliances or sporting goods. The rise in sales is
attributed in part to what the trend watcher Faith Popcorn has
called the ``cocooning'' and ``burrowing'' stay-at-home habits of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers come through to meet the industry's optimistic
forecast, of course, depends on where householders draw the line.
It's one thing to pay $350 to $500 for a 27-inch television set for
the children's room to keep up with the burrowing Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   But with high-definition television programs still scarce on the
airwaves, are consumers really ready to hand over $800 to $1,500
for a set-top box that will translate digital signals into enhanced
pictures on their conventional TV's _ or pay up to $12,000 for a
completely new HDTV set?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Terry Webb, a mother of two in Virginia Beach,
Va. ``I know someone who bought a video disk player, and they paid
a lot of money for it. I wouldn't buy any new product in the first
year that it's out. It's too expensive and you want to make certain
they've gotten all the kinks out first.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers like Mrs. Webb could prove the industry's toughest
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we see, consumers haven't figured out why they need
to own any of this stuff,'' said Nick Donatiello, president and
chief executive of Odyssey, a San Francisco-based market research
firm. And for retailers and manufacturers alike, ringing up high
volumes of sales will be the key to profitability because of the
tight profit margins on all but the biggest-ticket products.
</P>
<P>
   Donatiello said that so far interest in some of the other newer
products, like digital video disk players for watching movies, had
been limited. Still, industry executives are excited because sales
of DVD players, introduced in 1997, topped one million units last
year, rising to that level quicker than sales of the industry's
last entirely new product _ audio compact disk players, which were
introduced in the early 80s.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of movies on DVD is growing, with retailers
like Best Buy, Borders and Blockbuster now carrying many of the
2,800 titles available. And while Hollywood is moving quicker to
make new releases available in the DVD format when they come out on
videocassette, copy-protection issues are keeping some studios from
offering some of the hottest titles on disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the digital video disk player is going to represent a
sea change in the way consumers watch television at home,''
Donatiello said. ``But not this year, and not next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even industry leaders acknowledge that the newest, high-priced
products may be a tough sell. One reason is that while
manufacturers are pushing HDTV, there are few broadcast programs
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first two to three years, it's going to be the early
adopters who are going to be customers'' for HDTV, David Arland, a
spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics, the nation's
top-selling television set maker, acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry officials bring a World's Fair optimism to the
issue, reasoning that curiosity about the newfangled could help
stimulate sales of the older-fangled products.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going into retail outlets to see what the
excitement is about,'' said Jeff Joseph, a spokesman for the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Association. ``They are not
walking out with a new digital television. but they may walk out
with a new VCR or a television.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 1998's strong sales were fueled by purchases of items
like large-screen conventional television sets, videocassette
recorders and video games _ and in many cases, as the second or
third TV set, VCR or game console in the household.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the number of American households owning three or
more television sets reached 49 percent, according to Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   The typical supply-and-demand curves for new types of consumer
electronics products would indicate that sales volume will pick up
as prices decline. And past patterns indicate that as prices fall,
the products themselves will become more functional.
</P>
<P>
   Digital video disk players, for example, had a price tag of
about $1,000 when they first reached the market in 1997. Since
then, prices on some models have dropped below $300, even with
several video disk movies thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, $100 can fetch a VCR with many more features
than the models costing more than $1,000 when the machines first
came on the market in the late 70s. Even the compact disk player
continues to evolve; this year's portable models offer improvements
in the anti-skip features that are popular with joggers and
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history also factors into the industry's current
optimism. Repeatedly in the last 20 years, new types of consumer
electronics have caught on much faster than analysts expected. When
compact disk players were introduced in 1983, for instance, many
market forecasts called for a player to be found in only one in 10
homes within a decade. At this point, 54 percent of households own
them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And in 1984, when the nascent cellular telephone industry was
lobbying for radio airwave space, advocates said that by 1995 more
than 900,000 people would own the devices. ``They were off by about
17 million,'' remarked Richard F. Doherty, director of research at
the Envisioneering Group, a market research firm in Seaford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Video games are the fastest-growing category of consumer
electronics, with sales rising 22 percent, to $6.3 billion last
year. And these, too, are on the verge of a major product overhaul
_ even if the first of the new devices, the Dreamcast from Sega, is
not expected to reach the market until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of game machines use chips that process
information in 64-bit chunks. But the Sega Dreamcast, which is
already available in Japan, will have a 128-bit chip and give
players access to the Internet for group play on line _ a
capability that has so far been limited to PC games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sony announced plans for release early next year of a
128-bit version of its Playstation, which may also play CDs and DVD
movies. Nintendo's 128-bit upgrade is not expected before 2001.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the consumer electronics bazaar may be offering
bewildering new wonders. And consumers may be forced to become
familiar with computer terms like convergence and networking,
whether they want to or not.
</P>
<P>
   Working with chip makers like Intel and computer companies like
Sun Microsystems, consumer electronics makers including Sony,
Toshiba, Thomson, Sharp, Panasonic and Philips are developing
consumer products that could be joined in home networks.
</P>
<P>
   And new alliances between such companies as Bell Atlantic and
IBM are paving the way for home appliances like microwaves and
heating systems to link with computers, VCR' and home security
systems for remote access via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, Scott _ probably not this year. Such
consumer-electronics convergence is ``a trend that's just taking
shape,'' said Jim Hirschberg, director of Intelect ASW, a market
research firm. ``Unless you're Bill Gates,'' he said, ``it's a
little bit down the road.''

   LOS ANGELES _ One other piece of business was settled Sunday:
Frozena Jerro had the interim label removed. She is now Cal State
Northridge's head women's basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made by interim athletic director San
Jankovich and outgoing President Blenda Wilson, came moments after
the team learned it would play at Colorado State in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich said he and Wilson met Saturday night after Northridge
won the Big Sky Conference tournamentand decided it should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro and the team learned about it at the moment of the
announcement. As a result, guard Edniesha Curry, who had hinted she
might leave Northridge if Jerro weren't named head coach, said she
will stay for her remaining two seasons.

STANLEY KUBRICK, 70, SAVAGELY WITTY FILM DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also KUBRICK-FILMS)  
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick, the famously reclusive director of such classic
films as ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``A
Clockwork Orange,'' died Sunday at his home in England, his family
said. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The police were summoned to Kubrick's rural home in
Hertfordshire, north of London, Sunday afternoon, and he was
pronounced dead. ``There are no suspicious circumstances,'' a
police spokesman said. Kubrick's family announced his death and
said there would be no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few American directors who had the prestige to make
big-budget movies while working outside the Hollywood mainstream,
Kubrick directed coldly brilliant films that explored humanity's
baser instincts with great visual flair and often savage wit.
Although those films won eight Academy Awards, none were for best
director.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because his subjects were often dark. The comic
satire ``Dr. Strangelove,'' made at the height of the Cold War,
portrayed the military as a collection of incompetent, jingoistic
yahoos itching for an chance to unleash nuclear devastation. The
film was a harsher and much funnier version of the same vision of
military pathology and hypocrisy found in ``Paths of Glory,'' the
movie that brought him to prominence in 1957, and that was
reiterated 30 years later in ``Full Metal Jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's sarcasm and ironic humor flared memorably in ``Dr.
Strangelove'' in the juxtaposition of Vera Lynn singing ``We'll
Meet Again'' against images of nuclear catastrophe. It was also
evident in ``The Blue Danube Waltz'' accompanying a space-docking
sequence in ``2001'' and in a scene of Malcolm McDowell jauntily
crowing ``Singin' in the Rain'' while delivering a brutal beating
in ``A Clockwork Orange.'' That film's savagery was so pointed that
some critics complained that the movie glorified violence.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick withdrew the film from distribution in Britain after it
was said to have inspired copycat crimes. But if Kubrick's
misanthropy prompted some critics to accuse him of coldness and
inhumanity, others saw his pessimism as an uncompromisingly
Swiftian vision of human absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's chilly outlook coincided with his reputation for being
an extreme perfectionist who insisted on control over every aspect
of his films, from casting and screenwriting to editing, lighting
and music. It often took him many months and sometimes years to
complete a film. He was known to film up to 100 takes of a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly reclusive, he announced in 1974 that he was
settling permanently in England. Refusing to give interviews, he
withdrew so completely that an Englishman impersonated him for
several months before being discovered.

   Stanley Kubrick was born on July 26, 1928, in the Bronx, N.Y. As
a child he was encouraged by his father, a doctor, to take up still
photography, and when he was 17 he was hired as a staff
photographer by Look magazine, which had been impressed by a
picture he had snapped the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt
died. While working at Look, he attended film screenings at the
Museum of Modern Art and later said that seeing so many bad films
gave him the courage to make a movie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 he quit his job at Look and set out to make his first
film, ``Day of the Fight,'' a 16-minute documentary, which he sold
to RKO-Pathe. He produced another documentary short for RKO before
making his feature debut in 1953 with ``Fear and Desire,'' a
low-budget film that was financed with family money, and that he
wrote, directed, photographed and edited.
</P>
<P>
   After making a second feature, ``Killer's Kiss,'' he formed a
production company in 1954 with a producer, James B. Harris, and
made ``The Killing,'' a drama about a racetrack heist starring
Sterling Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's fourth full-length film, ``Paths of Glory,''
established him as one of the most promising postwar American
filmmakers. The World War I drama, starring Kirk Douglas, was a
devastating indictment of military duplicity that still stands as
one of the most powerful of all antiwar movies. He made ``The
Killing'' and ``Paths of Glory'' for a percentage of the profits,
and both received critical acclaim while faring indifferently at
the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1959, Kubrick was invited to replace Anthony
Mann, the director of the high-budget Roman epic ``Spartacus,''
which starred Douglas as the leader of a slave rebellion against
the Roman state. The film, released in 1960, was noticeably more
intelligent than most Roman spectacles of the era and was an
enormous box-office success.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Kubrick moved to England, where he hoped to
maintain greater creative control of his films than he could in
Hollywood. But he soon returned to the United States to scout
locations for ``Lolita,'' an adaptation of the Vladimir Nabokov
novel in which James Mason played Humbert Humbert, the middle-aged
lover of the pubescent Lolita (Sue Lyon).
</P>
<P>
   The director's taste for the controversial and bizarre sharpened
with the nightmarish comic satire ``Dr. Strangelove'' (subtitled
``How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb''), which
imagined nuclear Armageddon as a macabre joke. More than any other
film ``Dr. Strangelove'' established Kubrick's reputation for
coldness.
</P>
<P>
   The successes of ``Spartacus,'' ``Lolita'' and ``Dr.
Strangelove'' gave Kubrick the rare freedom to choose his subjects
and to control his projects. And for the next several years, he
worked on the science fiction epic ``2001'' (1968), which he wrote
with Arthur C. Clarke. In its visual grandeur and dazzling special
effects ``2001'' paved the way for George Lucas' ``Star Wars''
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   After the spaced-out fantasies of ``2001,'' in which the hero is
reborn as an angelic child, Kubrick's pessimism reared up savagely
in his adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel ``A Clockwork
Orange.'' The work was voted the year's best in 1971 by the New
York Film Critics Circle, which also named Kubrick best director.
The film paints a portrait of Alex (McDowell), a violent, homicidal
thug who is sadistically brainwashed into placidity by the state,
and has no sympathetic characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``2001'' and ``A Clockwork Orange'' were
the high-water marks in a career that stumbled with ``Barry
Lyndon'' (1975), a visually stunning but static film based on a
Thackeray novel in which the director took enormous pains to evoke
a lighting and imagery that would recreate an authentic
18th-century ambiance. The costly movie took 300 shooting days to
complete and fared only modestly at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later came ``The Shining,'' an icy Gothic fable based
on a Stephen King novel in which a writer (Jack Nicholson) holes up
with his family in a haunted Colorado hotel and goes mad, turning
into a homicidal maniac. Kubrick's next film, ``Full Metal Jacket''
(1987), adapted from Gustav Hasford's novel ``The Short-Timers,''
was a grim near-horror movie about the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick was married four times. His marriages to Toba Metz in
1948, Ruth Sobtka in 1954 and Suzanne Harlan (with whom he had
three daughters) in 1958 ended in divorce. He is survived by his
fourth wife, Christiane, and his daughters Katharine, Anya and
Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick had recently finished editing his final film, ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' a psychosexual thriller based on Arthur Schnitzler's
``Traumnovelle'' (``Dream Novel'') and starring Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman as psychiatrists. Filmed in Britain in an atmosphere
of almost military secrecy, it took 15 months to shoot. The film is
to be released on July 16.

   WASHINGTON _ Some doctors and hospitals have been forcing poor
women to pay hundreds of dollars in cash for a popular procedure to
relieve pain in childbirth, federal officials say, and the
government has ordered hospitals to stop the practice immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says that pregnant Medicaid patients may not be
charged for prenatal care, delivery or other medical services that
relate to pregnancy. Medicaid reimburses hospitals and doctors for
such services, but doctors say the payments for pain treatment are
grossly inadequate, sometimes only 10 percent or 20 percent of what
private insurance companies pay.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent recently to state health officials, Sally
Richardson, the national director of the Medicaid program, said she
had received reports that health-care providers were improperly
requiring patients to pay cash for services covered by Medicaid,
which pays the bills for more than one-third of all births in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they do not know how widespread the
problem is, but doctors and health-policy experts say they have
heard complaints from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, Ms. Richardson said, anesthesiologists have
insisted that Medicaid patients pay in advance, with their own
money, for the widely used form of anesthesia, known as the
epidural block.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one instance,'' Ms. Richardson said, ``the obstetrician
ordered the epidural in advance, but when the woman was in active
labor, she was refused this service for lack of prepayment. Even
though she tried to pay by check, credit card and a Western Union
money telegram, the doctor refused anything but cash.''
</P>
<P>
   With somewhat more passion than midlevel federal officials
usually express, Ms. Richardson said, ``Treatment of a Medicaid
patient in this manner is not just a concern, it is alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   She told state Medicaid directors to make sure that hospitals
understood their obligations to provide all medically necessary
services, including anesthesia, to Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson did not name any of the doctors who demanded
cash, nor did she name any hospital. But Medicaid patients said
last year that they had been asked to pay cash for epidural
injections at a dozen hospitals in the Los Angeles area, and
Florida officials say they have received similar complaints.
Patients who could not pay were, in many cases, offered less
effective and less expensive forms of pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in the newsletter of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists quoted doctors who believe they are grossly
underpaid by Medicaid. ``Poor people can't expect to drive a
Rolls-Royce or to eat at a fine French restaurant, so why should
they expect to receive the Cadillac of analgesics for free?'' one
doctor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Birnbach, director of obstetric anesthesiology at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, said such comments
came from ``a vocal minority of anesthesiologists'' and were
contrary to the society's official position, which holds that women
in labor should not be denied pain relief for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Health Services found that
anesthesiologists at one hospital, Northridge Hospital Medical
Center, had required Medicaid patients to pay $400 in cash for
epidural pain relief in labor and delivery, and it said the
hospital had helped collect the money.
</P>
<P>
   The state demanded that Northridge refund the money to patients,
and Ken August, a spokesman for the California Department of Health
Services, said 114 women had received such refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Women said it was humiliating to dispatch their husbands to
automated teller machines, friends and neighbors to get cash.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Ozzie Chavez, said she thought the nurse was joking
when she asked for $400 in cash just hours before Mrs. Chavez gave
birth at Northridge in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a wimp when it comes to pain,'' Mrs. Chavez said in an
interview. ``But it was a very painful delivery. The
anesthesiologist wouldn't even come into the room until she got her
money. I offered her a credit card and a check, but she wouldn't
accept it. I was lying there having contractions, and they wouldn't
give me an epidural. I felt like an animal. It was degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chavez's sister called relatives in England, who wired the
money to Los Angeles. ``By the time the money arrived, I had had
the baby,'' Mrs. Chavez said. Wendell Mobley, a spokesman for
Northridge, said the hospital had apologized to Mrs. Chavez. Mobley
refused to discuss the hospital practices in detail, because of
pending lawsuits, including one by Mrs. Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Neeld Jr., president of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists, said, ``It's unethical to withhold services
because of reimbursement. Anesthesiologists share with all
physicians the responsibility to provide care for patients
irrespective of their ability to pay for their care.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbach agreed. While Medicaid payments are far too low, he
said, ``we should not practice in a way that will allow us to be
accused of extorting money'' from patients, and ``we should not
fight the battle of unfair reimbursement for epidurals at the
patient's bedside.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The epidural injection blocks pain in the lower part of the
body, but the mother generally remains wide awake.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and the
states, and states set reimbursement levels. Some states have
increased payments for obstetricians in recent years, but
reimbursement for anesthesiologists has lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by the American Society of Anesthesiologists
found that New York, for example, typically paid $55 to $105 for
the epidural block, and Connecticut paid $64, while insurance
companies often paid more than $800 in those states.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the society said, Medicaid reimbursement averaged
$60, about one-tenth of the amounts typically paid by insurance
companies. In California, Medicaid payments ranged from $98 to
$170, while private insurers often paid more than $400.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, including New York and California,
anesthesiologists have lobbied state legislators and Medicaid
officials to increase the payments for pain-relief services in
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bodkin, executive director of the Florida Society of
Anesthesiologists, said, ``The Medicaid reimbursement rates are so
dreadfully low _ the equivalent of $20 an hour for someone with 12
years of professional training _ that they discourage
anesthesiologists from taking Medicaid patients, who deserve the
same quality care as other patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George
Washington University, said doctors, nursing homes and other
health-care providers had often tried to get Medicaid patients to
pay more than the amounts paid by Medicaid. But Medicaid officials
said it was particularly inappropriate to require such payments by
women in labor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bullen, the Medicaid director in Massachusetts, who is
chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors,
said, ``This shouldn't be happening,'' and he added, ``You cannot
require cost sharing of any kind as a condition of services being
rendered to pregnant Medicaid patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Crayton, the Medicaid director in Florida, said his agency
had received reports similar to those in California.
``Anesthesiologists told Medicaid patients they did not accept
Medicaid payments for epidurals and required payment in advance for
the service at labor and delivery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wallace-Brodeur, the Medicaid director in Vermont, said
that even if anesthesiologists had valid concerns about inadequate
reimbursement, ``they shouldn't take it out on the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to state officials, Ms. Richardson said: ``Under
federal Medicaid law, deductions, cost sharing or similar charges
are not permitted for Medicaid services furnished to pregnant
women. Thus, a participating physician's demand for these
additional payments would be in violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesiologists say that Medicaid patients sometimes agree to
pay them directly for their services during labor and delivery,
just as private patients would. But, Ms. Richardson said,
regardless of the preferences of any particular doctor, the
hospital has a duty to ensure that pregnant Medicaid patients can
obtain services ``without the imposition of deductibles, cost
sharing or similar charges.''

COMMENTARY: AMERICAN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Throughout the 1996 Clinton campaign for president,
China's agents of influence had the run of the White House as they
raised millions for the Clinton campaign. Chinese military
intelligence officials were waved in without clearance. U.S.
executives contributed megabucks as they lobbied for easier
approval of sales of sensitive technology to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this _ in April of 1996 _ a Department of Energy
official informed President Clinton's deputy national security
adviser, Samuel Berger, (1) that China had probably stolen our
secrets of making warheads small enough to enable long-range
missiles to pack multiple nuclear punches, and (2) that the
suspected spy was still at work in the Los Alamos laboratory in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who sat in on most of the political meetings with
Clinton's Asian fund-raisers, did nothing. The internal security
division of the Department of Justice apparently did not ask a
court for wiretap authority under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act. At Reno Justice, investigating any Chinese
penetration is a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   Over one year later, after news stories and columns about
Clinton's ``Asian connection'' had stimulated law enforcement
officials and a Senate committee to bestir themselves, FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet went
to the office of Energy Secretary Federico Pena. ``Louis and George
read him the riot act,'' a meeting participant tells me, ``about
lax security at Los Alamos.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing happened for a year and a half. Sen. Fred Thompson's
hearings on the Asian connection were politicized and truncated by
John Glenn and Tom Daschle. Not until late 1998, when a bipartisan
House select committee under co-chairmen Chris Cox and Norman Dicks
began asking questions about Chinese espionage, did a new energy
secretary begin to lock the barn door.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the House select committee has been negotiating with
the Clinton Secrecy Brigade to declassify most of its 700-page
report. The White House hopes to delay clearance until the select
committee goes out of business in April, when criticism of the
espionage defeat and its Clinton cover-up could be diffused and
buried.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger did not reckon with the journalistic enterprise of
The New York Times' James Risen and Jeff Gerth. Their story on
Saturday was headlined ``China Stole Nuclear Secrets for Bombs''
and subheaded ``Espionage Case at New Mexico Lab Is Said to Be
Minimized by the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   They show how the theft of our nuclear secrets enabled China to
leap a generation ahead with warheads that can be launched from
under water. The reporters quote Paul Redmond, the CIA's former
counterintelligence chief who caught the Soviet spy Aldrich Ames,
assessing the impact on our defenses of this Chinese espionage:
``This was far more damaging to the national security than Aldrich
Ames.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger has a unique geopolitical Weltanschauung: Whatever elects
Bill Clinton and protects him from criticism is good for our
national security. Accordingly, his spin control will be: The
initial breach happened in the 80s, so blame Reagan, not us.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, goes the White House line, when a Berger flunky asked
for a quickie CIA ``alternative analysis'' of the suspicions of the
energy department's Notra Trulock, that whistleblower's warning was
derogated as merely ``a worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet denied, but likely to be unless witnesses were present,
is The Times' account that Trulock ``was ordered last year by
senior officials not to tell Congress about his findings because
critics might use them to attack the administration's China
policies, officials said.'' For spilling the beans, Trulock was
demoted.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're getting to the nub of it. Yanked to a complete
turnabout on trade policy with China by the Riady family and other
heavy campaign contributors in the satellite and computer
businesses, Clinton did not want Congress _ empowered by law with
oversight of intelligence _ to know what the FBI and CIA and DOE
suspected about China's spy in Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Although aware of the dangerous spying, Clinton still insisted
that regulation of the transfer of sensitive technology be
controlled by his sell-'em-anything commerce department.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered for China. Will Congress now protect the interests
of the United States?

 &HT;    Lewis, delegation of lawmakers march in Alabama to celebrate
spirit of civil rights movement
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ They crossed their arms across their chests and
held each other's hands, black hand on white, white hand on brown.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen members of Congress from across the country came to
this town along the banks of the Alabama River to understand the
struggle African-Americans endured to gain the right to vote and to
remove the laws segregating blacks from whites.
</P>
<P>
   It was here 34 years ago that Alabama state troopers clobbered
and left for dead one of their fellow congressmen _ Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.) _ for leading 600 people across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to
protest the rules that kept blacks from voting.
</P>
<P>
   Returning as a congressman, Lewis is hoping that the
re-enactment of the march will ignite a dialogue on race relations
in America and tear down the social barriers that remain more than
three decades after Congress passed the Voters' Rights Act and the
Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must still move to build bridges, bridges of
understanding,'' Lewis said. ``We have come a great distance, but
we still have a distance to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan congressional delegation retraced Lewis'
footsteps on March 7, 1965, walking from Brown Chapel AME down
Martin Luther King Boulevard and past the low slung brick buildings
lining downtown. As they walked, they began singing, ``God is on
our side today,'' their voices getting louder with each step.
</P>
<P>
   Just ahead, children carried signs that said ``Wake Up America''
and ``Justice for all'' and sang ``no one is going turn us
around,'' as they walked to the bridge where white troopers once
attacked Lewis and his fellow marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of that march was clear to Marquita Harris, 15, and
her friend Joyce Watts, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who think that the white people are bigger and the
black people are smaller are wrong,'' said Harris, a Selma
resident. ``Everyone should be treated equal. I think all the
blacks and whites should be together.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the march only drew a few whites despite town officials
declaring Selma the ``most integrated city in America.'' Both Watts
and Harris said it made them sad that their white friends did not
show. ``We should all be here together,'' said Watts.
</P>
<P>
   It is these young people who Lewis and the congressional group
want to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to walk this bridge for the children and the
unsung heros,'' Lewis said. ``We are going to redeem the soul of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time, he said, to lay down the burden of race: ``When we
go back to Washington I hope we can do what we can to create one
home, the American House.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, sponsored by the Faith &AMP; Politics
Institute, a nonprofit interfaith group based in Washington, D.C.,
the lawmakers toured monuments of the civil rights movement and
heard live testimonials from those who fought for equality.
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, they met the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who was a
target of white segregationists. His church and home were bombed
and he was chain-whipped for trying to enroll his daughter in an
all-white school.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Shuttlesworth walked through the Kelly Ingram Park,
where protestors once were sprayed by the Birmingham police with
fire hoses that were so strong they could remove bark from trees 80
feet away. Standing in front of a sculpture of a boy being attacked
by a white police officer, gospel singer Bettie Fikes began to
sing, ``I've been in the storm so long,'' a song that her
grandmother, a slave, had passed on to her.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Capitol in Montgomery, the delegation bowed
their heads and prayed in former church of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power structure of Alabama is up there,'' said Lewis,
pointing to the Capitol. ``The power of the human spirit is here in
this church.''
</P>
<P>
   In Selma, they ate dinner with Mayor Joe Smitherman, the same
mayor who stood against Lewis 34 years ago. Once a segregationist,
Smitherman now says he ``was on the wrong side.''
</P>
<P>
   At the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, the
group ate breakfast with Coretta Scott King and Martin Luther King
III, King's widow and son, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have caught the spirit, the sense of family and
community'' said Scott King. ``There is nothing greater than the
power of the spirit. .. we can now begin the transformation in
Congress which is so desperately needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio) said he intended take his experience
back to his district in the hopes of improving race relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a country that is still in need of healing,'' Sawyer
said. ``We still struggle over divisions. And the ability to see
people for what they really are is the first step to repair the
divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's division of the Atlanta-based Southern Christian
Leadership Conference was also in Selma, marking the 13th year they
have honored the the march's anniversary and the death of Viola
Gregg Liuzzo.
</P>
<P>
   Liuzzo had watched the state troopers beat Lewis and the other
marchers on television. It so enraged her that she left her five
children and drove to Selma to help the movement.
</P>
<P>
   After driving carloads of blacks between Selma and Montgomery,
she was shot and killed by Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Lowery, founder of the 20-year-old SCLC/WOMEN, said the
group came to Selma to make sure that ``no one ever forgets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never forget the struggles and the sacrifices made,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the trip was a sad reminder of what they did not do
earlier. Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.) said he grew up in the South, but
was not involved in the civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt like I was better than my black brothers and
sisters, that was just the way it was,'' Dickey said. ``My purpose
now is to bring about racial harmony and understanding. We have an
opportunity to bring change. That is my duty.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is much change that needs to occur, say the veterans
of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Fikes, the gospel singer who had marched with Lewis, said she is
saddened that the spirit of the movement has not caught on with the
younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many dreams have been deferred?'' Fikes asked. ``Somewhere
along the line we lost the main ingredient: unity.''
</P>
<P>
   She is dismayed at the black on black violence that terrorizes
inner city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Recently her son said to her, ``I get it now. In the 1960s they
(whites) sicked the dogs on us. Now we sick the dogs on each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, said Fikes, is the reason why the struggle is far from
over.

A SPIRAL SOLUTION FOR THE PATENT OFFICE'S LIBRARIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Pa., Texas, Ky.)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of U.S. patents issued last year reached an all-time
high, jumping 31.5 percent from 1997, according to statistics
recently released by the Patent Office.
</P>
<P>
   This crush of new patents simply intensifies what has long been
a headache for the agency: trying to figure out where to store
paper copies of all those new patents.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Patent Office sprawls across 1.4 million square
feet in 18 buildings in Crystal City, Va. This spring, a government
panel is expected to make a final decision about whether to
renovate the existing quarters or move into a new campus. Although
there has long been talk of making the Patent Office a paperless
agency, paper copies are expected to be around for at least another
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Bromer, a patent agent based in Marietta, Pa., thinks he
has come up with a way to simplify the complicated logistics of
adding millions of pages of patents each year to the Patent Office.
Of course, he has patented the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bromer has designed a spiral patent office. It is essentially
one long, skinny, curving building that coils loosely around
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear the word spiral they think of the Guggenheim
Museum,'' Bromer said. ``But that is really a conical-helical
shape,'' he said, noting that his spiral, rather than curving
upward, radiates outward on a single horizontal plane.
</P>
<P>
   Bromer said that the patent collection could be arranged in line
on a single, curving, continuous track that extends the length of
the building _ thus eliminating the need to reshelve to make space
for new patents, which the agency arranges according to a special
classification system.
</P>
<P>
   Once the track started to become full, the building could be
made bigger by simply adding on to the end of the spiral. ``The new
construction would always be on the outside, so no one would be
disrupted,'' Bromer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bromer had the Patent Office in mind when he designed
his building, he thinks it would work for any expanding library or
archive. He said the building could be several stories high, with
each floor having its own long, snaking shelf. He said different
parts of the spiral would be connected with walkways, so that one
wouldn't have to travel the entire length of the spiral to get from
the start of the collection to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Bromer received patent number 5,855,098. &QL;

Preventing Fires In Auto Crashes
</P>
<P>
   When Sandra Kerns was 13, she watched two men burn to death
after a car accident. ``It's a sound, sight, and smell you never
forget,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kerns, a housewife, and her husband, Joe, a retired
mechanic, who live in Edmonton, Ky, have invented a device intended
to prevent a fire from igniting once a car has crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the gas lines of most vehicles automatically
disconnect upon impact. ``But the main problem isn't the gas tank _
it's the fumes,'' Mrs. Kerns said. ``What you need to do is
eliminate any possibility of an electrical spark igniting the
fumes, That's why the first thing emergency workers do is
disconnect the battery when they get to the scene of an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Housed inside the Kernses' small plastic device is a chamber
filled with mercury or some other liquid that conducts electricity.
The device attaches to the battery cables and under normal
circumstances, the mercury conducts electricity through the cables.
</P>
<P>
   If the car rolls over, however, the mercury flows through a
series of one-way valves into some tubes on the top of the device.
Once the mercury has escaped, the battery cuts off because the
conductive material is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a front impact or a rear impact or a side impact, what
happens is there's a sliding block covering the hole that holds the
mercury,'' Mrs. Kerns said. ``On impact, an air canister triggers
the block to drop so the mercury drops into a bottom chamber'' _
thereby cutting off the battery connection.
</P>
<P>
   In either situation, the mercury also comes into contact with a
metal plate, and this action causes the alternator to shut off,
according to Mrs. Kerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes in contact with a metal-clad wall that also has
screws in it and has wires going to your alternator,'' she said.
``And that kills the alternator. You can start your car and remove
your battery and it will continue to run because your alternator is
running. So you want to kill both of them at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kernses contend that the device would cost about $100 to
manufacture and could be easily installed on existing or new cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Kernses received patent number 5,602,371. &QL;

Zinc Toothpicks To Fight Infection
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have shown that periodontal disease can
foreshadow or worsen other infections in the body. Edward J.
Petrus, a doctor in Austin, Texas, patented two things last week
that he says will keep gums healthier: zinc-coated toothpicks and
zinc-coated dental floss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zinc is antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral,'' Dr. Petrus
said. ``It also acts as an astringent. It reduces swelling and
bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Petrus said he was looking to license patents patents
5,875,799 and 5,875,798 to a company that would finance clinical
research on the floss and toothpicks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

   Cable Deregulation Raises Specter of Higher Rates
</P>
<P>
   Cable television, one of the last industries to have its prices
controlled by the government, is set to become almost completely
deregulated this month. But while the prospect of competition was
supposed to drive prices down, the opposite has happened. Cable
rates continue to rise, with many companies announcing increases
for this year averaging 5 percent, more than twice the projected
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 assumed the cable industry
would be facing far more competition from satellite broadcasters
and telephone companies. But that has not happened, raising deep
concerns that cable companies unshackled from price controls and
not threatened by competition will continue to impose big rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Online Payment System Developed
</P>
<P>
   A company that has developed an Internet system to allow
advertisers to pay for a computer user's attention plans to begin
permitting consumers to earn money online and use it to buy digital
content, including music files, articles, maps, software and other
information.

<P>
   Magazine Apologizes for Mailing
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand subscribers to Poz, a magazine for people who
are HIV positive, who had requested that their names not be rented
out to other companies became alarmed when they received a letter
last month from a company with information about a new HIV
treatment. The magazine's parent, Poz Publishing, said the mailing
was a mistake and apologized.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Listening for Rumors on the Web
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have long paid clipping services to monitor their
appearances in the conventional news media. But now a company
called Ewatch and its competitors have taken the practice online
and a step further. This new generation of monitors trolls for
rumor and innuendo in the back alleys of the Web, where unchecked
scuttlebutt can damage corporate reputations and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Red Alerts From Partisan Sites
</P>
<P>
   A year after the gossipy Web site run by Matt Drudge became a
bookmark in Washington computers, other, more partisan Web sites
are becoming early warning systems for the mainstream news media.
</P>
<P>
   Screens Go Dark in TV Dispute
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for DirecTV, the satellite television provider,
750,000 viewers have lost programming from Fox and CBS because of a
legal battle between broadcasters and the satellite television
industry over who can receive network signals.
</P>
<P>
   Turning Browsers Into Buyers
</P>
<P>
   Those who shop on the Internet abandon one-half to two-thirds of
the purchases they begin, industry executives and analysts say.
Some consumers are just trying out the online shopping experience.
Others abandon the process when confronted with big shipping
charges or with registration forms that ask for personal
information. Tired of not closing sales, e-commerce sites have
begun devising ways to convert browsers into buyers.
</P>
<P>
   New Devices for Internet Music
</P>
<P>

Creative Technology, the leading seller of audio circuitry for
personal computers, showed off a line of products that can retrieve
and play music from the Internet using the MP3 software format,
including a portable MP3 player that will cost less than $200,
roughly the same price as an MP3 player offered by Diamond
Multimedia.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZHANLONG, China _ Villagers here say they were not entirely
surprised when on the night of Aug. 7, 1997, public security
officers piled four farmers deemed troublemakers into a van, drove
them to an isolated rice field in front of a copse of trees and
riddled them with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were quickly cremated, and the policemen probably
assumed that the case was closed. After all, local residents say,
police harassment and even summary executions have for years been
an occasional fact of life in this rural town in the southeastern
province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   And villagers say they dare not complain, knowing that policemen
receive praise from above, and at times even $1,200 bonuses, for
such swift ``justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But China is changing, and in this case the four dead men's
cause did not disappear. Their relatives, all barely literate
farmers, waged a yearlong campaign for redress.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered Beijing lawyer agreed to represent the families,
pro bono, in a lawsuit against the police. And a reporter from
China's increasingly vigorous press helped expose a harrowing tale
of police brutality that local officials had kept under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``As ordinary Chinese we felt we had the legal right to have
this case heard,'' said Zheng Canming, the younger brother of one
of the dead men.
</P>
<P>
   Later in March, seven police officers are due to stand trial on
murder charges, in a case that casts a rare spotlight on widespread
abuses by China's local police _ as well as the fledgling efforts
to control them.
</P>
<P>
   Such abuses, from torture to ``extrajudicial killings,'' have
been attacked recently in human-rights reports and implicitly
criticized by top Beijing officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case shows a problem of law enforcement across the
country,'' said Gu Xianping, the lawyer. ``It is typical: The
farmers are victims and don't get protection from the law. We are
gradually improving our legal system, but I'm very concerned about
why the police thought they could get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   China's state-owned law journals and newspapers now often
publish hair-raising exposes of torture and other forms of police
brutality, although such stories rarely seep into the mainstream
press. But experts say it is significant that such a delicate
subject is raised publicly at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese officials are clearly getting more serious about
police and security abuses,'' said Scot Tanner, a professor at
Western Michigan University. ``They know it is a very serious
problem.'' Tanner has done extensive research on Chinese law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the government's legal publishing house came out
with a new series of books about legal abuses, with titles
including ``The Crime of Confession Obtained by Torture'' and ``The
Crime of Illegal Detention.''
</P>
<P>
   The books estimated that hundreds, if not thousands, of Chinese
were illegally detained each year and that 250 people were tortured
to death in police custody in 1993 and 1994. It was the first time
such figures had been publicly released and was an extraordinary
admission, even though experts said the true numbers were certainly
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Although Westerners tend to focus on more abstract rights like
freedom of speech, Chinese officials know that arbitrary harassment
and punishment by local public security officials are far more
gripping issues for ordinary people in this country and threaten to
undermine the government's authority.
</P>
<P>
   So, to help control abuses in its far-flung law-enforcement
system, the central government has recently allowed and even
encouraged press coverage of abuses and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains great ambivalence about the new openness,
Tanner said. On one hand it deters wayward police officers, but on
the other it fuels criticism by Western human-rights groups. And
the desire to provide more even-handed justice does not extend to
those who threaten communist rule, like democracy activists, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are moving to a two-track legal system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 miles from Beijing, on the freewheeling southern
coast of Guangdong province, Zhanlong and its neighboring villages
exude lawlessness. In these once-poor rice-growing towns, many
villagers have become prosperous in the last five years by
reselling fabric, cigarettes and liquor smuggled from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In an area where family-planning regulations allow at most two
children, many families have four or five. Drugs and prostitution
are growing problems. The narrow roads lined by pressed-clay and
tile homes are filled with a strange jumble of ancient tractors,
motorcycles and contraband Mercedes Benzes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlessness also reigns at the local Public Security Bureau,
villagers said, where officers are quick to fine, confiscate,
detain _ and sometimes physically punish _ with little provocation.
Taxi drivers from the nearby cities of Shantou and Shenzhen refuse
to enter places like Puning, the county seat that encompasses
Zhanlong, where they say the police stop taxis and hold licenses or
even cars if they feel the driver has no business in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is afraid of the police here _ everyone,'' said a
farmer-turned-cloth-salesman who gave his surname as Chen. ``We all
know of the killings. These kinds of incidents have happened a lot
here before. The police like to deal on the spot with people they
consider hoodlums.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most people in Zhanlong, the four men who were killed that
night in August 1997 were legally registered as farmers but in
reality made most of their money in small business _ though none
was very successful at it. All were between 20 and 35, had
grade-school education and were married with children. One, Zheng
Canyan, who was either 29 or 30 (his family is unsure when he was
born), had five children aged 6 months to 9 years when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the killings, the local government-owned
television station broadcast the official version of the night's
events: Four ``vicious thugs with guns'' had threatened a villager,
looted his home, and were shot dead after they escaped from
officers who had arrested them.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, the men's relatives felt something was
amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng Canming said he became suspicious the moment he nervously
went to the police station to report that his brother Zheng Canyan,
a homebody, had not returned to his house. The police sent him to
fetch his brother's photo. When he returned, they confirmed that
his brother had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock, crying and wailing,'' said Zheng, who agreed
to speak about the killings, but would not talk generally about the
police. ``He was one of the most simple, honest men in the village.
The police who had shot him couldn't even identify him, since he
didn't have a record.''
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Zheng immediately went to the county morgue, in Puning,
where he persuaded someone to let him see the body, which was about
to be cremated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for a cloth to clean him, since he was covered with
bullet holes and blood,'' he recalled. ``I spent some time there
trying to close the eyes _ one wouldn't go down. And I noticed all
the bullets had entered from the front, and I thought: `That's
strange. Why would it be this way if he was fleeing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The families ultimately pieced together a different story, which
was supported by an intensive investigation by the state-owned
Legal Daily, and later by provincial law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the killings, one of the four farmers, Chen
Guanfeng, had gone to another villager's house to demand money that
he said he was owed. The two argued, and the villager, who was
related to a former Zhanlong police chief, went to the Public
Security Bureau claiming that Chen had tried to extort money from
him at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy police chief immediately sent six officers to Chen's
small paper factory and arrested him as well as three other men,
all casual acquaintances who were there drinking tea. Witnesses
said the men had been led into a van with their hands bound with
belts and strips of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to a local farmer who lived near the field, who said
that night he heard sounds like firecrackers, then crying and then
more firecrackers and then more crying,'' Zheng said. ``How could
four men with their hands tied escape from six policemen with
guns?''
</P>
<P>
   Days after the killings, 200 friends and relatives descended on
the Puning prosecutor's office demanding an investigation, Zheng
said. Two weeks later, when that investigation concluded that the
police had acted lawfully, indignant families fanned out to
Guangzhou, the provincial capital, and to Beijing to present their
findings to officials.
</P>
<P>
   Later they contacted a reporter at Legal Daily and decided to
retain a lawyer as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always believed that the party and the government would
abide by the Chinese people,'' said Zheng. ``But at that point I'd
already spent a lot of time and money on fruitless visits to
Beijing. And life was so hard for my sister-in-law with five
children to feed. I felt we needed a top-class lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   He found Gu Xianping, who has a reputation as one of the best
lawyers in China and was originally from a rural area.
</P>
<P>
   Gu credits the families' persistence with turning their tragedy
into a test case. ``In the last 10 years there have been campaigns
to raise legal consciousness among ordinary Chinese, and so the
families came convinced that China was a country with the rule of
law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a yearlong investigation by Legal Daily ``broke
the case'' and pushed the Guangdong authorities to conduct their
own inquiry. On Sept. 10, 1998 _ more than a year after the
killings _ two deputy police chiefs and five policemen were
arrested. The Guangdong prosecutor's office concluded that one
deputy chief had ordered the killings while most of the officers
had taken part reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   The case, however extreme, clearly reflects systemic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In February, China Consumer Journal reported the case of Wang
Chonggao, a model worker and head of a local electricity-supply
bureau in Hubei province, who died after 29 hours of continuous
interrogation and extensive torture that included beatings around
the ears, painful handcuffing and more. The local prosecutor's
office had suspected him of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Chinese Lawyer recently reported on Zhao Yi, a
young engineer, who suffered brain injuries and a ruptured eardrum
after she endured four hours of beatings at the hands of police
interrogators in Liaoning province who suspected her of theft.
Although the police concluded that she was innocent, she sued. A
number of reporters attended the trial, but wrote that there had
been efforts in court to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhanlong trial, originally scheduled for early February, has
been ``postponed'' because of intense public interest, said Gu, who
is now fielding interview requests from the mainstream press.
``Before this, cases like this wouldn't have been reported,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking the $12,000 that each family could
receive under the state compensation law, Gu has filed a civil suit
demanding further damages for the victims' families. Zheng's widow
now supports her five children by selling sundries like toilet
paper and pens out of her mother-in-law's house, her brother-in-law
said, and is buoyed by the prospect of justice and money.
</P>
<P>
   But other villagers remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a court case, but I don't expect them to be
punished,'' said the cloth salesman, Chen. ``The police they are
bigwigs. We are not. It is hard for me to take the trial
seriously.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: AT&AMP;T'S EMBRACE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SIGNALS NEXT ERA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid last week's typically hectic flow of headlines about the
communications industry, perhaps the most significant news of all
got lost: Frank Ianna, president of the AT&AMP;T Corp.'s network unit,
announced that by the end of this year, the long-distance giant
wanted to stop buying traditional telephone switches for the core
of its network.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Ianna's pronouncement last Tuesday was not the
lapel-grabbing kind of news generated by a multibillion-dollar
takeover or the latest hot Internet stock. But it was a seminal
moment for the communications industry and in some ways for
everyone who uses a phone.
</P>
<P>
   As it halts decades of investing in the traditional gear that
makes up most of the global phone system, AT&AMP;T is retooling its
network around a new generation of technologies inspired partly by
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI Worldcom, the other long-distance giants, are
doing much the same thing. But as the biggest communications
company in the United States, AT&AMP;T wields a proportionately larger
influence in the market and with technology suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday's announcement was perhaps the definitive sign that
at least in the long-distance business, the aging and increasingly
crowded phone network would be rejuvenated with younger, more
efficient technologies.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, this evolution could lead to lower prices. And in
the future, as the new technologies expand from the core of the
network to homes and businesses, consumers could also benefit from
new sorts of features and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the functionality moves closer and closer to the customer,
the bottom line for the consumer is that clearly we will drive the
economics down,'' said Neil J. Grenfell, an engineering vice
president at Sprint. ``This can also help give the customer more
and more control and more and more integration.''
</P>
<P>
   This might mean, for instance, that a tourist or business
traveler who wanted to stay in touch could simply unplug the
handset from the home or office telephone and plug it into the base
of any other telephone. The network would recognize that the person
had moved around the block or across the country, and calls to the
original number would ring in the new location.
</P>
<P>
   Services like that are many years away and would require the
local phone companies to invest billions of dollars on top of the
current spending by long-distance carriers. And, of course, it
would require consumers to buy ``intelligent'' phones.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the new advanced networks being planned by AT&AMP;T and
others are new and advanced is that they change the way networks
behave at their most basic level.
</P>
<P>
   Since the invention of the telephone, almost every civilian
communications network has been based on the concept of circuits.
If a network is a multilane highway, then a system based on
circuits, known as a circuit-switched network, paints the lane
lines of that highway solid: each conversation has its own lane, or
circuit. If two people are on the phone with each other and neither
of them is speaking, they still use the entire circuit just as if
they are screaming. The standard voice circuit sends and receives
64,000 bits of information a second.
</P>
<P>
   The main advantages of circuit switching are that it is reliable
and relatively simple to carry out. The main disadvantage is that
it is extremely inefficient to keep an entire lane open for every
phone call, regardless of how much data _ in this case,
conversation _ it is carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative that is being embraced by AT&AMP;T and the others is
a sort of mass-transit alternative called packet switching. On a
packet highway, the lane lines are dashed. Rather than consuming at
entire lane, each conversation gets broken up into millions of
small pieces, or packets, that are then mixed up with other
conversations only to be reassembled into intelligible
communications at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The main advantage of packet switching, the technology used by
the Internet to move massive amounts of data around the globe, is
that it is extremely efficient. A conversation that takes up 64,000
bits a second on a circuit-switched network might take up only a
quarter of that, or 16,000 bits a second, on a packet-switched
system. That can allow carriers to lower their costs and,
potentially, the prices they charge consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that sorting out all those packets and routing
them to the right place requires ingenuity, especially when the
packets are carrying conversations. A few extra seconds when
loading a Web page may not mean much, but consumers expect their
phone calls to be perfect representations of what they are saying _
with no delays or distortion.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The means for making packet-based systems robust enough to carry
millions of phone calls has just emerged over the last year or so
from companies including Ascend Communications, which has agreed to
be acquired by Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems and others.
</P>
<P>
   Packet-based, however, does not necessarily mean the Internet
version, known as Internet protocol.The main technology that AT&AMP;T
and many other long-distance carriers are looking toward is called
asynchronous transfer mode.
</P>
<P>
   In the jargon of the communications industry, ATM uses ``cells''
rather than packets. That is because while the data packets
generated by Internet protocol vary in length, the data cells in an
ATM system are always the same size, generally 53 bytes. That
uniformity can be a powerful advantage because it allows ATM to
carry co-mingled voice, video and data traffic without sacrificing
much efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while Internet protocol often ships each packet of
information to its destination by a different path, ATM sets up
so-called virtual circuits, which help insure that a transmission
of Hamlet's soliloquy begins with ``To be'' instead of ``Be to'' or
``Eb ot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is basing its network of the future largely on ATM
switches made by NEC of Japan, though Sprint is also working
closely with Cisco. AT&AMP;T is using Ascend's ATM equipment. MCI
Worldcom has asked vendors to submit proposals for ATM switches but
has not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   One of the raging debates in the communications industry is
whether ATM is necessary at all or whether Internet protocol is
reliable enough to form the underlying network language instead.
For now, most of the big carriers are wary of Internet protocol,
partly because not all of the work has yet been done to add
advanced features like Caller ID and call-waiting to Internet-based
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the software you need to do call-waiting in the
circuit world,'' Ianna said. ``Think about the software and the
intelligence you need to replicate that in the IP world. It's
non-trivial. There is a lot of router work that needs to be done,
and it's not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time AT&AMP;T revamped its network so thoroughly was about
10 years ago when it upgraded its long-distance network from copper
wires to optical fiber. About 20 years ago, the company upgraded
its circuit switches from analog to digital.
</P>
<P>
   `'This is the next-generation architecture,'' Ianna said. ``If
analog was the first generation and digital switching was the
second and digital transmission was the third, this is the fourth.
It is significant.''

 &HT;    Harrington's loving spirit still alive, friends and family say
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Precious few tears were shed Sunday for the late Rev.
W. Frank Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Even the weather, sunny and unseasonably warm, seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   A great man had passed and left a legacy hardly worth mourning,
but rather worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, 63, died last week after a long illness. In 28 years
he shepherded Peachtree Presbyterian Church from obscure pastorate
to the biggest mainline Presbyterian church in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorial service packed to overflowing _ and cybercast live
on the Internet _ the resonant feeling was that Harrington's spirit
still invests ``every brick and every plank'' of the expanding
church, said Peachtree minister Frank Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said, `Keep us in your prayers, and remember how
much I love you,''' said Skinner of his old friend. ``What made
that sentence so powerful is that single word `love.' It defines
the ministry and life of Frank Harrington.''
</P>
<P>
   The many who attended _ an estimated 5,000 _ and the names of
many who attended _ former Mayor Maynard Jackson, Mayor Bill
Campbell, Gov. Roy Barnes, businessman Guy Millner _ spoke volumes
about the reach and stature of Harrington's ministry.
</P>
<P>
   He was remembered as iron-willed and soft-hearted, a spinner of
sometimes folksy, highly personal (``I never gave a sermon I didn't
need to hear myself,'' he once said), often elegant sermons.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke his mind, and would occasionally use Sunday morning as
a bully pulpit. Last year he called for the resignation of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But he never lost sight of his evangelical calling to build the
ranks of Presbyterianism, said the Rev. Douglas Oldenberg,
president of Columbia Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally (Frank) disagreed with the decisions of the
(Presbyterian) General Assembly,'' Oldenberg said, evoking
laughter. ``But ne never wavered from his support of what he called
the `Mother of my Faith.'''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner recalled that Harrington ``never made small plans, and
the construction all around is testament to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his tenure at Peachtree, the congregation grew five fold and
the church's annual budget increased from about $300,000 to $9
million. He baptized 3,000 infants, about 1,000 adults, and
performed nearly 1,000 weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the low country of South Carolina, Harrington rose
through a number of smaller churches before arriving at Peachtree.
Even though he befriended many of his faith's aristocracy _
including evangelist Billy Graham _ he never lost his ambition, or
attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   New members to Peachtree were told by Harrington they could only
join if they would agree to ride the church's shuttle bus. The
congregation long ago outgrew its parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A visit from Frank was always a memorable experience,'' said
Skinner. ``And, I might add, expensive. He was never above passing
the offering plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The hour-and-a half service ended simply and hauntingly. Two bag
pipe players, leading the gathered from the main chapel. They
played ``Amazing Grace.

3 SURVIVE AND 40 DIE IN SINKING OF 2 HAITIAN BOATS NEAR FLORIDA
</HEADLINE>
 
(Deletes art advisory. No other changes.)  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (ms) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The three Haitian men who rescuers found in cold, rough
seas are apparently the only survivors of two boats that sank this
weekend off the South Florida coast, leaving as many as 40 dead in
what may be the worst smuggling disaster in this state's history.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard, which had found only the three survivors
and four bodies in its sweep of the open ocean from Cape Canaveral
to Palm Beach, called off its search Sunday as hope faded of
finding anyone still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty are presumed dead,'' said Art Bullock, a U.S. Border
Patrol officer in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The two boats, with most of their human cargo, vanished about 30
miles east of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no debris, no vessels,'' Jeff Hall, petty
officer with the Coast Guard in Miami. Even if survivors had
something to cling onto, it was unlikely they could have survived,
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water temperature was 70 to 72 degrees,'' he said. ``We
factored in the water temperature to gauge their chances of
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state that has seen bodies and makeshift rafts wash up on
its beaches for as long as most people here can remember, this sea
disaster is almost certainly the most costly, in lives, in the
seemingly never-ending crossings from Haiti and Cuba, rescuers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest disappearance of a boatload of refugees that
I've heard of,'' in Florida waters, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians, trying to escape the latest rounds of violence and
persecution and a endless poverty, were apparently making their
crossing with the help of a for-profit smuggling ring,
law-enforcement officials said, after speaking with the three
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The two vessels, a 17-foot boat and a 20-foot boat, were
believed to have cast off from the western end of Grand Bahama, and
headed straight for Palm Beach, a usual smuggling route, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, such boats carry about nine people at most, Hall said.
These boats had at least twice that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, sometime just after midnight, one of the
boats began to sink, and the second boat came alongside to help.
But as the terrified passengers crossed over on the second boat,
it, too, began to sink, one of the survivors told rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2 a.m. Saturday, about 30 miles off Palm Beach, crewmen
aboard the passing freighter Tomas Faith heard screams in the
water, and radioed the Coast Guard. The sinking might have gone
unreported, if crewmen aboard the Tomas Faith had not heard people
screaming. As it turned out, only a few people, dead or alive, were
found on the surface as dawn broke.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter found the first survivor, weakly trying to stay
afloat as he grasped a propane tank, at about at about 5 a.m., and
two others were found clinging to a barrel at about 8 a.m. All
three survivors, one man in his late 30s, one in his early 40s and
another in his 20s, were treated for hypothermia, and questioned by
the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Although rescuers used helicopters, planes and seagoing boats to
search an area of 2,600 square miles, they found only four bodies.
</P>
<P>
   They found no life jackets, either on the survivors, on the
bodies, or floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bahamas, smugglers tell them it's easy to get here,''
said Samedi Florvil, who works with the Haitian Refugee Center in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Haitians here in Miami said, those who can afford the
costs _some pay hundreds of dollars, or more, a small fortune in
that poor country _ are loaded onto unsafe boats, and risk their
lives in crossings in the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   It is happening, immigration officials said, more and more, in
both Haiti and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the two vessels on Saturday follows a December
incident, in which a larger vessel sank in high seas just off
Elliott Key, about 20 miles south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that 14 Cubans perished, although only
nine bodies were recovered and the rest are believed to have been
lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nine survivors were charged with smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   As conditions in those Haiti and Cuba worsen, the number of
rafters and smuggled people is expected to rise. In 1998, the Coast
Guard intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 1,206 Haitians as they tried to
enter the country, said Petty Officer Hall. In 1997, only 406
Cubans and 587 Haitians were intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 112 Cubans and 258 Haitians have been
intercepted at sea, said Petty Officer Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's Little Haiti, where many of the Haitian refugees have
settled after fleeing a history of dictators and chaos, the news of
the disaster saddened many people, but surprised no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are hurting, day after day after day,'' said
Gerard Joseph, a radio commentator, of deteriorating economic and
political conditions in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   All three survivors will eventually be taken to Krome Detention
Center in Miami, and could be deported back to Haiti.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IN PLAYS OF FLEDGLINGS, INTIMATIONS OF
IMMORTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the late 1930s a hopeful young playwright studying
at a Midwestern university spent many weekends visiting a friend
who was working in a nearby prison. From his observations he wrote
a play about what he called ``the system's malign pressure on human
brains.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was turned down in a competition, he put it aside and
went on to other plays. But he said he was haunted by his memories
of ``those hot, humid cellblocks with tier on tier of humans'' and
``the wild, insane laughter and threatening uproars that
periodically arose.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright was not Tennessee Williams; it was Arthur Miller,
and the play was ``The Great Disobedience.'' Where are you, Vanessa
Redgrave?
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable coincidence that at approximately the same
time and at the same point in their careers both playwrights were
writing about prison conditions. In contrast to Miller, Williams
was not writing from firsthand experience. As a student at the
University of Iowa he had read a newspaper article about a
rebellion of inmates, and, inspired by gangster movies of the
period (like ``The Big House''), he wrote ``Not About
Nightingales.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Redgrave discovered this ``lost play'' and brought it to the
attention of the Royal National Theater, which presented its
premiere in London. Trevor Nunn's production, starring Ms.
Redgrave's brother, Corin, recently opened at Circle in the Square
on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller was a student at the University of Michigan, his
plays won the Avery Hopwood Award two years in a row, but ``The
Great Disobedience'' was rejected and he put it away in a trunk.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a half-dozen works by Miller that preceded his
first Broadway play, ``The Man Who Had All the Luck,'' in 1944.
Obviously Miller was not discouraged. As he wrote in his
autobiography, ``Timebends,'' ``My play's failure did nothing to
weaken my conviction that art ought to be of use in changing
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Most writers have a long apprenticeship and years of struggle
before they break through, and even the most accomplished have
early plays that have not been produced, sometimes with
justification, sometimes through oversight. In many cases the
authors simply forget their apprentice work.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to a volume of two early plays by Joe Orton
(recently published in England), the editor says that Orton ``liked
to give the impression that he had sprung, a fully mature
playwright, straight from the head of Dionysius.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton claimed that ``Entertaining Mr. Sloane,'' the play that
established his reputation in 1964, was his first full-length work.
In fact three other unproduced plays had preceded it, along with at
least seven novels that he wrote by himself or in collaboration. So
much for Dionysius.
</P>
<P>
   Currently New Yorkers have an opportunity to see lost plays by
two diverse writers, ``Not About Nightingales'' and ``The
Hothouse'' by Harold Pinter. Each followed a different path to
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not About Nightingales,'' written in 1938, was rejected by the
Group Theater, and it was not staged in Williams' lifetime. Reading
it, one can understand the reasons for the neglect. In the unlikely
event that it had been performed, it undoubtedly would not have had
the kind of rousing production Nunn has given it, or the impressive
cast of British and American actors. Anything less would have been
a disservice to the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   The play reveals Williams' nascent talent, but it is a long way
from ``The Glass Menagerie,'' his first masterwork. If it had been
done first, it might have set him off on a different course,
encouraging him to write other melodramas instead of the intimate,
autobiographical plays that followed.
</P>
<P>
   When lost plays are finally produced, timing is important.
Although ``Nightingales'' is a period piece, it gains new relevance
from current incidents of prison injustice and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Also it can now be approached in the context of Williams' other
work. There are hints of themes that were to obsess him throughout
his career, especially in the portraits of characters too sensitive
to withstand the battering of malevolent forces in society.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Williams, Pinter put aside ``The Hothouse''
because of the adverse critical reaction to his first full-length
play, ``The Birthday Party.'' Twenty years later he read it ``as a
stranger'' and ``laughed quite a lot,'' and he decided to stage it.
Since then it has become an essential part of his body of work. A
new production is playing off-Broadway at the Atlantic Theater
Company.
</P>
<P>
   A black farce set in a state-subsidized mental institution,
``The Hothouse'' is unlike other early Pinter works. With its
zestful exuberance it is also far from his new play _ the terse,
mysterious ``Ashes to Ashes'' _ which is currently being presented
by the Roundabout Theater Company. It is closer to the spirit of
Orton (who at the time had not yet written his best plays).
</P>
<P>
   Had ``The Hothouse'' been produced when it was written, it might
have given the playwright a different image. ``The Caretaker,'' the
next full-length Pinter play to be staged, was the tone setter,
with its air of comic malice and lingering dread.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for Orton, ``Fred and Madge'' and ``The Visitors,'' his
earliest unproduced comedies, demonstrate his talent for spoofing
the working class. One can see in them sparks of ``Entertaining Mr.
Sloane'' and ``What the Butler Saw.''
</P>
<P>
   With another early play, Chekhov's ``Wood Demon,'' there is the
added asset of historical significance; this work was the original
version of ``Uncle Vanya.'' Looking at them together illuminates
the growth of the author's genius.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Samuel Beckett wrote his first play, ``Eleutheria,''
followed by ``Waiting for Godot,'' and tried to get either or both
produced. Finally Roger Blin, an actor and director in Paris, chose
to do ``Godot,'' at least partly because it had a smaller cast than
the other work. And Beckett was on his way into theatrical history.
He withdrew ``Eleutheria'' from consideration, but he chose not to
discard it.
</P>
<P>
   As James Knowlson points out in his biography of Beckett, if it
had been done in 1948, ``it would certainly be talked of now, in
spite of its limitations and flaws, as one of the plays that
ushered in a new era in avant-garde French theater.''
``Eleutheria'' is closer to Ionesco than to Beckett. One hopes that
if and when ``Eleutheria'' is finally presented, it will be done
with the fidelity and imagination that Nunn has brought to
``Nightingales.''
</P>
<P>
   A final note: ``Nightingales'' was not Williams' first but his
fourth full-length play. His first was ``Beauty Is the Word'' in
1930.
</P>
<P>
   His first play to be staged was ``Cairo! Shanghai! Bombay!,''
produced in 1935 by a community theater in Memphis, Tenn. As Lyle
Leverich recounts in his biography, ``Tom: the Unknown Tennessee
Williams,'' the playwright described it as ``a farcical but rather
touching little comedy about two sailors on a date with a couple of
`light ladies.'''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing it, Williams was impressed by ``the laughter, genuine and
loud'' and the applause. In his ``Memoirs,'' he wrote, ``Then and
there the theater and I found each other for better and for
worse.'' It would be another 10 years before the world discovered
him.

 &HT;    Oh, brother: Jeff Burton edges sibling
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Burton brothers started racing Go-Karts in
Virginia when each was only eight years old. But their age
difference _ Ward is six years older than Jeff _ deterred any
rivalry on the dirt tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no sibling duel will ever match the battle that occurred
in the final laps of Sunday's Las Vegas 400. The Burtons led 170 of
the final 197 laps, and with only 10 remaining, Jeff passed his
brother on the high side of the back straightaway for his sixth
career Winston Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted it to come down to the end like that,'' Jeff
Burton said. ``The next time he'll get me. That's awfully
stressful. To sit there and try to beat him is really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been Ward Burton's first victory since October
1995, a winless streak of 96 races. Two-time defending Winston Cup
champion Jeff Gordon finished third, with Mike Skinner and Bobby
Labonte rounding out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat everybody but one car,'' Ward Burton said. ``I feel
pretty disappointed not beating that one car, but if I have to lose
to somebody, I'd want to lose to my brother. That's still not much
consolation, though.''
</P>
<P>
   A restart with only 32 laps left set up the dramatic finish. A
late caution sent the drivers to pit road after the engine in
Geoffrey Bodine's No. 60 Chevrolet blew up, leaving oil between
turns 1 and 2 of the 1.5-mile oval of Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed Ward Burton to take the lead from his brother after
getting out of the pits first. He owned the lead for 21 of the next
22 laps, holding off a challenge from Gordon, who led only one lap
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon tried to pass Ward Burton between turns 1 and 2 with
only 25 laps remaining, Burton blocked him and then his brother
took second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to go to the outside of Ward,'' Gordon
said. ``He kind of gave me the inside. I wanted to get to the
outside of him. Had I been able to back off and get back in behind
him and work on him a little bit, I might have been able to do
that. But Jeff was there and got by me and they started battling.
My car got loose and I faded.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton didn't. With only 14 laps remaining, Ward Burton
opened up a sizable advantage. Jeff started closing about two laps
later, though, and the brothers raced side by side for the next
four laps until Jeff finally took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to give him an inch,'' Ward Burton said. ``I
even thought about moving up a little bit higher than I did, but I
knew one of us wouldn't have gotten out of the corner if I did. I
was trying to crowd him as much as I could without wrecking him. I
don't want to wreck my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't forget he's your brother,'' Jeff added. ``No matter
what, he's your brother. But I was doing everything I could to win
the race and he was, too.... I kind of giggled during the race
because Winston Cup racing is such a really big deal, and for two
brothers to be racing for a win is pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burtons had never finished 1-2 in a Winston Cup race, but
they accomplished the feat in a Busch Series race at Myrtle Beach,
S.C., in 1993. Jeff won that race, too, after Ward missed a shift
with only two laps left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was different,'' Jeff said. ``This was a side-by-side
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton was one of only three drivers of Ford cars who
finished in the top 10. Ford teams dominated the inaugural event
here last year with 13 of the top 14 finishers. But General Motors
teams led Sunday's race, placing seven in the top 10, including
four Chevy teams.
</P>
<P>

GANSTER COMEDY `ANALYZE THIS' WHACKS BOX OFFICE COMPETITORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- &UR;  &LR; Moviegoers mobbed the nation's multiplexes for
gangster-comedy ``Analyze This'' as it dominated offerings with an
estimated $17.7 million at 2,518 theaters during the Friday-Sunday
period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. release, starring Robert De Niro as a crime
boss seeking the aid of a psychiatrist played by Billy Crystal,
topped Hollywood's expectations and benefited from strong
word-of-mouth among moviegoers. Attendance jumped an impressive 55
percent from Friday's $5.15 million to Saturday's $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that `Analyze This' did so well because it's
something of a dark comedy, which is not an easy sell,'' said movie
analyst Arthur Rockwell. ``Warner's marketing campaign was clearly
effective, because it obviously broadened the audience beyond
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell also noted that the success of ``Analyze This,'' which
received fairly positive reviews, came despite Crystal's lack of
drawing power in recent years. ``He can do well if he's in the
right kind of role, which is what happened here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
credited the studio's strategy of showing sneak screenings during
the past two weekends. ``The sneaks really helped get the marketing
to work,'' he said, adding that ``Analyze This'' would probably
wind up grossing $55 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other opening, Sony's prep-school drama ``Cruel
Intentions'' with Sarah Michelle Gellar, finished a respectable
second with $13.2 million at 2,312 theaters although the total was
below projections made earlier this year. Bucksbaum predicted the
``Dangerous Liaisons'' update will take in $38 million overall _ a
solid return on a reported $10.5 million budget _ and noted that
``Intentions'' had to overcome an R rating and a marketplace that
has been saturated with films aimed at teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teen films that have been performing best are light
comedies like `She's All That,' &UR;  &LR; '' Bucksbaum said. `` &UR;  &LR; `Cruel
Intentions' may have been a little too sophisticated and dark for
young teen-age girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted that adult-oriented star-driven films, such as
``Analyze This,'' ``Payback,'' ``Message in a Bottle'' and ``8mm,''
have outperformed teen movies in recent weeks. ``There's been a
real resurgence in that part of the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of ``8mm'' lost slightly over half its
audience, finishing third with $7 million at 2,370 sites. ``Movies
of that genre usually lose their legs pretty quickly,'' Rockwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Disney's second weekend of romantic drama ``The
Other Sister'' held up moderately well with $5.6 million at 1,846
theaters as the studio added 503 screens. Paramount's fifth weekend
of ``Payback'' continued to draw respectably in fifth with $4.1
million at 2,855 theaters, going past $72 million overall as it
extended its lead as the top grosser of 1999 movies.
</P>
<P>
   Three films in their fourth weekends took the sixth, seventh and
eighth spots, led by Universal's ``October Sky'' with $3.7 million
at 1,695 theaters. It edged Disney's ``My Favorite Martian'' with
$3.6 million at 2,309 screens and Warner's ``Message in a Bottle''
with $3.4 million at 2,489 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love'' finished ninth with $3.2
million at 1,721 theaters to push its 87-day total to nearly $65
million. ``Shakespeare'' continues to benefit from its 13 Academy
Award nominations and may still be in the top 10 when Oscars are
handed out March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's sixth weekend of ``She's All That'' continued to draw
respectably with $2.6 million at 1,865 theaters to top $57 million
overall, followed by its 20th weekend of ``Life Is Beautiful,''
which has seven Oscar nominations, with $2 million at 672
locations. ``Life'' has become the first foreign language movie to
go past $30 million in U.S. ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with 11 Oscar nods, showed
it still has some drawing power with $1.2 million at 945 locations.
``Ryan'' has topped $207 million and holds the 23rd spot on the
all-time domestic chart.
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy racked up solid returns from its opening of ``Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' with $144,000 at eight theaters.
The British comedy, made for a minuscule $1.6 million, has grossed
more than $20 million in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses hit about $80 million, down about 8 percent from
the same weekend a year ago when the 12th weekend of ``Titanic''
led the box office. Year-to-date grosses have gone past $900
million, trailing the 1998 period by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Five new movies will open Friday, including 20th Century Fox's
action-adventure ``Wing Commander,'' Sony's drama ``Deep End of the
Ocean,'' MGM's horror-sequel ``The Rage: Carrie 2,'' Sony's comedy
``Baby Geniuses'' and New Line's police drama ``The Corruptor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' will be helped if a new trailer for ``Star
Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace'' plays before it, as was
reported recently, but Fox has not confirmed those plans.

AT SELMA ANNIVERSARY MARCH, A PLEA FOR INTERGRATED POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ Each year on March 7, this tumbledown town comes
alive with the spirit of an instant in time, the beginning of the
end of American apartheid, when an Alabama state trooper cracked
John Lewis' skull.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, 1965, the troopers and a racist posse attacked 600
black civil rights marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge over the
Alabama River, splitting flesh and bone with clubs, bullwhips,
rubber hoses wrapped with barbed wire. The attack shamed Congress
into guaranteeing black people the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the head of that march was Lewis. Now a seven-term
U.S. representative from Georgia, he returned to the bridge Sunday
with 20 fellow members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, who
joined several hundred Alabama residents to reenact the march.
Selma was the last stop on a two-day pilgrimage by bus to some of
the stations of the cross of civil rights: Birmingham, Montgomery,
Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he was trying to make his colleagues feel the spirit
of the movement that transformed the law, and to start them talking
together about race and reconciliation _ or, for that matter,
talking together about anything.
</P>
<P>
   The House members say they spend less and less time speaking
with one another as they become more and more ideologically
segregated. Not even the chaplains of the Senate and House attract
politically integrated congressional congregants, members say.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we really don't talk,'' said Lewis, 59.
``You can go days on end in Washington and never speak to another
member. In the House, most Republicans, as a rule, walk in on the
Republican side, and leave the same way,'' as do Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on Martin Luther King Jr. Street in Selma, Ray LaHood,
a Republican from Peoria, Ill., who gaveled Lewis to silence in the
divisive impeachment debate, said much the same about his
colleagues: ``They don't mix because they don't know each other.
They are separate. You don't know the people you're trying to make
laws with.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hotel by the Alabama River, once Selma's slave-trading
post, Rep. Fred Upton, a Republican from southwest Michigan, said:
``We don't know each other. There's not been a lot of dialogue
lately.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bus to Montgomery, Rep. Marion Berry, a Democrat from
northeastern Arkansas, and a farmer, said Congress is ``structured
to keep us apart.''
</P>
<P>
   And outside the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, where
four girls were murdered by a racist's bomb, Rep. Michael Forbes,
R-N.Y., said: ``It's gotten so bad, so partisan, so polarized.
That's why you have to have shared experiences, to blow away
preconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the point, Lewis said: to show his colleagues a time
and place that changed Congress, in the hope it might change again.
On the bus from Birmingham to Montgomery, where, in 1961, Lewis,
then a 21-year-old Freedom Rider, was beaten for trying to
integrate interstate bus lines, Rep. Bob Filner of San Diego was
traveling through the past. He was a Freedom Rider, too. He and
Lewis are the only members of Congress to have served time at
Parchman Farm, the legendarily tough Mississippi State
Penitentiary. They were arrested for their civil rights activism by
lawmen commanded by G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery, who went on to serve
30 years in Congress before retiring in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been back here for 33 years,'' Filner said. ``When I
saw that the motorcycle cops escorting us out of Birmingham were
black, I thought: This place has changed. We changed American
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement did not transform Selma. ``It remains today what it
was back then, a sleepy, dying little Southern town,'' Lewis wrote
in his autobiography, ``Walking With the Wind'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1998). The races still do not mix much; few white people joined
today's parade. The mayor, Joe Smitherman, stayed away. He has been
mayor since 1964, and he stood with the troopers and the vigilantes
on the bridge as they savaged the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman shares power with black people now, not always
easily. ``I was on the wrong side'' of the bridge, he said on
Saturday night in a speech at a dinner commemorating the march.
``I'm often on the wrong side now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, at a breakfast before the march, Rep. David E.
Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, said he felt ``a
magic, an essence'' emanating from the place. ``It radiates.''
</P>
<P>
   This radiance, said Coretta Scott King, King's widow, was the
light that shined through the civil rights movement. ``It was a
spiritual movement,'' she said at the breakfast. ``That same spirit
is available today. You just have to claim it.'' That reclamation,
she said, ``could bring about a transformation of the Congress that
is desperately needed.''

 &HT;    `A great day for Auburn,' bad day for the ACC
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was joy at Auburn and the SEC but anger
throughout the ACC Sunday as the 64-team field for the NCAA Men's
basketball tournament was announced in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing to Kentucky in Saturday's semifinals of the SEC
Tournament, Auburn (27-3) received the first No. 1 seed in school
history and is in the field for the first time since 1988. The
Tigers open the tournament Thursday against Winthrop, the Big South
Champ, in the first round of the South Regional in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous story and a great day for Auburn,'' said
coach Cliff Ellis. ``Our kids and our fans deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC got six teams (Auburn, Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida,
Arkansas, Ole Miss) with a seventh, Mississippi State, getting
passed over with a 20-12 record. The Big Ten led all conferences
with seven bids.
</P>
<P>
   History, the bad kind, was made in the ACC as for the first time
since 1980 it got only three teams in the tournament. Duke,
Maryland, and North Carolina were all top three seeds, but Wake
Forest (16-13) and N.C. State (18-13) were left out. Wake Forest,
which finished fourth in the ACC, lost its chance when it fell to
N.C. State in Friday's second round of the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people in the ACC are upset but once the automatic
entries are put in place, you have play your way in,'' said
Kentucky's C.M. Newton, the chairman of the NCAA selection
committee. ``I think it would have helped Wake Forest to win a game
in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's other top seeds included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Duke (32-3), which brings a 27-game winning streak into
Friday's first round of the East Regional in Charlotte, where they
beat North Carolina 96-73 on Sunday for the ACC Tournament
championship. The Blue Devils will open against 16th-seeded Florida
A&AMP;M (12-18).
</P>
<P>
   _ UConn (28-2), which is the No. 1 seed in the West after
beating St. John's 82-63 for the Big East Tournament title. The
Huskies open with Texas-San Antonio on Thursday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michigan State (29-4), which beat Illinois 67-50 win the Big
Ten Tournament final on Sunday. The Spartans, the top seed in the
Midwest, will open the tournament Friday in Milwaukee against Mount
St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, Miami, Utah and Stanford were the No. 2 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (25-8), the defending national champions, drew a No. 3
seed in the Midwest Regional and will open the tournament Thursday
in New Orleans against New Mexico State, winners of the Big West
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other surprises from selection Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alabama Birmingham (20-11), as the fourth team picked from
Conference USA. The Blazers had struggled down the stretch and lost
in the semifinals of the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   _ A No. 8 seed for the College of Charleston (28-2), despite a
25-game winning streak which includes a victory over North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   _ An at-large bid for New Mexico (23-7) despite an RPI of 86 and
a strength of schedule of 229.
</P>
<P>
   MEN'S TOURNAMENT
</P>
<P>
   _ TOP SEEDS: East _ Duke; South _ Auburn; Midwest _ Michigan
St.; West _ UConn.
</P>
<P>
   _ SEC: Arkansas (W4); Auburn (S1); Florida (W6); Kentucky (MW3);
Mississippi (MW9); Tennessee (E4).
</P>
<P>
   _ ACC: North Carolina (W3); Maryland (S2).
</P>
<P>
   _ UNLIKELIEST CINDERELLA: Florida A&AMP;M, the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference tournament champion, brings a 12-18 record. The Rattlers
would have to win the title to finish .500.
</P>
<P>
   _ KNOWING THE ROPES: North Carolina is making its 25th
consecutive appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _ CONFERENCE CALL: The Big Ten's seven entries are the most of
any conference.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT
</P>
<P>
   _ TOP SEEDS: East _ Tennessee Mideast _ Connecticut; Midwest _
Purdue; West _ Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   _ SEC: Alabama (MW5); Auburn (E5); Florida (MW11); Georgia
(ME3); Kentucky (W6); LSU (W4); Mississippi State (MW7).
</P>
<P>
   _ ACC: Clemson (ME2); Duke (E3); North Carolina (MW4); N.C.
State (MW10); Virginia (W9).
</P>
<P>
   _ ONE AND DONE?: Surprising Southern Conference tournament
champion Appalachian State (14-14) run may be short. The 16th seed
plays at three-time champion Tennessee in its opener.
</P>
<P>
   _ SAME OLD, SAME OLD: Should Tennessee and Louisiana Tech win
out, the 1998 finalists would meet in the title game.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some doctors and hospitals have been forcing poor
women to pay hundreds of dollars in cash for a popular procedure to
relieve pain in childbirth, federal officials say, and the
government has ordered hospitals to stop the practice immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says that pregnant Medicaid patients may not be
charged for prenatal care, delivery or other medical services that
relate to pregnancy. Medicaid reimburses hospitals and doctors for
such services, but doctors say the payments for pain treatment are
grossly inadequate, sometimes only 10 percent or 20 percent of what
private insurance companies pay.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent recently to state health officials, Sally
Richardson, the national director of the Medicaid program, said she
had received reports that health-care providers were improperly
requiring patients to pay cash for services covered by Medicaid,
which pays the bills for more than one-third of all births in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they do not know how widespread the
problem is, but doctors and health-policy experts say they have
heard complaints from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, Ms. Richardson said, anesthesiologists have
insisted that Medicaid patients pay in advance, with their own
money, for the widely used form of anesthesia, known as the
epidural block.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one instance,'' Ms. Richardson said, ``the obstetrician
ordered the epidural in advance, but when the woman was in active
labor, she was refused this service for lack of prepayment. Even
though she tried to pay by check, credit card and a Western Union
money telegram, the doctor refused anything but cash.''
</P>
<P>
   With somewhat more passion than midlevel federal officials
usually express, Ms. Richardson said, ``Treatment of a Medicaid
patient in this manner is not just a concern, it is alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   She told state Medicaid directors to make sure that hospitals
understood their obligations to provide all medically necessary
services, including anesthesia, to Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson did not name any of the doctors who demanded
cash, nor did she name any hospital. But Medicaid patients said
last year that they had been asked to pay cash for epidural
injections at a dozen hospitals in the Los Angeles area, and
Florida officials say they have received similar complaints.
Patients who could not pay were, in many cases, offered less
effective and less expensive forms of pain relief, like Demerol and
other narcotic medicines.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in the newsletter of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists quoted doctors who believe they are grossly
underpaid by Medicaid. ``Poor people can't expect to drive a
Rolls-Royce or to eat at a fine French restaurant, so why should
they expect to receive the Cadillac of analgesics for free?'' one
doctor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Birnbach, director of obstetric anesthesiology at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, said such comments
came from ``a vocal minority of anesthesiologists'' and were
contrary to the society's official position, which holds that women
in labor should not be denied pain relief for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Health Services found that
anesthesiologists at one hospital, Northridge Hospital Medical
Center, had required Medicaid patients to pay $400 in cash for
epidural pain relief in labor and delivery, and it said the
hospital had helped collect the money.
</P>
<P>
   The state demanded that Northridge refund the money to patients,
and Ken August, a spokesman for the California Department of Health
Services, said 114 women had received such refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Women said it was humiliating to dispatch their husbands to
automated teller machines, friends and neighbors to get cash.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Ozzie Chavez, said she thought the nurse was joking
when she asked for $400 in cash just hours before Mrs. Chavez gave
birth at Northridge in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a wimp when it comes to pain,'' Mrs. Chavez said in an
interview. ``But it was a very painful delivery. The
anesthesiologist wouldn't even come into the room until she got her
money. I offered her a credit card and a check, but she wouldn't
accept it. I was lying there having contractions, and they wouldn't
give me an epidural. I felt like an animal. It was degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chavez's sister called relatives in England, who wired the
money to Los Angeles. ``By the time the money arrived, I had had
the baby,'' Mrs. Chavez said. Wendell Mobley, a spokesman for
Northridge, said the hospital had apologized to Mrs. Chavez. Mobley
refused to discuss the hospital practices in detail, because of
pending lawsuits, including one by Mrs. Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Neeld Jr., president of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists, said, ``It's unethical to withhold services
because of reimbursement. Anesthesiologists share with all
physicians the responsibility to provide care for patients
irrespective of their ability to pay for their care.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbach agreed. While Medicaid payments are far too low, he
said, ``we should not practice in a way that will allow us to be
accused of extorting money'' from patients, and ``we should not
fight the battle of unfair reimbursement for epidurals at the
patient's bedside.''

   The epidural injection blocks pain in the lower part of the
body, but the mother generally remains wide awake.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and the
states, and states set reimbursement levels. Some states have
increased payments for obstetricians in recent years, but
reimbursement for anesthesiologists has lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by the American Society of Anesthesiologists
found that New York, for example, typically paid $55 to $105 for
the epidural block, and Connecticut paid $64, while insurance
companies often paid more than $800 in those states.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the society said, Medicaid reimbursement averaged
$60, about one-tenth of the amounts typically paid by insurance
companies. In California, Medicaid payments ranged from $98 to
$170, while private insurers often paid more than $400.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, including New York and California,
anesthesiologists have lobbied state legislators and Medicaid
officials to increase the payments for pain-relief services in
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bodkin, executive director of the Florida Society of
Anesthesiologists, said, ``The Medicaid reimbursement rates are so
dreadfully low _ the equivalent of $20 an hour for someone with 12
years of professional training _ that they discourage
anesthesiologists from taking Medicaid patients, who deserve the
same quality care as other patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George
Washington University, said doctors, nursing homes and other
health-care providers had often tried to get Medicaid patients to
pay more than the amounts paid by Medicaid. But Medicaid officials
said it was particularly inappropriate to require such payments by
women in labor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bullen, the Medicaid director in Massachusetts, who is
chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors,
said, ``This shouldn't be happening,'' and he added, ``You cannot
require cost sharing of any kind as a condition of services being
rendered to pregnant Medicaid patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Crayton, the Medicaid director in Florida, said his agency
had received reports similar to those in California.
``Anesthesiologists told Medicaid patients they did not accept
Medicaid payments for epidurals and required payment in advance for
the service at labor and delivery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wallace-Brodeur, the Medicaid director in Vermont, said
that even if anesthesiologists had valid concerns about inadequate
reimbursement, ``they shouldn't take it out on the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to state officials, Ms. Richardson said: ``Under
federal Medicaid law, deductions, cost sharing or similar charges
are not permitted for Medicaid services furnished to pregnant
women. Thus, a participating physician's demand for these
additional payments would be in violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesiologists say that Medicaid patients sometimes agree to
pay them directly for their services during labor and delivery,
just as private patients would. But, Ms. Richardson said,
regardless of the preferences of any particular doctor, the
hospital has a duty to ensure that pregnant Medicaid patients can
obtain services ``without the imposition of deductibles, cost
sharing or similar charges.''

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: CARTER'S RETIREMENT IS A LIFE OF LEARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Jimmy Carter's latest book is ``The Virtues of
Aging'' (Ballantine, 1998), and in a speech at the American Society
on Aging's annual conference here, the 75-year-old former president
presented his personal list of those virtues, from time to learn
new things to grandchildren to a closer relationship with his wife,
Rosalynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become mountain climbers,'' said Carter, who was 56 when
he was voted out of the White House and into early retirement. At
64, he climbed to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, he said. At 70, he
climbed Mount Fuji.
</P>
<P>
   From Orlando he planned to fly to Aspen to join his wife and
grandchildren on the ski slopes. ``I never saw skis till I was
62,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   He has learned how to write books, he said, and recently
embarked on his first novel. He makes furniture. He has mastered
the computer. ``We have tied our family together with e-mail,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the four-day conference, which was attended by
3,000 gerontologists, academics, nurses, social workers and others,
was a celebration of aging. As such, Carter, who looked fit and
younger than his years, was a fitting choice as the keynote
speaker, opening the event on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the conference workshops emphasized the importance of
relationships to the health and well-being of older people, and
Carter told the audience that he had taken particular satisfaction
in his marriage of nearly 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our love has deepened in many ways, including in physical
ways,'' Carter said. ``We have made a deliberate decision to do
more things together.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while he and his wife had had difficult times in
their marriage, and plenty of arguments, they had learned to
forgive each other.
</P>
<P>
   He described one argument, not so long ago, that went on for
days. ``We could hardly speak to each other,'' he said. ``We wrote
ugly notes back and forth on our computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, he went to his woodworking shop and fashioned
a check out of a piece of walnut. ``I wrote on it: `This is good
for the rest of our lives for an apology or forgiveness, whichever
we prefer,''' he said. ``I signed it, and I gave it to Rosalynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``She uses it frequently,'' he added, to warm laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exploring the opportunities of life, Carter said,
it is also necessary to think about the end of life. He talked
about his own family history in that regard. ``My father died of
pancreatic cancer,'' he said. ``My mother died of pancreatic
cancer. My older sister died of pancreatic cancer, as did my
youngest sister, as did my only brother. I'm the only one left.''
</P>
<P>
   All of his family members died at home, he said. ``They've not
been strangled by tubes.'' He said that he and his wife have signed
living wills stating that they do not want to be kept alive by
artificial means.
</P>
<P>
   If Carter is the embodiment of what is talked about these days
as successful aging, then what about people who cannot play tennis
and climb mountains? What about the frail elderly? Are they to be
viewed as failures at aging? If independence and autonomy are among
the highest American virtues, then how shall those who have no
choice but to depend on others be regarded?
</P>
<P>
   These were some of the questions posed by Mark H. Waymack, an
associate professor of philosophy and co-director of graduate
programs in health care at Loyola University, in a workshop called
``Dependency and the American Myth of Rugged Individualism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the theses of the new gerontology is that successful
aging is not an aging of dependency,'' Waymack said. ``You climb
mountains, play tennis, go hiking. I'm worried about the elderly
who are in nursing homes, or in home care, and who find it
difficult to get out of their homes because they're frail and
dependent. And they may be dependent in ways we can't change.'' He
also pointed out that money often buys health and independence.
</P>
<P>
   There have to be new models for what is regarded as successful
aging, Waymack said. ``What's wrong with being dependent?'' he
asked. ``We don't think it's shameful for children to be dependent.
Why do we then think it's shameful for adults to be dependent?''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his lecture on creativity and aging, Gene Cohen, a
psychiatrist and gerontologist, quoted William Carlos Williams, who
wrote about ``an old age that adds as it takes away.''
</P>
<P>
   The poet was 79 when he published ``Pictures from Brueghel and
Other Poems,'' which won the Pulitzer prize, said Cohen, who is the
director of the Center on Aging, Health and Humanities at George
Washington University in Washington. Through his work at the
center, as well as that of a team of social workers in the
Washington area, Cohen said he had found astonishing painting,
sculpture and collages among elderly people who had never
considered themselves artists.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about a ``liberation phase,'' which can begin in the
mid-60s and 70s, and which can be demonstrated in everything from
social action to evolving family relationships _ both of which can
be creative, he said _ to painting and sculpture. ``Many people
feel free to do the right thing,'' he said.``They feel this
creative push to do what they might have done. If not now, when?''

MODERATE CONSERVATIVE LEADS SALVADORAN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ A moderate candidate from the
governing conservative party led the voting Sunday in El Salvador's
second presidential election since the end of its civil war seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An early survey of voters leaving polling stations showed
Francisco Flores, the 39-year-old candidate of the governing
Nationalist Republican Alliance, with a comfortable lead over
Facundo Guardado, 44, his opponent from a coalition led by the
country's former guerrilla movement, the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   Among five other candidates, Ruben Zamora, the FMLN presidential
candidate in the last election but now running under his own
Democratic Center Union, drew the third largest block of votes,
about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among 3.1 million registered voters appeared low after
an election campaign dominated by the grave problems that have
plagued El Salvador since its 12-year civil war ended, including
rampant crime, inflation and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Voter apathy, political analysts said, demonstrated a loss of
faith in the effectiveness of government since peace arrived in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that despite the end of the war, the fundamental
problems of the country have not been solved like they had
expected,'' said Jose Miguel Cruz, director of the Public Opinion
University Institute at the Central American University. ``They say
we've had war, elections, peace accords and more elections, and we
still have violence and problems of unemployment and poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous elections only half of the eligible voters cast
ballots. Two out of three Salvadorans had little or no interest in
this election, according to a survey last month by the Public
Opinion University Institute. The reasons, it found, ranged from
mistrust of politicians to skepticism that the vote would make a
difference in solving the country's problems or improving living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the disillusionment of Salvadorans was not enough to turn
voters away from the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or ARENA,
which suffered serious losses to the party of the former guerrillas
in municipal an legislative elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls opened Sunday, Flores, a conservative
economist and philosopher with a fresh face and no ties to the
civil war, was favored to win, though it was unclear whether he
would gain enough votes to avoid a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   The FMLN, after much infighting, had rejected broadening its
appeal and settled on Guardadoa, a leftist activist and moderate
ex-guerrilla commander who himself had pushed for the selection of
a centrist candidate from an allied party.
</P>
<P>
   Guardado's war credentials and Flores' resume, which includes
studies in Indian philosophy and a bachelor's degree in political
science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, seemed to
leave many voters unable to see an alternative beyond ARENA,
however dissatisfied they might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francisco Flores seems to me more capable, better educated,''
said Raul Avila, 68, a tailor who said he has been held up twice in
recent years. ``No government is ideal but the hope we all have is
that he can begin solving the most serious problems of the
country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Avila voted at the fairgrounds here where 69,000 Salvadorans
were registered to vote and where throngs of voters filed into
cavernous pavilions Sunday morning to cast their ballots at
cardboard podiums.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the scene was festive, with food and drink vendors
hollering for business as voters came and went, many of them
wearing T-shirts, caps and hair ribbons with party colors and
honking their horns in electoral euphoria as they sat in heavy
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were held on the eve of President Clinton's
four-day visit to Central America to survey the damage inflicted by
Hurricane Mitch late last year. His visit begins in Nicargua and El
Salvador Monday. Flags welcoming the ``Excelentisimo Senor
Presidente,'' the first U.S. president to visit El Salvador since
Lyndon B. Johnson stopped by in 1960s, have been up on major roads
here for days.
</P>
<P>
   At a press teleconference this week from Washington, Peter
Romero, the State Department's subsecretary for Western Hemisphere
affairs, said the president is also coming to celebrate the
region's democratic transformation after the civil wars of the
1980s and, particularly, the results of El Salvador's elections.
</P>
<P>
   That transformation would have been even more remarkable if the
FMLN, which the United States helped the government here fight
after El Salvador became a main Cold War battleground, had built on
previous electoral victories to take over power now.
</P>
<P>
   But after capturing the second largest bloc of legislative seats
and a large number of mayoral posts, including the capital, in
1997, internal divisions within the party reinforced feelings among
many voters that the ex-guerrillas were ill-prepared to govern as
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, a social democrat and highly regarded intellectual, was
expected to capture much of the disaffected leftist vote.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ARENA, which was founded in the early 1980s by
leaders of El Salvador's right-wing death squads but has since
cultivated a moderate image, united after the losses of 1997 behind
Flores, a candidate known in the national assembly for building
consensus. He seemed to epitomize the party's message of
``renovation and openness.''
</P>
<P>
   He avoided personal attacks and campaigned on a platform of
bringing professionalism to the police force, reforming a corrupt
judicial system and generating jobs through increased foreign
investment and support of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major change in ARENA is a change toward the common good,
the national good,'' Flores said in an interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Salvadorans, however, regard Flores as a question mark,
noting it remains to be seen whether he would still mainly respond
to economic sectors, such as banking, that benefit from ARENA
government policies.
</P>
<P>
   For most Salvadorans, the overriding issue in this election was
crime and unemployment and underemployment rates of 30 percent. The
``delinquency problem,'' as it is called here, is blamed on a
variety of factors, including the availability of arms left over
from the war and the loss of moral values.

   COLORADO (DENVER) When Rex Brown proposed a charter school in
the city's urban center, it wasn't state education officials he had

the competition _ the public school district. Under Colorado law,
charters must petition public school districts for permission to
operate. The districts decide what charter schools can open within
their boundaries, what goals the charters must achieve, even how
the charters are to be funded. In Colorado, charter schools are a
small, controlled experiment. Their performances are analyzed each
year by the state education board, their licenses must be renewed
every three to five years, and only 60 can exist at any time. &UR; By

people starting a school don't have any experience in running

then, five other charter schools _ including one that secured

CUBA-BOUND OWNER OF ORIOLES WANTS TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Angelos has spent several years trying to take his
Baltimore Orioles to Cuba, and now that he has succeeded in
arranging a game there, he wants to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' the team's owner said Sunday when asked if the
Orioles would take their regulars. ``They're a pretty formidable
opponent. While we wish them all the best, we don't want to lose.
We want to make our best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached Saturday evening in a meeting that
included representatives of the State Department and the Cuban
government, the Orioles will play the Cuban national team March 28,
although a slight possibility remains that the game could be March
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans then will visit Baltimore for a game whose date will
be determined this week when a delegation from Major League
Baseball travels to Cuba to make final arrangements for the game
there. The game at Camden Yards will be played on April 3, the day
before the season opens, if logistics can be worked out, or on
April 26 or May 3, which would make it an in-season exhibition
game.
</P>
<P>
   The second game was critical to the first because without it,
the players association would not have approved the Havana game, a
union official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Angelos wants to win the games, he said the outcome was
not of paramount importance. ``Ultimately, who wins and loses is
not the important thing,'' the owner said by telephone from
Baltimore. ``The key is the contact and establishing a better
understanding and atmosphere of friendship between the people of
both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels that way. More than 70 Cuban exiles
demonstrated Sunday at Fort Lauderdale Stadium, the Orioles' spring
training base, before and during an exhibition game with the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Cuba under the current conditions there is a sign of
insensitivity and lack of respect for human rights there,'' said
Huber Matos, a native of Cuba who spent 20 years in prison for
opposing Fidel Castro's government. ``It's like taking part in the
abuses that are going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig, in Tampa, Fla., at an exhibition game
between the New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins, said he was
sensitive to the concerns of people opposed to the Orioles' trip.
He added, ``Given the advice we've gotten from the State
Department, we're very excited about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of all factions needed 12 hours of meetings in
Washington on Friday and Saturday to resolve the remaining
roadblocks to the games. The primary issue, the proceeds of the
games, was settled with the understanding that if there are any
proceeds, they would be used for endeavors related to sports,
chiefly baseball.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the negotiations credited Sandy Berger,
President Clinton's national security adviser, and Wendy Sherman of
the State Department with helping get the matters resolved. Neither
attended the meetings, but they contributed by telephone, Sherman
from Beijing last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government has agreed to several changes at the
stadium where the Havana game will be played. Padding will be added
to the outfield fences, and temporary dressing facilities will be
built because the stadium has no locker rooms.

ATWATER THE SUPER BOWL SAFETY WHO FELL TO EARTH
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is not likely to openly display selfishness or to rant, rave
or pout when things go sour. No, Steve Atwater offered a convincing
performance while the Denver Broncos were winning the last two
Super Bowls. All the while, Atwater was slipping in stature among
his coaches and was toiling in an unusual, personal mix of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The team was winning championships.
</P>
<P>
   But Atwater's role at safety was different, reduced.
</P>
<P>
   His coaches said he was slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was, but from what level? From superior to great? After
all, he was still making game-swinging plays. He had also earned
his eighth Pro Bowl selection last season.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 seasons Atwater had played safety for Denver in a
physical and nasty style, and then last year the Denver coaches
asked him late in the season to sit on third-down plays. They told
him that he looked slower, that his quick bursts had waned.
Atwater's heart sank, but he did not show it. He was bruised, but
hid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' Atwater said, ``they asked me in two or three
games for four or five series to sit down on third-down plays, and
I didn't understand why. I kept asking and they finally told me it
was to increase my efficiency. I really didn't buy into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the year and throughout the playoffs, it
stopped, but even then, I was not happy in the defense. We've been
running the type of defense in the last two years where I play more
the role of a cornerback and the cornerback plays more the role of
the safety. And then when I roll up to the cornerback slot, teams
would often run the other way. I just wasn't getting to play around
the ball enough. Other guys were making plays and I was happy for
them. But I'm used to being in the game more, getting a chance to
make more plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, how can you complain? It was working. We won two Super
Bowls. So, unselfishly, for the team, it was great and we were
champions. But selfishly, it was a system where I felt I was going
to waste. I was very unhappy. Really, if the Broncos had asked me
back, I'm not sure I would have wanted to come back to that. I
really might have been ready to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Retire at age 32 after so many operations on his knees and
shoulders, even after the shots of morphine for two straight weeks
last season to keep dealing with the pain? Retire because the
Broncos saw younger players as being on the cutting edge and
Atwater as on the edge of a cliff ready to plunge, not at all worth
the $2.6 million he was scheduled to earn in 1999 from the Broncos?
</P>
<P>
   Atwater would not have to retire. Nearly three weeks ago, he was
cut. See you. The Broncos said they were doing him a favor, letting
him go early so he could sign with another team while free-agent
money was still floating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone saying, `You're fired and it's a favor,'''
Atwater said, bemused. ``The day I got the word was the night
before my grandmother's funeral in Mississippi. I got six messages
to call my agent. I knew. I called him back and said, `OK, where
are we going?'''
</P>
<P>
   To the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos cut Atwater loose because they believe he is about
to plummet toward his football finish. The Jets wrapped their arms
around all 6 feet 3 inches and 217 pounds of him because they
believe he is a player who will bring them savvy, toughness,
experience and championship mettle along with his reputation as
football's biggest hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos see bone.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets see meat.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Atwater never plays a down for the Jets, he helps them
immensely in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, he becomes an important example of the dedication and
desire required to win championships. Atwater is pure pro. The way
he practices, prepares and handles himself on and off the field
will be a joy for Jets players and coaches to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Second, recall that Denver beat the Jets in the American
Football Conference championship game. Denver is the hunted. What
better way to gain insight on the team to topple than by signing
one if its smartest and most mature players? Atwater will help the
Jets understand techniques about how to beat Denver in ways that
few could. He gives them the blueprint, the floor plan, the
combination, the key.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example? An insightful scout? Atwater plans on being
much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played the last two years hurt, especially with my
shoulders and the knee,'' he said. ``I haven't been able to
practice or play the way that I can. I made the Pro Bowl last year,
but that is not how I gauge myself. I can play better and do more.
I'm sure of it. I'm healthy and I'm ready. And now I'm challenged
to go out there are prove it to myself and earn the respect of my
new coaches and teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   And earn more from the old ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   The new, shiny Bronco is Dale Carter, a free-agent signee at
cornerback from Kansas City. The present and future for the Broncos
also includes the young players Tori Noel at cornerback/safety and
George Coghill at safety.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater said: ``In the back of my mind, after the way things
were going last year, I kind of had the feeling that Denver was
going to let me go. I did not shed a tear. I'm not bitter. In this
era of free agency nowadays, most guys don't get to stay with a
team for 10 years. I was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   And happy now. Happy to land with the Jets. A new start, a new
chance. He will be appreciated anew. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He will still be appreciated in Denver, too, where the Broncos
say that Atwater will most likely one day be placed in the team's
Ring of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   A shove out the door _ with love.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years in Denver, I will miss my friends, my teammates
and some of my coaches,'' Atwater said. ``But I'm going to a place
where they are going to use me in the role of a traditional safety
and where Coach Bill Parcells and the Jets are known for being
rough and expecting a lot. That kind of stuff fires me up _ as long
as you tell it like it is.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: VAN HORN CAUGHT IN THE NETS' VORTEX
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out of a useless timeout 27.1 seconds from the end of
a hopeless game, the ball found Keith Van Horn, way out in the
right corner where the baseline and sideline meet, and from where
an offensive player has nowhere to go. Metaphorically, this is also
where the New Jersey Nets happen to be, about as far away from
where they thought they were headed, their hopes for a turnaround
in a season stuck on fast forward suddenly reduced to a wing and a
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   From the corner, his back to the basket, Van Horn rotated on
long, tired legs for a wild 3-point try that Larry Johnson, who is
about 4 inches smaller, pinned back against his hands. A clean
stuff, the final slur in another foul day in an increasingly
obscene season for the Nets' franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no franchise players on a team that's 3-13,'' Van Horn
said sadly in the Nets' locker room, offering profundity where not
long ago there was so much promise.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, now operating on a whole different plane of
expectation, broke in similarly, 14 years ago. Ewing started with a
bad, injury-wracked New York Knicks team and an overbearing coach
named Hubie Brown. It didn't take long before the practice of
dwelling on what Ewing couldn't do as opposed to what he could do
became something of a pastime in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd come out and there'd be Patrick and guys like Louis Orr
and Trent Tucker,'' said Herb Williams, omitting the likes of Ken
Bannister and Eddie Wilkins from those old Knicks-Indiana Pacers
games. ``We'd swarm Patrick with three, four guys. When you have a
star player who doesn't have the right people around him, it's hard
for him to be the star.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the hardest lesson for a man who carries the weight of a
NBA team that is sinking fast. The 22 points and 16 rebounds
produced by Van Horn in the Ewing-dominated 97-86 Knicks' victory
Sunday at Madison Square Garden would not define his afternoon's
work as much as his 16 missed shots, his inability to rise in the
closing moments and a costly turnover as he passed cross court out
of a double team on the left post with the Nets down a doable five.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not college any more,'' said Van Horn's protector,
Jayson Williams, who needs a legitimate center as a guardian for
himself, now that Rony Seikaly has beamed back to his usual
outpost, the injured list. ``You're not going to win your whole
career. Michael Jordan didn't win his whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan never lost this way, though, not even when his supporting
cast was more nightmare than Jordanaire. Van Horn is no heir to
Jordan, but nor was he supposed to be an Iverson or a Webber, the
young bull in a china shop, the centerpiece of a breakable team.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn and Tim Duncan were hailed as exceptions to the rule,
mature four-year college players lucky enough to land as rookies
last season where there was help. Now Duncan struggles with a
strangely disappointing San Antonio team, while Van Horn strokes
his goatee more than he does his jumper, as he ponders a season
riding, in part, on players named Doug Overton and Damon Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to maintain a semblance of calm amidst the dissension
and chaos that such underachievement begets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's upsetting and frustrating and we get mad at each other,''
said Van Horn, who finds himself the middle man between the jittery
John Calipari and the coach's physically banged-up and emotionally
worn-down troops.
</P>
<P>
   He took it upon himself to sit down with Calipari last week,
after a rock-bottom defeat to Charlotte. Someone asked Sunday if he
had called for management to be patient, and he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never once talked to Cal about keeping the team together,''
Van Horn said. ``I asked him to keep us together, to make sure our
heads stay in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no job for a player whose professional career has not
yet reached 100 games, whose life has been made tough enough by the
loss of the injured Sam Cassell. The peculiarly sassy point guard
was the Nets' creative eye, the difference for Van Horn and Kerry
Kittles between shots in the flow and those painfully contrived _
like Van Horn's blind, spinning adventure right into the Knicks'
defense with the Nets trailing by 85-80.
</P>
<P>
   He missed, badly, and on the Nets' next possession came the
aforementioned Van Horn turnover out of the double team. Then Allan
Houston scored, and Johnson successfully posted up Van Horn, and
the outcome was guaranteed. As was another night for Van Horn to
dwell on inadequacies, not assets.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't muscle Johnson on defense, couldn't create for
others on offense. Ewing, with 30 points, nine rebounds and four
blocked shots, didn't have to make a game-winning shot to beat the
Nets. For this day, he was the franchise player, the one, true
thing. There is no equivalent on a 3-13 team, and those with the
potential often start to wonder if they could become one someplace
else. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The original plan was to write a column about National
Procrastination Week last week, when it was observed. But one thing
and another came up and . . . well, here we are.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shame in procrastination. Serious procrastinators are
actually optimists in lazy clothing. If you continually put things
off until tomorrow, you assume that there is always going to be a
tomorrow. There's a comfort there.
</P>
<P>
   ``With procrastinators, there generally is a tomorrow,'' Les
Waas said. ``They seem to live longer than those people who are
anticrastinators (cool word; he made it up). They are the people
who are literally rushing through life. They rush into their graves
because they're uptight all the time, doing too much, more than
they have time to do, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   He would know. Waas, a semiretired advertising executive who
lives in Bryn Athyn, Pa., is the president of the Procrastinators
Club of America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was elected president in 1956,'' when the club was founded,
he said. ``The nominating committee still hasn't reported back for
1957.''
</P>
<P>
   Ba-da-boom. Waas is one of those people who should have a
drummer on hand for all his conversations. For instance, ask him
how one joins his august group, and he replies, ``Very slowly, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Or listen to him talk about club membership:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have half a million members in the U.S. alone who haven't
gotten around to joining yet,'' he said. ``We have 14,000
card-carrying members. I don't know what their hurry was.'' &QL; 
The week that
</P>
<P>
   Forget Procrastination Week. To hear Waas talk about
procrastination, it's clear that, for most of us, it's a year-round
activity, even if some of us won't admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do two things at a time,'' Waas said. ``That means
everybody's a procrastinator because anytime you're doing
something, you're putting off 100 other things.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, sort of. We all procrastinate on some level. Got a
leaky faucet you've been promising you'd fix? Well? What's stopping
you? I'm sure you're going to get to it right away, just as soon as
you finish your coffee and . . . hey, that ``Today'' show interview
with an expert on aging explaining how to keep dentures in pristine
shape looks good. The leaky faucet will wait.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's bigger than that. We live in a city, after all,
that managed to put off building a manageable freeway system until
so many people lived here that now, as soon as a new road is
finished, it's instantly choked with so much stop-and-go traffic
that a 3-year-old riding backward on a tricycle could get home
faster during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has something else to do. But don't confuse
procrastination with dereliction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procrastination is simply putting something off,'' Waas said.
``That means you do it. You just don't do it now. What we do is
wait till the last minute to do something. Then we have all that
time up front.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you do with the time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you want to,'' Waas said. ``If you want to go to the
movies, take a vacation, smell the flowers, you have time to do it.
That's what's important in life. Life isn't about working 20 hours
a day.'' &QL; 
You can join whenever
</P>
<P>
   Some would say he's right _ there are 24 hours in a day; if
you're working only 20, you're wasting four. Waas happily begs to
differ.
</P>
<P>
   And at 77, he's hoping he's right about all this. He's working
on the Big Procrastinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to put off demise for as long as I can,'' he said.
``I'd like to be the last one out.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you do want to join the Procrastinators Club,
send $21 to P.O. Box 712, Bryn Athyn, PA 19009. That'll get you a
lifetime membership. (``It wasn't supposed to be that way,'' Waas
said. ``It was supposed to be $5 a year. But we had a
procrastinator who was our treasurer. By the time he got all the
work done, everyone had moved.'')
</P>
<P>
   No hurry, though. It'll wait. &QL;

 &HT;    SEC gets 6, ACC only 3
 &HT;    (EDS: Updated version _ please use.)
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was joy at Auburn and the SEC but anger in the ACC on
Sunday as the 64-team field for the NCAA Tournament was announced
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing to Kentucky in the semifinals of the SEC
Tournament, Auburn (27-3) received the first No. 1 seed in school
history. The Tigers open Thursday against Winthrop, the Big South
champion, in the South Regional in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Six SEC teams (Auburn, Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida, Arkansas
and Mississippi) made the field, while a seventh, Mississippi
State, was passed over despite a 20-12 record. The Big Ten led all
conferences with seven teams.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC got only three teams in the tournament for the first
time since 1980. Duke, Maryland and North Carolina were top-three
seeds, but Wake Forest (16-13) and N.C. State (18-13) were left
out. Wake, which finished fourth in the ACC, lost its chance when
it fell to N.C. State in the second round of the conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people in the ACC are upset, but once the automatic
entries are put in place, you have to play your way in,'' said
Kentucky's C.M. Newton, chairman of the NCAA selection committee.
``I think it would have helped Wake Forest to win a game in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The other top seeds:
</P>
<P>
   _ Duke (32-3), which brings a 27-game winning streak into
Friday's first round of the East Regional in Charlotte, where it
beat North Carolina 96-73 Sunday in the ACC final. The Blue Devils
will open against 16th-seeded Florida A&AMP;M (12-18).
</P>
<P>
   _ Connecticut (28-2), which is the No. 1 seed in the West after
beating St. John's 82-63 for the Big East title. The Huskies open
with Texas-San Antonio on Thursday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michigan State (29-4), which beat Illinois 67-50 win the Big
Ten final Sunday. The Spartans, top seed in the Midwest, open
Friday in Milwaukee against Mount St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, Miami, Utah and Stanford were the No. 2 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (25-8), the defending national champion, drew a No. 3
seed in the Midwest and will open Thursday in New Orleans vs. New
Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   MEN'S TOURNAMENT
</P>
<P>
   _ TOP SEEDS: East _ Duke; South _ Auburn; Midwest _ Michigan
St.; West _ UConn.
</P>
<P>
   _ SEC: Arkansas (W4), Auburn (S1), Florida (W6), Kentucky (MW3),
Mississippi (MW9), Tennessee (E4).
</P>
<P>
   _ ACC: Duke (E1), North Carolina (W3), Maryland (S2).
</P>
<P>
   _ UNLIKELIEST CINDERELLA: Florida A&AMP;M, the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference tournament champion, owns a 12-18 record. The Rattlers
would have to win the title to finish .500.
</P>
<P>
   _ KNOWING THE ROPES: North Carolina is making its 25th
consecutive appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _ CONFERENCE CALL: The Big Ten's seven entries are the most of
any conference.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT
</P>
<P>
   _ TOP SEEDS: East _ Tennessee Mideast _ Connecticut; Midwest _
Purdue; West _ Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   _ SEC: Alabama (MW5), Auburn (E5), Florida (MW11), Georgia
(ME3), Kentucky (W6), LSU (W4), Mississippi State (MW7).
</P>
<P>
   _ ACC: Clemson (ME2), Duke (E3), North Carolina (MW4), N.C.
State (MW10), Virginia (W9).
</P>
<P>
   _ ONE AND DONE? Surprising Southern Conference tournament
champion Appalachian State's (14-14) run may be short. The 16th
seed plays at three-time champion Tennessee in its opener.
</P>
<P>
   _ SAME OLD, SAME OLD: Should Tennessee and Louisiana Tech win
out, the 1998 finalists would meet in the title game.

 &HT;    SEC makes history with 8 teams in field
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEC coaches have been griping for years that they don't get
enough NCAA Tournament teams, even though every year they get more
than any other conference. On Sunday afternoon, however, they got a
pleasant surprise that broke new ground.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in NCAA women's tournament history, a single
conference, the SEC, will be represented by eight teams. Florida
(19-13), which finished 6-8 in SEC play, also became the first
women's team ever to be selected with a losing conference record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've understood for a long time that it's the best conference
in the country,'' Georgia coach Andy Landers said. ``Getting eight
is a compliment to all the coaches and players in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also got three teams among the Top 16 seeds, one of them
being Georgia, the No. 3 seed in the Mideast. Second-ranked
Tennessee is the No. 1 seed in the East, while LSU, which toppled
the Lady Volunteers two weeks ago, is No. 4 in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Seven SEC teams finished at .500 or above in conference games,
but the selection of Florida reflects the NCAA women's basketball
committee's objective of choosing what it considered the best
teams. The Lady Gators also had a losing record in February, but
their win total and an RPI of 24 pushed them into the bracket as
the No. 11 seed in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had 19 wins in the No. 1-ranked conference in the
country,'' NCAA women's basketball committee chairwoman Bernadette
McGlade said. ``That's a pretty good season that most teams in the
country would take.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has had seven teams qualify two other times, but getting
eight usually has been viewed as a stretch. Mississippi State, the
only SEC team never to get invited, was made a No. 7 seed in the
Midwest. Auburn and Alabama got No. 5 seeds in the East and
Midwest, respectively, and Kentucky is the No. 6 seed in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time defending NCAA champion Tennessee (28-2) is the No. 1
seed in the East. But the Lady Vols have had several close calls
this year in trying to follow last year's 39-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Tennessee team that takes the court in March is expected
to win,'' said senior point guard Kellie Jolly. ``We're probably
not as much of a favorite as we were last year but we're still a
threat. And we know people are going to be out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Purdue is the No. 1 seed in the Midwest, while No. 3
Louisiana Tech got the top seed in the West. Connecticut took the
final No. 1 seed and was assigned to the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   The second seed there is Clemson, which won the ACC Tournament
and drew the highest NCAA seed in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC and Big 12 each got five teams in.Regular-season
champion Duke is No. 3 in the East and North Carolina is No. 4 in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Other firsts included multiple berths for two minor conferences.
Even though Maine and Santa Clara lost in their conference
tournaments in the American East and West Coast, respectively, they
were included because of high RPI numbers. Conversely, the Big 10
and Pac 10, which usually send five teams each, were held to four
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried not to worry about what everyone would say and tried
to put the best teams in the tournament,'' McGlade said. ``There
were some good teams that didn't get in because there were only
four places. The 64th team this year is much stronger than it was
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   There are seven teams making their first NCAA appearances,
including Cal State-Northridge, winner of the Big Sky Conference.
The Matadors have played this season under an interim coach after
their former coach was charged with drug trafficking in October.
</P>
<P>
   There are no losing teams among the group of 64, but Appalachian
State evened its record at 14-14 by winning the Southern Conference
tournament. For their troubles, the Lady Mountaineers get to play
Tennessee Saturday in the first round.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a short walk across Auburn Avenue Sunday, the
faithful members of Ebenezer Baptist Church left the cramped
sanctuary where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had preached
his gospel of nonviolence, and consecrated an airy new church that
they dedicated to the legacy of his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 11 years of planning, fund raising and
construction to enable the congregants to take their brief journey
from a farewell service in their old church to the ribbon-cutting
of their new one. Many acknowledged that they felt conflicting
emotions as they left behind the bittersweet history of the simple
sanctuary where King, his father, and his maternal grandfather all
preached, where King's funeral was held, and where his mother was
killed by a deranged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   But as the procession crossed the street, led by young girls
dressed in white gowns with angels' wings, any misgivings seemed to
dissolve. The congregants settled into their new pews, with King's
sister, Christine King Farris, taking a seat in the fourth row. The
110 members of the choir, their shoulders draped with scarves of
kinte cloth, tested the acoustics by belting out ``We Have Come
Into This House.'' The Rev. Joseph L. Roberts Jr. used a rousing
sermon to emphasize that his church was making a statement by
staying in a struggling inner-city neighborhood rather than fleeing
with other churches to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we could have moved away,'' Roberts shouted in a resonant
baritone. ``Yes, we could have gone to the suburbs. But this is the
place for which Christ died.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying a particularly athletic riff behind his new
lectern, completed with a gyrating twirl, the 60-year-old Roberts
smiled with satisfaction at his preacher's version of a zero-to-60
test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to like this place,'' he said, as his parishioners
chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for Ebenezer's move was the need for more
space. Each year, 500,000 tourists visit the church, many for
Sunday services, and members and visitors often struggle to squeeze
into 750 seats. The new $8 million sanctuary seats more than 1,700.
</P>
<P>
   But the move also holds great promise for preservation and the
development of Atlanta's King historic district into a significant
tourist attraction. The original church will be leased by the
National Park Service, which plans to spend $2 million to restore
the building and use it for daily programs about the history of
Ebenezer and the role of the black church in the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the latest effort by the park service to broaden the
appeal of the district, which includes King's birth home, his
crypt, a visitor's center, a firehouse and the Martin Luther King
Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. The park service is
negotiating with the King family to buy the King Center and the
house where King lived as an adult, as well as a large number of
artifacts, including clothing and the funeral wagon that carried
his casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible opportunity for us to tell the story,''
said Frank Catroppa, superintendent of the Martin Luther King Jr.
National Historic Site.
</P>
<P>
   For most of King's life, Ebenezer Baptist Church was home. His
grandfather, the Rev. A.D. Williams, Ebenezer's second pastor,
built the modest red-brick church, which was completed in 1922. His
father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., succeeded Williams as
pastor in 1931. After beginning his ministerial career in
Montgomery, Ala., Martin Luther King Jr. joined Ebenezer as
co-pastor in 1960 and remained in that position until his
assassination in April 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Historians who have studied King's preaching at Ebenezer detect
an unusual sense of calm and comfort in his voice. He was more
relaxed and self-revealing there, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whenever Martin Luther King Jr. came back to Ebenezer
it was like returning to the bosom of a community that had nurtured
him and supported him throughout his whole life,'' said Richard A.
Lischer, a professor of homiletics at Duke University and the
author of ``The Preacher King'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).
``I've listened to many tapes of King preaching in Ebenezer, and
there's always this great sense of weariness from all the travel
and struggle, and yet there is this tremendous sense of relief that
is audible in his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   King delivered his first and last sermons at Ebenezer, and
old-timers still recall the Sunday mornings when the young preacher
sought to stir the crowd with sophisticated oratory while his
father, seated behind him, implored him to ``make it plain, M.L.,
make it plain.''

 ATLANTA: it plain.''

<P>
   They also recall the unimaginable day in 1974, six years after
King's assassination, when Marcus Wayne Chenault Jr. entered the
church with two pistols and began firing, killing a deacon and
King's mother, Alberta Williams King, as she sat at the organ
playing ``The Lord's Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Ebenezer, which will be called the Heritage Sanctuary,
is not a fancy church, a point of some pride for longtime members
who remember its working-class origins. Its exterior is advertised
with a simple neon cross, and the interior, with its sagging
balcony and peeling paint, is overwhelmed by the brilliant burgundy
of its carpeting, pew cushions and baptismal drapery.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer always has been the kind of church where members will
pointedly hand an open hymnal to visitors who dare not join in the
singing. Its leaders boast not just of its history, but of its
continued commitment to social justice through youth mentoring
programs and a food co-operative.
</P>
<P>
   The striking new building, which will be called the Horizon
Sanctuary, is set diagonally to Auburn Avenue so that its axis
travels through King's crypt. The architects, the Atlanta husband
and wife team of William J. Stanley III and Ivenue Love-Stanley,
gave the church a conical shape that resembles a ram's horn. Its
stepped, arched roof, overlaid in copper, is intended to recall an
African hut, and an adjacent bell tower is patterned after an
African obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   Stained glass windows, which have yet to be designed, will trace
the passage of Africans to the United States and their progress
from slavery to civil rights. Roberts is particularly eager for the
installation of a mosaic that will depict ``a Jesus of a darker
hue'' than the white image in stained glass over the altar of the
Heritage Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer searched for years for a site for its new building, and
ultimately found an ideal solution through a three-way deal. The
city of Atlanta gave the National Park Service a piece of land
directly across the street from the old church, and the Park
Service then gave part of the parcel to the church in exchange for
a 99-year lease on the Heritage Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Although 96 percent of the church's approximately 1,600 members
now live outside the Sweet Auburn neighborhood, which was a black
commercial center in segregated Atlanta, Roberts stressed that it
was vital for Ebenezer's ministry to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King never ran to the suburbs,'' Roberts
preached. ``Martin Luther King didn't stay in the Peabody Hotel but
in the Lorraine Motel,'' he said referring to a luxury hotel in
Memphis and the motel at which he was staying when he was
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King didn't stay with the high and mighty, but
in his death he identified with garbage workers. If we're ever
going to make our society better we've got to stop running away
from our problems.''

CATCHERS TO SHARE STARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ One of the Angels' most pressing questions this
spring involves the catching situation. It seems the Angels will
not have a designated everyday catcher, instead dividing the duties
among three.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are hoping Todd Greene, depending on the health of
his surgically repaired right shoulder, will be able to catch two
or three times a week. Matt Walbeck, who signed a two-year contract
during the off-season, will get his share of starts behind the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining starts will go either to veteran Charlie O'Brien
or Phil Nevin, who can also play first and third base but only
began catching two years ago. One will make the team, the other
won't.
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck, who hit .257 in 108 games for the Angels last year,
says the foursome doesn't talk about the situation among
themselves, but they get along well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things you don't have control over,'' he
said. ``It's a lot of wasted emotion to talk about it or even think
about it. With Todd's situation, he hasn't caught much and it will
be difficult to jump right in there. So we all have to be able to
step in and do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, 37, is the best at throwing out potential basestealers
and calling a game. In other words, he's a pitcher's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can catch,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``He also has a
plan of what he wants to do. He's one of those guys who knows what
he does best and makes sure that stays sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scratches: First baseman Mo Vaughn and third baseman Dave
Hollins were scratched from Sunday's game just before game time,
partly because of the weather conditions _ cool and light rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo's legs are real tight,'' Collins said. ``All of a sudden it
got so cold and they tightened up again.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins participated in a strenuous throwing workout with coach
Larry Bowa on Saturday, and his arm was too sore to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   __ First look at Belcher: Pitcher Tim Belcher made his debut in
an Angels uniform Sunday afternoon in the Angels' 9-8 win over the
Oakland A's at Tempe Diablo Stadium. He went 22/3 innings, allowing
five runs (all earned) and four hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically I felt really good; the ball was jumping out of my
hand a lot better,'' he said. ``You hope the results follow, but if
they don't, you try not to dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won the game in the 10th inning on Keith Luuloa's
two-out RBI single, scoring Steve Decker from second base. Jim
Edmonds, Chris Pritchett, Tim Salmon and Jeff Huson each had two
hits for the Angels. Salmon also hit his second homer of the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   __ Appier available:A former teammate of Belcher's in Kansas
City, Kevin Appier, is on the trading block. And Belcher said he
believes Appier, 31 and coming back from arm surgery, could help
any team, including the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't hesitate to add him to this club,'' Belcher said of
the former Antelope Valley High and Antelope Valley College star.
``If he's healthy, he could put someone over the top. Having said
that, I'm not saying we NEED someone like him.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels currently have Omar Olivares, Jason Dickson and
Jarrod Washburn competing for the No. 5 spot in the starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   __ Next: The Angels travel to Peoria, Ariz., to play the
Mariners today at 12:05 p.m. Ken Hill will start for the Angels
against the Mariners' Jeff Fassero.

SPORTS COLUMN: THAT MARCH RITUAL REACHES 60 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the nation's most compelling sports rituals was set in
motion Sunday: 64 Division I men's college basketball teams set
sail for four regions where they will begin the pursuit of a
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the 60th anniversary of the annual rite called
March Madness. In 1939 the University of Oregon defeated Ohio State
University in the championship game of the first tournament. That
tournament was sponsored by the National Association of Basketball
Coaches, who turned it over to the National Collegiate Athletic
Association after the tournament lost $2,531. In the intervening
years it has grown from eight teams in two divisions to 64 teams in
four regions. The tournament has introduced a vocabulary of its
own, with terms such as ``ratings percentage index'' and ``on the
bubble'' assuming as much significance as ``pick and roll'' and
``give and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the tournaments has had its own character. Some were
characterized by sensational runs of upsets. In 1963 _ in the
pre-robber baron era of college basketball when it was possible for
an underdog to actually win _tiny Loyola upset the two-time
defending champion, Cincinnati, in overtime. In the late '60s and
'70s, on the other hand, the tournament was known as the UCLA
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   This year the tournament has the traditional plots and subplots.
The tone was set on Saturday when Lamar Odom's long, arduous fight
to play college basketball paid off in dramatic fashion, with his
game-winning shot sending Rhode Island into the tournament for the
second straight season. After first signing with Nevada-Las Vegas,
Odom decided to transfer to Rhode Island after being accused, with
others, of cheating on tests. He finally won his fight to prove he
qualified legitimately, but missed a year of basketball. After the
game Saturday, a tearful Odom said: ``I just know that everything
that I was going through was the past. I just knew my day would
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears. The tournament always offers plenty of tears. Last year
Coach Jim Harrick was seconds away from taking Rhode Island to the
first Final Four in school history when his team crumbled before
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For all the intriguing plots that will arise, this year's
tournament should come down to three questions.
</P>
<P>
   First, a standard question: Will Kentucky repeat? Last year was
a feel-good year: Tubby Smith, the first African-American head
coach at Kentucky, won a championship in his first season. This
season has been all about basketball, and it has been more
difficult. The Wildcats will have to defend their title as the
third-seeded team in a murderous Midwest region.
</P>
<P>
   Second: Will Connecticut finally reach the Final Four? For eight
years now, the nation has watched Coach Jim Calhoun build a strong
foundation only to fumble with the final brick. In 1990, the
Huskies lost in the East Regional final to Duke on a buzzer-beating
shot by Christian Laettner in overtime. In 1994, Donyell Marshall
missed two free throws with three seconds left and the game tied in
the East Regional semifinal, and the Huskies lost to Florida in
overtime. In 1995, the Huskies were beaten by the eventual
champion, UCLA, in the West Regional final. In 1996, with point
guard Ricky Moore injured, UConn fell to Mississippi State in the
Southeast Regional final. Last year they lost to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Calhoun, repeating what has become his mantra,
said, ``If we reach the Final Four I will not be a better coach,
and if we don't make it I won't be a worse coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally: Will Duke win the national championship? For some the
question is simpler: By how many points will Duke win?
</P>
<P>
   The experts call No. 1-ranked Duke the most prohibitive favorite
to win the NCAA tournament since the 1992 Duke team repeated as
national champion. The Blue Devils won a school-record 26
consecutive games and became the first Atlantic Coast Conference
team to go 16-0 in league play. Pete Gillen, the Virginia coach,
declared: ``Nobody's going to beat Duke. Who's going to beat them?
It's going to be boring. They're a wrecking machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillen's comments are a bit self-serving: Virginia lost two
regular-season games to the Blue Devils by 46 points each. Then it
lost by 37 in the ACC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If only Duke could play Virginia for the next three weeks. As
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski knows, this tournament is a funny
animal. For many years Krzyzewski was like Calhoun. He took his
team to the brink but could not cross that River Jordan. The lowest
point came in 1990, when his team was routed by UNLV, 103-73, in
the national championship game. Then Grant Hill happened. The next
year Duke finally won the elusive championship _ it beat an even
better UNLV team _ and repeated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure that Duke fans understood _ or understand _ how
central Hill was to carrying the Blue Devils into the promised
land. Duke has not been to the Final Four in five years. In 1995,
with Krzyzewski missing most of the season because of a back
ailment, Duke dropped to 13-18. Last year Duke was a game away from
the Final Four but blew a 17-point second-half lead in the South
Regional final to the eventual champion, Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Now they carry a 31-1 record into the tournament. It could be a
heavy burden to carry, but only time will tell. It's March. It's
mad, and it's finally here.

RUSH LIMBAUGH TAKES HIS SHOW TO THE INTERNET  
 AFTER THE INTERVIEW: THE GOOD AND THE TAWDRY  
 GANNETT WITHDRAWS ADS FROM JOURNALISM REVIEW  
 POZ APOLOGIZES FOR DIRECT MAILING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last few years, Rush Limbaugh, the blustery conservative
radio talk-show host, resisted taking his radio show to the
Internet, even though an increasing number of syndicated radio
programs were being sent online to homes and offices throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until last Monday, when his show began broadcasting _
or ``streaming,'' as a technophile would say _ over the Internet at
Broadcast.com, a Web site that broadcasts audio and video over the
Internet ranging from radio and television programs to full-length
compact discs and audio books.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh said that he had waited to begin streaming his show to
protect the more than 600 radio stations that carry his program _
affiliates in the industry lexicon _ from losing listeners to the
Internet, which transmits his show without the local commercials
carried by the affiliates and the advertising dollars that pay for
them.
</P>
<P>
   But Limbaugh said that there had been ``such a public demand''
to hear his show from people who ``cannot get a radio signal in an
office building,'' that he and the producers of his show, which is
owned by the Premiere Radio Networks unit of Jacor Communications,
decided it was the right time to move to the Internet. He noted
that many of his affiliates were now streaming programs on the
Internet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of his efforts to protect his affiliates, listeners
will not be able to download his show and listen to it at any time,
as they can with many other programs. The ``Rush Limbaugh Show''
will only be available live, from noon to 3 p.m. Eastern standard
time.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harrison, the editor of Talkers, a talk-radio trade
publication, said that while Limbaugh might be one of the last
big-name radio hosts to begin streaming a show _ Dr. Laura
Schlessinger's program, another widely listened-to syndicated radio
show, has been available on the Internet for almost two years _ the
medium is still in its nascent stages and the number of Internet
listeners is minuscule compared with the estimated 20 million
people Limbaugh's radio show draws every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new technology and there was no reason for him to jump
in early,'' Harrison said. ``But it's become apparent that
eventually this is where people are going to be, and he knows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG
</P>
<P>
   After the Interview: The Good and the Tawdry
</P>
<P>
   A few final observations before the Monica Lewinsky interview
fades into history:
</P>
<P>
   BEST POSTMODERN MOMENT: MSNBC's ``Hockenberry'' producers,
knowing they couldn't beat 'em, tried to join 'em. MSNBC promotions
urged viewers to tune in to John Hockenberry's 10 p.m. talk show
using the picture-in-a-picture mode, if they had it, or during
commercials on ABC's ``20/20.'' For the latter group,
``Hockenberry'' even put a clock on the screen showing how many
minutes remained in ABC commercials before the interview resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, ABC's ``Good Morning America'' had a blitz of
postinterview reportage that included a segment on the
``Hockenberry'' gambit. That's an ABC station reporting on an NBC
cable network reporting on an ABC News prime-time interview _ a
real media pretzel.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MEDIA SCOLDING: Ted Koppel had Barbara Walters and Joe
Klein of The New Yorker on ABC News' ``Nightline'' after the
interview. Toward the end, Klein held forth about the private lives
of public figures providing ``the stuff of fiction forever'' (both
he and Shakespeare had done it, Klein said, although ``Shakespeare
did it far more profoundly'').
</P>
<P>
   But Klein, the ``anonymous'' author of ``Primary Colors,'' went
on to say that the ``reality'' of the Clinton-Lewinsky saga and the
media's coverage of it was ``just kind of embarrassing and tawdry,
and it diminishes all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel bordered on indignant in response, telling Klein: ``It
was unbecoming in the way, yes, that it was handled by the press,
by politicians, but in large measure unbecoming because of the way
in which the president himself handled it. So before you start
slapping all kinds of blame around left and right, I think we need
to bring it back where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCE AND REALITY: In some instances, it seemed advertisers
on the interview program were well aware of the surroundings in
which their commercials would be shown. Victoria's Secret, for
example, owned by Intimate Brands Inc., ran a sultry,
black-and-white spot promoting its lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Of several commercials now running for Diet Dr Pepper, Cadbury
Schweppes PLC chose to run one set at a make-believe congressional
hearing; at one point, a young woman runs up to a can of the soft
drink and shouts dramatically, ``No, no, tell them that you're
diet!''
</P>
<P>
   And a promotion for a program on ABC on May 23 about Cleopatra
began, ``When she was 20, she seduced the most powerful man in the
world.''

   Gannett Withdraws Ads From Journalism Review
</P>
<P>
   In journalism, as in so many other endeavors, timing is
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Editors and reporters make statements not just by printing
articles but by deciding when to print them _ or not print them.
Advertisers, too, can make statements, not just by buying
advertisements but by choosing when to buy them _ or withdraw them.
</P>
<P>
   So the staff at American Journalism Review, the monthly magazine
published by the University of Maryland's College of Journalism,
could not help but wonder whether Gannett Co. was making a
statement in January when it pulled all its annual advertising _
about eight pages, according to AJR's editor, Rem Rieder. ``I was
surprised,'' he said, noting that Gannett had advertised in the
magazine for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a few weeks before Rieder learned about Gannett's
decision, the magazine published an article titled ``Editor Inc.,''
part of a series of wide-ranging, in-depth reports in a project
called the State of the American Newspaper. The article, by Geneva
Overholser, a former Gannett editor, took some not-so-subtle swipes
at her old bosses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, discussing the cuts she was required to make in
the newsroom budget of The Des Moines Register in her last year as
editor there in 1995, she wrote: ``Having already removed heart,
soul and giblets, we cut some more _ another $63,000 in newsroom
spending. Very shortly thereafter, we learned that during the
months we were engaged in these hope-withering negotiations,
Gannett earnings were up 22 percent over the previous year's fourth
quarter.''

   Contacted last week, a Gannett spokeswoman, Mimi Feller, said,
``We have realigned some ad spending beginning last fall and going
on forward, by starting to put some dollars into campus newspapers,
because early recruiting is so important for us. So what we've done
is cut some of the dollars for trade'' publications like AJR.

   Poz Apologizes for Direct Mailing
</P>
<P>
   Some magazines tell their subscribers that if they do not want
their names rented out to other companies hawking merchandise, the
readers can check a box on the subscription form, or call a
toll-free number to protect their names and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Poz magazine, a monthly publication for
HIV-positive readers, privacy is an especially serious issue. The
magazine gives out free subscriptions to people who will declare on
a subscription form that they are HIV positive. Issues are
delivered to subscribers in a nondescript envelope.
</P>
<P>
   So when several thousand subscribers to Poz who had specifically
requested that their names not be rented out to other companies
found a letter from Community Prescription Services, with
information about a new HIV treatment, in their mailboxes last
month, they were alarmed. Had their wishes not been honored? And
did Community Prescription Services know their HIV status?
</P>
<P>
   The mailing was a mistake, said Sean Strub, an owner and
chairman of Poz Publishing LLC. In a letter of apology mailed to
those subscribers two weeks ago, Strub wrote, ``This was a terrible
mistake that makes it appear that we do not respect readers'
privacy or the option we so clearly gave readers not to have their
names exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the mistake ``demonstrates that even with the best
intentions, once a name is on a list it is never 100 percent
private'' and that the publishers of Poz ``are extremely aware of
the dangers of involuntary disclosure and believe strongly in our
readers' rights to keep their names private.''
</P>
<P>
   Community Prescription Services, he noted in the letter, is a
sister company to Poz Publishing, but he wrote that the company's
affiliation was no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Strub also owns Metamorphics Media, a direct-marketing company
that controls several mailing lists. Critics have said that Strub,
through Metamorphics, could take unfair advantage of his Poz
subscriber list.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for that reason, we have to be doubly safe with this sort
of thing,'' he said. ``This time, we were not. To the recipient who
checked the box saying `I don't want to receive any other
mailings,' and then they got something from another company, this
was a violation. And we are sorry.''

MODERATE CONSERVATIVE LEADS SALVADORAN VOTE

<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ A moderate candidate from the
governing conservative party led the voting Sunday in El Salvador's
second presidential election since the end of its civil war seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An early survey of voters leaving polling stations showed
Francisco Flores, the 39-year-old candidate of the governing
Nationalist Republican Alliance, with a comfortable lead over
Facundo Guardado, 44, his opponent from a coalition led by the
country's former guerrilla movement, the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   Among five other candidates, Ruben Zamora, the FMLN presidential
candidate in the last election but now the candidate of his own
Democratic Center Union, drew the third largest block of votes,
about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among 3.1 million registered voters appeared low after
an election campaign dominated by the grave problems that have
plagued El Salvador since its 12-year civil war ended _ rampant
crime, high unemployment, inflation and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that despite the end of the war, the fundamental
problems of the country have not been solved like they had
expected,'' said Jose Miguel Cruz, director of the Public Opinion
University Institute at the Central American University.
</P>
<P>
   But the disillusionment of Salvadorans was not enough to turn
voters away from the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or ARENA,
which had suffered serious losses to the party of the former
guerrillas in municipal an legislative elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ARENA, which was founded in the early 1980s by leaders of El
Salvador's right-wing death squads but has since cultivated a
moderate image, united after the losses of 1997 behind Flores, a
candidate known in the national assembly for building consensus. He
seemed to epitomize the party's message of ``renovation and
openness.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, FMLN, after much infighting, rejected broadening
its appeal and settled on Guardadoa, a leftist activist and
moderate ex-guerrilla commander who himself had pushed for the
selection of a centrist candidate from an allied party.

WHAT HATH DRUDGE WROUGHT? PARTISAN WEB SITES GAIN SOME MEDIA
CREDIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rash of telephone calls started coming in to Doug Thompson,
the publisher of Capitol Hill Blue, a four-year-old Web site, about
three weeks ago. Journalists from a broadcast news organization,
from U.S. News &AMP; World Report, and from several British and
American newspapers, wanted his Web publication to help them reach
the sources for an article he had published.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson refused to help them. Reporters, he said in an
interview last week, do not ask for other reporters' sources. In an
editorial on his Web site _ a rant, in Webspeak _ he scoffed at the
idea that he should ``trust the mainstream media that has either
ignored the mounting evidence'' against President Clinton or
``rushed to his defense whenever legitimate stories were published
about his many high crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's telephone calls tell a tale. A year after the gossipy
Web site run by Matt Drudge became a bookmark in Washington
computers, other, more partisan Web sites are becoming early
warning systems for the mainstream press. Like talk radio, they are
filled with free-form invective. Like trailers from a new X-Files
movie, they offer previews of coming attractions from places where
conspiracy is king.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening with Capitol Hill Blue reminds me of the
early days of Drudge,'' said Stephen G. Smith, the editor of U.S.
News &AMP; World Report, who confirmed that his reporters were among
those who called Thompson last month. ``It has caught on as an
early warning sign of stories coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   It became clear last week that journalists in some corners of
the mainstream press check in with Capitol Hill Blue. Last Monday,
for the first time, The Hotline, the capital's most widely used
daily electronic tip sheet, used material from Capitol Hill Blue
and a liberal site called American Politics. Hotline is a summary
of all things political, from newspaper coverage of candidates to
the most recent polling data.
</P>
<P>
   An offshoot of the National Journal, an eminently respectable
magazine, The Hotline, according to Smith of U.S. News, is ``beamed
directly into the consciousness'' of Washington politicians and
journalists every weekday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Crawford, the editor of The Hotline, said he decided to
include chatter from the two partisan Web sites in his daily
round-up in part because some British newspapers, like The Daily
Telegraph, had begun passing on Capitol Hill Blue's reports. ``It's
hard to discern when you see something if it is the next NBC
interview or the next love-child fiasco,'' Crawford said. The
Hotline earlier this year included in its daily summary both the
reports about the then-unbroadcast NBC interview with Juanita
Broaddrick, who accused the president of sexually assaulting her 21
years ago, and unfounded tabloid speculation about an illegitimate
child fathered by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drudge may have started it,'' Crawford added, ``but there are
many more Drudges out there, and more to come.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Capitol Hill Blue began as a one-man operation four years ago.
Then Thompson, 51, added three unpaid contributors, all older than
55 with backgrounds at newspapers. Thompson began his career as a
journalist before working as an aide to Republicans like Manuel
Lujan, the former representative from New Mexico. He is now a
public relations consultant but said he began the Web site because
``I'm an ex-newspaperman who wanted to get back into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   His site, established in 1994, is emblazoned with a motto
derived from one of Mark Twain's celebrated remarks: ``Because
nobody's life, liberty or property is safe while Congress is in
session.'' It carries the news the four contributors generate and
news from syndicated services like The Washington Post-Los Angeles
Times news service. It also features news photos and political
cartoons from major syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue needed to pay for such features comes from banner
advertisements from businesses like The Wall Street Journal's
interactive edition and Macy's. Thompson said advertising revenue
covered the $20,000 a month needed to pay for these features and
the three computer servers the site uses.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the news that appears on a site like Free Republic
is the news the stridently conservative readers bring to it. Free
Republic, a Web-based discussion group run by a former software
company executive in Fresno, Calif., posts the full text of
articles from major newspapers and asks for comment. The site is
being sued for copyright violation by The Los Angeles Times and The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his readers, the site's owner, Jim Robinson,
said: ``We're basically just a group of individuals, conservatives,
who are debating what we can do to roll back some of the liberal
laws and agencies. The government has overstepped its limits, in
our opinion.'' Robinson, who works on the site 18 hours a day, and
says it is supported by reader donations.
</P>
<P>
   For Mark Hosenball, an investigative reporter in Newsweek's
Washington bureau, Free Republic is ``more entertainment and a
study in abnormal psychology than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   For Smith of U.S. News and World Report, checking in on the
conservative sites is a necessary part of the routine. ``It's
defensive editing,'' he said. ``If there's going to be a freight
train moving down the tracks, better to hear the vibrations
early.''

ST. JOHN'S GETS ITS WISH: NO HOOPLA AND NO DUKE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing against Boston, but you could not miss the
relief when the East Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament was announced Sunday and St.John's was not
in that bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to Boston,'' exulted Dermon Player, a St.
John's assistant coach, as his boss, Mike Jarvis, applauded.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's is going to Disney World, or, more specifically,
Orlando, Fla., where the Red Storm (25-8) will be seeded third and
will face 14th-seeded Samford (24-5), the Trans America Athletic
Conference champion, in the first round of the South Regional on
Thursday. In going South, St. John's avoids what would have been an
overwhelming amount of attention for the return of Jarvis, a
Cambridge, Mass., native, but also top-seeded Duke.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck for Miami, though. The Hurricanes, who lost to St.
John's in the semifinals of the Big East tournament, but who beat
the Red Storm twice in the regular season, were rewarded with a No.
2 seeding in the East, which means that they could play Duke in the
regional final at the Meadowlands to advance to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy we're not in the East,'' said Jarvis, whose team
lost to Duke in overtime in January. ``If I had gone back to
Boston, the media would have been so uncontrollable. There would
have been far too much emphasis on me. And if we're going to play
Duke again, let it be in the Final Four. Right now, there isn't
another team today that can beat Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of St. John's draw is that it
holds the potential for what would be a dramatic second-round game.
If St. John's gets by Samford _ forward Ron Artest said he
accidentally watched Samford highlights on television a few weeks
ago because he thought the announcer said Stanford _ it would play
the winner of the game between the 6th- and 11th-seeded teams. Pick
your poison: Bobby Knight and Indiana (No. 6) or George Washington,
the team Jarvis coached for eight years before leaving for St.
John's last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonials, who are now coached by Tom Penders, got an
at-large bid out of the Atlantic 10 and Indiana comes from one of
the nation's toughest conference, the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis wears a huge ring on his right hand commemorating 1993,
the year he took the Colonials on a wild run to the Sweet 16. But
Jarvis is ambivalent about seeing his former team in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I chose the field, I would not have George Washington in my
bracket,'' he said. ``Only because I'd much rather be rooting for
them rather than playing against them. I'll wish them well. And if
we play them, I'll have to forget about the fact I recruited
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, St. John's appears to have been placed in
one of the more manageable brackets. Not one of the region's top
four seeded teams _ Auburn, Maryland, St. John's and Ohio State _
is a conference champion. If St. John's gets out of the first
weekend, though, it would have a tough meeting in the Sweet 16 in
Knoxville, Tenn., likely with Maryland, which lost to North
Carolina in the Atlantic Coast Conference semifinals but has spent
much of the season in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse is the No. 8-seeded team in the South and, if it beats
ninth-seeded Oklahoma State, would likely face top-seeded Auburn in
the second round. Villanova, which beat St. John's in the last game
of the regular season, is seeded eighth in the Midwest, and faces
Mississippi in the first round. Rutgers, which has been on the
bubble for the last few weeks, did not make it and will be in the
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, St. John's assistants were tucking into their
offices, preparing for an all-nighter of scouting Samford, since
nobody knew much about it. Jarvis didn't even know what city it was
in (Birmingham, Ala.). Since St. John's tapes every game on
television anywhere, Jarvis was sure there had to be a tape of the
Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a primer on Samford: Its big victory of the season was
over Tulane on Dec. 1. its second-year coach is Jim Tillette and he
was the conference coach of the year. Its star player is the junior
forward Reed Rawlings (6 feet 7 inches, 225 pounds), the
conference's player of the year, who is averaging 16.6 points per
game in the team's motion offense that features pick-and-rolls and
backdoor plays.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last season, St. John's was in a similar
predicament, knowing little more about its first-round opponent,
Detroit, than that the television analyst Dick Vitale had once
coached there. It apparently didn't learn fast enough because
Detroit beat the Red Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what we're getting into,'' point guard Erick
Barkley said of Samford. ``But I guarantee you, what happened last
year with Detroit will not happen again. We're not coming home so
fast.'' &QL;

RANGERS WIN BATTLE BUT LOSE SAMUELSSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With two regular defensemen already out of the lineup
with injuries, the New York Rangers could not afford to lose any
more, especially in a game with serious implications for the
playoff race. But one went down, early, against the Boston Bruins
on Sunday in the Fleet Center. He was Ulf Samuelsson, knocked
unconscious and bleeding from the face, by Ken Belanger's vicious
board check.
</P>
<P>
   So with five defensemen left to fill six roles, the Rangers
could not afford to lose any more. But they did, for about a
minute, when Brian Leetch limped to the locker room after blocking
a shot with his right leg while killing a penalty near the end of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Without Leetch, their captain and leader in minutes played, the
Rangers would have had a hard time preserving their two-goal lead,
winning the game and extending their unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   But Leetch came back for the third period, the streak grew to
five games, and the Rangers beat the Bruins by 3-1 to move within 2
points of the Bruins in the Eastern Conference standing. The
Rangers (27-28-8, 62 points) are in ninth place in the conference.
The Bruins (27-26-10, 64 points) hold the eighth and final playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting on the bench going, `Please, not Leetchie!'''
said Marc Savard, who helped set up the clinching goal by Kevin
Stevens. He said some players stopped by the trainer's room during
the second intermission to make sure Leetch would be able to return
for the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson, who probably sustained a concussion, will be
re-examined Monday and is unlikely to play against the Toronto
Maple Leafs at Madison Square Garden in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first game of a busy stretch, with the Rangers playing
five games in the next eight days. It is very likely they will use
defenseman Stan Neckar, who has not suited up for the last five
games. Defenseman Peter Popovic, out since Feb. 14 with an eye
injury, is expected to resume practice this week. Defenseman Jeff
Beukeboom's return from his second concussion of the season is
still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's was the second consecutive victory for the Rangers, who
are 4-0-1 in their last five games. The Rangers were outshot by
38-18, and their best performer was goalie Mike Richter. They lost
all but 17 of 42 face-offs. But they got a slap-shot goal by John
MacLean and a short-handed goal by Niklas Sundstrom in the second
period for a 2-0 lead. After Boston's Landon Wilson cut the lead to
2-1 at 12 minutes 25 seconds of the third period, Stevens scored
1:26 later to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   He fired a one-timer after Rumun Ndur banked a pass off the
boards for Savard, who gambles by leaving the defensive zone early
but rarely gets burned. ``I didn't see him, but I heard him,'' Ndur
said. Savard said, ``I saw an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who scored his 16th goal of the season, said MacLean
helped by going to the net, taking the coverage with him and
leaving goalie Byron Dafoe exposed for a one-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger's hit against Samuelsson came at 15:04 of the first
period, after Belanger exited the penalty box after serving his
roughing minor. He charged across the ice and crunched Samuelsson
from behind, earning a major penalty for boarding and an ejection.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston fans cheered the sight of an obviously injured
Samuelsson. They dislike him because of altercations years ago with
Cam Neely, the former Bruin, when Samuelsson played for Pittsburgh.
Samuelsson stayed on the ice for more than a minute and needed help
to stay upright after he was revived.
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, the Ranger coach, said the hit was ``about as bad
as you can get.'' In a lighthearted remark, he said: ``Sammy says
he's back on the planet.'' But the coach did not specify which
planet, and Samuelsson was not able to speak with reporters. Leetch
said: ``Ulfie never saw him coming. It was a bad hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch played 35:12 and seemed weary at the end, missing an open
Savard with a pass and getting beaten by Wilson on the Boston goal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the unbeaten streak and the final 19 games of the
regular season, Leetch said: ``You see the end of the season. You
see the playoffs. You want to be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter, referring to the result and the developing team
personality, said: ``That was an important win for us. It kept our
momentum going. We'll look back on this one, I think. There's a
feeling on this team this year that we are a more competitive
squad. We feel capable of beating anyone on a given night.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Wednesday, they face the Maple Leafs and the
Ottawa Senators, the top two teams in the conference, and possible
playoff opponents for whoever finishes eighth.

<P>
   The Duke Blue Devils officially became prohibitive favorites.
Their most formidable potential opponent, Connecticut, will have to
win out West to get to them. And the balance of power in college
basketball appears to have shifted to the East and Midwest. Or at
least that appeared to be the meaning of the invitations and
seedings announced Sunday for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1-ranked Blue Devils (32-1) will begin their national
title campaign as the top-seeded team in the East Region on Friday,
in their home state of North Carolina. They topped off a dominating
year by thumping North Carolina, 96-73, in the Atlantic Coast
Conference tournament final Sunday in Charlotte, and they will
return there Friday against the team with the worst record in the
field of 64: Florida A&AMP;M, the champion of the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference tournament despite a 12-18 record.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said that even if the Blue Devils did
not win the tournament, after being selected as the nation's
toughest team, ``we'll know that we did everything we could to try
to win it and we didn't let pressure stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (28-1) was made the top-seeded team in the West
Regional and will try once again to get to its first Final Four
beginning Thursday against Texas-San Antonio (18-10) in Denver.
Like Duke, Connecticut captured its regular season and conference
tournament championships in impressive fashion, whipping St. John's
by 82-63 to win the Big East on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn came out second, but had to go out of the region because
Duke was the top seed,'' said C.M. Newton, chairman of the NCAA
selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun anticipated his team would be
moved, but was more concerned that it remain healthy _ especially
after its dominating run through the Big East tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just care about looking at going someplace and finding out
who is there, who we have to play against to get where we want to
be,'' Calhoun said. ``I've always been a bracket guy much more than
geography.''
</P>
<P>
   He should like the West _ the No. 2-seeded team is Stanford
(25-6), a team Connecticut beat in February. No. 3 is North
Carolina and No. 4 is Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The Auburn Tigers (27-3) and Michigan State (29-4) earned top
seedings in their home regions of the South and the Midwest, and
will join the tussle to bring down Duke. Over all, the tournament
bids provoked little controversy and provided hope for one Big East
team and heartache for another.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's will travel to Orlando, Fla., as the No. 3-seeded in
perhaps the softest regional of all, the South. They will meet
Samford on Thursday. Both the No. 1- and No. 2-seeded teams, Auburn
and Maryland, exited their conference tournaments early this past
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Hurricanes, however, could not win for losing. They
were knocked out in the semifinals of the Big East tournament by
St. John's, but still earned a No. 2 seeding in the East. If they
hope for a trip to the Final Four in St. Petersburg, Fla., the
Hurricanes will probably have to beat No. 3-seeded Cincinnati, the
only team to vanquish Duke this season, in the regional semifinals
next week at the Meadowlands. And then, of course, the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten, led by Michigan State, put the most teams in the
tournament with seven _ tying the record set by the Big East in
1991 and the Big Ten in 1994. If Illinois had upset the Spartans in
Sunday's Big Ten conference tournament final, the selection
committee was prepared to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   The traditionally powerful Atlantic Coast Conference did not
fare as well. Only Maryland (26-5) and North Carolina (24-9)
advanced to the tournament along with Duke _ the three teams being
the lowest total since two were chosen for the field of 48 in 1980.
Newton said the committee considered Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake Forest really needed to win a game in the ACC tournament
and they didn't do that,'' Newton said. ``They had a chance to play
their way in and didn't.''

CHILDS COMES OFF BENCH TO HELP KNICKS BURY NETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For two years, Chris Childs was a misfit. He would
step onto the court as if dressed in a plaid jacket for a black-tie
affair and force his racy, loud style on the conservative New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least bit shy, Childs would disrupt the team's flow with
his flashy notions and elicit scowls from his teammates upon his
rash decisions. After being plopped down on the bench a year ago,
after hearing his name echo in trade speculation, Childs has
discovered that playing with a calmer head does not have to dull
his energy.
</P>
<P>
   A more mature, grown-up Childs revealed how he has learned to
mesh his talents with those of his teammates Sunday afternoon at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd that has occasionally booed his petulance in the past
watched with approval as Childs worked in concert with Latrell
Sprewell off the bench to pick up the Knicks for a 97-86 victory
over a crestfallen and confused New Jersey Nets team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie and say I wouldn't want to start,'' said
Childs, who scored 15 points and grabbed six rebounds in 31 minutes
of play. ``Everyone's dream is to start. For this particular team,
I'm a better fit this way, especially with Latrell coming off, too.
That gives us a lot of intensity and energy and firepower off the
bench. We're high-energy guys.''
</P>
<P>
   In different ways, the electricity generated by Sprewell and
Childs provided a finger snap to jar a daydreaming Knicks team that
was losing interest and its 11-point halftime lead as the game wore
on.
</P>
<P>
   With his touch as flat as an anvil, Sprewell ditched his own
shot and made a nifty inside pass to Larry Johnson for a layup
after the Nets had closed within three points with four minutes
left to play. A few moments later, Childs patiently worked the ball
around, and then, when it circled back to him, he unabashedly hit
his third 3-pointer of the game to turn a six-point Knick lead into
a crushing nine-point edge with 1 minute 27 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Childs and Sprewell were co-hosts to Patrick Ewing's
30-point effort as the Knicks (10-7) sent the Nets to their ninth
loss in 10 games as New Jersey's record dropped to 3-12.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Childs and Sprewell took the burden off Ewing. For the
first time in three games, Ewing was not forced to take a shot at
the buzzer only to miss and lose and draw criticism. This time, the
Knicks were playing at home, where their margin for error is
greater and the victories come more easily. Despite their
rebounding flaws and offensive limitations, the Knicks are 8-1 at
the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing a fabulous job at home,'' said Ewing, who scored
18 points in the third quarter. ``We just have to turn it around on
the road. I think it's mental.''
</P>
<P>
   It's physical, too. For a week, coach Jeff Van Gundy has
criticized the Knicks' inability to rebound and pleaded for his
team to put a body on someone. The Knicks allowed the Nets an edge
in rebounding, 51-40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about that, and it's done absolutely no good,''
said Van Gundy, whose team ranks 28th in rebounding. ``We may just
run around in football pads at practice, but we're going to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs did his part. He dodged bigger bodies for six rebounds.
Only Ewing, with nine rebounds, had more for the Knicks. Flaunting
his diversity, Childs also hit three of four 3-pointers (including
a 40-footer at the end of the third quarter) to maintain his
league-best 3-point-shooting average (59.3 percent), while his
bench partner, Sprewell, managed to deliver five assists to play a
part in his first victory with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Before his heel injury, the Knicks were 0-2 with Sprewell in
uniform as a starter. In his first game back on Friday, the Knicks
lost in Milwaukee despite Sprewell's pop off the bench. He was
almost too pushy, too shot-happy against the Bucks. A game later,
Sprewell was almost too tentative against the Nets. But when he
passed up shots, he moved the ball. And it worked against the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, winning is the important thing,'' said Sprewell, who
shot 2 for 6 and had five points in 21 minutes on the floor. ``I'm
happy playing this role right now. I'm satisfied with it at this
point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There may come a point when Sprewell balks at his bench status.
There may come a time when Van Gundy returns him to the starting
lineup. But for a day, the combination of Sprewell and Childs
provided enough edge to pull the Knicks out of their two-game
slide.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets merely continued their unfathomable free fall. As well
as point guard Doug Overton (18 points) played, the Nets are lost
without the injured Sam Cassell. About a month ago, they were the
league darlings and even had the audacity to proclaim themselves
the top dogs of this metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bragged a little bit, but I'm not even going to come back
and say what kind of dog they are now,'' Childs said with a smile.
``I mean, I think if they are at full strength and they're
confident, they're a dangerous team. Right now, they're driving a
car with only two wheels. And that won't get you very far.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs should know. He used to be the Nets' guide. In some ways,
he was a lot like Cassell. He was the frenetic playmaker and shot
taker. Once he left New Jersey, he tried to take his stylish act
through the Lincoln Tunnel. It did not travel well at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've finally come to grips with the way I have to play for the
Knicks to be successful,'' Childs said. ``I think the first couple
of years, I was in a position where I tried to make a lot of things
happen at once instead of letting the game come to me. Now, I don't
want to take over the game. I'm not the first option anymore. We
have other guys on this team that are capable scorers.'' &QL;

DUKE RUNS THE TABLE, LEAVING ACC IN AWE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BARRY JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The details differed from game to game, but
when the Duke basketball team played in the Atlantic Coast
Conference this season the result was always the same.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Blue Devils finished a 19-0 run through the
conference regular season and post-season Sunday and staked a claim
as the most dominant squad in league history. They did it with a
commanding 96-73 victory over No. 15 North Carolina to capture the
ACC tournament championship.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (32-1) won its 27th consecutive game and earned the league
title for the first time since 1992, when it went on to win its
second consecutive national championship. The Blue Devils, who
Sunday were awarded the top seeding in the East Regional of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, will play
Florida A&AMP;M (12-18), the only team in the N.C.A.A. tournament with
a losing record, at the Charlotte Coliseum on Friday in the opening
round.
</P>
<P>
   Duke set a record for winning margin in the ACC tournament,
beating North Carolina, North Carolina State and Virginia by an
average of 25 points. The Blue Devils also set a league record for
margin of victory during the regular season (25.5 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have any weaknesses,'' said Bill Guthridge,
who is in his second season as North Carolina's coach after 30
years as Dean Smith's assistant. ``It's hard to compare teams from
year to year, but I don't remember a team dominating a league the
way they have, the way they just took everybody apart. They're so
efficient, so effective.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, the third-seeded team in the conference
tournament, fell to 24-9. The Tar Heels are seeded third in the
West Regional of the NCAA tournament, and will face Weber State
(24-7) on Thursday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils were paced by their big man, Elton Brand, the
tournament's most valuable player, who had 24 points and 13
rebounds, and guard William Avery, who led both teams with 29
points and had 4 steals and 5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing without Trajan Langdon, their second-leading
scorer, the Blue Devils did not trail North Carolina after the
game's first two and a half minutes. Langdon, a senior guard who,
his teammate Shane Battier said, is the team's emotional leader,
has a sprained foot but is expected to play this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils became only the fifth team to finish the ACC
regular season without a loss and then go on to win the league
tournament, along with North Carolina's undefeated national
champions of 1957, Duke's Final Four squad of 1963 and North
Carolina State's teams of 1973 and 1974. The '74 Wolfpack team was
an NCAA champion; the '73 team was on probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen and 0, even if they're all 1-point games, would be
pretty impressive,'' said Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, acknowledging
that his team ``really wanted to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team needs to take the lead and keep the lead,
not just necessarily in a game,'' added Krzyzewski, who won his
fourth ACC title. ``We're playing so well, to let up would be
tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Tar Heels, the ACC's two-time defending champions,
Duke took the lead for good at 9-6 on a 3-pointer by Battier two
minutes and 42 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Against North Carolina's mix of zone and sagging man-to-man
defense, Duke made seven of 13 three-pointers in the first half and
10 of 22 in the game. The Blue Devils average 19 three-point
attempts a game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Blue Devils forced 13 turnovers, which they
converted into 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Duke took a 49-35 lead at the half on 60 percent shooting. For
the game, the Blue Devils shot 57.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Duke opened the second half with 10 consecutive points, building
its largest lead of the game, 59-35, on an Avery 3-pointer with
18:13 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, which reached the final by defeating Georgia
Tech and second-seeded Maryland, was in danger of being embarrassed
after playing its best basketball in three months. The Tar Heels
responded with 14 straight points, then pulled within 65-56 on a
free throw by center Brendon Haywood with 10:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the North Carolina inside game was
neutralized as Duke controlled the boards, 35-30. The Heels got a
team-high 22 points from wing Max Owens and 11 assists from guard
Ed Cota, who set a tournament record with 29 for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Battier recalled squandering a 17-point lead midway
through the second half when similarly challenged in the 1998 NCAA
Southeast Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, in the Kentucky game, when they made that run, our
eyes were wide open,'' said Battier, a sophomore forward. ``We were
all looking at each other, not knowing what to think. When Carolina
made the run today, we just huddled up and said, `Hey, let's just
play ball,' and responded with a run of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke quickly pushed the lead back to 18 points and coasted the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good, but we have six games to prove we're a great
team,'' said Duke wing Chris Carrawell, who contributed 12 points
and 7 assists. ``We're not there yet.'' &QL;

RUSSIA VOWS TO PUNISH CHECHNYA FOR ABDUCTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia vowed Sunday night to punish the separatist
Chechnya region unless Chechen kidnappers quickly released a
high-ranking Russian officer. The threat that represented the most
serious deterioration in Russian-Chechen relations since a peace
settlement was concluded more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials declined to specify how they would respond to
the kidnapping of Maj. Gen. Gennadi Shpigun, a senior Interior
Ministry official. Sergei Stepashin, the interior minister, said
Sunday night that Russia was planning a series of economic,
political and ``operational'' measures.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was not just to free the kidnapped officer but also to
punish the Chechens, said Stepashin, who was a hawk during the
fierce Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be tanks or 18-year-old boys,'' he told Russian
television. ``It will be appropriate measures.''
</P>
<P>
   As Moscow brandished its threats, representatives of the Russian
government were evacuated by convoy from the breakaway Caucasus
republic. Chechnya has been racked by kidnappings since it won its
freedom, making it one of the most lawless regions of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Russia insists that Chechnya is still part of
Russia. But the region enjoys a kind of de facto independence,
underscored by the withdrawal of the Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The latest drama began on Friday when Shpigun was seized by
masked gunmen after he boarded a plane in Grozny bound for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers had hidden in the luggage compartment of the
plane. Armed with assault rifles, they barged into the passenger
compartment as the plane was taxiing on the tarmac, seized the
officer, stopped the plane and then fled with their captive.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the officer had been seized.
One view, reflected in the Russian news media, was that the
kidnappers reported to Salman Raduyev, the Chechen commander, who
wants to exchange the officer for two Chechen women jailed for
bombing a railway station in Pyatigorsk, in southern Russia. The
bombing killed two people and the Chechen women were sentenced,
respectively, to 16 and 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   But kidnappings have also been carried out for ransom, Chechen
officials noted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not the first time that Russian officials have been
kidnapped. Valentin Vlasov, President Boris Yeltsin's personal
representative to Chechnya, was kidnapped but released six months
later. Another Russian government representative, Akmal Saidov, was
killed by the gunman who seized him.
</P>
<P>
   The latest kidnapping, however, was portrayed in Moscow as the
last straw: an intolerable humiliation aided by Chechen
authorities. Vlasov said Chechnya had been given until Monday to
secure the release of the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen security officials, for their part, insisted they had
not orchestrated the kidnapping and were investigating the case.
They also expressed concern that the evacuation of Russian
officials was a prelude to an airstrike or other military action.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who talked to Yeltsin several times over the weekend,
said his plan to punish Chechnya would be considered by the
government's Security Council on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that thousands of Russians still live in Chechnya,
Stepashin opposed an all-out economic blockade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk should be less about sanctions that affect the population
than measures that would bar anyone from earning money from
carrying on like the band that seized Gennady Shpigun,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STONY BROOK, N.Y. _ Two years ago, Dr. Robert D. Cess, a
climatologist at the State University of New York here, grumbled
when another professor urged him to supervise a local high school
student in a summer program for bright teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Cess said, was that in nearly four decades as a
professor, he had never found any use for an undergraduate research
assistant, let alone a junior from Miller Place High School, even
one with a passion for weather.
</P>
<P>
   He grudgingly agreed, and sent the student, Meredith Croke, then
17, down the hall to a computer in an empty office. He told her to
familiarize herself with its sophisticated package of
number-crunching software. ``I figured that would take at least
half the summer,'' Cess said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to lunch. ``When I got back,'' he said, ``she asked me,
`Professor Cess, what shall I do next?'''
</P>
<P>
   Cess began to think that Ms. Croke might have some potential
after all, he said, and now he is sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Croke's research at Stony Brook on links between clouds and
temperature has been accepted for publication in The Journal of
Climate, a prominent research periodical that is usually the
province of gray-haired doctorate, not peach-faced 19-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The same work was rejected by judges last year for the finals of
the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, a high school competition
that is now sponsored by the Intel Corp.. That was a blow, Ms.
Croke said. ``But I'll take this any day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely unusual to have someone this young who's out
there doing research in an important area,'' said Dr. James J.
Hack, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Hack reviewed an early version of the paper. ``It's original and
provocative and raises interesting questions about one of the
central mysteries of the climate system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Croke's research led to a full scholarship to Stony Brook,
where she is a freshman with plans for graduate work in applied
physics and meteorology. ``There is just something about weather,''
she said, ``how it's always changing, with so many things involved
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, Robert, a Suffolk County police inspector, and
Susan, a secretary, said they have no idea where their daughter's
fascination with weather came from, but that it was there at a
young age.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 5, during trips in the car she would chat idly in
the back seat _ until the forecast came on the radio, Croke said.
``She'd stop dead and listen to the weather,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 10, for Christmas she wanted a weather station with
an anemometer to check wind speed. ``We thought that was a somewhat
unusual request,'' Croke said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of becoming addicted to Nickelodeon or MTV, she sat
mesmerized by satellite images on the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   She applied for the summer program at Stony Brook in 1997,
writing in her application about her love of weather.
</P>
<P>
   Her aim was to find relationships between long-term patterns of
cloudiness, precipitation and temperature across Long Island, she
said. Dr. Cess gave her a weighty tome with 87 years of global
weather data, and she began sifting for clues using the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The study expanded to the East Coast, then the West Coast near
San Diego and the southern Great Plains. Slowly, a pattern emerged
linking years with unusual cloudiness to changes in high pressure
zones near Hawaii and in the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Cess said Ms. Croke's work significantly advances the
understanding of the relationship between changes in global
temperature and changes in cloudiness.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds can cool and warm the planet, reflecting some of the
sun's heat back into space but also acting like an insulating
blanket, trapping some heat near the surface. Warmer weather tends
to spawn more clouds, but the details remain _ well _ cloudy, Dr.
Cess said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to unscramble an egg,'' he said to illustrate
how difficult it is to find patterns in the turbulence of global
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Croke's research appears to reveal at least one small link,
he said. It may help scientists refine computer models of the
atmosphere that are being used to assess the potential impact of
global warming but are hampered by a lack of understanding of the
physics of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is dense with technical terms and statistical
formulas. But there is at least one hint of adolescence in the
acknowledgments: ``One of us (MC) would like to thank her dad for
letting her use the car to get to Stony Brook during this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Croke said that for now, her climate research will take a
back seat to introductory calculus and literature courses and track
meets. She runs 60 or 70 miles a week to stay in shape for a
cross-country event, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, she will be back at her research.

GEBRSELASSIE, SZABO WIN THEIR SECOND GOLDS AT WORLD INDOOR TRACK
CHAMPIONSHIPS

<P>
   MAEBASHI, Japan _ Haile Gebrselassie's amazing string of
performances continued Sunday with a victory in the 1,500 meters at
the World Indoor Track Championships. Coupled with his 3,000-meter
victory on Friday, it gave the 25-year-old Ethiopian an
unprecedented double, one duplicated Sunday by Gabriela Szabo of
Romania. It was not easy for Gebrselassie, though.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing his lethal finishing kick, the two Kenyan runners in the
field, Laban Rotich and William Tanui, plotted a fast early pace
that stretched out the field and, up until the final straightaway,
appeared to have done the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Rotich, holder of the Kenyan 1,500-meter record, had a
commanding lead with 40 meters remaining. But Gebrselassie found an
extra gear and squeezed past the struggling Kenyan to win in 3
minutes 33.77 seconds, the fastest time ever at the indoor
championships. Rotich held on for the silver medal in 3:33.98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not expecting that, because I thought everybody would be
running for the win,'' Gebrselassie said of the quick pace. ``But
Tanui pushed at the beginning, and I was happy because everybody
was tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Szabo, 23, finished her double by winning the 3,000 in 8:36.42,
passing Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco on the last lap. She won the 1,500
in a championships record time of 4:03.23 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could things be better?'' Szabo said. ``One gold is great;
two in a championships, now that is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Two world records were set in the 4x400-meter relay Sunday, by
the U.S. men's team and by the Russian women's team. Milt Campbell
anchored the American men to victory in 3:02.83, overtaking Robert
Mackowiak of Poland in the final straightaway. The Russian women
won in 3:24.25.
</P>
<P>
   There were upsets in both 800-meter races. Maria Mutola of
Mozambique lost for the first time indoors since June 1993,
finishing second to Ludmila Formanova of the Czech Republic, whose
1:56.90 was the second-fastest time in history and a meet record.
And Johan Botha of South Africa beat the world record-holder,
Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, by .02 seconds in 1:45.47.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene of the United States won the men's 60 meters in
6.42 seconds, a championships record.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of his two gold medals, Gebrselassie said he was most satisfied
with the 1,500 meters. ``Because the real competition was today,''
he said. ``The 3,000 meters was just a jog at 10,000-meter pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebrselassie has not lost a world championships or Olympic final
on the track since 1993. He holds the 5,000- and 10,000-meter world
records outdoors and the 5,000-meter record indoors, which he set
last month in Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the 3,000 on Friday, Gebrselassie had tried to
play down his ability in the 1,500 _ even though he ran the
second-fastest indoor time in history, 3:31.76 last year at
Stuttgart, Germany. According to his agent, Jos Hermens, who took
Gebrselassie to Europe as a teen-ager in 1992 and has nurtured his
career since, Gebrselassie was relaxed in the days leading up to
Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an incredible talent,'' Hermens said. ``He's so relaxed
_ that's his strength. He is always relaxed. The smile at the start
is genuine. He amazes me all the time how relaxed he is. He doesn't
worry, doesn't think a lot about tactics. He just runs and does his
best and if someone is better, then they are better. No problem.'' &QL;

INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS FROM AROUND WORLD GATHER FOR SEDONA FILM
FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ For $1, you could have had your name in the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Selling screen time for a buck was one ingenious method that
indie filmmaker Allan Piper used to raise money for ``Starving
Artists,'' the comedy he wrote, directed, produced, edited and
stars in.
</P>
<P>
   Piper, of Boston, and other independent filmmakers from around
the world gathered in Sedona over the weekend, where they shared
the movies they risked fortune and sanity to make with 1,200 movie
lovers during the fifth annual Sedona Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   When Piper was raising money to make ``Starving Artists,'' an
energetic farce whose plot is encapsulated in its title, he
promised that anyone who gave him even $1 would find their name on
screen in the movie _ as graffiti on walls, in newspaper headlines,
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That inspired some people to give more than a dollar so their
names would be more prominent,'' Piper told an amused audience of
movie lovers at the filmmakers' panel Sunday morning. ``I have to
describe it as divine intervention that we finished the movie at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   While the moviemakers struggled to get their films to Sedona,
movie fans faced a dizzying array of films and events, including a
workshop staffed with Oscar-winning sound editors; a wide range of
American indies; films from Italy, China, Japan, Greece, Iceland
and Mali; documentaries; and four collections of short films.
</P>
<P>
   From Friday morning through Sunday night, festivalgoers chose
from four different programs every two hours. Movie die-hards could
have spent the weekend watching 16 different films, not to mention
attending the parties and Q&AMP;A sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Sean Young, who lives in Sedona, showed up at the
opening night party with small white wings on the shoulders of her
glittery gown. An angel is a central character in Young's film,
``Special Delivery,'' a comedy about a woman who thinks she is
bearing the next Christ child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Delivery'' is not your typical film festival picture,
although it might become your typical megaplex release or
made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   Why did director Ken Carlson choose Sedona for the world
premiere? ``I had a chance to make this movie through a studio, but
I didn't think they'd let me keep in some of the spiritual
material,'' the Arizona filmmaker explained.
</P>
<P>
   Young felt that ``Special Delivery'' had found a home at the
Sedona Festival. ``We all know in Sedona that it's OK to be
spiritual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schay, who directs the festival and heads the Sedona
Cultural Park, includes films like ``Special Delivery'' because
``there are more mainstream movies here than you'd see at
Sundance,'' he said. ``We like movies that are about something more
than saying, `Look how clever I am.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other big star in attendance was Sean Astin, best
known for starring in such movies as ``Rudy'' and ``Encino Man.''
</P>
<P>
   After the U.S. premiere of his sweet romance, ``Boy Meets
Girl,'' Astin talked with the audience _ one of the intimate
thrills that you'll only find at this kind of boutique film
festival.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a Hollywood star like Astin make a small-budget movie
like ``Boy'' ``Meets Girl?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom to take risks,'' the actor explained. ``It's a great
change of pace because studios wouldn't make a movie like this.
There aren't marketing strategies that impose themselves on the
making of a movie like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Astin also likes the rapid, intense pacing of a small-budget
production, where producers don't have enough money to waste time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get there, you start working and you're out of there,''
Astin said. ``I love the speed of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhapsody in Bloom,'' a romantic comedy starring Penelope Ann
Miller and Ron Silver, was Sedona's other mainstream movie, one
that could easily find its way to a multiplex near you.
</P>
<P>
   ````Rhapsody in Bloom'' fits an interesting niche,''
director/producer Craig Saavedra admitted. ``The independents felt
it was too studiolike, and the studios thought it was too
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra's project was attractive to an accomplished screen
actress like Miller because it gave her ``the chance to headline a
cast and not just play the girlfriend, like she did in
``Kindergarten Cop'','' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But stars bring other problems to new directors. ``I told them
in the beginning, I know you guys have been on films where you have
your egos stroked,'' Saavedra recalled. ``But I'm not going to do
that. You're going to have to be adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge for a new filmmaker with his cast is to
make sure you're all making the same movie, telling the same
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Piper had no stars available to him when he made ``Starving
Artists'' on a budget that would keep actors starving, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Piper didn't want stars. ``You see the same stars in every
movie,'' he said. ``There's something wonderful about looking at
unknown actors and really believing that they are the characters in
the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra agreed. ``I'm looking forward to becoming successful
enough that I can cast unknown actors because often the stars come
with baggage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All indie filmmakers face the essential problem: Name actors can
help get distribution deals, especially overseas and in video
stores.
</P>
<P>
   With the market flooded with indie films, Saavedra recouped his
investment in ``Rhapsody in Bloom'' by selling the overseas, cable
and video rights so that he won't lose money even if the film never
reaches movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some indies will premiere first on cable, then get picked up
because distributors see it as a proven commodity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarian director Momchil Karamitev, whose dark drama, ``The
Insurance,'' was one of the more complex films at the festival,
described trying to get his movie made in a non-movie-producing
country as ``painful for a long period.''
</P>
<P>
   Karamitev's producer had lined up funding from the Bulgarian
cultural department, but then died and they lost the connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up putting my own savings in to finish the film,'' he
said. ``That was the main support we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the scores of film festivals around the country can be
a pricey proposition for the indie filmmaker, with each festival
requiring an entry fee, with no guarantee of acceptance and no
payoff even if the film is shown. Sedona's $50 is among the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   But filmmakers like Harish Saluja of India, who directed and
produced ``The'' ``Journey,'' built the price of entering film
festivals into his production budget. ``The Journey'' has now
played in 18 festivals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festival circuit is a process that for films like mine
need to happen,'' Saluja said. ``It's like a song. You sing it for
people and let it be heard. That interaction is very important to
the harmony of the work. You get the film in front of people and
see whether they love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Native American filmmaker Robby Romero ``(Hidden Medicine)''
sees indie movies in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all filmmaking is mainstream, whether it's independent
or not,'' he said, ``because you want as many people to see it as
possible.''  &QL;

CAMBODIA PLANS TRIAL FOR JAILED KHMER ROUGE LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 5th and 6th grafs to correct name to Nuon Chea.)  (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cambodian officials said Sunday they will conduct a trial in
Phnom Penh for Ta Mok, the last fugitive Khmer Rouge leader, who
was captured on Saturday. Their statements raised further doubts
about their commitment to produce other Khmer Rouge leaders for an
international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, who is believed to be about 72, led the dwindling rebel
force after its former leader, Pol Pot, was purged in 1997. He
remained on the run even after other fugitive leaders surrendered
to the government, along with virtually all their fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Ta Mok had few friends, and a number of political
analysts were predicting that the Cambodian government would seek
to make him a scapegoat for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge. The
brutal communist movement was responsible for the deaths of more
than a million people when it held power from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure we will try him in Cambodia,'' said Om Yentieng, a
top adviser to Prime Minister Hun Sen. ``We have everything here,
why should we try him abroad?''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has been much more ambiguous about the fate of other
former Khmer Rouge leaders _ notably two top officials who defected
last December, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea. He has warned that a
trial could endanger an ill-defined process that he calls
``national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their surrender, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have been
allowed to live freely in a remote enclave populated by former
rebels and guarded by former Khmer Rouge fighters. They have urged
the world to ``let bygones be bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is prosecuted, Ta Mok would be the first Khmer Rouge
leader to appear in court. Immediately after their ouster from
power, Pol Pot and his Foreign Minister, Ieng Sary, were tried and
convicted in absentia by a newly installed Cambodian government in
a proceeding that is not generally recognized as having been valid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Sunday that Ta Mok was being held in shackles in
a prison in downtown Phnom Penh, almost within sight of Tuol Sleng,
the former prison and torture house where at least 14,000 people
were sent to their deaths by the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   A team of lawyers has recommended to the United Nations that 20
to 30 former leaders of the Khmer Rouge be tried in an
international court. The lawyers said Cambodia's judicial system is
not adequate to handle such a complex and politically volatile
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director of the New York-based group
Human Rights Watch, said it would be unlikely that Hun Sen's
government could defuse pressure for an international tribunal by
putting Ta Mok on trial at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that even by having some kind of show trial in
Cambodia, pressure for an international tribunal is going to go
away,'' she said. ``I think things have already gone too far. In
fact, any attempt to try Ta Mok in Cambodia could provide more
momentum for having an international tribunal simply because it
will focus attention on all the problems of holding a trial inside
Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still in tatters 20 years after the ouster of the Khmer Rouge by
a Vietnamese invasion, Cambodia's legal system is primitive,
unschooled and riven with graft and political influence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cambodian researchers who have been compiling
evidence against leading Khmer Rouge figures say that despite Ta
Mok's widespread reputation for brutality, the documentary evidence
that he participated in the crimes of the Khmer Rouge is slim.
</P>
<P>
   A jungle fighter since his youth, Ta Mok was a resistance
soldier against the French colonial government in the 1940s. There
is some uncertainty about his given name, but historians say he was
born Ek Chhoen. Well before old age, he was using the revolutionary
alias that includes the honorific ``Ta,'' meaning ``grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a regional commander in the Khmer Rouge's fight for power
in the 1960s and 1970s _ known for his brutality even against
fellow revolutionaries with whom he disagreed. After the movement
came to power, he was a member of the nine-member Standing
Committee that ruled the country under Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
   He led what amounted to a coup within the Khmer Rouge in June
1997, ousting Pol Pot from leadership of what had again become a
guerrilla movement and engineering a show trial and house arrest
for the former leader.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, he had close relations with military commanders
just across Cambodia's northern border in Thailand and is widely
believed to have become a millionaire through cross-border business
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in prison in Phnom Penh, a Cambodian official said, ``He is
looking very tired, very frail and, of course, he is looking sad
that he has been arrested.''

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   One morning recently, I boarded the 79th Street crosstown bus
and sat down next to a little girl of 5 or 6 and her nanny. I soon
felt a small hand on my wrist and looked down to see the smiling
face of the child, who admired my bracelet. I thanked her for the
compliment, and she asked if she could have the bracelet when I
die.
</P>
<P>
   Her nanny admonished her, but the little girl defended her
question by saying that she was going to get jewelry when her
grandmother dies. She then asked me if I had grandchildren. When I
told her that I didn't, she smiled brightly and once again asked if
she could have the bracelet when I die.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could respond, her nanny escorted her off the bus, and
off to school they went.

   Margie Goldsmith was walking in midtown with Sara Smith, her
12-year-old visitor from Davenport, Iowa. They stopped to look at
an FAO Schwarz window in which Barbie was featured wearing various
costumes. ``She's been a teacher, a vet, a dentist, an Olympic
skater, and now all these people,'' Sara said. ``Why can't Barbie
hold a job?''

   Constance Bullard was in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel at
Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street when a young businessman came
flying out. He hailed a taxi, opened the door, flung his coat and
briefcase in the back seat and, as he got in, yelled at the driver:
``Take me to Grand Central Station.'' The terminal is precisely one
building away from the hotel. Ms. Bullard's observation: ``Possibly
from out of town?''

   George and Didi Gold were having dinner at a new restaurant on
the East Side. Gold ordered a reasonably priced wine, finished the
bottle and, having found it pleasant and worth remembering, asked
the waitress to take off the label. She returned with the bottle,
without the label. ``It's a lovely bottle, isn't it?'' she said
cheerily. But where was the label? he asked. ``In the garbage,''
she replied.

<P>
   When I recently tried to visit the Veterans Administration
building in downtown Manhattan, I was refused admittance because I
was carrying a pocket knife. I offered to leave it with the guard
and pick it up when I left, but was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   So I went across the street to a hot-dog vendor. ``Hold this for
me,'' I said, ``and when I come out, I'll take care of you.'' He
agreed. When I completed my business and returned, he waved off my
tip, saying, ``That's all right _ I do this for people every day.''

   I had just missed two crosstown buses at Park Avenue and 86th
Street and, waiting impatiently, walked into the street to see if I
could spot the next one.

<P>
   A nicely dressed woman asked if there was anything in sight. I
told her there wasn't, and she asked if I wanted to share a ride to
the West Side _ she was getting out about a half-mile before my
destination. We hailed a cab and arrived at her stop so quickly
that I decided to get out and walk the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   As we paid, the driver said to me, ``Don't get out, I'll take
you the rest of the way, no problem.'' I was incredulous. ``Free,
you mean?'' I asked. He nodded and sped along. I fished in my
wallet for an additional tip but when we pulled up, he refused it.
``Well,'' I said, ``I hope you have a wonderful day, you deserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and said, ``That's all the tip I needed.''

   Nice taxi story No. 2: Before dawn, Catherine Ursillo caught a
cab to La Guardia Airport and was dropped off at Continental Air
Lines. Twenty minutes later, as she was waiting in the check-in
line, the driver appeared. He pulled out his wallet and gave her
change for the $100 bill she had mistakenly given him, thinking it
was a $20. She thanked him, of course, and offered a reward. No, he
said, and off he went. She still can scarcely believe it.
</P>
<P>
   A shopper who prefers to remain anonymous was at the Fairway
market at 74th Street and Broadway. She figured that she would have
just enough time to make her purchases and get to her appointment
with her therapist. However, with one customer asking for samples
of different meats before making a decision and more people than
usual at the prepared-food counter, she was still waiting in a long
line at the cashier when her session was scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   She whipped out her new cellular phone and dialed her
therapist's office. The therapist, a regular Fairway shopper
herself, immediately grasped the reasons for the delay and the two
continued talking as the woman paid for her food and walked the two
blocks to the therapist's office.
</P>
<P>
   As the woman rang the bell, the therapist ended the call,
saying, ``I'm sorry, I have to stop now; there's someone at my
door.'' They were both laughing as the session started.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   In this day and age it is refreshing to witness restraint in the
use of uncouth expletives, no matter how apt. Recently I saw a man,
whose large dog had just soiled the sidewalk along Madison Avenue,
trying to pick up the offending pile with an amount of paper
toweling that was decidedly unequal to the task. As he struggled
unsuccessfully to hold on to the mess, he muttered to himself,
``Oh, sugar!''

 &HT;    Moving with the Spirit
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lord knows how many marches originated from Ebenezer
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the members were marching for justice or civil
rights, perhaps no march was sweeter than the one they took Sunday
from their 77-year-old home to their new one 75 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from a church that held 750 to one that can hold nearly
2,000, Ebenezer entered a new era with a rousing service full of
joy and promise for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the cornerstone (of the original church) being placed,''
said Jethro English, a member of Ebenezer for 74 years. ``Now the
Lord has blessed me to walk across the street to our new home and I
am very grateful. I'm going from one degree of grace to another.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people packed Ebenezer's sparkling new Horizon
Sanctuary for the inaugural 10:45 a.m. service. Earlier, less than
half of them squeezed into the old building, the Heritage Sanctuary
_ where the likes of A.D. Williams, Martin Luther King Sr., Martin
Luther King Jr. and A.D. King preached _ to listen to current
pastor Rev. Joseph L. Roberts' final service there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful experience,'' said Terry Woods, who has
been a member of the church all of her life. ``It's kind of sad to
leave the old church, but it will still be there _ right across the
street. The new church is everything I dreamed it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   At the morning service in the Heritage Sanctuary, it was obvious
that the congregation had outgrown its home. People stood in the
aisles or sat on stairs in the balcony, while the area around the
alter was clogged with people trying to come to the microphone to
deliver prayers or testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that because the old church, located at 407 Auburn
Ave., only held about 750 people, they often had to turn people
away. With the new 1,800-seat church, at 400 Auburn Ave., that will
no longer be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a miracle to have a new home,'' said church member Steve
Harris, busy snapping pictures of both churches. ``Especially for
the older members of the church. Their parents built (the Heritage
Sanctuary). Now they built this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking across the street after the morning service, Christine
King Farris, the sister of former Ebenezer co-pastor Martin Luther
King Jr. and the only living child of ``Daddy King'' and Albertina
King, reflected on what the old church meant to her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings, because the Heritage Sanctuary is my
home. A lot of things are going through my head right now,'' said
Farris, whose grandfather, A.D. Williams, was succeeded as the
church's pastor by her father. ``I was born there. Baptized there.
Married there. My dear mother was taken from me there. All those
things were on my mind, when I was walking across that street.''
</P>
<P>
   Few can deny the beauty of the new facility. With a ceiling
skylight that runs along the spine of the church and high windows
along the sides, the church is bathed with light. The choir stand
and pew are huge, and African carvings adorn most of the wood in
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am going to like this place,'' Roberts said with a
smile from the pulpit after hearing the applause cascade off the
church's fan-shaped ceiling. But he warned the congregation that
just because they have a nice, new church doesn't mean their work
is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not get so caught up in the beauty of this house that
we forget where we came from,'' said Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said the new church has to serve as a wall of protection
around the neighborhood and its people and that they can't afford
to run away from the problems of the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something about our streets,'' said Roberts,
refering to earlier expectations that Ebenezer would relocate away
from Sweet Auburn and the inner city. ``Yes, we could have moved.
We could have moved to the suburbs. But King never ran to the
suburbs. He didn't stay at the Peabody Hotel. He stayed at the
Lorraine. King didn't mingle with the high and mighty. He died for
garbage men. Stop running away from your problems. We have got to
make sure we keep our resources here for those who need them the
most''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the congregation has moved out of the old building, the
Heritage Sanctuary has been turned over to the National Parks
Services for daily tours starting today at 9 a.m.

SHERIFF ARPAIO ORDERS INTERNAL PROBE OF `TAILING' ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Sunday
vehemently denied he's ordered deputies to tail his enemies, and
said he's ordered an internal investigation into the roots of the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' reported Saturday that federal
investigators are probing whether Arpaio ordered surveillance on a
laundry list of foes, including Maricopa County Attorney Rick
Romley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' Arpaio said. ``Its just a product of
vile and bizarre imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the enemies Arpaio's deputies allegedly shadowed were
key figures in a lawsuit stemming from the 1996 death of inmate
Scott Norberg.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Romley, the list of alleged surveilance targets include
the dead man's father Jaron Norberg; Michael Manning, the family's
attorney; and U.S. District Judge Paul Rosenblatt, who heard the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Barnes, president of a fledgling deputy union, told the
``Republic'' he gave the FBI names of deputies who complained they
were assigned to investigate and watch Arpaio enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tailing judges and the Norbergs?'' Arpaio said, incredulously.
``This is so bizarre. This is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaron Norberg said Sunday he never felt that he was being
tailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would never have crossed my mind that would have been
done,'' said Norberg, whose son died strapped in a jailhouse
restraint chair. ``But its getting to the point where nothing would
surprise me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio revealed that deputies in his enforcement support unit do
investigate some of the sheriff's enemies, but only those who
threaten his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're following political enemies around, but
they have been concerning tracking all of these death threats
against me,'' Arpaio said. ``It has nothing to do with this other
stuff. . .about political enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said several people have threatened to kill him, one
recently broadcasting it by pirating onto the MCSO radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff theorized that the death threat investigations are
being mistakingly perceived as Arpaio using his office to gather
dirt on enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have detectives working threats on me _ threats to kill _
and people may get confused as to what is going on,'' Arpaio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're mixed up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he ordered an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know where this information is coming from,''
Arpaio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know who is making these statements and if they have
any facts,'' he said. ``We're going to find out if there's any
substance to these ridiculous allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal probe will assume Arpaio did not order the
surveilance, said Chief Deputy Dave Hendershott. Investigators will
not interview the sheriff to ask him if he ordered any enemies
tailed, Hendershott said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation will look into whether any deputies
did in fact tail Romley or the figures in the Norberg case, acting
on their own or under orders from someone other than Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should a deputy have done that, or course it would come out,''
Hendershott said. ``But I can tell you it didn't happen.'' &QL;

AFTER A SEASON OF STRUGGLE, UCONN GETS A TOP SEEDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Connecticut women's basketball team, which struggled
through a season laden with injuries, a reward arrived Sunday. The
Huskies (27-4) joined Purdue (28-1), Tennessee (28-2) and Louisiana
Tech (26-2) as top-seeded teams for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament that begins on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 64 teams in the tournament, 30 qualified automatically as
conference champions. The other 34 were named Sunday, when the
matchups were announced by the NCAA women's basketball committee.
</P>
<P>
   The top four seeded teams in each region will play host to the
first two rounds, half of those games on Friday and Sunday and the
other half on Saturday and next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, the Big East champion for the last six years, was
seeded first in the Mideast and will open against 16th-seeded St.
Francis of Pennsylvania (18-11), the Northeast Conference champion.
Rutgers (26-5), which shared the Big East regular-season title with
Connecticut, was seeded third in the Midwest (behind Purdue and
Texas Tech) and will face Dartmouth (19-8), the Ivy League
champion.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 second-round winners will advance to the regionals on
March 20 and 22 in Greensboro, N.C. (East), Cincinnati (Mideast),
Normal, Ill. (Midwest), and Los Angeles (West). The regional
winners will move into the Final Four March 26 and 28 in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Connecticut, the highest seedings followed
expectations. In the latest Associated Press media poll, the top
five teams are Purdue, Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Colorado State
and Connecticut. Rutgers is ranked eighth and Notre Dame is ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has won the national championship three consecutive
seasons, but that was not a factor in the seedings. The selectors
used a formula that incorporated a team's record, the strength of
its schedule and the strength of its opponents' schedules. A team's
performance in its last 10 games was also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette McGlade, assistant commissioner of the Atlantic Coast
Conference, heads the NCAA's women's basketball committee, which
makes the at-large selections and assigns the seedings. She said it
was safe to assume that Purdue, Tennessee and Louisiana Tech were
chosen as No. 1 seeded teams ahead of UConn. She said Colorado
State was another candidate. Connecticut was helped by a strong
nonconference schedule and an impressive end to its season after
the return of injured players.
</P>
<P>
   One of those players is the fiery Shea Ralph, now UConn's
leading scorer, who had a sprained knee. The knee is fine now, but
Sunday Ralph got a mild concussion during practice. Coach Geno
Auriemma said she would be back Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth time in six years that Connecticut has
received a No. 1 seeding. Last year it did not because of an
Achilles' tendon injury that ended the season of Nykesha Sales,
Uconn's best player. The Huskies eventually lost to North Carolina
State in the regional final. This time, Auriemma did not know what
to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as us getting a No. 1 seed,'' he said after the Big
East tournament, ``I don't know. But where we go, we go. We'll pack
our bags and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Rutgers not been eliminated by Notre Dame in a semifinal
game of the Big East tournament, it would probably have received a
No. 2 seeding. Coach C. Vivian Stringer is still upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love our chances in this tournament,'' said Stringer, whose
team lost to Tennessee in the Round of 16 last season. ``I think we
are capable of going to the Final Four. We expect to get beyond the
Sweet 16. This team is one that when you say `tournament,' they
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Connecticut's seeding was hurt last year by the injury
to Sales, Notre Dame's seeding was dropped for a similar reason
this season. The Irish, who might have been seeded third or even
second, fell to fifth because of a season-ending knee injury to
Niele Ivey, the team's starting point guard, in the Big East
semifinal game against Notre Dame. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Southeastern Conference, traditionally the strongest in the
nation, landed eight teams in the tournament. The Big 12 and the
Atlantic Coast Conference placed five each and the Big East and the
Big Ten have four each.
</P>
<P>
   One of those SEC teams is Florida (19-13) despite a 6-8
conference record. This was the first time the tournament had given
an at-large berth to a team with a losing record in conference
games.
</P>
<P>
   Teams on the bubble that got in included North Carolina State
(16-11), which won seven of its last 10 games and played a strong
nonconference schedule; Maine, (23-6), which finished 9-1 and lost
to Northeastern by only two points in the American East final and
Santa Clara (22-6), which played a strong game against Colorado
State.
</P>
<P>
   McGlade said eight to 10 teams were in contention for the last
four berths. Among those not chosen, she said, were George
Washington, Western Kentucky, Kent, New Mexico and Northwestern
Louisiana. Georgetown of the Big East missed out, too. Those and
other winning but unselected teams became prime candidates for the
Women's National Invitation Tournament, a 32-team competition that
starts Thursday and will be played at campus sites.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Summitt, the Tennessee coach, spoke highly of her team,
which lost only to Purdue and Louisiana State this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern,'' she said, ``is that we don't get anxious
and quick-shoot the basketball. We have to go inside. Whether we
play against a zone or man defense doesn't matter. We're better
prepared to play against a zone than any time in 25 years because
that's all we see.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw, Tennessee's all-American, also dismissed the
theory that a zone defense would present a problem for the Lady
Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything will present a problem for us,'' she
said. ``I don't think any team in America can stop us.''

DORAL'S MERCILESS 18TH HAS MERCY ON ELKINGTON
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was a dramatic victory for Steve Elkington, a
disgusting loss for Ernie Els and a cruel turn of events for Greg
Kraft. And when Sunday's final round of the Doral-Ryder Open was
history, the 18th hole, one of the toughest in the world, had added
to its victims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a double-bogey by Els and a bogey by Kraft on the
final hole, Elkington claimed a suspense-filled one-stroke victory,
despite making bogey at No. 18 as well. Shooting an eight-under-par
64, including a streak of six consecutive birdies, Elkington
overcame a six-stroke deficit and won at Doral Golf Resort and Spa
for the second time in three years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elkington finished at 13-under-par 275, a stroke ahead of Kraft,
the third-round leader, who hit his second shot at No. 18 into the
water, leading to the bogey that sank his dreams. Five players tied
for third at 11 under: Els, Tommy Armour 3d, Scott Dunlap, Jay Haas
and David Toms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it was Elkington who walked away with the $540,000
first-place check, playing tremendous golf to overtake the field,
then watching as his main competitors stumbled on the final hole of
the course nicknamed the Blue Monster. It was the 10th PGA Tour
victory of Elkington's career, but he realized that in addition to
being good, he was fortunate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty lucky, wasn't it?,'' asked Elkington, the 1995 P.G.A.
Championship winner, who was so angry after missing his five-foot
putt for par at No. 18 that he kicked the scorer's trailer. ``But I
will take it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The climax was wild. Completing his round more than an hour
before Kraft and Els finished, Elkington watched on television from
the driving range, preparing for a possible playoff, only to see
Els and Kraft make miscues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Els was the first to fall, arriving at No. 18 at 13 under par,
tied for the lead. But No. 18 is a par-4, 443-yard potential
nightmare that features a narrow driving area and a large pond on
the left side that can swallow both tee shots and approach shots.
After a good drive, Els pulled an 8-iron shot from 154 yards into
the left rough near the water, about 20 feet from the hole. Faced
with a terrible lie, Els needed to hit a delicate chip shot that
would land near the pin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Els made another mistake. He flubbed his chip shot, which
landed only a few feet in front of him, and the ball rolled back
down the bank and almost went into the water. Now Els needed a
miracle _ a chip from about 20 feet, out of a another terrible lie,
to save par and to tie Elkington. It didn't happen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Els blasted his chip shot past the pin, then missed the putt
coming back for a double-bogey. For a two-time United States Open
champion, it was a humbling ending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play good enough to win,'' said Els, who shot a 70.
``I wanted to hit the first chip on the green, but it was a really
tough lie, almost unplayable. I couldn't get myself to hit it hard
enough. I can't believe I hit that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft soon felt the same way. Looking for his first victory on
tour, Kraft birdied No. 17 to tie Elkington heading to the 18th
hole.
</P>
<P>
   But after a strong drive, Kraft made his blunder, badly
mis-hitting a 5-iron from 190 yards that never had a chance to stay
dry. Many in the crowd gasped as the ball landed in the water,
forcing Kraft to take a penalty stroke and a drop from about 90
yards. Kraft then hit a wedge shot that stopped about 10 feet short
of the pin. He made the putt for bogey and a 71 and settled for the
toughest second-place finish of the three he now has in his
career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kraft decided to play aggressively on the final hole, and it
cost him dearly. ``I was trying to hit a 5-iron against the wind,
tilted on it and hit it heavy,'' Kraft said. ``I knew it was in the
water as soon as I hit it. I played an aggressive shot, and hit a
very poor one. I was thinking birdie.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the $324,000 second-place check was any consolation,
Kraft said: ``No. It's very disappointing, but it's not going to
stop me. I'm going to work harder. Sooner or later, I'm going to do
it right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elkington did almost everything right early, shooting a 30 on
the front nine and making six consecutive birdies starting at No.
6, the tour's longest birdie streak this year. But he left the door
open by missing his five-foot putt for par at No. 18. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elkington angrily left the green and spent the next hour
watching from the driving range and hoping for the best. ``I was
upset,'' he said. ``I felt like I let everybody back in, and I was
pretty disgusted with myself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he emerged a winner. With one of the game's most fluid
swings, Elkington is a premier player, but he has been plagued by
health problems the past two years, including a nasty bout with
viral meningitis last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how sick he was,'' said Joe (Gypsy)
Grillo, Elkington's caddie. ``I was scared. I've known him for a
long time and I had never seen him like that. He could hardly move,
and he had a 105 fever. But he's O.K. now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elkington proved that and hoped it signaled the start of good
things to come. ``I'm 36, and when you start to get older, you
focus on the big tournaments,'' he said. ``Doral kind of represents
the start of golf on the East Coast. I'm very happy.'' &QL;

SERENA WILLIAMS RAISES HER CONFIDENCE BY DEFEATING DAVENPORT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS, Calif. _ Now that she has developed the confidence
to match her muscles, Serena Williams has declared her intention of
shouldering into the top five by the year's end. After all, the
year's beginning has produced her first career title, collected
last week in Paris, and a significant victory over the world's No.
2 player, earned Sunday afternoon in her debut appearance in the
Evert Cup's singles draw.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on outgrowing her role as understudy in the sister act
she and her fifth-ranked sibling, Venus, have unleashed on the
women's tour, Williams used her blistering returns and unbreakable
serve to throttle last year's runner-up, second-seeded Lindsay
Davenport, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has struggled through two courses of antibiotics
trying to tame a virus she caught at the Australian Open in January
and was neither sharp nor strong enough to contend with the power
that Williams, ranked 21st and unseeded here, hurled across the net
in the second-round match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely took advantage of a good day to beat a top
player,'' said Davenport, who had a chance to reclaim the No. 1
ranking from Martina Hingis had she been able to capture this
event, her first in a month because of her illness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Williams slipped ahead in their career rivalry, 2-1,
and has no reason, she said, to be intimidated by Davenport or
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm playing well, doing the best that I can do, I'm
definitely going to be in the top 10 and probably the top five, if
not better,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she used last year's defeat of Davenport in Sydney,
Australia, as incentive to plow into this match not as an underdog,
but as a clear threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really mentally focused, and I really was mentally
there,'' said Williams, who demonstrated her perseverance by
flinging herself to the court in successful pursuit of a drop shot
from Davenport in the final game. Williams catapulted from the
backcourt to the net, scooped up the ball as her body scraped the
hardcourt and collected a forehand winner. The move put Davenport
deeper in trouble, down by 5-2, 15-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many other players probably would have gotten there;
she is just a great athlete,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   To punctuate her upset, Williams stabbed both arms into the air
with a mix of menace and jubilation after her crosscourt forehand
secured the victory. Then she raced to the corner of the court to
embrace her father, Richard, whose recent strategy for making both
daughters bona fide world-beaters, entering them in separate events
when possible, appears to be reaping immediate rewards.
</P>
<P>
   When Serena Williams won her inaugural title last Sunday by
defeating the hometown heroine, the Australian Open runner-up
Amelie Mauresmo, at the Gaz de Paris, Venus Williams was busy
defending her first title in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a lot of the same tournaments last year and it just
didn't work,'' said Serena Williams, who picked up no titles while
her sister won three in 1998. ``If something isn't working, let's
try something different. That's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters are playing doubles together here, with Venus
sitting out singles, but both have entered the Lipton
Championships, later this month in Key Biscayne, Fla.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House subcommittee hearing was chugging along
unremarkably enough when suddenly, out of nowhere, she piped up.
The panel's Republican chairman, George W. Gekas of Pennsylvania,
all but cringed.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he practically moaned, was Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, a Texas
Democrat, bearing down on a microphone at a meeting of a panel to
which she did not belong? Gekas' expression posed another question,
which went unspoken: Would she please just go away?
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Ms. Jackson-Lee lingered, lobbying Democrats
on the subcommittee to yield her a few of the minutes they were
allotted for statements. When one did, Ms. Jackson-Lee got her
moment.
</P>
<P>
   She almost always does.
</P>
<P>
   This scene last week at an inquiry into the future of the
independent counsel law, when Ms. Jackson-Lee argued against the
statute's renewal, confirmed what her four years on Capitol Hill
and her voluble role in the impeachment debate already had made
fairly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson-Lee has become Congress' resident noodge, an
endlessly loquacious presence here, there and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson-Lee, 49, says that she simply is dedicated to her
job and to her constituents in the section of Houston that she
represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an obligation to make sure that their concerns are
heard, are answered,'' she said in an interview in her Capitol Hill
office on Thursday. The shade and cut of her purple jacket were
regal, as was the emphatic tone of her voice. ``I need to make a
difference. I don't have wealth to write a check. But maybe I can
be a voice arguing consistently for change.''
</P>
<P>
   It is her opinion that the time and money available to
independent counsels have been unchecked and that the same work
could be done in a less reckless fashion by a strengthened Justice
Department. Ms. Jackson-Lee remains astounded by the treatment of
President Clinton, and while a handful of other House members
dropped by Clinton's Senate trial once or twice, Ms. Jackson-Lee
went daily.
</P>
<P>
   She said that as a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
which had held hearings into the articles of impeachment, she
wanted to bear witness to the completion of a prosecution she
opposed. ``I know oppression when I see it,'' she said. ``I know
unfairness when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her trial vigil surprised few colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find her an incredibly conscientious, serious, committed,
passionate public servant,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D- Calif.. ``I
don't watch C-Span that much, but friends of mine who do tell me
that Sheila is on whenever they turn on the set.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ambitions, she said, were not always grand. When she and her
brother were growing up in Queens, where their mother worked as a
nurse and their father as a hospital orderly, she set her sights on
becoming an executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination when she
was in high school altered her future. It triggered the creation of
scholarships for black students at New York University, one of
which she got. And it filled her with a new fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a benefactor of the hills and valleys, the broken bodies
and broken hearts, the loss of life of many who have gone on before
me,'' Ms. Jackson-Lee observed.
</P>
<P>
   She transferred to Yale University, from which she graduated in
1972, then earned a law degree from the University of Virginia.
Marriage led her to Houston, where her husband, Elwyn C. Lee, is an
administrator at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They have a daughter, 19, in college in North Carolina and a
son, 13, in private school in Houston. Ms. Jackson-Lee never moved
her family to Washington and flies home on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her political ambitions sprang in part from her
desire to help women and black and Hispanic people get a fair shot
at success. Her seat in Congress, which once belonged to Barbara
Jordan, came after four years on Houston's City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the notice Ms. Jackson-Lee has drawn since arriving here
in 1995 has not been flattering. News reports have pegged her as an
imperious taskmaster who forces staff members to drive her just a
few blocks and who has a high turnover among employees. A former
executive assistant, Rhiannon Burruss, said in an interview that
Ms. Jackson-Lee was so rude to flight attendants that an official
with one airline offered to send the congresswoman's office a
competing carrier's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson-Lee called such accusations ``absolutely
ridiculous,'' out of date and sexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a point when, just like any other human being,
a politician has the right to say, `That was age-old, and you leave
it be.' And then you have to prove to me you do the same kind of
thing with congressman Somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson-Lee would prefer to talk about issues like better
mental health care for needy children, one of her current concerns.
But colleagues said that her style sometimes undercut her
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat sitting near her at last week's hearing said that
when Ms. Jackson-Lee persuaded Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, to
give some of his time to her, the reaction among a few other
Democrats was audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They groaned,'' the lawmaker said.

BEING 1ST CHARTER SCHOOL MEANS HARD WORK, DISCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Colo. _ In 1993, the Douglas County Schools became
the first Colorado district to approve a charter school, Academy
Charter.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy, said Melinda Windler, one of the parents who put
together the 600-page proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people starting a school don't have any experience in
running schools,'' she said. ``It's impossible to do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, five other charter schools _ including one that
secured enough money to build its own facility _ have sprouted in
this hilly, picturesque region where homes in the shadow of the
Rocky Mountains are big and filled with professionals who work just
up the interstate in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of the district's students occupy desks inside
these charters, higher than the 2.6 percent state charter
enrollment average.
</P>
<P>
   Each weekday morning, cars stream into the strip-mall parking
lot just south of McDonald's in Castle Rock. Doors open.
Uniform-clad elementary and middle school students pile out and
into Academy Charter School, housed in a former Super Value grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hart used to shop at the store. Now her children study
there.
</P>
<P>
   She also serves as the charter's office manager and deals with
Douglas County Schools, whose central office is just across the
highway from Academy Charter. Sometimes she sees the district as a
tight-fisted employer, requiring the charter to use its liability
insurance and other services and failing to mail monthly checks
promptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the big picture, we're just a little piece for them,'' Hart
said. ``But to us, it's everything.''
</P>
<P>
   She gravitated toward the 300-student Academy Charter School
because of its primary focus on reading, writing and arithmetic.
The curriculum is based on core knowledge guidelines outlined in
the 1987 bestseller ``Cultural Literacy: ``What Every American
Needs to Know''.
</P>
<P>
   Like many back-to-basics schools in Arizona, discipline is
strict. Classes are small. Learning is based on individual-learning
plans, or yearly goals.
</P>
<P>
   That appeals to many students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it better than my old school,'' announced Kaitlyn
Lincoln, a 10-year-old fifth-grader. ``I had a C, now I have an
A.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, who must volunteer at least 20 hours each school year
to ensure their child has a spot, created this school and work for
it _ literally. They hung drywall and grabbed paintbrushes to get
it ready for students the first year.
</P>
<P>
   They could be put back to work in the near future. Plans are
being made to construct a building nearby that could be used by the
charter school and other community groups.
</P>
<P>
   There is a waiting list. You might even find a newborn's mother
adding her child's name.
</P>
<P>
   The school has had its share of growing pains, however.
</P>
<P>
   It is noisy. Like cubicle partitions, the walls in the center of
the building don't reach the ceiling. So teachers don headsets and
equip rooms with speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Three principals have either quit in frustration or been fired.
One of them was barred from the campus by a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, three-quarters of the 32-member &UR; teaching staff left
because of overzealous parents. Carmen McElhinney, the art teacher,
might be the next to go. She recently recalled confrontations with
parents upset that she was teaching art from different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're held back by politics,'' said the educator as she
watched fifth-graders sketch Mayan designs.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Smith, the school's latest principal, is trying to change
that. This fall, he began requiring parents to make appointments
with teachers instead of barging into classrooms on a whim.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Goodwin, president of the parent governing board, is most
concerned with whether the school is working for her children _ and
improving the district. For instance, the district has adopted
academic tracks for different types of students, similar to an
honors program already in place at her charter school.
</P>
<P>
   And that's important.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most Academy grads will have to return to the
district to attend high school since there isn't a charter high
school in the area. &QL;

BULLIED ISLANDERS FAIL TO COME TO THE DEFENSE OF THEIR GOALIE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ A second-period shouting match between the
Islanders' Tommy Salo and the Devils' Scott Stevens was probably
not a factor in the Devils' 4-2 victory Sunday, but it spoke
volumes about the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   First the Islanders stood and watched as Stevens bullied Ted
Donato, their finesse forward, whom Stevens outweighs by 35 pounds.
Then the Islanders allowed Stevens to taunt Salo, their starting
goalie, before 12,045 fans at their home rink.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved the Devils' record to 3-0 at Nassau
Coliseum this season, giving them their first season sweep here.
The Devils (35-21-8) also moved within 2 points of the Eastern
Conference leader, Ottawa. The Islanders fell to 19-38-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils played much of the game without Bobby Holik, their
leading scorer, who was hit by an errant puck while on the bench in
the first period and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' troubles this season can be summed up by the
trash-talking between Salo and Stevens, the Devils' hardened
captain.
</P>
<P>
   They exchanged words late in the second period with the Devils
ahead, 4-2. Stevens was skating toward the exit after he and Donato
had picked up matching roughing penalties. Donato had taken a whack
at Devils goalie Martin Brodeur and Stevens cross-checked Donato
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Salo began jawing at Stevens, who is known for not backing down.
The two wound up face to face, with Stevens motioning Salo to drop
his gloves and fight. Salo backed down as his teammates watched
from the other end of the ice. No Islander came to Salo's side.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time this season that the Islanders did not
stand up for a teammate, as hockey protocol demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actions speak louder than words,'' Islanders Coach Bill
Stewart said when asked what his team should have done. ``I guess
we'll have to do some actions _ or transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you one thing, Scott Stevens wasn't too scared.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were playing without Rich Pilon, their tough
defenseman, who missed the game after straining his back in
Saturday's 3-3 tie at Philadelphia. Eric Cairns, another tough
Islander, was summoned from the minors Sunday but did not arrive
until the second period. Gino Odjick, the Islanders' only
legitimate tough guy, is out for the season after abdominal
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevens was pretty tough with Donato,'' said Salo, who refused
to repeat what Stevens said to him. ``We needed to get something
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said that Salo initiated the incident but that it was
not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was yelling at me,'' Stevens said. ``I asked him what he
said, but I still couldn't understand him. But he came out of the
crease, so he was making an effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Salo and Stevens have a history. On Oct. 29 at Nassau Coliseum,
fans threw foam pucks onto the ice in disgust as the Islanders were
headed toward another loss. Stevens and other Devils began firing
the pucks at Salo, who exchanged words with them, fired the pucks
back and was not laughing after that game.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were running on fumes Sunday after their bruising
game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the Devils took a 2-0 lead on goals by
Brendan Morrison and Patrik Elias. Morrison scored on a breakaway
at 2 minutes 56 seconds, and Elias finished off a two-on-one
opportunity with Petr Sykora at 14:32.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders cut the lead to 2-1 on a goal by Sergei Nemchinov
at 9:39 of the second period, but the Devils answered with two
goals, by Petr Sykora and Denis Pederson, in the span of 1 minute
42 seconds. Sykora got his 22d goal of the season by beating Salo
with a wicked wrist shot at 12:59. On the power play, Pederson
backhanded the puck under the Islanders' goalie at 14:41.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders scored once more in the second period on a
power-play goal by Robert Reichel to make it 4-2 at 17:48. But they
failed to make a game of it in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Holik was hit on the forehead by an errant puck midway through
the first period. He left the bench immediately to get six stitches
from the Devils' medical staff. He was not expected to miss any
games.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Carpenter was trying to clear the puck from the Devils'
zone, but it went directly over the boards and hit an unsuspecting
Holik.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not as alert as I should be,'' Holik said. ``I didn't
want to take any chances. I feel better than when it happened.''

STANDARDS SET FOR REGISTERING INTERNET NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies wanting to compete with Network Solutions Inc. and its
current monopoly in the lucrative business of registering Internet
domain names can begin applying for consideration next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Criteria for registration were approved last week in Singapore
by the new nonprofit corporation appointed by the Clinton
administration to take over administration of the Internet from the
U.S. government and to introduce competition into the system of
assigning the Internet addresses known as domains.
</P>
<P>
   The initial accreditation guidelines called for applicants to
have $100,000 in liquid capital, $500,000 in liability insurance, a
proven computer infrastructure and at least five employees. Esther
Dyson, interim chairwoman of the group's board, said that in
relaxing the guidelines the board would allow exceptions to some of
the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria were among the first policy decisions made by
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling other issues, the board also forged a structure for the
body that will ultimately recommend how and when to add new
top-level domains _ the three-letter suffixes like .com and .org _
to accommodate demand for new Internet addresses. In addition, the
board adopted a conflict-of-interest policy and established
procedures for reviewing its staff decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some major progress toward creating a truly
competitive environment in the .com, .net and .org domain-naming
system,'' Ms. Dyson said. ``We also showed the consensus process in
operation by changing our initial proposals to reflect the
community's feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the creation of Icann and just about everything the
board has proposed have stirred opposition and controversy around
the globe, nothing has been more contentious than its refusal to
hammer out policy decisions in public.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson said the board had also relaxed its requirements for
companies that wanted to compete with Network Solutions, which has
operated until now as a government-protected monopoly. It is
currently the exclusive registrar for the most popular top-level
domains _ .com, .net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   International complaints about the company's lucrative monopoly
led the United States last year to create Icann and to move
administration of the Internet from federal contractors to the new
private corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can either meet that criteria or you can prove to us that
you don't need to,'' Ms. Dyson said. ``You can say, `Hey, I've got
only two guys, but we're total Net heads, we've been in business
five years, we've never had any complaints. We don't need five
employees.'''
</P>
<P>
   Icann's initial goal is to introduce five competitors to the
domain-registration business by the end of April. That test is
expected to last about two months, after which Icann plans to let
an unlimited number of companies around the world participate in
the registry.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for those initial five will be taken beginning next
Monday. The Icann staff, led by its interim president, Mike
Roberts, will pick the first five companies from those applicants.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Ms. Dyson said, Icann will lower the threshold.

INTERNET CONCERN PLANS SYSTEM FOR SMALL ONLINE TRANSACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cybergold Inc., a company that pays consumers to
pay attention to World Wide Web sites, now plans to let consumers
make online purchases for as little as 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, which Cybergold intends to announce on Monday,
is the industry's latest attempt at a so-called micropayment system
for the Internet _ a way to pay for information or services whose
price may be too low to warrant the expense of a credit card
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Cybergold already operates the online Earn and Spend Community,
which has 1.5 million members and enables consumers to earn money
by responding to advertisements or commercial offers. The amounts,
which are credited to a subscriber's account and can be converted
to cash or used as cybercurrency, range from 25 cents for filling
out a form for the online car buying service 1StopAuto to $3 for
purchasing a subscription to Rolling Stone magazine. Currently the
highest fee that a Cybergold member can earn is $25 for signing up
for a Visa card.
</P>
<P>
   The new system would employ electronic accounts from which
members could make online purchases of as little as 25 cents. The
approach is supposed to be simple enough that an individual author,
for example, could offer a document for sale on the Cybergold Web
site. Each time someone decided to purchase and download that
document, the price would be transferred from the reader's account
to the author's account. Other possibilities might be downloading
digital audio files in the popular MP3 format, which would enable
musicians to sell their own recordings directly. Cybergold would
take a fee of 10 to 15 percent for each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is publishing for the rest of us,'' said Nat Goldhaber, a
Silicon Valley entrepreneur, who founded Cybergold in 1996. ``I
believe that there is an audience for content that has a smaller
constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Microsoft Corp. announced an ``electronic
wallet'' system last week, to be known as Microsoft Passport and
intended to let computer users pay for purchases made via the
company's MSN Web portal. Microsoft is trying to attract small
businesses to set up electronic storefronts on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Micropayment systems, which are intended to supplant traditional
currency systems on the Internet, are expected to be the means for
completing 8 of every 10 online transactions _ though only about 25
percent of the total revenue _ by the year 2002, according to
Jupiter Communications, a New York-based market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   There have been various attempts to create micropayment systems
on the Internet, including efforts by Cybercash Inc., Digicash Inc.
and the First Virtual Corp. But so far, none of these efforts have
yet been widely adopted.
</P>
<P>
   They have failed, Goldhaber said, at least in part because their
systems required users to download large software files, which then
limited the consumer to using the PC on which the software was
installed. In contrast, the Cybergold system is based on standard
Web software and can be used from virtually any computer with an
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Goldhaber said the Cybergold system was still growing rapidly,
with 175,000 new members signed up in February.

 &HT;    Elliott, 6 others mix it up accident
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A seven-car pileup took out a pair of contenders in
Sunday's Las Vegas 400, including Bill Elliott of Dawsonville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin, last year's NASCAR Winston Cup rookie of the year,
appeared to spark a massive pileup for the second time this season.
Irwin, who was running in the top 10 before the wreck, lost control
of his No. 28 Ford and spun in the back straightaway during the
132nd lap.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's car knocked Kenny Wallace's Chevrolet into the wall,
knocking him out of the race. Elliott, who started 14th and climbed
as high as fifth, was t-boned between Wallace and Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Derrike Cope, Buckshot Jones of Tucker, Joe Nemecheck and Jimmy
Spencer were also involved in the wreck, but they all returned to
the track, although none finished higher than 26th.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wallace) was racing (Irwin) so hard and they came up off the
corner and Kenny just got a little bit loose,'' Elliott said.
``When they hit I thought they were gonna go up so I turned left.
But (Irwin) went up and came back down and I hit him. I tried
everything to miss him, but I just couldn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who was knocked out of the race and finished 41st, caused
a pileup in the season-opening Daytona 500 when he hit the rear of
Roush Racing teammate Dale Jarrett's Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got loose on new tires,'' Irwin said. ``It took about
10 laps to get going and with the lapped car on the outside, I
tried to go to the inside and got a little loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's crew repaired his No. 94 Ford and he later returned to
the track, where he completed 172 of 267 laps to finish 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really encouraged a lot by how good we were running,''
Elliott said, ``but it sure is disappointing in a lot of ways. It's
definitely the best we've been in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving up
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan struggled in the first two events this season,
finishing 14th and 29th at Daytona and Rockingham, respectively.
Things didn't look much more promising at Las Vegas, where Irvan
started 40th on Sunday after needing a provisional to make the
field.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvan quickly stormed through the field. He made an
unscheduled pit stop during the 10th lap to tighten up the car and
led five laps, 64-68. He finished sixth, matching his best
performance of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good day coming off our struggle at Rockingham,''
Irvan said. ``Anytime you come from the back and go all the way to
the front and lead the race, that's what it's all about. There were
times when it was probably the best car on the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   Falling down
</P>
<P>
   Besides three drivers who didn't qualify for the race -- Robert
Pressley, Kyle Petty and Dave Marcis, Irwin took the biggest hit in
the standings points, falling 12 spots to No. 18. Stewart and
Elliott both fell nine spots to Nos. 27 and 28, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Four drivers who started the race in the first five rows, Tom
Hubert (4th), Jerry Nadeau (8th), Nemecheck (3rd) and Ricky Craven
(6th), all finished outside the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   In the pits
</P>
<P>
   It's rare that Jeff Gordon's Rainbow Warriors are out-performed
on pit stops, but that was the case in the first green-flag stop in
Sunday's race. During the 56th lap, Ward Burton's crew teams got
him out first with a 17-second pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   That equaled Mark Martin's time in the pits, and beat Gordon's
time of 18.2 seconds. Burton got out of the pits first, even though
he spun out on the infield driving onto pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pit crew has been working all winter and that's the first
time in Winston Cup that I've gone in leading and gone out
leading,'' Burton said. ``They just did a fabulous in the pits all
day long. Even when I went through the grass like a clown out
there, we still came out leading the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's second pit stop wasn't as good as his first. He took
only two tires on the stop, but then decided to come back a second
time for two more tires.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin's fortunes weren't as bad as that of Jones and
Jarrett, who both ran out of gas before making it to the pits.
</P>
<P>
   In the garage
</P>
<P>
   Craven, looking to revive his career after suffering from
post-concussion syndrome last year, took the hardest break on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Craven, who had the sixth-fastest qualifying time on Friday, was
forced to pull into the garage area after the power steering pump
in his No. 58 Ford broke. He later returned, but finished 39th
after completing only 136 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just froze up,'' Craven said. ``It started pretty early and
it got worse and worse. It got to the point where I couldn't even
steer it. It's a shame that it happened so early on, but we worked
awfully hard this week and it's getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd, who won the pole at Rockingham on Feb. 21, was the
first driver to retire after 115 laps on Sunday and finished 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke a valve or something,'' Rudd said. ``I guess we made
a big mistake on the first caution. I came in and we were gonna
work on the car because we started in the back, but we started off
racing about three-quarters of a lap down and got a lap down
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie watch
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart caught a tough break in only the eighth lap when
Johnny Benson lost it on the front straightaway. Benson's No. 26
Ford caught the right front of Stewart's Pontiac, sending Stewart
into the wall and Benson onto the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just some guy out there in a hurry, I guess,''
Stewart said. ``It must have been a 30-lap race today. They must
have changed the length of it. I thought it was 267 laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Elliott Sadler was involved in a wreck for the third race
in a row. During the 188th lap, Michael Waltrip's car went sideways
and hit Steve Grissom's Chevy. Sadler tried to pass in the infield,
but he couldn't avoid the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler returned during the 111th lap and finished 33rd. Stanton
Barrett, making his first start in owner Junie Donlavey's Ford,
finished 30th. Stewart holds a one-point advantage over Sadler in
the rookie of the year standings.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who made his first Cup start of the season, finished 29th
and trails Stewart by 18 points. Jones, the most popular driver on
the Busch Series last year, missed qualifying for the first two Cup
events this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't any good (in practice on Saturday) so we just
guessed with the setup,'' Jones said. ``We missed. It was way too
soft up front on the springs. But we learned a lot and changed a
lot of things on the car. I'm not getting down about it.''

CAMBODIA SAYS IT WILL TRY REBEL LEADER IN DOMESTIC COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY _ Facing mounting calls to try Khmer Rouge leaders blamed
for the deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians, the Cambodian government
said Sunday it would prosecute the last hard-line Khmer Rouge
commander in a domestic military court.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is expected Monday to release recommendations
by a panel of jurists calling for an international tribunal to
judge as many as 30 Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The group ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, imposing a brutal
vision of agrarian Marxism that led to the death of one in six
Cambodians by execution, starvation, overwork or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Observers worry that Prime Minister Hun Sen might use Saturday's
capture of Ta Mok _ the notorious ``one-legged butcher'' who had
evaded authorities for two decades _ as a chance to heap all blame
on one hated figure and absolve others now allied with Hun Sen. A
high-profile prosecution at home _ where courts are widely seen as
vulnerable to corruption and government intimidation _ might also
silence demands for an international trial, which Hun Sen could not
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``A domestic trial ... wouldn't be fair,'' Pin Sisovann,
associate editor of The Cambodia Daily, said in a telephone
interview Sunday. ``The Cambodian government should know that the
international community would never support a tribunal that would
only hold Ta Mok responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear whether a broader-based international trial
would be good for the nation or would reopen old wounds. That
debate rages daily in Cambodian homes and newspapers, and whichever
side prevails will shape the moral code and the political culture
of that country.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say an unbiased, international trial would heal a
broken nation, proving that crimes have consequences and squelching
a culture of impunity. Skeptics say assigning blame now could upset
a delicate peace and distract an impoverished country from
rebuilding its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen _ himself a Khmer Rouge battalion commander before he
broke with the rebels and fled for Vietnam in 1977 _ asked the UN
to consider a tribunal in 1997, but lately has spoken against the
idea, saying it could scare defectors into reigniting civil war. In
December, when two top rebels abandoned jungle hideouts where they
were waging a losing battle, Hun Sen welcomed them as VIPs, hosting
them in a five-star hotel and urging the nation to ``dig a hole to
bury the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The government feels differently about Ta Mok, 72, who never
surrendered to authorities. Still, government spokesman Khieu
Kanharith said Sunday that Ta Mok would not be sent to an
international tribunal after being prosecuted at home. ``One
tribunal for one crime and it's over,'' he told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong leaves for New York
Monday, and is expected to meet UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
this week to discuss a tribunal. Hun Sen has said he would only
support proceedings that also hold responsible those who aided the
Khmer Rouge, such as China, the United States, and Thailand. That,
all sides agree, is hardly likely.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Hun Sen throws up obstacles, demands for a trial are
stronger than ever. With last year's death of Khmer Rouge supremo
Pol Pot, the arrest and defections of others, and the UN report, a
growing number of people think there will finally be an accounting
for one of the century's most brutal regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly everything is coming into place and I feel it's going
to happen. People were frightened to see the welcome given to two
Khmer Rouge leaders last December. . . . Now there is a feeling, a
momentum, an atmosphere _ this is the time,'' said Youk Chhang,
director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Youk Chhang lost his sister, aunts, and uncles, and was himself
tortured by the Khmer Rouge, and has devoted his life to
documenting their atrocities. He and his staff have visited 410
killing sites _ each with 100 to 2,000 bodies _ and have amassed
350,000 pages of evidence, plus photographs, tapes, and films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell the Khmer Rouge that they can torture me, kill
my sister, torture my mother, but I came back strong. The Khmer
Rouge have done so much psychological damage to us, but now we have
to face them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We collect things that are part of the puzzle, and now the
puzzle is ready to be seen,'' he said, waving at cabinets full of
numerous items such as Khmer Rouge diaries, job applications, death
orders, and crop reports.
</P>
<P>
   One human rights worker who spoke on condition of anonymity
recounted a recent dream in which Khmer Rouge leaders came seeking
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put half in my mother's house, half in my house,'' the
worker said. ``I think it's a reflection of the fear that if they
are put on trial here, it'll be a Mickey Mouse trial. If it's a
serious international trial . . . someone might kill them'' so they
don't reveal the involvement of others.
</P>
<P>
   Yet tribunal supporters say despite the risks, such a
prosecution is necessary for healing. ``This is a broken society.
Think of the population of Europe in 1945, but imagine the entire
population was survivors of Auschwitz,'' said Raoul Marc Jennar,
author of the forthcoming ``Cambodian Chronicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennar said that trying perpetrators in an independent court is
essential for a society that has come to believe people can
literally get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to put a kid in jail for five years for
stealing a motorcycle if (Khmer Rouge leader) Khieu Samphan can get
VIP treatment after what he did,'' Jennar said, referring to a
rebel who was welcomed by Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his Phnom Penh home, opposition legislator Sam
Rainsy agreed ``impunity is at the root of a never-ending cycle of
violence. Because no one has ever been prosecuted, criminals don't
hesitate to commit more crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has been tried for a grenade attack on a Sam Rainsy rally
that killed at least 16 people in March 1997 _ an attack widely
suspected to have been launched by Hun Sen's supporters. Sam Rainsy
says there have been at least four more attempts on his life since
then.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy said Hun Sen doesn't want a tribunal, because it
would raise questions about his own Khmer Rouge past. ``The worst
type and most dangerous criminals are those still in power: Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hun Sen says if you want peace, we can't have justice, and if
you want justice, we'll have war. We should not be obliged to
choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys indicate that three-quarters of Cambodians
support a tribunal, and conversations with ordinary people back
that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want justice, even if it's a choice,'' said Chroy, 29, a
chauffeur. ``If there's justice, there will be peace. If we don't
bring them to trial, the next generation will walk the same way as
the Khmer Rouge.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hammarberg, the UN's special representative for human
rights in Cambodia, said it is critical ``that justice is not only
made, but is seen to be made. . . . There should be a public
apology from the state authority to the people for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeking to put those old men behind bars
necessarily,'' he added. ``One could imagine they could be
pardoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of any trial, Youk Chhang said it is
impossible to truly punish the Khmer Rouge. ``How would they pay
back 2 million lives? Should they die 2 million times? Live in hell
2 million years? Be forced to work day and night for 2 million
years? The crimes they committed are so grave that I don't know
what punishment would be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``I think a guilty verdict would be a
start.''

BOOK TELLS OF COURTSHIP TO GET CUOMO ON HIGH COURT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind-the-scenes efforts to get Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York to
change his mind and accept a Supreme Court nomination came within
15 minutes of success in 1993, but just before President Clinton
was to make the offer Cuomo called the White House to forestall it,
George Stephanopoulos, the former presidential adviser, says in a
new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the president to think that I might say yes _ the
president shouldn't call me,'' Cuomo was quoted as telling
Stephanopoulos in a 5:45 p.m. call, pre-empting an offer brokered
by Stephanopoulos and Andrew Cuomo, the governor's son and
political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was listening to Cuomo in disbelief,'' Stephanopoulos
writes, ``Andrew called. `This is a 180-degree turn from
yesterday,' he said. `I'm sorry.' I was, too. The game was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos relates the Clinton-Cuomo pas de deux over the
nomination that never was (for a seat to be vacated by Justice
Byron White) in a 456-page memoir, ``All Too Human: A Political
Education,'' published this week by Little, Brown. Excerpts appear
in the March 15 issue of Newsweek, out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Sunday about the account, Cuomo referred to his own
diaries and said he had received only one call from Clinton about
the nomination _ from Air Force One about a week earlier, on April
1, 1993. After several days of intense speculation, Cuomo made
public a letter to Clinton removing himself from consideration and
saying he could better serve as governor and in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the withdrawal, Stephanopoulos said, he and Andrew Cuomo
began quietly trying to change the governor's mind and to get
Clinton to make an offer. ``Andrew and I were caught up in the
world's oldest courtship ritual,'' he wrote. ``He was telling Cuomo
that Clinton really wanted him; I was assuring Clinton that Cuomo
really wanted him.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort came close, Stephanopoulos said, with Cuomo ``on
board'' and Clinton saying that ``Cuomo should expect a call around
6 p.m.'' But, Stephanopoulos said, Cuomo's 5:45 call put an end to
the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said on Sunday that he had no recollection of that call,
but added, ``If George says I called him, I'm sure I called him.''
Cuomo lost the governorship to George Pataki in 1994 and is now a
lawyer who speaks often on public affairs. He said he had no
regrets over his decision.

   LOS ANGELES _ First the euphoria, then the business.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the excitement of seeing their school's name on television
_ on the NCAA selection show, no less _ some Cal State Northridge
women's basketball players had to ask, ``WHO are we playing?''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, it's Colorado State. Northridge (21-7) received the
15th seed in the West and will play the second-seeded Rams (31-2)
Friday at 9 p.m. PST in a sub-regional at Fort Collins, Colo. The
game will be televised live on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State and UC Santa Barbara are also in CSUN's
half of the bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Also as expected, UCLA will host a sub-regional at Pauley
Pavilion on Saturday at 9 p.m. The Bruins (23-7) earned the West's
third seed and will take on No. 14 Wisconsin-Green Bay (19-9), with
the winner getting either Kentucky or Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second straight tournament appearance for the
Bruins, but it's the first for Northridge. Players, coaches and
fans congregated in the Presidential Suite at the Warner Center
Marriott to watch the selection show.
</P>
<P>
   No one cared where the team was going and few were surprised
Colorado State is the destination. Northridge officials had talked
with Big Sky Conference officials (there was one Big Sky member on
the seeding committee), who told them to expect a trip to the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's official, what do the Matadors know about their
opponents?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely nothing,'' guard Edniesha Curry said. ``They're
ranked No. 4 and they got beat by (Southern Methodist). I don't
know anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing to expect: The Rams will key on Curry, who was second
in the conference with an 18.3-point scoring average. In the
conference tournament, she scored 24 and 23 points in the two
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to focus on me, then fine,'' she said. ``It's
been like that for all my years at Cal State Northridge. With a
great team like this, and with the chemistry we have, and with the
depth we have, it creates problems. You can't focus on just Eddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State is led by All-American point guard Becky Hammon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll watch tapes and get to know them, and devise a plan,''
Northridge coach Frozena Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had lost three of its last eight games to fall out of first
place in the Pac-10. But the Bruins rebounded with victories over
Arizona State and Arizona. Coupled with Stanford beating Oregon on
Thursday, UCLA reclaimed a share of the conference title, its first
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a lull,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said. ``We
played such a strong nonconference schedule. Everyone we played,
they're in the tournament (actually, eight of 12 are). It took a
toll on us down the stretch. We lost focus and almost got relaxed.
We always said we needed to finish strong to stay at home and the
players rose to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the victories over the Arizonas and the Bruins found
themselves in as unfamiliar territory as Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Arizona on Saturday, the team ran off the court as
it always does, only to have athletic directors and sports
information people bring them back to take a bow and cut down the
nets.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will the host Midwestern Collegiate Conference
champion Wisconsin-Green Bay Phoenix, led by senior Chari
Nordgaard, who averaged 22.4 points a game and shot 64 percent from
the field.

CALM VOTING SIGNALS PROGRESS IN EL SALVADOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ With the kind of relaxed order that residents
here could only pray for a decade ago, more than 1 million voters
peacefully cast presidential ballots Sunday, a good-news
development for President Clinton ahead of his regional visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid anymore,'' said Nicolas Guevera, a
53-year-old bricklayer from Mejicanos, a northern suburb of the
capital. ``This is not like before, when we were scared of being
hit by gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   For many residents, the calm of Sunday's balloting was another
soothing reminder of how far their country has come since a 12-year
civil war between leftist rebels and the US-backed rightist
government turned their neighborhoods into battlegrounds and made
voting a frightful civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while emerging democracy in El Salvador will probably become
a prominent backdrop for Clinton, who begins a four-day visit to
the region Monday, leaders and residents also warn of a growing
pessimism over their economic troubles. US and Central American
officials have warned of a new stream of refugees from the ruins of
Hurricane Mitch, which devastated the region last October.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing President Armando Calderon Sol said he would urge
Clinton to open US markets to more Salvadoran goods and would
propose the development of more liberal trade agreements with
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to be partners in commerce,'' Calderon Sol said
from his presidential office. ``We're trying to make the transition
from Cold War to democracy, but we can't if we don't have economic
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton is coming empty-handed. He had hoped to announce
nearly $1 billion in aid for the region, but Congress last week
coupled the aid to domestic spending cuts that Clinton rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the economic frustration felt in El Salvador could be
noted in Sunday's low voter turnout. Less than half of the
country's 3 million registered voters bothered to cast ballots,
others evidently seeing little prospect of change.
</P>
<P>
   Even many who did vote said they were troubled that nearly seven
years of peace have done little to improve their standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see so much poverty wherever I go and it really affects the
way I feel,'' said Cesar Ortez, 22, who makes $229 a month working
in a clothing factory. ``The war may be over, but it feels like
we're still fighting for our own survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortez voted for Ruben Zamora, a candidate from the Center
Democratic Union, a center-left party. Ortez's wife, Ana Gonzalez,
voted for the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the former guerrilla group known as the FMLN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though our candidate is not great, I still believe in the
principles of the front,'' said Gonzalez, a college student,
referring to Facundo Guardado, a former FMLN commander.
</P>
<P>
   An early exit poll released Sunday night by the University of
Central America showed that Guardado had 33 percent of the vote,
while Francisco Flores, the candidate from the ruling National
Republican Alliance, or ARENA, had 43 percent. Zamora had 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flores declared victory Sunday night, but it remained unclear
whether he would get the majority needed to avoid a runoff election
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, 39, a graduate of the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst and former Parliament speaker, has tried to soften ARENA's
once fervent anticommunist image. He surprised the country's
political establishment when he announced his candidacy last spring
several weeks before anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the orderly manner that Salvadorans
have voted Monday,'' Flores told reporters after casting his ballot
at a San Salvador school. ``Monday is a victory for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Guardado, 44, has tried to emphasize the growing crime problems
in the country's cities, but has been hurt by divisions within the
FMLN between traditional socialists and more pragmatic moderates.
</P>
<P>
   There were few polling irregularities reported. Most polls
opened at 7 a.m. and closed promptly at 5 p.m. local time. A few
precincts, however, opened a few minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   At the Feria Internacional exhibition center in San Salvador,
the nation's largest precinct, thousands of voters turned the pale
gray and white structure into a street fair.
</P>
<P>
   Families and friends milled and chatted while dozens of vendors
sold everything from fruit drinks to home-made popsicles. Traffic
was jammed along Avenida de la Revolucion in front of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for the low turnout Sunday may be in El
Salvador's often confusing voting rules.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible to vote, residents must acquire a voting card
that requires an applicant to move through a maze of bureaucracy.
On election day, voters must report to polling places designated by
the first lettter of their last name, rather than casting ballots
at a neighborhood precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would make this easier,'' said Francisco Rene
Alvarez, whose two-hour journey to the polls required rides on two
buses. ``If they let us vote where we live, more people would want
to vote. But maybe they don't want more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government recently passed electoral reforms that
call for residential voting, observers say the government has been
slow to implement those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ touring the region without Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
has been sidelined with a recurring back problem _ is likely to
promote democratic movements in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras,
and Guatemala as a legacy of the controversial US policies in the
region in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of those countries are also expected to ask for more
money to ensure that democratic reforms will continue, particularly
after the hurricane-related destruction of much of the region's
agricultural-based economies.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon Sol said the region's economic troubles have also sent
a new wave of immigrants north to the United States in search of
jobs and money to send home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's not about our people going to the US, but
about our people being able to work here,'' he said. ``We're not
interested in gifts, but in investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurting Clinton's efforts will be the end Monday of a
hurricane-related US moratorium in deportations of illegal
immigrants back to El Salvador and Guatemala. White House officials
say there is ``no basis'' for extending the deportation stay.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein Barillas of Guatemala warned
that the forced return of a large number of immigrants would
severely crimp recovery efforts.

EDITORIAL: A NEW SPEAKER ERRS ON REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 8:
</P>
<P>
   After two months in office, House Speaker Dennis Hastert is on
his way to making the very mistake that helped destroy Newt
Gingrich. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support in the House for
campaign finance reform, which could lead easily to its swift
passage, Hastert has bottled up the legislation in committee until
later in the year or next year. This is Gingrich-style
obstructionism with a more genial face. Supporters of reform need
to get ready for a renewed battle, including a petition drive to
force the bill to the floor by spring.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started late last month, when Rep. Christopher Shays
of Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts reintroduced
their ``soft money'' ban. House rules prevent the start of
collecting signatures for a petition until next month. But
conservative pro-reform House Democrats, led by two Texans, Jim
Turner and Charles Stenholm, have already informed Hastert that
they will take the petition route if he does not yield. Some
Republicans are already prepared to join them. Last year, Gingrich
was humiliated by the success of a similar petition effort. The
same fate awaits Hastert if he does not rise to this first test of
his sincerity in wanting to change the atmosphere in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would outlaw unrestricted soft-money
donations to parties from corporations, unions and rich
individuals. It passed the House last year by a vote of 252 to 179
and has even more support this year. Hastert says he is
concentrating right now on avoiding another legislative debacle
like last year's, which occurred when Republican squabbling over
taxes and spending blocked passage of a budget resolution. His
aides say he also wants to allow consideration of two other
Democratic favorites, the minimum wage and a patient's bill of
rights, before campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   These tactics are a smokescreen. There is no reason for the
minimum wage or health care to preclude early consideration of the
Shays-Meehan bill, which was debated endlessly last year before it
was passed. Even with the difficult budget schedule, there is a
window of opportunity to do campaign finance reform in April and
May, after the scheduled passage of a joint House-Senate budget
resolution and before appropriations bills are considered toward
the fall. That window should be the target date of all supporters
of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Fast action is needed because, although a majority of senators
favor reform, there are not yet 60 votes to block an expected
filibuster led by Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell. Reformers need
time to wage a campaign of pressure on senators before the campaign
season starts next year. The Senate logjam is not a foregone
conclusion. Recently, McConnell, the leading opponent of reform,
said that some form of compromise on the issue was ``worth
discussing.'' His words clearly reflect the anxiety of senators,
who know that voters are demanding an overhaul of a corrupt system.
Once the presidential campaign heats up, hundreds of millions of
dollars in soft money from special interests will pollute the
system. Hastert must not be allowed to thwart the demands of the
public, and his own members, to clean it up. &QL;

 &HT;    40 refugees feared dead off Florida coast
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Estinvie Celius is waiting for his family
to wash ashore.
</P>
<P>
   They crammed onto a 17-foot boat in the Bahamas last week, his
son, three nephews and about a dozen other Haitians paying big
money for a seat on a rickety boat and a better life in South
Florida. Now they are among 40 presumed dead at sea, victims of
perhaps the most deadly smuggling mission in Florida history.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard called off its search for survivors Sunday
morning, a day after two boats carrying 43 Haitians foundered and
sank 26 miles east of West Palm Beach. Three men were rescued, but
their conflicting stories and the slim chance of recovering the
boats dampen hopes of finding out exactly what happened, Coast
Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents say the gas-powered boats _ one a
17-footer, the other 20-feet long _ carried no life preservers and
were part of an organized smuggling operation out of the West End,
Grand Bahama Island. Bahamian authorities found two trucks and
trailers Saturday at a public boat ram used to launch the vessels,
said Art Bullock, head of the Border Patrol office in West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Celius said he talked to his 21-year-old son and three nephews
last Monday night, just before they left St. Mark in Haiti for the
Bahamas. He expected them to arrive Friday night, but then heard
about the sinking through news reports over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he and more than a dozen men and women gathered at
the Haitian American Community Council in Delray Beach awaiting
word on whether any bodies had been found and praying that their
relatives would have a proper burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they didn't get on the boat; I'm calling (Haiti) but I
think they are gone,'' Celius said quietly through an interpreter,
wiping his eyes and nose with a white handkerchief. ``I want to
find the bodies so I'll know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Four men's bodies have been recovered, leaving 29 men and seven
women missing. Agents believe the smugglers died with their
passengers, although officials are still searching Grand Bahama
Island to make sure they aren't hiding out.
</P>
<P>
   The three survivors were not involved in the smuggling
operation, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pure speculation as to what happened out there (at sea),
and the Border Patrol is still gathering information,'' Coast Guard
Lt. Commander Mark Woodring said. ``I don't expect to see any
bodies or wreckage. Traditionally, that far out, people get caught
up in the Gulf Stream and just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   The search began about 2 a.m. Saturday after crewmembers of the
Tomis Faith, a freighter from Malta, heard screams in the water and
saw flashing lights 30 miles east of West Palm Beach. Two Coast
Guard cutters and 12 helicopters and planes looked for survivors
over a 2,600 square mile area, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter found the first survivor, weakly trying to stay
afloat as he grasped a propane tank, at about at about 5 a.m., and
two others were found clinging to a barrel at about 8 a.m. All
three survivors, one man in his late 30s, one in his early 40s and
another in his 20s, were treated for hypothermia, and questioned by
the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors were taken to West Palm Beach hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Pierre, who was on the boat carrying 25 people, remains
hospitalized in stable condition at Good Samaritan Medical Center,
while the other survivors are being held at the Krome Detention
Center near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Two boats, one carring 16 men and two women, the other 20 men
and five women, left Grand Bahama Island during the night late last
week, according to relatives, Coast Guard officers and Border
Patrol agents. About 30 miles off shore, the small boat began
taking on water and the second boat attempted to help, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, both vessels were under water, taking most of
the passengers with them, according to agents' interviews with
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The drownings are the latest in a deadly 12 month which has seen
nearly 60 Haitians and Cubans die trying to reach American shores.
On Dec. 17, a 29-foot boat capsized in 6-foot high seas off Elliott
Key, some 22 miles south of Miami. Nine Cubans drowned and another
five were lost at sea and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and Border Patrol officials said Saturday's
smuggling disaster was the deadliest in Florida's history.
</P>
<P>
   Oppressive conditions at home and the promise of a better life
in Florida entice many Haitians to pay smugglers up to $3,000 per
trip, members of the Haitian community in Palm Beach County said
Sunday. Unless the Haitian and American governments can restore
economic and political stability in Haiti, more smuggling and
drownings are certain, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have peace, real safety in our homes and on our streets,
we won't come to the U.S.,'' said Jean Detreffe, who left Haiti two
decades ago and now owns a transmission shop in West Palm Beach.
``People never know when they'll be shot or attacked in their home.
If (street gangs) know you have money, even a little money, they
are going to come and take it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no control, no police in Haiti right now,'' added
Derrilus Jean, another Haitian immigrant. ``As long as it's out of
control, dangerous, more people are going to die trying to get
here.''

IMMIGRANTS CELEBRATE PASTOR'S RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a worship service that felt at turns like a rock
concert and a religious revival, more than 2,000 people gathered
Sunday in an old movie house in Queens to celebrate the freedom of
the Rev. Frank Almonte, proclaiming it a clear sign that in times
of crisis, God works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus is our man in battle,'' shouted Carlos Jimenez, an
assistant to Almonte. ``He led our pastor to victory. He can defeat
any enemy. He will lift us through any hardships. Glory, glory to
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Almonte walked slowly to the stage. And as he turned to look out
at the cheering crowd, even he, a man who believes in miracles,
seemed awestruck.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is so wonderful,'' he said. ``Blessed is the name of the
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   It was from the airwaves of Radio Vision Cristiana, heard from
New York to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic at 1330 AM, that
Almonte built his growing congregation of more than 1,600 people,
most of them immigrants, in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most rousing sermon, however, was delivered last
month in a five-minute telephone conversation from jail. It was a
call that galvanized immigrants from across the city to demand
freedom for the minister and to protest recent immigration reforms.
And it set Almonte, a 40-year-old father of three sons, on a new
mission to make sure that no other immigrant ever has to endure
what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   The minister had been arrested on drug charges when he arrived
at Kennedy International Airport from his native Dominican Republic
and customs officials discovered 300 steroid tablets in his
suitcase. The pastor explained that the pills were available
legally and over the counter in the Dominican Republic, that he
bought them at the suggestion of a Dominican doctor to help improve
his son's appetite, and that he had no idea they were illegal in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, customs agents shackled the pastor, who had no previous
criminal record, and took him to jail. And because of the felony
arrest, the Immigration and Naturalization Service moved to deport
Almonte, who has lived legally in this country for 23 years and
whose sons are American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday after his arrest, Almonte called his church, the
Adonai Christian Center, from jail. His voice cracking over a
loudspeaker, the minister told his flock that they must practice
the faith he had taught them, and he urged them to pray.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the church decided the time had come to do more than
pray. They called people on prayer lists to raise support for their
pastor, and circulated petitions. Radio evangelists made Almonte's
arrest the focus of their talk shows. And immigrants' rights
advocates criticized America's laws in interviews with Hispanic
newspapers and television programs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Almonte appeared for arraignment at the Queens
County courthouse, more than 1,000 people were there. And last
week, when Almonte appeared in court again, the size of the crowd
outside had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the drug charges against him were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are on the radio with just a microphone, you feel
like you are alone,'' he said. ``But this has made me realize that
I am not alone. From that microphone, I was able to reach the
hearts of many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Almonte said that in his 23 years in America, he had never
participated in demonstrations, nor used his church to push
political agendas. But since the rallies on his behalf, Almonte
said he had warmed to the idea of participating in political
causes, adding that he would work to change America's immigration
laws.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, he has one more legal battle of his own: he is
still under threat of deportation.

GAY MAN IS ALLOWED TO BE A CHURCH LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (lb) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ An openly gay man may sit on the governing
board of his Presbyterian church here despite his refusal to
divulge whether he engages in sexual activities that would bar him
from serving, ecclesiastical judges have ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-1 decision, handed down on Saturday by the Permanent
Judiciary Commission of the Presbytery of Southern New England and
announced Sunday, is the first test of a 1997 amendment to the
constitution of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) that requires
deacons, elders and ministers ``to live in fidelity within the
marriage of a man and woman or in chastity in singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has been monitored around the United States in churches
struggling with the issue of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment, known as Amendment B, also
requires candidates for church leadership to state that they have
repented of any self-acknowledged sin. The church considers
homosexual activity _ though not homosexuality itself _ sinful.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the Stamford case is Wayne Osborne, a
38-year-old financial adviser and a graduate of the Princeton
Theological Seminary who was elected to serve on the session, or
governing body, of the 700-member First Presbyterian Church of
Stamford in May. He has been a member of the church for more than
five years.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his first elevation to the session. He had already
served for three years starting in 1994. But this time, the
circumstances were different, and the session itself was pitted
against congregants who claimed that it was violating the church
constitution by installing Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished his first term as a member of the session, he
divulged to the congregation that he was in a long-term
relationship with another man, Greg Price, a fellow congregant who
worked with developmentally disabled adults.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Osborne was nominated for a second term on the
30-member session because he was deemed by the nominating committee
to have been called on by God to serve. Like the other 10
candidates, he was examined by the session, whose members asked a
prescribed set of questions. Among them: ``Are you a
self-acknowledged sinner unrepentant of that sin?''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne denied having committed any sins requiring repentance,
but was then asked whether his relationship with Price involved
sexual activity. He declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Standing quietly in the church on Sunday after the service at
which the verdict was announced, Osborne explained his refusal to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not an appropriate question,'' he said. ``Even my best
friends don't ask me, and for me to have answered would be to go
against who I am as a person and who God made me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two church members _ Mairi Hair and James MacCallum _ filed
charges against the session, alleging irregularities in its
examination and approval of Osborne as a session member. In the
Presbyterian Church, ordination to elder is a lifetime appointment,
although not all elders serve on sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The ecclesiastical trial was held on Feb. 26 at the Quinnipiac
School of Law in Hamden.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the constitution, the elders examining the person
are required to ask certain necessary questions, including ones
about sin, but the constitution does not require that they get a
clear answer,'' Dan Sassi, a church deacon, explained in a
telephone interview. ``It says that sessions are to respect the
right of the individual to decline to answer and not discuss the
issue. The other side in this case believes that living with a
person is enough proof of sex outside marriage; we say that it is
not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reached by telephone after the news conference, William Prey, a
representative of the church members who challenged Osborne's
appointment, said: ``We are understandably disappointed with the
decision. Be assured that we remain committed to praying for and
working for Amendment B. We are leaning to filing an appeal but
have made no decision yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, emphasizing that the complainants were not motivated by
prejudice against homosexuals, he said: ``There are provisions in
the constitution that apply equally to heterosexuals and
homosexuals that spell out sinful behavior inappropriate for
elected leaders. What one church does locally is really on behalf
of the whole denomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the service on Sunday, Mary Morrison, executive director
of the Darien Chamber of Commerce, remarked: ``I am so pleased. I
know Wayne well and he is a man of exceptional standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amendment B is labeled a gay amendment but that is a
misnomer,'' she went on. ``It could impact all of us who are
single, including me. I am a divorced mother of two grown children.
And Wayne was being truthful to himself and to God.''

STANLEY KUBRICK, MASTER FILMMAKER, IS DEAD AT 70 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick, the last of the great cinema artists of the
20th century, died Sunday at age 70 in his home outside London. No
cause of death was given by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from one genre to the next in a 45-year career _ jabbing
and weaving from the epic story of ``Spartacus'' (1960) to the
intimate adaptation of ``Lolita'' two years later _ the Bronx-born
filmmaker mixed form and function with unmatched wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson, a longtime friend who delivered one of his
finest performances as the deranged writer-husband-father in Mr.
Kubrick's ``The Shining,'' was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was just so great,'' Nicholson said Sunday from his
home in Beverly Hills. ``This is a loss for everyone. We've never
had anyone like him, both as a man and a filmmaker. He's in a class
by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that relies on passing fads and hopeless cliches
to feed the appetite of the nation's box office, Mr. Kubrick took
his time. He had the last open-ended deal with a studio _ in his
case, Warner Bros. Mr. Kubrick selected his material, created his
production schedule, and oversaw everything from the script to the
finished film with no pressure or interference from the studio. He
was, in the truest sense of the word, an independent. And he wasn't
in it for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Mr. Kubrick showed very early promise as an
artist with a camera. When he was 14, he earned $100 from Look
magazine for the first of a number of assignments and was hired
there as a staff photographer when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he sold his first film, ``Day of the Fight,'' a
16-minute-long documentary, to the RKO film studio.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when the words ``artist'' and ``genius'' are used to
describe everything from hairdressers to baseball players, perhaps
we should create new words to describe Mr. Kubrick. He was so far
ahead of everyone else, they may never catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Even his films of the '50s, particularly ``The Killing'' (1956),
a magnificent film noir starring Sterling Hayden as the brains
behind a race track robbery, and the ironically titled ``Paths of
Glory'' (1957), could have been made Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kubrick made 13 feature films. ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' starring
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, his final movie, is slated to be in
theaters this July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him why he didn't make more movies,'' said Nicholson,
while recalling the many hours the two men spent talking on the
phone about boxing, movies, and life in general over the years. ``
`Well, Jack,' he said. `You really wouldn't want me to get bored
making movies, would you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was never bored. And he certainly never bored us.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kubrick never went for cheap thrills. Even in his most
controversial work, ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), which was
criticized for the ultra-violence it decried, Mr. Kubrick never
took the easy way out. He appreciated complexity, embraced
ambiguity, and danced with enigmas. His plans were never simple,
and his vision never failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968) remains the most personal
science fiction movie ever made _ and Mr. Kubrick shot it in
widescreen Cinerama. Watching it Monday is like seeing a brand new
film. While more than 30 years old, there's nothing dated about it.
There were sequences in the film, particularly the stargate montage
toward the end, where Mr. Kubrick had to reinvent the technology in
order to find the cinematic equivalent of his imagination. He had
to put his planned next film ``A.I.'' (for Artificial Intelligence)
on hold because cinema couldn't technically accommodate his
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were making our picture,'' said Nicholson, referring
to ``The Shining'' (1980), ``he had already started thinking about
`Eyes Wide Shut.' He just hadn't come up with an ending. I remember
when he called and told me he came up with an ending but he
wouldn't say what it was. Stanley didn't go into battle without
being fully prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the definitive war
film should take a good, hard look at ``Full Metal Jacket'' (1987).
Mr. Kubrick understood that the Vietnam War was not an aberration
but a brutal, uncomfortable outgrowth of American culture. It
wasn't a matter of hawks and doves, it was the inevitability of
violence as the logical extension of manifest destiny that drew Mr.
Kubrick to the material.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same theme he brought to the equally brilliant ``Dr.
Strangelove, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb''
23 years earlier. While Peter Sellers was remarkable in his many
roles, it was Slim Pickens, riding the bomb as if it were a bucking
bronco, that gave the film its crowning image.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Shining,'' Mr. Kubrick wasn't content to simply make a
terrifying horror film. He wanted the terror to be personal, to get
under our skins, to hit us where we live. He took a rather
one-dimensional story of a family ``getting away from it all'' and
transformed it into a tale of abuse that went back generations.
When Nicholson, the deranged writer, stalks his only son in the
snowbound maze at the film's conclusion, it's not an act of madness
but a logical extension of the psychic pressures that had built up
over time. In many ways, it's more Old Testament than New Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Some myopic viewers only saw Mr. Kubrick as a technocrat, more
concerned with the special lenses he had ground for particular
shots than in developing dramatic themes. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. Mr. Kubrick developed the technology only to
actualize the humanity of his films.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Christiane, and three daughters from a
previous marriage. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

CHARTER SCHOOLS SLOWLY NURTURED IN DENVER AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ When Rex Brown proposed a charter school in the city's
urban center, it wasn't state education officials he had to win
over. Or the community. Or the parents.
</P>
<P>
   He had to win over the competition _ the public school district.
</P>
<P>
   Under Colorado law, charters must petition public school
districts for permission to operate. The districts decide what
charter schools can open within their boundaries, what goals the
charters must achieve, even how the charters are to be funded.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, charter schools are a small, controlled experiment.
Their performances are analyzed each year by the state education
board, their licenses must be renewed every three to five years,
and only 60 can exist at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado is something of a national model for how to nurture
charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Miles away in neighboring Arizona, a younger charter school
movement is bounding ahead, growing furiously and with few
restrictions. The explosion includes 270 charter schools to date,
accounting for almost a quarter of all charter schools in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   This is often cited as a criticism: That the charter law passed
in 1994 is too loose because it allows the movement to be too
large.
</P>
<P>
   While only the school districts in Colorado have authority to
sponsor a charter school, there are three ways charters can come
into being in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   School districts, the Arizona Board of Education, and the state
Board for Charter Schools each can sponsor charter schools. The two
boards are limited to 25 new charters a year, but a district can
sponsor any number, inside or outside its boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Charter leases can run 15 years, and the law doesn't force the
sponsors to evaluate the schools' quality.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has captivated national observers of charter
schools, and most are more skeptical than impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wild West is what we call Arizona. It's too loose,'' said
Brown, executive director of P.S. 1, an ethnically and economically
diverse charter school in inner-city Denver where students build
homes, stroll through the nearby art museum and work in tattoo
parlors as part of their education.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had to wage a two-year campaign to win sponsorship for his
school. By having to plead his case to the public school board, he
said he had to scrutinize his proposal from all financial,
administrative and educational angles.
</P>
<P>
   That depth of scrutiny doesn't exist in Arizona, a state that
national educators say seems more concerned with quantity than
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Jim Griffin, executive director of the
Colorado League of Charter Schools, say the Grand Canyon State
should have a better system for evaluating charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having district-level sponsorship only, accountability (in
Colorado) is clear,'' said Eric Hirsch, an education specialist at
the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan
research group based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 34 states with charter-school laws have a similar
system, wherein districts are the sole sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The concept sounds contradictory _ the apparent equivalent of
Burger King asking McDonald's for permission to open a franchise _
and at times those seeking to create charter schools certainly feel
the system is stacked against them.
</P>
<P>
   When the first wave of charter applications hit Denver Public
Schools in 1993, district school board members balked at approving
them. Student population growth had been stagnant, and allowing new
schools meant the loss of tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And board members were far from impressed with the proposals for
new schools. Said district spokesman Mark Stevens, ``the board
wasn't going to allow city students to go to these schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Into this climate walked Rex Brown with his proposal for P.S. 1,
a school with an untraditional bent: lax classrooms, few exams,
heavy emphasis on out-of-class projects.
</P>
<P>
   The first year Brown pitched P.S. 1, the board instructed him to
fine-tune the idea before it would even consider it. The next year,
it took the unprecedented step of approving the school without
giving it any funding.
</P>
<P>
   Brown appealed to the state board of education and, in the third
year, won. In 1995, P.S. 1 opened in the city library. Today, the
school is housed in an overhauled warehouse that had once been a
bank. Community members also use the building for gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. 1 has no grades, no credits and little structure. The
campus is in effect all of Denver: students are given bus passes to
ride city buses to and from school, to the city library, and to
field trips to places like Colorado rivers to study water
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   The diverse mix of students learns about urban life and how to
become part of it. Standardized test scores are some of the highest
in the Denver district.
</P>
<P>
   Brown credits the success, in part, to the rigorous approval
process P.S. 1 had to go through.
</P>
<P>
   As in Arizona but on a lesser scale, Colorado districts have
responded to the charter school phenomenon by offering new
programs. One Colorado district, faced with an application for a
charter school for gifted students, opened its own gifted school.
Another started a back-to-basics district school because of parent
demand. But these are exceptions to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Colorado education officials say charter schools' impact
on traditional schools here has been minimal compared to the
situation in Arizona, where districts have responded by offering an
array of innovative programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, charters tend to offer programs that public
district schools already offer, some educators say.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the Denver Public Schools spokesman, said that the
district's 120 schools already were providing many alternatives to
traditional learning when charters came on the scene. Within the
district, there are Montessori schools, art-based and gifted magnet
schools, vocational and pre-professional schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he and other Colorado officials say that charters
have a legitimate place alongside traditional schools, even if they
must undergo an arduous process to prove they could thrive on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Rick O'Connell, for one, believes he is proof that an open mind
can make the coexistence of charter and traditional schools work.
The Douglas County Schools superintendent embraced the untested
charter-school concept while many of his peers felt threatened by
it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said it wasn't easy when parents told him he wasn't
adequately serving their children and that charter schools could
better meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he knew charters had great potential.
</P>
<P>
   Charters can take the pressure off overburdened district schools
by reducing student numbers. Pupils are flocking to O'Connell's
district, located in one of the fastest-growing counties in the
country. In one year, 10 schools had to be constructed, and school
calendars were extended year-round to make room for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter schools are one of the best things to happen to
Douglas County,'' said O'Connell, who came to the district two
decades ago when there were 3,000 students. Now, the district hosts
30,000 pupils with 3,000 more coming aboard each year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Colorado and Arizona are bursting with children. Maricopa
County also is one of the nation's fastest growing counties.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear that Arizona's lax charter school law sets up many
schools for failure, for reasons ranging from the possibility of
fly-by-night operators to well-intentioned educators who have no
financial acumen to keep the business afloat.
</P>
<P>
   They fear more cases like Citizen 2000, a charter school whose
founder was accused of using $100,000 state money to buy a home and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be easy,'' said Brown of the P.S. 1
school, ``to start a public school.'' &QL;

IS INDY THE FAST TRACK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The hot topic is where they are: Indianapolis,
site of the 1996 Princeton debacle. The relevant issue is where
they are not.
</P>
<P>
   They are not in the East.
</P>
<P>
   They are not with Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we weren't in the East,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said,
``a lot of kids were excited.''
</P>
<P>
   For good reason. With the dominating Blue Devils as its No. 1
seed, the East Region is ground zero for early exits in the 1999
NCAA Tournament. The Bruins had a 1-in-3 chance of landing there,
and they'd rather face a hundred Princetons than wander into Duke's
path early in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you want to avoid the No. 1 team in the country,''
UCLA forward Sean Farnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bruins are seeded No. 5 in the South Region and
will play Midwestern Collegiate Conference champ Detroit, the No.
12 seed, on Thursday in the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. (Tipoff time
will be announced today, but expect no earlier than 7:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   If they win, the Bruins will face either Ohio State or Murray
State in Saturday's second round. (Keep in mind: Murray State is no
longer coached by former UCLA assistant Mark Gottfried; he's at
Alabama.)
</P>
<P>
   Auburn is the South's No. 1 seed and UCLA's potential Sweet 16
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the seed we deserved,'' Bruins guard Baron Davis said.
``It's a nice environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they got the best No. 5 seed possible. They avoided
Duke, Connecticut and Michigan State _ the obvious No. 1s _ and
were packaged with an Auburn team that has no substantive
nonconference victories and lost to Kentucky in the Southeastern
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the South appears to be the weakest region: None of the
top seeds (Auburn, No. 2 Maryland, No. 3 St. John's and No. 4 Ohio
State) won their conference tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Bruins' 17-point loss at Arizona on Saturday
was a blessing. As expected, the winning Wildcats became a No. 4
seed and were shipped to the Midwest Region, the tournament's
toughest, while the Bruins became a No. 5 and were sent to the
weakest.
</P>
<P>
   Had UCLA won in Tucson, the teams probably would have switched
positions _ their records and power ratings are almost identical _
placing the Bruins in the Midwest alongside Michigan State, Utah
and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a spot in the Midwest could have created a
second-round collision with Jim Harrick and 12th-seeded Rhode
Island, and no one in Westwood wanted any part of that circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we have to do is focus on ourselves and Detroit,''
Farnham said. ``The tournament is a one-game process. If you
overlook one team, you'll get bounced out so quick you won't know
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (22-8) know enough about Detroit to know another
Princeton-esque fate awaits if they're poorly prepared mentally and
strategically.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (24-5) defeated St. John's in the tournament last
year and probably would have received an at-large berth Sunday if
they hadn't won the MCC title.
</P>
<P>
   They defeated Gonzaga on a neutral court in December and lost at
Iowa by one point. They have a tough, defensive-minded coach, Perry
Watson, who was an assistant at Michigan during Lavin's tenure at
Purdue in the early '90s. They have a sparkling guard tandem in
Rashad Phillips and Jermaine Jackson, an NBA prospect. And they'll
be playing as close to home as L.A. is to Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're one of the top defensive teams and they're similar to
Miami in that way,'' Lavin said, referring to UCLA's smothering
first-round opponent last year. ``It'll be an unbelievably
competitive game.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, they almost always are.

LAWYERS SAY INVESTIGATORS SOUGHT DAMAGING INFORMATION ON DIALLO
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for the family of Amadou Diallo said Sunday
that police investigators searched for damaging evidence and
questioned Diallo's roommates in an effort to taint his character
in the hours immediately after the fatal shooting of the West
African immigrant by four police officers last month.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, who accused the police of trying to ``dirty up''
Diallo's background, said they were calling on local and federal
law enforcement officials to broaden their investigations into the
death of Diallo, who died in a barrage of 41 bullets fired by the
four officers on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers, Peter J. Neufeld, said Sunday that Diallo's
Bronx apartment was thoroughly searched by investigators, and that
Diallo's roommates were taken to the local police station house in
the Soundview section and questioned for hours about his habits
without being told that the police had killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld said that police investigators emptied two wardrobes in
Diallo's bedroom, removing all of his clothes and leaving them in
piles on the floor, and then took the curtains and curtain rods off
the windows. While the four police officers who shot Diallo were
not questioned because Bronx prosecutors feared it could jeopardize
their criminal investigation into the shooting, the victim's
roommates said they were asked about Diallo's character and whether
he had any enemies, Neufeld said. The allegations were first
reported Sunday in The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutionally, you have a situation where police officers
become the only class of suspect who are not promptly questioned
about their conduct when a crime may have occurred,'' Neufeld said
Sunday. ``They are also able to abuse their authority to dirty up
the victim and cover up for their fellow officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Watters, another lawyer for the Diallo family, said Sunday,
``This is a further indication that the New York Police
Department's common or ordinary course of business when the police
are involved in possible criminal activity is that they try to find
out something bad about the victim and protect their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani referred questions about the allegations
to the police department. Inspector Michael Collins, a police
department spokesman, said he could not comment because the Diallo
case is still the subject of a grand jury investigation in the
Bronx. Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney,
Robert Johnson, said he could not say whether the grand jury would
look into the police department's handling of its inquiry into the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   One of Diallo's roommates, Abdou Rahman Diallo, said that when
he was questioned extensively at the 43d Precinct station house
immediately after the shooting, he had no idea that it was police
officers who had killed Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were asking if he had enemies,'' Abdou Rahman Diallo, who
is a cousin by marriage, said Sunday. When the six-hour interview
ended, he said, the detectives asked him whether they could do
anything for him, and he replied, ``All I want is for you to help
me find out who killed Amadou and why Amadou was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until he returned to his apartment at 1157 Wheeler
Ave. around 7 the next morning, he said, that he got a telephone
call from a reporter informing him that it was police officers who
had shot his roommate.
</P>
<P>
   A senior police official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said: ``It would not be uncommon for investigators to
talk to the roommates or search his room. They couldn't talk to the
officers, and they were still trying to find out what he was doing
on the street that night.''
</P>
<P>
   The police official said it was possible that detectives might
not have immediately told the two roommates who were questioned
that Diallo had been shot by the police, for fear they would not
cooperate, but he could not imagine why they would not tell them at
the end of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when police officers have shot people, police
officials have revealed the criminal records, if any, of the
shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo was unarmed when he was shot and had no criminal
record, officials said after he was killed. His friends and family
described him as a hard-working and pious man who neither drank nor
smoked.

<P>
   The unofficial officious office guide:
</P>
<P>
   When you're using office time to cram office paper into the
office Xerox machine today to make copies of your cute little NCAA
Tournament bracket for the office pool, be sure not to collate in a
copy of this cheat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   This secret 12-step plan isn't just a fail-safe way to look good
in front of co-workers in this usual blind-pick 'em contest, but
you might even consider going for bigger stakes _ like a side bet
with the bossman:
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 1: Identify the beast.
</P>
<P>
   This year it's as simple as taking a crayon, spelling ``Duke''
in the middle spot and working your way to the outer edge, careful
not to color out of the lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Dukies have the coach of the year, the team of the decade,
the eye of the tiger . . . now we're sounding like Dorkie V. But
consider they won the three ACC tournament games by an average of
25 points _ and that Little Dance is a tougher tango than the Big
Dance.
</P>
<P>
   So if there's a tiebreaker where you gotta pick the final score,
give Duke a 25-point ticker-tape victory.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 2: Ride the celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky took off last year and the 'Cats will go to the final
again this year, because of one simple factor.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   CBS doesn't want shots of Tubby Smith and Coach K ranting on the
sidelines. They want Ms. Judd leaping from her seat, for St. Pete's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Stanford goes to the Final Four because of . . .
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Don't mess with Chels. You'd be surprised what strings her mom
and the Secret Service can pull these days.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 3: Go with your wife's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ohio State completes the Final Four coming out of the South.
Plus, she's sweet on Scoonie Penn.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 4: Don't trust UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   They might be Terry Christman's pick to go all the way, but
escaping past round two won't happen. We're not saying this team is
too young, but Steve Lavin has already promised a field trip on
March 20 to the opening of LegoLand.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 5: The Michael Jordan rule.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's point guard is named Michael Jordan. After Penn wins its
first-round game, it'll probably play the other Michael Jordan's
alma mater, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Stay with MJ. Penn is mightier than the sky-blue swarm.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 6: Auburn is a football school. The top-seeded Tigers
get tackled maybe between Knoxville and the opening of spring
practice.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 7: When the tournament has two teams from New Mexico,
something's amiss.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 8: Lamar Odom over Jason Terry. Rhode Island goes to the
Midwest final, razing Arizona on the way.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 9: Kent is simply Kentucky without the Ucky. After
kneeling on Temple, it gets slap-happy against cross-state rival
Cincinnati and tears those shirts off their backs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 10: Don't mess with pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The UConn-Stanford rematch doesn't happen because Arkansas rears
its ugly rear in the West regional. Then Stanford's farm experience
comes in handy for a Razorback slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 11: Always go opposite of what Harold Lederman says. It
not only applies to his picks in the HBO boxing telecasts but to
life in general.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule 12: Grab a handful of nice, colorful, pointy darts. Put
the chart up on the wall. Heave the darts, all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Got any other bright ideas?

MAYOR HIRES A FUND-RAISER WITH NATIONAL EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what aides are describing as the most concrete
sign yet that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is planning to run for the
U.S. Senate next year, his main political action committee has
hired a finance director with broad experience in national
Republican fund raising and a strong background in Senate
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The finance director, Laura Van Hove, who started last week, has
limited New York experience but a strong command of federal
campaign finance regulations, former colleagues said. Since 1990,
she has worked on three Senate campaigns, on Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign and for the Republican Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Her addition to the political action committee, Solutions
America, suggests that the mayor is concentrating his efforts on
running for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. Giuliani's advisers said they were moving quickly to
capitalize on intense national interest in a possible contest
between the mayor and the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani, in public, has repeatedly said he has made no
definite decision about his plans, some of his associates have said
that a clear signal, if not a formal declaration of his candidacy,
could come within the next three weeks. Hiring a finance director
is a crucial step in preparing for any such announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's highly public consideration of running for the
New York seat has energized campaign contributors in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last several weeks, the interest that I have seen in
the race has increased dramatically,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum,
executive director of Solutions America, ``specifically with
respect to those who want to lend support to the mayor's
campaign.'' Teitelbaum, the mayor's former chief of staff, has been
laying the groundwork for Giuliani's political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was important to hire someone with the expertise in
a federal campaign,'' Teitelbaum said. ``Laura has extensive
experience in fund raising on the presidential, Senate and
congressional levels,'' he added. Ms. Van Hove was recommended to
him by Republicans in Washington, Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Van Hove's national skills could just as easily prove
useful in a presidential or vice presidential run, the mayor's
aides have said it is unlikely that Giuliani will seek the
Republican nomination for president. The mayor has also suggested
he would show particular deference to two likely Republican
presidential contenders: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues of Ms. Hove's and aides to the mayor say she has
experience in raising both ``hard'' money, contributions given
directly to candidates, and ``soft'' money, unregulated
contributions to political parties and committees.

ALLIED WASTE SEEN IN DEAL TO ACQUIRE BROWNING-FERRIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ariz.) (lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is believed to be one of the largest leveraged buyouts
since Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.'s hostile takeover of RJR
Nabisco in 1988 for $25 billion, Allied Waste Industries and two
investment firms, Blackstone Group and Apollo Advisors, are
expected to announce as early as Monday that they are acquiring
Browning-Ferris Industries, another waste-services company, for
about $7.1 billion in cash, executives close to the talks said
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of Allied Waste and Browning-Ferris met Sunday and
are believed to have approved the deal late Sunday night. Allied
and the investment firms are offering $45 a share in cash for
Browning-Ferris, a premium of $10.25, or 29.5 percent, over the
company's closing stock price on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They would also assume Browning-Ferris' long-term debt of about
$2.5 billion, bringing the total value of the deal close to $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any deal, the agreement could fall apart if all
parties do not sign the deal documents.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Allied Waste and Browning-Ferris
have been reported to be in talks or in some kind of joint
operation. Last May, Allied Waste was reportedly interested in
buying Browning-Ferris for about $7 billion. More recently, in
February, the companies announced a definitive agreement to
exchange certain service assets, including customer contracts,
equipment and facilities representing $120 million in acquired
revenues to each party.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Browning-Ferris' stock price rose $1 to close at
$34.75 in heavier than normal volume. Traders attributed that stock
rise in part to a Bear Stearns research note that speculated that
Browning-Ferris could be a takeover target of the French waste
company Sita. Stock-options trading in Browning-Ferris at the end
of last week was heavier than usual too.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Waste, for its part, plunged $5 on Friday _ or 25 percent
_ to close at $15. As a result of the stock dive, the New York
Stock Exchange asked the company to issue a statement outlining any
corporate developments that might have affected the stock price.
The company did not issue a statement then.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long considered Browning-Ferris a turnaround play.
Allied is likely to merge overlapping operations _ including
collection, truck routes and landfill properties _ to increase
revenues and profits. Operating through a network of 109 collection
companies, Allied runs 69 landfills and provides solid-waste
management and handling for 2.2 million customers in 28 states.
Browning-Ferris collects refuse in 46 states, Puerto Rico and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Browning-Ferris, which is based in Houston, is the United
States' second-largest waste-services company, after Waste
Management Inc. Allied Waste, which is based in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
is No. 3, although it has a much smaller market capitalization, of
$2.7 billion, than Browning-Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Allied, the two other partners involved in the buyout
are Blackstone, which was started in 1985, and Apollo Advisors,
which is led by the financier Leon Black. The two companies invest
in ailing companies _ either outright or with a minority stake _
with the expectation they will sell them in the future for a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a stock swap where companies exchange shares, investors
in a leveraged buyout borrow debt to pay for a company. The three
parties are expected to borrow a total of about $11 billion to
complete the deal, one executive said. But that loan will be
reduced by the end of the year after the sale of some of the
combined operations assets.

EDITORIAL: EQUITY IN THE EVERGLADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 8:
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton pledged six years ago to restore
Florida's failing Everglades to good health, he committed his
administration to the most complicated and expensive ecological
rescue effort ever undertaken in the United States. There has been
more progress than anyone expected, given the formidable political
and financial odds. But the job has barely begun, and now he and
Vice President Al Gore face a major test of their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The test comes in the form of a preliminary restoration plan for
the entire central and southern Florida ecosystem devised by the
Army Corps of Engineers. The plan is more ambitious than anything
the Corps has tried before. But almost without exception, the
biologists and environmentalists who have examined its details have
found serious flaws, the most fundamental of which is that it will
not restore the historic flows of fresh, unpolluted water that once
made the Everglades one of the world's most wondrous ecosystems.
The plan, which could cost as much as $8 billion over 20 years,
will be presented to Congress July 1. That gives the administration
almost four months to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a historical obligation here. In 1947, following
back-to-back hurricanes that put much of South Florida under water,
Congress handed the Corps of Engineers $200 million and told it to
make the area safe for agriculture and people. The vast web of
levees, canals and pumping stations that emerged from this project
kept Florida's booming east coast free from floods and safe for
development, and provided the rich soil for Florida's hugely
profitable sugar cane industry. But it also starved the Everglades,
put more than 70 bird and animal species on the endangered list and
degraded the rich fishing grounds of Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Corps' new plan is intended as an act of
restitution for its earlier folly. Its stated purpose is to
recapture the freshwater that is now wastefully flushed out to sea
during the wet season _ 1.7 billion gallons every day _ leaving the
Everglades dry when the rains stop. Lagoons would be built to store
the water, and canals and levees would be destroyed or rerouted to
let it flow southward in a more natural way.
</P>
<P>
   The major conservation groups have reacted to the plan with
varying degrees of alarm, but all concur on one key point. It is
that much of the Corps' proposed infrastructure _ the elaborate new
reservoirs, canals and levees _ is designed primarily to satisfy
the projected needs of Florida's urban population and its
agricultural interests, at nature's expense. In other words,
instead of atoning for past mistakes, the Corps risks repeating the
same mistakes. A methodical study conducted by scientists at
Everglades National Park, for example, concluded that in its
present form the plan would increase water flows into the park and
Florida Bay by a mere 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what Congress had in mind when it ordered up this
study three years ago and asked, in plain language, for a
comprehensive plan ``for the purpose of restoring, preserving and
protecting the South Florida ecosystem.'' Nature was to come first,
the cities and agriculture second. Whatever its other virtues, a
plan that subverts Congress' core mandate simply will not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has ever attempted a restoration project on this scale
before and, on the Corps' behalf, it should be said that this is a
thankless, complicated, uncertain task. The Everglades is not the
only claimant for Florida's abundant rainfall. But surely, this
time around, the Everglades deserves its due.

COMMENTARY: AT LAST, IT'S TIME TO BET ON JAPAN'S RECOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long national economic nightmare is finally ending in Japan.
After a decade of denying reality, of bad policies being followed
by worse changes, the Japanese economic pulse is starting to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   That is not, to be sure, the opinion of most Japan-watchers, in
or out of a country where every sign of an economic spring has
proved false. Over the past seven years, Japan's economy has grown
just 5.5 percent, an average of less than 1 percent a year. It has
been almost impossible for a seer to be too pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to stick their neck out and call the bottom,''
says Ron Bevaqua, a senior economist with Merrill Lynch in Tokyo,
who can list the positive things going on but nonetheless forecasts
that this revival, like others before it, will sputter. He fears
consumers will stop spending.
</P>
<P>
   That pervasive pessimism has obscured positive developments that
would provide encouragement anywhere else. At long last, the
government is doing everything it can to stimulate the economy with
fiscal and monetary policy. Steps are being taken to recapitalize
banks and alleviate the credit crunch. Japanese corporations are
restructuring in ways that will make them more efficient. The
number of new corporate bankruptcies has fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   But because Japan has been down for so long, many doubt that
announced reforms will be implemented and almost everyone is
cautious. As retail sales rose in recent months, manufacturers
hesitated to step up production. Now inventories are at a four-year
low and production is starting to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious clue that change is at hand can be seen in the
performance of small Japanese stocks. Most of them depend on the
local economy and are of little interest to foreign investors. So
in the years since the bubble burst, they have had almost nothing
going for them. The Japanese index of over-the-counter stocks fell
85 percent from its 1990 peak to last October's low. Now, however,
it is up 50 percent from the low.
</P>
<P>
   Large Japanese companies, more dependent on exports, have not
done as well. Even with Friday's leap of 5 percent, the Nikkei 225
is just 16 percent above its October low. It fell 67 percent from
top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that consumers will be reluctant to
continue spending, or that those in the government who are appalled
by the big budget deficits being posted will try to raise taxes,
repeating the mistake that so hurt the economy last year. It is not
certain that Japan's banks will succeed in putting their bad loans
behind them, or that they will be willing to lend to businesses
without the government guarantees now being used to stimulate
lending.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, notes Robert Barbera of Hoenig &AMP; Co., one of the
few economists who expect Japan to grow this year, ``they have to
prevent easy money at home from deteriorating into a collapsing
yen, because the world needs them to generate a home-grown
recovery, not an export-led expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   But consider what will happen if the pessimists are wrong. Just
as Japan's falling yen and the retreat of Japanese banks helped
cause the Asian collapse, the reversal of those trends could assure
that tentative recoveries in South Korea and Thailand continue. A
growing Japan would help to stem deflationary forces in the world,
helping manufacturers and commodity producers.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything will be better with a healthy Japan. Already,
Japan's big deficit financing is boosting long-term interest rates
there and is one reason that long-term rates are rising in this
country. The environment will not be quite as nice for consumers,
who will see more inflation and higher mortgage costs. Japan will
seem like a better place to invest money, making the United States
seem less attractive and perhaps putting pressure on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But, to say the least, all that would be worth it. Only months
after many were worrying that a global recession, or worse, was at
hand, there are signs that the sickest of the big economies is off
the critical list and on the way to recovery.

ABC IS BEHIND THIS ANNOYING CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC enters the lively sweepstakes Monday for most
incomprehensible TV show.
</P>
<P>
   The entry is ``Strange World,'' a midseason ``X-Files'' wannabe
that makes practically no sense at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's also dreary, if that's any consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange World,'' which moves to its regular time slot Tuesday,
is about a deadly virus, a Desert Storm veteran and USAMRIID.
</P>
<P>
   Confused already? OK, Desert Storm was the Gulf War back in '91.
Seems that Paul Turner (series star Tim Guinee) was exposed to
toxic chemicals during the war and now perspires all the time.
</P>
<P>
   He's kept alive by some mysterious serum that is secreted to
him, one dose at a time, by a character known only as Asian Woman
(Vivian Wu).
</P>
<P>
   And he is recruited, against his will, to join USAMRIID (U.S.
Army Medical Research Institute, and, no, I don't know what the
``ID'' means.)
</P>
<P>
   So he's supposed to be a government agent fighting abuses of
science and medicine _ Monday's pilot apparently involves cloning
children _ but he seems to have landed smack dab in a sinister
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   USAMRIID, or the FBI, or both, or neither, are responsible for
the conspiracy, the aim of which seems to be to confound and
irritate the American television viewing audience, and to force it
never again to watch sci-fi shows on the American Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I know that brighter bulbs than I will make sense of
``Strange World.'' If I had any brains, would I be a TV critic?
</P>
<P>
   The show is created by Howard Gordon, an ``X-Files'' import who
wrote Monday's program with Tim Kring. ``Strange World'' has that
damp, dim Vancouver look, and the production team has successfully
wrung all traces of levity from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy buffs are never giddy with laughter, I've noticed.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ ``RedHanded'' is a UPN thing with a Fox veneer, only tackier.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Erik Nelson of ``Busted on the Job'' fame has created
another hidden-camera show to catch people in the act of being
dishonest, venal or just plain obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   In the first installment, airing Monday, the show puts the sting
on a guy who steals everything that isn't nailed down in his hotel
room. Entrapped and confronted by ``RedHanded,'' he tries to blame
his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that there are no future Nobel laureates on
this program. The tone, the attitude and even the off-camera voice
of the commentator, comedian Adam Carolla, are reminiscent of the
``You Don't Know Jack'' computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on the bright side, it's better than ``The Secret Diary
of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a show UPN will never be allowed to live
down.
</P>
<P>
   The allotted time is seven weeks. If ``RedHanded'' catches on,
it's a candidate for fall. Stop it now, before it kills.

 NEW YORK'S NEW MEDIA COMING TO SAN FRANCISCO  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Start spreading the news: When it comes to new
media and money, New York concedes San Francisco's superiority.
</P>
<P>
   What else explains today's Alley to the Valley conference? For
the second year in a row, a lineup of companies from New York
City's ``Silicon Alley'' new-media district are coming to the
Sheraton Palace Hotel in San Francisco to look for some of those
Silicon Valley venture dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, New York can learn a lot from California investors
and can offer a lot to California investors. There's a tradition of
technology-related venture capital in California, and we want to
learn the way that they think,'' said Charles Millard, president of
the New York City Economic Development Corp., a city agency that's
co-hosting the conference with AlleyCat News, a monthly magazine
for investors in New York's new-media industry.
</P>
<P>
   Companies presenting this week include Bikini.com, cha!, The
Duck Corp., and Absolute Reality.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Alley also has produced numerous public companies well
known in the Internet world, including Theglobe.com, N2K, EarthWeb,
24/7 Media and DoubleClick,
</P>
<P>
   ``More companies have had IPOs in New York than anywhere else in
the country,'' Millard said. ``We want California venture
capitalists to be aware of the tremendous strength and diversity of
New York companies.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the New Yorkers hope that West Coast exposure could
lead to other deals, such as mergers, acquisitions and joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly to think you'd only merge two companies on the East
Coast,'' said Janet Stites, editor of AlleyCat News. ``You're
talking about the Internet, this global technology.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's technology industry was born out of the advertising
and publishing trades, Stites said. At first, big companies'
new-media divisions were ``the unwanted stepchild,'' she said, but
eventually the people doing that work left to start their own
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now technology has expanded beyond new media _ companies
presenting this week include Renal Tech, a biotech firm _ and it
has grown increasingly important to the New York economy.
Conference literature says high tech in New York has doubled in the
past two years, with 2,600 companies employing more than 55,000
workers and generating about $3billion per year.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has become a key part of the city's redevelopment
efforts, Millard said. New York is developing small Internet-ready
offices and has inked 160 leases on such spaces in the past three
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everywhere you go. You hear people on the subway talking
about Web sites,'' Stites said. ``I wonder where traditional media
companies are getting their talent because everyone wants to be
involved in the cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference runs today and tomorrow. Information is at
www.alleyvalley.com.

SUNS LABELED SLACKERS  
 BUT AINGE THINKS TEAM WILL RECOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Blunt as usual, Suns Coach Danny Ainge said Sunday
that his team has lacked discipline, toughness and smarts on too
many occasions this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a second home court loss to the Sacramento Kings,
Ainge said the Suns just aren't as good as they assume.
</P>
<P>
   It's a stinging assessment, but plenty of evidence supports all
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's what I feel,'' Ainge said Sunday as the Suns
began to pick up the pieces before traveling to Dallas for a game
Tuesday night. ``We just come out to play the game and play to the
level of the competition, whatever that might be. We think we can
turn the switch and it's going to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it's going to take for them to realize
that's not the case. It's hard enough for great teams to do it, let
alone a team that has to scratch for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he doesn't want to overemphasize what happened
against the Kings, and he believes the Suns will recover. But he
said the club's struggles now go beyond the NBA lockout and its
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that stuff,'' he said. ``I think it's a lack of
discipline. I'm trying to instill discipline, but if you have
people who won't listen to what you're trying to teach, you have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge didn't single out players, but he said he's perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need discipline at both ends of the court because we don't
have superior talent,'' he said. ``We have to be able to execute
and be willing to play at a high intensity level. It seems like we
either have to play a great opponent or be down by 15 in order to
reach that high level.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Suns have sunk to the bottom of the NBA, but
they don't have the depth of talent to coast through games and flip
on the afterburners to win at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what they have attempted to do. Their pattern through
the first 13 games was to fall behind early, make a big run to get
back into the game and hope for the best at the end. They appeared
to have broken that cycle, despite two losses to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But as forward George McCloud put it, the Suns ``took a step
backward'' against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked a lot about being physically, mentally and
emotionally tough,'' Ainge said. ``I thought we failed in all three
categories.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing consistent in this lockout-shortened season has
been inconsistency, but a few things have become apparent:
</P>
<P>
   The Suns don't have much of an inside game. The additions of Tom
Gugliotta and Luc Longley give the club some firepower, but they're
not strong on the post. In fact, point guard Jason Kidd has been
the team's most efficient player on the block.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are weak on the boards. They've been outrebounded in
six consecutive games. They rank 20th in the league in rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   When they play hard defensively, the Suns are very effective.
But they usually play soft on defense until they're in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   When Rex Chapman's is shooting well, the Suns are at their best.
But he hasn't been effective often enough. He's shooting 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, who was playing at an All-Star level at the start of
the season, hasn't played that well of late. A sore back, which
Gugliotta can be seen stretching out during timeouts, probably has
contributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a better player than he's showing,'' Ainge said of
Gugliotta. ``He needs to take responsibility and play better. I
need to take responsibility for finding ways of using him, and
putting combinations (of players) on the floor that better utilize
his skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are 9-8 and have won only four of nine games at America
West Arena. If the playoffs had begun Sunday, the Suns would have
been tied with San Antonio for seventh in the Western Conference
and only one game ahead of Sacramento, which has the head-to-head
tiebreaker against Phoenix already.
</P>
<P>
   The top eight teams in the conference will go to the playoffs,
and with the easiest stretch of their schedule gone in February,
the Suns can't take their 10-year playoff streak for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of good players who have experience, they're
smart, they can pass,'' Ainge said. ``But we always have to match
the intensity and play smarter than the opponent. We have not done
that consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what this team is capable of achieving yet, but I
know it's capable of more than we're getting. I've seen the best
side of us and the worst side. The worst side is like the worst
team in the NBA. The best side can compete with the best teams in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job and my responsibility, to have this team achieve
what it's capable of achieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team will respond, I believe.'' &QL;

 INSURANCE PLAYING INTERNET CATCH-UP  &HT;     By JAMIE BECKETT 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Kaye knew he was paying way too much for his car
insurance: $1,400 a year just for liability coverage on his Dodge
Dart.
</P>
<P>
   So when his policy was ready to expire, the 24-year-old shopped
around _ on the Web. With a few clicks of a mouse, he was able to
get full coverage, including collision and comprehensive, for just
$800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, a Web-savvy consumer who owns a San Jose business
designing microprocessors for small appliances, is still a pioneer.
Not many consumers are shopping for insurance online because not
many insurers are offering it. Unlike the banking and brokerage
industries, insurance has been slow to embrace the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Online sales of auto, homeowners and term life insurance totaled
just $155 million last year _ less than 1 percent of all premiums,
according to Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cambridge, Mass., firm expects online insurance sales to
balloon to $4.1 billion by 2003 as a growing number of insurers
overcome regulatory and technical hurdles to offer quotes,
information and sales on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, most insurance sites let you comparison shop and
complete an application online. But some still require an agent to
actually sell you the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe insurance is a huge market because of the inherent
convenience of being able to shop for your product without any
pressure and complete a transaction in a fraction of the time it
now takes,'' said Steven Aldrich, president of financial
software-maker Intuit's insurance unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View company's Web site, www.insuremarket.com, went
up in 1996 and now offers term life, auto (but not yet in
California) health and other types of insurance from several
different insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers have their own Web sites _ State Farm
(www.statefarm.com) provides quotes for auto and life insurance.
Progressive sells auto insurance at www.progressive.com. But much
of the growth in online insurance is coming from ``malls'' that
represent multiple carriers, such as InsWeb, Intuit's InsureMarket,
InsureRate (life only), QuickQuote (life), Quotesmith and others.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, independent insurance agents have offered one-stop
shopping for decades. But the online malls think that they can do
it for less.
</P>
<P>
   InsWeb _ founded in 1995 in Redwood City by Hussein Enan, a
former insurance executive, and software entrepreneur Darrell
Ticehurt _ pioneered the mall concept. Enan got the idea when he
saw how easily his son bought a CD on the Internet. Enan figured he
could do the same for insurance. His site, www.insweb.com, offers
quotes for home, auto, life and health insurance. InsWeb lets
customers do everything but pay for a policy online.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Shopping for insurance has been a pretty tedious business,''
said Ticehurt, InsWeb president. Consumers typically must telephone
several carriers, provide information or fill out forms, collect
rates and then make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   By gathering quotes and information from several carriers in one
place, www.insweb.com is designed to let consumers comparison shop
and save time, too, Ticehurt said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The company provides quotes from 32 carriers, though not all
carriers sell all types of insurance in all states. In California,
for instance, drivers can get quotes from nine or 10 carriers. Like
all of the insurance malls, InsWeb is busy adding carriers and
expanding service.
</P>
<P>
   The site does not yet allow customers to purchase online _
instead, they get a quote and are contacted by the insurer.
However, that quote is guaranteed as long as the buyer provided
accurate information.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies concentrate on just one type of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   HealthAxis (www.healthaxis.com) offers health coverage for
individuals (a $20 billion market) and small companies (a $50
billion market).
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of INSURANC () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; ``This is probably the largest untapped area of the Internet,''
said Andrew Felder, chief operating officer of the Norristown, Pa.,
company.
</P>
<P>
   Launched at the end of last year, the fledgling site has just
five carriers so far, but it is up and running in most states,
including California. Unlike most insurance sites, it lets
consumers buy online.
</P>
<P>
   HealthAxis is working to add dental, vision, disability and life
insurance, Felder said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers have been slow to migrate to the Web, Gazala said, in
part because of technical and regulatory complexities. Each state
has its own rules for insurance, and each insurer has its own set
of insurability standards. &UR;  &LR; What's more, insurance is an inherently
risk-adverse business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that's all about protecting (against) the
downside. A lot of the managers are very cautious people,'' Gazala
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he expects that to change because consumers are eager to
shop the Web. ``The online insurance market will be up for grabs,''
he said.

KUBRICK: A MOVIE MAVERICK TO THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD GUTHMANN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``maverick'' gets tossed around awfully carelessly in
the movie world. Express an opinion, show a rebellious streak and
suddenly you're a maverick, a woolly ``independent'' who can't be
corraled.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that talk is self-serving hoo-hah, but in Stanley
Kubrick, the brilliant filmmaker who died Sunday at 70, the
qualities of independence, perfectionism and pureness of vision
were uniquely crystallized.
</P>
<P>
   In 45 years as a filmmaker, spent largely in isolation in his
adopted country of England, Kubrick never drank at the trough of
safe, audience-friendly formulas. His films drew from genres as
diverse as horror (``The Shining''), film noir (``The Killing''),
sexual satire (``Lolita''), space exploration (``2001: A Space
Odyssey''), dystopia (``Clockwork Orange'') and period costume
drama (``Barry Lyndon''), and yet the world they captured was
largely constant: a place where dread is real, disorder is rampant
and our efforts to master the world's moral void are inevitably
useless.
</P>
<P>
   A Kubrick film was alive with ideas, artistic rigor and a formal
technique that some found cold: the slow, ominous zooms, the
austere sets that seemed to swallow or diminish the actors, the
meticulous composition and camera placement. His most popular work,
``Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Bomb,'' is a savagely funny black comedy from 1964 that dared to
mock U.S. defense policy, right-wing paranoia and the arrogance of
the American military at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   His films puzzled and confounded, encouraged debate and inspired
reverence among his fans. The opening of a new Kubrick film, so
infrequent because of his painstaking work habits, was occasion for
celebration. Only Terrence Malick (``The Thin Red Line''), who
shares Kubrick's reclusiveness, isolation from Hollywood and
intellectual adroitness, could claim that same allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, that loyalty grew despite the fact that Kubrick revealed
little of himself, avoided the press and shunned the American cult
of celebrity. A native New Yorker and graduate of Taft High School
in the Bronx, Kubrick became a staff photographer for Look magazine
at 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a skinny, unkempt kid who carried his cameras in a paper
bag,'' he once remembered, ``so he wouldn't be mistaken for a
tourist.'' When photography proved ``too passive,'' he turned to
filmmaking, educating himself by watching movies at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. By 29, when he made the anti-war classic
``Paths of Glory'' (1957), Kubrick was being compared to Orson
Welles.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times piece from 1958 described him as a ``slightly
elusive, seemingly diffident young man who talks little ... and
makes astonishing movies.''
</P>
<P>
   When Premiere magazine ran its annual list of Hollywood's 100
most powerful people a couple of years back, a reader wrote in to
chide the magazine for omitting Kubrick. Who else but Kubrick, the
reader demanded, had the power to make films at a safe geographical
distance from Hollywood, without interference, and with absolute
control over every detail of his films?
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick shot one scene for ``Paths of Glory'' 58 times. When
``Dr. Strangelove'' was rereleased to celebrate its 30th
anniversary, Kubrick personally restored the film, photographing
his own print, frame by frame, to create a new negative master.
</P>
<P>
   On his last film, the still-unreleased ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
Kubrick reportedly shot and reshot endlessly _ obsessing over
details, changing his mind, tying up the schedules of stars Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I say ``reportedly'' because the film was
shrouded in secrecy, as so much of Kubrick's life and work were.
Warner Bros. plans to release the film in July.
</P>
<P>
   The greatness of Kubrick's legacy can't be judged by his films
alone but by the inspiration he gives to young filmmakers. We've
all heard horror stories of studio interference and films altered
beyond recognition, but a budding director can always look to
Kubrick's example _ to his fearlessness, obstinateness and refusal
to walk in lockstep with the pack _ to fortify the creative spirit.

 SPECIAL-EFFECTS FIRM CREATING ILLUSIONS AT NAVAL BASE  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. -- It's a cinematic illusion that defies gravity
and time: Keanu Reeves and an opponent _ both suspended in midair _
engage in a climactic gun battle. While the camera swoops around
and through the action at full speed, bullets pass by in slow
motion.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is from ``The Matrix,'' a Warner Bros. sci-fi movie
opening April 2. It represents a breakthrough in special effects _
the first time a moviemaker could take the viewer anywhere in a
full-motion, live action scene.
</P>
<P>
   An Alameda company, Manex Entertainment Ltd., made the
impossible a reality with new equipment and digital wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a first step toward virtual cinema,'' said Manex general
manager Robert Bobo. ``Any camera move you can dream of, you can
do; the director can dial in from any point of view.``
</P>
<P>
   Manex is making a major name for itself in special effects. Its
creative director is a top contender for a special effects Oscar
for ``What Dreams May Come,'' the Robin Williams movie lauded for
its awesome depictions of heaven and hell.
</P>
<P>
   But special effects is just one arm of the company's business.
Manex is attempting to turn &UR;  &LR; most of the old Alameda Naval Air
Station into Hollywood's newest outpost with a trio of ventures:
special effects, soundstage rentals and its own movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this summer, Manex Filmed Entertainment will produce
two to four &UR;  &LR; feature films a year, drawing on Bay Area talent,
locales and crew.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to start with moderate-budget films for which it will
provide effects at cost. Manex executives point to Miramax and New
Line Cinemas as role models.
</P>
<P>
   Encamped in the Alameda base's vintage 1940s Navy funk, Manex
currently looks more like a shoestring startup than a Hollywood
power player. Bobo, its 28-year-old leader, seems more scoutmaster
than movie mogul.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobo says the firm, which is 90 percent owned by a private
Ohio financial management company, the Manex Group, can raise the
tens of millions of dollars it will need to launch its own studio
and produce films that cost $15 million to $40 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The company grew out of a Massachusetts visual effects firm
called Mass Illusions. It moved to Alameda a year ago, mushroomed
from 10 people to 100 and grossed $12 million in 1998, largely from
the effects business. Bobo declined to discuss profits.
</P>
<P>
   For now, creating special effects is Manex's bread and butter,
though it has plenty of competition from effects houses ranging
from George Lucas's gargantuan Industrial Light &AMP; Magic in Marin to
hundreds of Silicon Valley and Hollywood firms.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Hynek, Manex's visual effects supervisor, is an Oscar
candidate for ``What Dreams May Come.'' He spent two years working
on the film's lush depiction of heaven as an Impressionist
masterpiece. Hynek previously was nominated for effects for
``Predator'' and won a special technical achievement Academy Award
for an optical printer he designed.
</P>
<P>
   Low-key and personable, he ducks the inevitable questions about
the Oscars, just saying it was a delight to work on a movie that
married ``technology and fine arts.''
</P>
<P>
   But film mavens aren't so restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday in the future, we'll look back at `Dreams' as a
benchmark that expanded the visionary palette of directors,'' said
Tom Atkin, executive director of the Visual Effects Society in
Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County).
</P>
<P>
   Manex just expanded its staff and its Hollywood presence by
buying special-effects house Computer Film Co. of Culver City (Los
Angeles County). With 30 people and credits on this year's other
two special-effects Oscar nominees (``Mighty Joe Young'' and
``Armageddon''), CFC ``is a perfect alter-ego for us,'' said Bobo.
``It's an award-winning company with a beautiful Hollywood
screening room,'' perfect for sealing power deals.
</P>
<P>
   Manex is continuing to blaze new trails in special effects. For
``Matrix,'' it honed a technique called Flo-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   For the gun-battle scene, the effects pros first created a
digital, photo-realistic, 3-D image of the subway station based on
photographs of a real subway station.
</P>
<P>
   Then they videotaped the battle with Reeves and his co-star from
multiple camera angles and transferred it to a computer to create a
``body track'' that would control the final filming.
</P>
<P>
   Then they positioned an array of still cameras in front of a
green screen.
</P>
<P>
   The actors then recreated the battle as the still cameras fired
sequentially in a precisely timed sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The still photos were scanned into a computer, where a
programmer melded them together into a continuous action sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the action footage was integrated into the digital 3-D
background, and the computer-generated slow-motion bullets were
added.
</P>
<P>
   Manex plans to use this technique to create ``virtual back
lots'' _ digital stock footage of famous locales that can be used
to create spectacular effects without the expense of shooting on
location.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it could make a 360-degree, navigable film of the
Eiffel Tower, shoot an actor on a green screen and insert him in
the famous landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a yawn if he just walked around,'' said Manex's
John Gaeta, visual effects supervisor on ``Matrix.'' ``But we can
fill the tower with marshmallows and have them dripping down onto
him, or have him _ and the camera _ fly around and through it, or
make it the year 2050 with a red sky.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's not cooking up effects, Manex takes advantage of the
cavernous buildings sprawled over the base. It has long-term leases
on five huge airplane hangers, totaling 260,000 square feet, which
it rents out as sound stages to the likes of Warner Bros., Walt
Disney and PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   Disney plans to shoot its big-budget Christmas feature,
``Bicentennial Man,'' on two of Manex's stages and at one on
Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   Power tools whine and sawdust dances in the air as two dozen
carpenters pound plywood into sets for ``Bicentennial Man.'' Right
now, they look like nothing more than an unfinished deck and a
backyard pool enclosure, but by the time the movie starts filming
in April, they will be transformed into the futuristic world where
android Robin Williams fights for his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The two largest stages, 80,000 square feet each, lease for
$45,000 a month or $2,900 a day. The smallest, at 19,000 square
feet, goes for $22,500 a month or $1,600 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Drab tan on the outside, inside the hangars are well suited for
filming. There are no supporting beams to obstruct camera views.
Several come outfitted with cranes that can lift up to five tons.
Others have movable gantries attached to the ceiling, perfect for
camera operators and lights. A filtering system, installed to
dispel fumes from airplane paint, can be used to quickly clear
smoke or other atmospheric effects.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of the military remain: Chest-tall letters on the walls
still shout out Navy messages such as ``Committed to quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, although movies from ``True Crime'' to ``Flubber'' have
already been filmed in these hangars, the buildings aren't yet up
to most filmmakers' standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see them made into real soundstages, not just
warehouses where you can shoot,'' said Rory Enke, a location scout
for Disney. ``Right now, when the foghorns go off on the Bay, you
hear it. If the Blue Angels come, you lose a day of shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next two years, Manex plans to bring the hangars up
to building code and to rig them for moviemakers with sound
abatement, blackout control and more electrical installations _ to
the tune of $5 million, said Dale Skaggs, vice president of
operations and studios. The company will get part of that back in
rent rebates from the base.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the soundstages, Manex provides other on-site services
to filmmakers: It rents out lighting and grip equipment, has a
35,000-square-foot warehouse for storing sets and props, and
provides stage managers who are familiar with the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``It's smoother because it's managed by people who understand
all of our quirks,'' Enke said. ``Manex makes it very simple for a
motion picture company to find a home in the Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   The base offers another amenity: real-life sets. The Navy left
behind an array of buildings that evoke small-town America: a post
office, a chapel, a bowling alley, a movie theater, a tree-lined
street with '60s-style ranch houses, another with colonial-style
houses _ both unobstructed by power and telephone lines. Of course,
there also are props for a military movie, including a fleet of a
dozen ships, an aircraft carrier, an airplane control tower and
barracks. And the island boasts breathtaking views of San Francisco
and the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Manex competes with two other former Navy bases _ Treasure
Island and Mare Island _ for movie shoots, and with a handful of
privately run soundstages in San Francisco for small-scale shoots,
such as commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Filming on Treasure and Mare islands is arranged through San
Francisco and Vallejo, respectively. Both cities welcome filmmakers
and offer some of the same amenities as Manex.
</P>
<P>
   Manex is helping make the East Bay more of a nexus for movie
shoots, said Ami Zins, Oakland's film coordinator. ``They're a big
part of my pitch'' to filmmakers, she said. ``They're 10 minutes
from downtown Oakland, with total ease of parking and
transportation. They have vast spaces, incredible ceiling clearance
and they have the capability and willingness to accommodate a great
variety of sizes of production,'' from big-budget feature films to
one-day commercial shoots.

GAMBILL WINS TUNEUP TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Sunday's singles final in the Franklin
Templeton Tennis Classic had a little bit of everything.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rain delay, fierce competition, a controversial call
and a first-time ATP Tour champion.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 21-year-old Jan-Michael Gambill of Colbert, Wash.,
outlasted 18-year-old Australian Lleyton Hewitt, 7-6 (7-2), 4-6,
6-4, at at the Canadian Pacific Princess Resort.
</P>
<P>
   The match, filled with long volleys, took 2 hours and 21 minutes
to complete. That's not counting a 46-minute rain delay between the
second and third sets.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial call went against Hewitt, who was at break
point in the third set that would have given him a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill's second serve hit near the line and was called out by
the linesman. But chair umpire Steve Ullrich overruled the call.
Gambill ended up winning the game to make it 4-4. Gambill won the
next two games and the match.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for an umpire to overrule a linesman unless the
umpire absolutely believes the call was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt displayed his displeasure. He said he was sure it had
been out. Gambill said he believed it had been in.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it changed the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my momentum, and his was going down,'' Hewitt said.
``That call lifted his confidence. It got the crowd behind him
again. And he got some great serves.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the rain delay hurt Hewitt's game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so, a little bit,'' he said. ``He came out and did a
little better than I did right after the delay. I had the momentum
at the end of the second set, but he got off to a quick start after
the delay, and it helped build his momentum.``
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said he'd be helped if he got stronger and a few more
cheap points with his serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a little better serve,'' Hewitt said, ``My serve
was stronger than it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was quite a bit of difference in the serves.
Gambill had 11 aces, Hewitt two. But Gambill had four double
faults, Hewett only one.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is known as a counter-puncher who keeps the ball in play.
Gambill is more of a power player. It showed Sunday. Gambill had 46
unforced turnovers, Hewitt 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of good wins,'' Hewitt said, ``and it increased my
confidence. What I have to do is forget this loss and play well the
next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time the two players have met.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about us meeting again,'' Hewitt said. ``He
has a great game. I expected him to serve well and hit some
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he surprised to be playing Gambill?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anticipating playing (Andre) Agassi,'' he said. ``I
think everyone was.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, the second-seeded player, injured a hamstring during his
semifinal match with Gambill and was forced to retire in the first
set.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill was exhuberant follow ing his match. He not only won his
first singles title but also beat the top player in the world, Pete
Sampras, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels great,'' Gambill said. ``It feels even better
because it was such a tough match. There were a lot of long rallies
today. It was a war out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my game is really coming along. My volleys were a
lot more solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill welcomed the rain delay. He said he thought it had
helped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had time to think about it, figure things out,'' he said.
``I'd quit attacking. I stepped it up, and serve and return were
better in the third set.''
</P>
<P>
   In the doubles finals, Justin Gimelstob of Miami and Richey
Reneberg of Atlanta beat second-seeded Mark Knowles of the Bahamas
and Sandon Stolle of Australia, 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The doubles winners split $22,600; the losers $13,290. The
singles champ received $46,000; the loser $27,000. The tournament
drew 55,863 in attendance, compared with 45,166 a year ago. &QL;

 CLOSED MILITARY BASES ARE OPENING DOORS FOR FILMMAKERS  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bay Area, with its stunning views and cultural amenities,
has long been a favorite of filmmakers for on-location shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the shuttering of three former local military bases _
Treasure Island, Alameda Naval Air Station and Mare Island _ has
created opportunities for moviemakers to do far more work in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   All three facilities have colossal _ and now empty _ airplane
hangars, warehouses and other buildings that can be set up as
soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the only reason you came to San Francisco was to
shoot the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower and other landmarks; then
you'd go back to L.A.,'' said Rory Enke, a location scout for
Disney. ``Now, you can shoot the entire picture here.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Island, run by the city of San Francisco, was first to
get in on the act. It started renting space to moviemakers a couple
of years before the Navy finished moving out in October 1997. The
TV show ``Nash Bridges'' has a permanent home in Building 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage the use of the island for filming,'' said
Annemarie Conroy, executive director of the Treasure Island
Development Authority. ``It's a great PR thing for Treasure Island
and the city. It's very lucrative to attract films to the city _
the spending power of these large productions is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities tend to greet moviemakers, known for their lavish
spending, with unreserved glee. A major motion picture might employ
several hundred people _ both imports from Hollywood and local
hires _ and they all need housing, transportation and food. During
location shoots, residents sometimes gripe about hassles with
parking and noise, but those aren't problems on the nearly
deserted &UR;  &LR; former bases.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Bicentennial Man'' will start shooting in April on
the Treasure Island and Alameda sites. ``What Dreams May Come,''
``Flubber'' and ``Jack'' were shot mostly on the former bases.
</P>
<P>
   Those movies all have something in common: They star San
Francisco resident Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin Williams is a mini-industry all by himself; he prefers
to work up here for family reasons, and with his clout, he can get
what he wants,'' said independent location scout Lance Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Besides scenery and soundstages, the Bay Area has another draw
for filmmakers: Dozens of special effects, sound editing and
animation shops give the region an edge for post-production work,
and it also can draw on the technical expertise of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having stage space is very important to the development of the
film business in San Francisco and the Bay Area. It's like an arm
or a leg; it makes it possible for major feature films to stay here
in the Bay Area,'' said Carole Isaacs, acting director of the San
Francisco Film &AMP; Video Arts Commission.

STUDY FINDS PERILS IN SURGERY IN DOCTORS' OFFICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patients who undergo surgery in a doctor's office
instead of in a hospital are protected by few regulations and face
dangers like outdated anesthesia equipment, according to a report
by a New York Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Senate Committee on Investigations, Taxation
and Government Operations, called office surgery ``an entirely
unregulated area of medicine in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, it said, was that some doctors performed surgery in
their offices that was outside their specialty. Hospitals, on the
other hand, verify that a doctor is qualified to perform a given
type of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dermatologist could perform brain surgery in his garage if
he could get a patient to agree to that,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Roy Goodman, R-Manhattan, said he
would push for further regulation. ``I think very few people are
aware of this,'' he said by telephone on Sunday. ``There should be
the same precautions in the office that there are in the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest doctors' group, the Medical Society of the
State of New York, said Sunday that it was aware of the concerns
about office surgeries and had been working on a solution for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Aswad, the society's chief executive, said his
organization had been working with the state Health Department to
create an educational program on office surgeries for doctors and
patients, which is to be announced shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases in which there are adverse effects are rare,'' Aswad
said. ``While they're rare, we have zero tolerance for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the abuses cited in the report involved elective
procedures like liposuction and plastic surgery. But medical
officials said an increasing number of operations of many types
were being done in doctors' offices because of rising hospital-care
costs and growing restrictions by insurers.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates cited in the report, elective surgeries
in doctors' offices are expected to rise to 20 percent by 2001,
from 6 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said some procedures, including laser eye surgery and
examinations to diagnose colon cancer, can very properly be
performed in a doctor's office. But he said that in many other
cases, his investigators found health hazards, lax procedures and
doctors practicing outside their specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Aswad said adding new regulations was not the answer, because
state agencies have complained that they did not have the resources
to enforce rules already on the books. He said doctors were in a
bind because managed-care companies were urging them to do more
procedures outside hospitals, to keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   The report gave another reason for doctors' willingness to do
surgery in their offices these days. ``A large proportion of office
surgery is now done for cosmetic purposes,'' the study said.
``Cosmetic surgery creates a considerable cash business, and it is
attractive to many doctors who feel restricted by the financial
limits of, and the delays in, health-insurance reimbursements.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the committee said it found one doctor in
Manhattan who was trained in ophthalmology but now specialized in
breast enlargements. ``The conditions in his office and the result
of his work were shocking,'' the report said. The doctor was not
named.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said that during nine months of research, staff
members found that anesthesia equipment used in office surgeries
was often outdated or poorly maintained. ``Some physicians purchase
old anesthesia machines for their offices which have been discarded
by hospitals because they are not up to date,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   When doing office surgery, a doctor is more likely to administer
anesthesia without the help of a specialist, the committee said.
This poses a special risk for patients who are obese or are elderly
with underlying medical problems, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee advised patients considering, for example, plastic
surgery at a doctor's office to check whether the doctor was
board-certified in that specialty. The report said every office
surgical unit should have an emergency cart that included oxygen, a
defibrillator and other equipment to resuscitate a patient in case
the surgery goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving nothing to chance, the report added, ``In addition, the
staff should know how to use these devices and medications.''

FASTBALL WHACKS WOMACK; X-RAY SHOWS MARK ON BONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Just when Tony Womack was starting to feel comfortable
with the Diamondbacks . . .
</P>
<P>
   A fastball from Chicago White Sox left-hander Jim Parque ruined
his Sunday _ and perhaps several days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed-hitting Womack, who was acquired in a trade from
Pittsburgh on Feb. 26 for the primary purpose of being Arizona's
leadoff man, was hit on the outside edge of his right wrist (ulna
bone) in the second inning of Arizona's 11-5 victory at Tucson
Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in the game and went on to score the team's fourth
run, and he played defense in left field in the bottom of the
second inning. Then he departed and went next door to Kino
Community Hospital for X-rays, which revealed a mark of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain whether the mark was a fracture, so Womack will
travel to Phoenix today to be examined more thoroughly by Dr. Don
Sheridan, a hand specialist, and Dr. David Zeman, the team
physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something there. We're hoping for the best. We'll
see,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Womack said, ``It was a fastball that ran in on the hands and
actually did (hit the hand).''
</P>
<P>
   Parque also hit second baseman Jay Bell with a pitch in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Womack was initially upset because he never has had a serious
injury before, but he was feeling more upbeat later in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get dressed with both hands, and I was flexing
it a little,'' he said, tugging on the tape that secured a padded
wrap.
</P>
<P>
   There was little or no swelling, Womack said, ``because they
(team trainers Paul Lessard and Dave Edwards) got ice on it real
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessard said it was difficult to tell how long Womack will be
sidelined, break or no break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he doesn't appear to have any pain is a good
sign. We are hopeful,'' Lessard said.
</P>
<P>
   Womack said he hopes he won't be out more than three or four
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like this is going to happen, it's better that it
happens now,'' he said. ``We don't punch the clock until April 5
(the season opener in Los Angeles).''
</P>
<P>
   While Womack is sidelined, the Diamondbacks likely will move
veteran Luis Gonzalez from right field back to left field.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days following Womack's arrival, Showalter's plan
was to have Womack in right and Gonzalez in left, but he felt
Womack was a better fit in left with Gonzalez in right. Gonzalez
also is likely to assume the leadoff role, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility in left is David Dellucci, who started 80
games there for the Diamondbacks in their inaugural season.
Dellucci is off to a hot start this spring with four hits in nine
at-bats (.444). Three have been for extra bases, including a home
run Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Womack wasn't the only Arizona outfielder to suffer an injury.
Bernard Gilkey left the game because of tightness in his left calf
muscle. His playing status is uncertain, and he will be evaluated
daily. &QL;

 SHAMAN PHARMACEUTICALS' CEO PITCHING ITS REINCARNATION  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shaman Pharmaceuticals Inc. will hold what promises to be a
lively conference call with shareholders this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Shaman is the former media darling whose high-profile chief
executive, Lisa Conte, once wowed investors with her groovy plans
to scour the rain forests for potential cures.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Conte all but shut down Shaman after the
Food and Drug Administration balked at licensing its most promising
drug candidate. The company's stock is now trading at 28 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Conte, who has led this company throughout its 10-year
history, is trying to sell Shaman's skeptical shareholders on her
latest plan. It calls for transferring much of the company's
intellectual property _ all carefully collected leaves, twigs and
barks _ to a private spin-off called Shaman Botanicals.
</P>
<P>
   Conte has said the Botanicals spin-off would end-run the FDA by
turning these rain forest products into over-the-counter herbal
potions _ that can be sold without government permission.
</P>
<P>
   But the small _ and some not-so-small investors _ who got stuck
with Shaman's 32 million near-worthless shares, have been burning
up the online chat rooms, trying to figure out what they get out of
this transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The details are spelled out in the proxy statement Shaman filed
February 24.
</P>
<P>
   Conte apparently is seeking to transfer the plant library from
publicly held Shaman Pharmaceuticals to the private Shaman
Botanicals in exchange for 720,000 shares of Shaman Botanicals
stock valued at $1 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Those shares would not be distributed to current shareholders,
but would be held as an asset of the pharmaceuticals firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to transfer a plant library that took them 10 years
and $100 million to collect for shares valued at $720,000,'' said
Joel Hungerford of Kennebunk, Maine, who owns 56,000 shares of
Shaman that he bought at an average price of $1.84.
</P>
<P>
   I read the proxy myself and got much the same understanding. I
called Shaman to make sure I wasn't misreading, but my calls went
unreturned.
</P>
<P>
   Shaman officials are scheduled to answer questions today in a
conference call open to all shareholders _ (800) 260-0719. A replay
of the call will be available for seven days by dialing (800)
475-6701.
</P>
<P>
   This unusual call-in is a prelude to a March 24 shareholder
meeting at the Embassy Suites hotel in South San Francisco, where
Conte needs a majority of those 32 million shares to vote approval
of her plans.
</P>
<P>
   I'll keep following the Shaman saga, but meanwhile, the lesson
is clear: Investing in biotech shares is like sailing the Titanic
through an ice field at high speed. A bad scientific trial or a
negative review by an FDA panel can sink a company pronto _ and the
risks are below the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran biotech watcher Karen Bernstein has standard advice for
individual investors _ before you buy, ask yourself: Is this money
I could afford to lose?
</P>
<P>
   CAT'S PAW: In November, I wrote about Neurobiological
Technologies Inc., a Richmond firm that was trying to scrounge up
the cash to finish clinical trials on a drug that could help people
with Alzheimer's disease and a related condition called AIDS
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   NTI chief executive Paul Freiman called last week with the good
news that NTI's drug candidate, Memantine, did well in Phase III
clinical trial in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The trial involved 166 Alzheimer's patients, some of whom
received Memantine, others of whom got a placebo. The results,
published in the Wednesday edition of the International Journal of
Geriatric Psychiatry, showed that the Memantine patients showed
considerable improvement in ordinary tasks like dressing themselves
or recognizing visitors.
</P>
<P>
   A similar Phase III trial already is under way in the United
States. If it also turns out positive results, then later this year
or early next year, Freiman hopes to ask European and U.S. drug
regulators to approve Memantine to relive Alzheimer's symptoms.
(The AIDS dementia trials are at an early stage of testing.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with two weeks cash on hand, Freiman said he's
confident that he'll close another $750,000 private placement to
keep the publicly held company afloat for a few more months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scratching and clawing,'' he said. ``This is the 10th
life of the cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmnn. Is there a theme here?

W. HARRINGTON, 63, ATLANTA CHURCH LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. W. Frank Harrington, senior minister of the largest
Presbyterian (U.S.A.) church in North America, died on Wednesday of
cardiorespiratory failure at Emory Hospital in Atlanta. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's church, Peachtree Presbyterian of Atlanta, grew
significantly during his tenure. It had fewer than 3,000 members
when he arrived in 1971 and more than 11,000 at the time of his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Foster, the church's publications director, said
Harrington liked to describe Peachtree Presbyterian as ``a big
church that feels more like a small town'' and worked hard to
maintain that atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cared about people and expressed that caring in very many
ways,'' said the Rev. Stephen Bacon, Peachtree Presbyterian's
minister of administration and stewardship. ``He always knew people
by name, he understood their circumstances and went out of his way
to be with them at any time of need.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said a $20 million expansion of the church, expected
to be completed by fall, will be part of Harrington's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was raised near Kingstree, S.C., and graduated from
Presbyterian College of Clinton in 1957. He received a Masters of
Divinity degree from Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga.,
in 1960, and a Masters of Theology in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordained by the Savannah Presbytery in July 1961, and
began his ministry as the pastor of First Presbyterian Church of
Hinesville, Ga. He also served at Fairview Presbyterian Church in
North Augusta, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is survived by his wife, Sara; their two daughters,
Victoria Franch, of Atlanta, and Susan Potter, of Shelburne Falls,
Mass.; and three grandchildren, Carolina Franch, Michael Franch and
James Franch, all of Atlanta.

ABUSE ACCUSATIONS OVERBLOWN, GUARDS FEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ ``Look,'' said Bruce Kusky, a burly
51-year-old, who has put in 20 years as a correction officer at the
Nassau County jail, ``We don't come to work looking for somebody to
beat up. We want it nice and easy, nice and safe. I want to pick up
my paycheck and go home and kiss my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been hard recently to be the one in uniform at the jail,
said Kusky. He and two other officers were speaking as they sat at
a corner table on Thursday at Runyon's Roadside Tavern, a bar
wrapped in neon across the street from the jail.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,200-bed Nassau County Correctional Center has become the
focus of a federal investigation of reports that officers
systematically beat inmates. The inquiry began after the Jan. 13
death of Thomas Pizzuto, 38, an inmate whose family contends that
he was beaten and then left unattended for days. The Medical
Examiner has ruled Pizzuto's death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   And last Monday, a federal jury found Salvatore Gemelli, a
15-year jail officer, liable for the 1993 beating of a mentally
retarded man with a frying pan. Later in the day, Gemelli was fired
by Sheriff Joseph P. Jablonsky.
</P>
<P>
   Until that verdict, the men at Runyon's Tavern said, they were
instructed by union officials to say nothing, for fear of
prejudicing Gemelli's trial. Now that he has been dismissed, they
said, they have plenty to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the media attention, he was never going to receive a
fair trial,'' said Corporal Mike Selover, 42, a vice president of
the unit of the Civil Service Employees Union that represents 1,000
Nassau County correction officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public negativity you can take,'' he said. ``But the
outright dismissal? Jablonsky is a tool, a political tool, and he's
got no idea what it means to be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jablonsky worked as a correction officer for six years before
serving as the deputy director of the county's work-release program
from 1979 to 1985. He became an under sheriff and was appointed
sheriff in 1986. The sheriff is a Republican leader in Hicksville
and three of his top four administrators at the jail are Republican
committeemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are politicians, not officers,'' Selover said. Then,
recounting the official version of the beating, he said: ``You
telling me a guy went to a pantry, walked across a room full of
inmates and beat a guy with a frying pan, and nobody saw it? It
never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The third officer, Chris McShane, 37, who has a business degree
from C.W. Post, said officers have had a much harder time of it at
the jail since Pizzuto's death. Television and newspaper reports
have kept the inmates well informed about the allegations, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stand there and tell you junk about your mother, grab
their genitals and tell you, `Go ahead and beat me, I can use the
money,''' McShane said. ``It's made it real tough to work in there,
but you battle it out with your mind, not your fists.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be some bad apples among the officers, the three
conceded, but incidents of abuse are rare. The district attorney's
office said that of more than 14,000 people who were in the jail
last year, 15 filed complaints against officers. Six of those
complaints were dismissed after investigations, and the other nine
cases are still open, according to the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that sound systematic to you?'' Selover said.
</P>
<P>
   The jail holds convicts who have been sentenced to terms of a
year or less and defendants awaiting trial. Colin Ferguson, who was
convicted of murdering six Long Island Rail road passengers, and
Joel Rifkin, who was sentenced to life after admitting killing 17
prostitutes, were held there during their trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the nicest people,'' Kusky said. ``This is not a
job many people want to do.''

OH, BROTHER, BURTONS RUN 1-2 AT LAS VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Only three races into the season and NASCAR already
has its first monumental upset.
</P>
<P>
   Someone other than Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin motored into
victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton survived a bravely fought battle against the only
NASCAR Winston Cup driver he dearly loves, his older brother, Ward,
and won a Las Vegas 400 on Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that
included four of the most spine-tingling laps in series history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awfully stressful,'' said Jeff, the 31-year-old,
out-of-breath victor. ``I'm a big fan of Ward Burton's. I want Ward
to do well and to sit there and try to have to beat him is really
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were door to door and all but rubbed a couple times. The
first couple of laps we were side by side, I didn't drive hard
enough and I said to myself, `You've got to drive harder.' And I
started to drive it a little bit harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always want it to come down to the end like that, (but) the
next time he'll get me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burtons, one of six sets of brothers to reach the 43-car
starting grid, were nearly flawless throughout the 267-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff led six times in the Exide Batteries Ford Taurus for 111
laps and Ward, 37, who finished runner-up by 1.074 seconds, led
seven times in the Caterpillar Pontiac Grand Prix for 71 laps.
</P>
<P>
   No one else led more than 25 laps, and Gordon and Martin
combined to lead only 18.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon (13) and Martin (seven), who combined for 20 wins in 33
Winston Cup races last season, had dominated the season's first two
races, splitting wins at Daytona (Gordon) and Rockingham (Martin).
</P>
<P>
   But here in Sin City, there were few heavenly moments for the
sport's dynamic duo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin appeared that he might have the late-race
ammunition to spoil the Burtons' day, he settled for 10th after
dropping a cylinder late in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished third ahead of Mike Skinner and pole-sitter
Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Until about the final 100 laps, the race, watched by a crowd of
125,000, lacked much drama or suspense.
</P>
<P>
   To put it bluntly, it was dull.
</P>
<P>
   But the stirring duel involving the Burtons, plus some other
dicey moments involving other drivers, helped rocket the
thrill-o-meter.
</P>
<P>
   The Burton battle began with Jeff entering pit road with the
lead following the fifth and final caution flag on Lap 232. He
re-emerged onto the 1.5-mile oval in third behind his brother and
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   On Lap 244, Jeff managed to ease by Gordon. Then on Lap 254,
Jeff was door to door with Ward.
</P>
<P>
   And for four nail-biting laps, they waged a battle for the lead,
the fans craning their necks for a better view of the unfolding
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Lap 257, Ward squeezed by Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   A lap later, it was Jeff back in front. This time, he was in
front to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to crowd (Jeff) as much as I could without
wrecking him,'' Ward said. ``I don't want to wreck my brother. I
wasn't giving him an inch. I even thought about moving him up a
little higher to be honest with you. I knew if I did, one of us
wasn't going to make it out of the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want your brother to beat you. But at the same time,
I love my brother and I want the best for my brother. I do know
Jeff can't do anything in a race car that I can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, he was just a little bit better when he needed to be
better to beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, Gordon thought he might be better than one of
the Burtons, but not two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of took off there at the end and I started to run down
Ward, and I said, `All right, we've got a shot a this,' '' said
Gordon, whose only lead was on Lap 242. ``(Dale) Jarrett was
holding up Jeff Burton and I was hoping he'd keep holding him up
because I knew we were all in trouble if he got free of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure enough, that's the way it turned out. I tried to make a
run at Ward (again), but I got too loose. I knew nobody could touch
Jeff.'' &QL;

YOUTH CLIMBS TO TOP  
 COMBINED AGE OF FINALISTS IS 39

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - The title contenders Sunday were the
youngest on the ATP Tour this season.
</P>
<P>
   The winner,  &UR; Jan-Michael Gambill, is only 21. His opponent,
 &UR; Lleyton
 &UR; Hewitt, turned 18 less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill became the fourth first-time winner on the Association
of Tennis Professionals Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill earned $46,000 for the win. Hewitt won $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt became the fourth Australian to make the Franklin
Templeton Classic finals in as many years. Only one, Jerome
Golmard, has won.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt had to go through qualifying rounds to make the
tournament. Had he won, he would have been only the fourth
qualifier to win an ATP tournament in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His current ranking is No. 91 in the world, but making the
finals here will put him in the top 65.
</P>
<P>
   That means he won't have to qualify at Indians Wells, Calif., in
this week's ATP tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, ranked 45th, will rise to about 30th.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the highest ranking either has held.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt also is the fifth-lowest ranked player to make the finals
on the ATP Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill led the tournament in aces with 42. &QL; 
Unorthodox serve &QL; 
 &UR; Andre Agassi may be Gambill's hero, but he didn't pattern his game
after Agassi's.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill calls his two-handed forehand unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would watch tapes of his (Agassi's) games over and over,''
Gambill said. ``I loved to see his intensity and focus. But I
didn't pattern myself after him because my stroke is a little
unorthodox.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to do with Gambill's tennis background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started (playing tennis) early. I was a tall, skinny kid and
didn't have any strength. I just started using the two-handed
forehand to get more power. I've just stayed with it.'' &QL; 
Agassi on road &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who was forced to retire in the first game of Saturday's
semifinals because of what his physician called a mild hamstring
strain, had a treatment Sunday morning and headed for Indian Wells.
He hopes to heal sufficiently to play a first-round match Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; Doug Spreen, the ATP trainer who gave the treatment, said
it is questionable whether Agassi can compete.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells' $2.4 million purse is among the ATP's largest,
other than Grand Slam events. &QL;

 `NET-ESCAPEES' SPAWNING STARTUPS IN SILICON VALLEY  &HT;     By JON SWARTZ 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netscape Communications may disappear as an independent company
when America Online finishes its $4.2 billion acquisition this
month. But it has begat a new wave of companies dotting Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At least half a dozen startups are either headed or heavily
staffed by ``Net-escapees,'' former executives of the Internet
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entrepreneurs at heart. We all want to create something
new _ maybe the next Netscape,'' said Todd Rulon-Miller, lead
partner at Apogee Venture Group, a new venture capital company in
Burlingame. When he was senior vice president of sales at Netscape,
Rulon-Miller hired 800 people in less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our years there trained us how to spot hot technologies and
build a company fast,'' said Rulon-Miller, who left Netscape in
August 1997. He now works at Apogee with two other Net-escapees,
Bill Foss and Jim Sha. ``There are a lot of opportunities out
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atri Chatterjee, who used to run marketing for Netscape's
profitable server business, last fall joined Responsys.com, a Santa
Clara company &LR;   &LR; that provides specialized software services to
e-commerce companies. About eight Net-escapees work for the Santa
Clara startup.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has created ``an incredible alumni society,'' said
Daniel Shader, a former vice president of developer relations at
Netscape who is now CEO of Accept.com, a mysterious e-commerce firm
in Redwood Shores. ``It's like Go, which spawned a number of
startups. Who knows? We may end up working with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The most intriguing post-Netscape venture may be TellMe.com, a
top-secret endeavor run by Mike McCue, Netscape's former vice
president of technology, and whiz kid Angus Davis. Jim Clark,
co-founder of Netscape, Silicon Graphics and Healtheon, is rumored
to be involved with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Other new companies headed by former Netscapers include
PassPoints, an e-commerce company in San Francisco, and
AllBusiness.com., another Internet company in the city.
</P>
<P>
   If you think all of these departures will result in brain drain
at Netscape, think again. Marc Andreessen, company co-founder and
resident visionary, will remain as chief technology officer at AOL.
</P>
<P>
   YOU SAY PORTAL. I SAY VORTAL: As if the Internet really needed
another buzzword ... here comes vortal _ an amalgamation of
``vertical'' and ``portal.''
</P>
<P>
   A portal is a welcome mat to the Internet. These sites try to
pack in so many lures _ news, search engines, free e-mail, online
shopping, instant messaging, chat rooms, etc. _ that many people
won't want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the Internet can only support four or five major
portals, and America Online, Yahoo, Microsoft and Excite already
have been declared winners.
</P>
<P>
   That left a bunch of portal-wannabes looking for a buzzword of
their own. They leafed through the hype dictionary and came up with
vortal.
</P>
<P>
   A vortal is a Web site that combines specific, ``vertical''
content such as sports, technology or health care, with some portal
features such as e-mail and shopping
</P>
<P>
   Cnet (www.cnet.com), the online technology news services that
claims to have coined the term ``portal,'' now calls itself a
vortal or _ get ready for this _ a portical.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the San Francisco company announced a new home page
with specialized portal features. For example, its search engine
covers 10 specific categories, such as hardware, software, games
and gadgets. And it sponsors chats on topics such as Y2K, MP3,
pagers and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com also claims to be a vortal. ``Consumers are going
directly to the source and not through a main gateway,'' said Jeff
Taylor, CEO of Monster.com, the world's largest online recruitment
service. ``We're entering the age of specialization.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a new name for an old (in Internet years) concept,
scoff industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventing a new name (for portals) is carrying it a bit too
far,'' said David Thomas, CEO of BroadQuest Inc. a San Jose company
that could call itself a vortal but won't. ``Let's not abuse the
portal name.''
</P>
<P>
   ALL FOR ONE, AND ONE FOR ALL?: Much has been made of Open
Service Gateway, the 13-company global consortium created last week
to design software &UR;  &LR; linking a variety of appliances _ personal
computers, telephones, TVs, VCRs and even toasters _ to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The powerhouse combine includes IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems
and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   But before we pronounce OSG the Internet's next great
advancement, remember what happened to Open Software Foundation,
Taligent, Kaleida Labs and Advanced Computing Environment.
</P>
<P>
   They were all hyped alliances that didn't amount to a hill of
beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For-profit business alliances don't mix well when their
members are competing companies,'' said Internet co-founder Vint
Cerf. ``Trying to get fierce rivals to share intellectual property
is pretty tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassroots organizations tend to get more accomplished, Cerf
said. He said the Linux movement is a good example. It's a loosely
organized group of computer users working toward a common goal: a
free alternative to Microsoft's operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The OSG alliance does not include Microsoft _ the dominant force
in consumer computing. What that leaves is a group with plenty of
swagger but not much bite.
</P>
<P>

   STAMFORD, Conn. _ An openly gay man may sit on the governing
board of his Presbyterian church here despite his refusal to
divulge whether he engages in sexual activities that would bar him
from serving, ecclesiastical judges have ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-1 decision, handed down on Saturday by the Permanent
Judiciary Commission of the Presbytery of Southern New England and
announced Sunday, is the first test of a 1997 amendment to the
constitution of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) that requires
deacons, elders and ministers ``to live in fidelity within the
marriage of a man and woman or in chastity in singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has been monitored around the United States in churches
struggling with the issue of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment, known as Amendment B, also
requires candidates for church leadership to state that they have
repented of any self-acknowledged sin. The church considers
homosexual activity _ though not homosexuality itself _ sinful.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the Stamford case is Wayne Osborne, a
38-year-old financial adviser and a graduate of the Princeton
Theological Seminary who was elected to serve on the session, or
governing body, of the 700-member First Presbyterian Church of
Stamford in May. He has been a member of the church for more than
five years.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his first elevation to the session. He had already
served for three years starting in 1994. But this time, the
circumstances were different, and the session itself was pitted
against congregants who claimed that it was violating the church
constitution by installing Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished his first term as a member of the session, he
divulged to the congregation that he was in a long-term
relationship with another man, Greg Price, a fellow congregant who
worked with developmentally disabled adults.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Osborne was nominated for a second term on the
30-member session because he was deemed by the nominating committee
to have been called on by God to serve. Like the other 10
candidates, he was examined by the session, whose members asked a
prescribed set of questions. Among them: ``Are you a
self-acknowledged sinner unrepentant of that sin?''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne denied having committed any sins requiring repentance,
but was then asked whether his relationship with Price involved
sexual activity. He declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Standing quietly in the church on Sunday after the service at
which the verdict was announced, Osborne explained his refusal to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not an appropriate question,'' he said. ``Even my best
friends don't ask me, and for me to have answered would be to go
against who I am as a person and who God made me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two church members _ Mairi Hair and James MacCallum _ filed
charges against the session, alleging irregularities in its
examination and approval of Osborne as a session member. In the
Presbyterian Church, ordination to elder is a lifetime appointment,
although not all elders serve on sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The ecclesiastical trial was held on Feb. 26 at the Quinnipiac
School of Law in Hamden.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the constitution, the elders examining the person
are required to ask certain necessary questions, including ones
about sin, but the constitution does not require that they get a
clear answer,'' Dan Sassi, a church deacon, explained in a
telephone interview. ``It says that sessions are to respect the
right of the individual to decline to answer and not discuss the
issue. The other side in this case believes that living with a
person is enough proof of sex outside marriage; we say that it is
not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reached by telephone after the news conference, William Prey, a
representative of the church members who challenged Osborne's
appointment, said: ``We are understandably disappointed with the
decision. Be assured that we remain committed to praying for and
working for Amendment B. We are leaning to filing an appeal but
have made no decision yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, emphasizing that the complainants were not motivated by
prejudice against homosexuals, he said: ``There are provisions in
the constitution that apply equally to heterosexuals and
homosexuals that spell out sinful behavior inappropriate for
elected leaders. What one church does locally is really on behalf
of the whole denomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the service on Sunday, Mary Morrison, executive director
of the Darien Chamber of Commerce, remarked: ``I am so pleased. I
know Wayne well and he is a man of exceptional standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amendment B is labeled a gay amendment but that is a
misnomer,'' she went on. ``It could impact all of us who are
single, including me. I am a divorced mother of two grown children.
And Wayne was being truthful to himself and to God.''

UA WOMEN HEADING TO JERSEY

   TUCSON _ There was a moment of hesitation, sprinkled with fear
and trepidation, before the ensuing celebration began for Arizona's
third consecutive NCAA Tournament selection.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Wildcats had finished the regular season on an
impressive 8-2 stretch, there was still a lingering doubt Sunday,
right up until Arizona saw its name flashed across the television
screen during the selection show on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw Arizona up on the screen, but it took us three or four
seconds to realize we were Arizona,'' guard Felecity Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (17-10) earned a No. 6 seed and will play No. 11 Florida
(19-13) on Friday at 4 p.m. in Piscataway, N.J., on the Rutgers
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players and Coach Joan Bonvicini were confident that
the Wildcats' strong second half of the season had assured them of
being the fourth team from the Pac-10 to make the tournament, but
the memories of Arizona's snub three years ago kept everyone on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more than satisfied,'' said guard Lisa Griffith, the
only active player from the 1995-96 team that went 22-8 but had to
settle for a National Invitation Tournament invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Bonvicini said Arizona's win over Stanford last weekend and the
Wildcats' come-from-behind win at Southern California on Thursday
combined with a non-conference schedule that included seven
tournament teams put them over the edge. Still, she expects her
team to improve by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played our best this past weekend (in the win
over USC and a season-ending loss to UCLA),'' Bonvicini said. ``We
really had a great second half of the conference season. We're just
going to go one game at a time, and I know that's a cliche.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have a potential second round match-up with No. 3
Rutgers (26-5) or No. 14 Dartmouth (19-8), but first the Wildcats
will have to tangle with an athletic Florida team that includes
talented freshman guard Brandi McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's going to be tough,'' Griffith said. ``In the
tournament when you're not hosting, it's hard. But we're not
expected to do a lot, so that should work to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Willis and Bonvicini have a lot of family in the New Jersey
and New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been praying for some opportunity to go back East and
play,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has played Florida once, losing, 94-76, to open the
1994-95 season in a tournament in Hawaii. &QL;

JOHNSON UNFAZED BY WIND  
 ALLOWS HIT, 2 WALKS IN HIS 2-INNING STINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ At first glance, the weather conditions for Sunday's
game between the Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox did not seem to
be conducive to pitching productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The wind gusted from behind the plate at Tucson Electric Park
toward center field at 20 mph. Thick clouds moved in to create a
contrast to what has been a sun-baked spring.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't faze Arizona left-hander  &UR; Randy Johnson as he made his
first official Cactus League start.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who struck out four of the six batters he faced against
the University of Arizona on Wednesday, pitched two innings Sunday
(27 pitches), giving up an infield hit while striking out one and
walking two. Arizona coasted to an 11-5 victory, its fourth in a
row after dropping the opener on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't have the location he desired with his fastball,
but he was pleased with his breaking pitches. His strikeout of the
first man he faced, White Sox outfielder  &UR; McKay Christensen, came
on a slider. Johnson threw only a few off-speed pitches against UA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a noticeable improvement,'' Johnson said. ``I have a
ways to go as far as my mechanics are concerned, but I'm getting
there. I also got to throw from the stretch, which was good
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also benefited from two double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good because it cuts down the number of pitches you
throw early, so you'll have more (energy) left later in the game,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His next start is scheduled at TEP on Thursday against the
Chicago Cubs. His pitch count likely will be around 55. &QL; 
Stinnett's first start &QL; 
After being limited to one pinch-hitting role in the first four
games because of tightness in the back of his throwing shoulder,
catcher &UR; Kelly Stinnett got his first start and responded with two
doubles and a home run. He also scored three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to be out there,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
new faces on the team and you want to see what you can do. It was
good to be able to catch Randy. And it was good to swing the bat.
The one (homer to left in the fourth inning) was helped by the
wind, but I got a couple of decent hacks on the others.'' &QL; 
Short stops &QL; 
Infielder-outfielder  &UR; Andy Fox was sent home Sunday morning with
flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre is the scheduled starter today as
Arizona plays for the first time this spring in Phoenix against the
Milwaukee Brewers at Maryvale Baseball Park. Right-hander  &UR; Steve
Woodard will be on the mound for the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The club sent three players to its minor league camp Sunday.
Catchers  &UR; Rod Barajas and  &UR; Ramsey Koeyers, both non-roster players,
were reassigned, and right-hander  &UR; Jason Boyd, a member of the
40-man roster, was optioned. With 52 players in the big league
camp, three more are scheduled to be reassigned today.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately one-fourth of the grass at Tucson Electric Park
and the 15 practice fields for the Diamondbacks and White Sox has
been replaced at a cost of $200,000 to Pima County, about $25,000
more than the original estimate, according to the ``Arizona Daily
Star.'' &QL;

HARRIET WADDY, 94, WAC OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Mo., Ore.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harriet M. Waddy, one of the two highest-ranking black officers
in the Women's Army Corps in World War II and its wartime adviser
on racial issues, died on Feb. 21 in Las Vegas. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1943, First Officer Harriet West _ as Harriet Waddy was
then known _ made a radio broadcast on behalf of the Army, urging
black women to get into uniform.
</P>
<P>
   She said that joining the segregated military ``and accepting a
situation which does not represent an ideal of democracy'' was not
``a retreat from our fight'' but ``our contribution to its
realization.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6,500 black women who joined the Women's Army Auxiliary
Corps, created in 1942, and the organization that succeeded it a
year later, the Women's Army Corps, joined an institution in which
segregation was the official policy. Many were used as uniformed
domestic servants, assigned to cleaning officers' clubs. Harriet
West tried to ease their distress after she was promoted to major
and named an aide to the WAC director, Col. Oveta Culp Hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Major West and Maj. Charity Adams, who commanded the only unit
of black Wacs sent overseas in World War II, were the only two
black women to attain the rank of major in the wartime WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harriet was charming,'' Charity Adams Earley recalled last
week from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ``She looked good, and she was
well-disciplined, as we were all trained to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Major West's composure must have been sorely tested when she was
dispatched to the South to hear the grievances of black Wacs.
</P>
<P>
   Lula Jones Garrett, a reporter for The Philadelphia
Afro-American, who accompanied Major West on a trip from Atlanta to
Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., in 1944, wrote how Major West
``had been insulted by a white conductor whom she had asked to hand
her baggage from the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Major West fought racially insulting Army decrees. On a visit to
Wacs at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, she recommended that ``all reference
to white and colored personnel be completely eliminated'' from the
official memorandums on information boards. She said she saw that
move as bringing ``less embarrassment to the colored personnel and
a general feeling that a forward step has been made toward
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Service in the wartime military, in her view, would help blacks
gain acceptance in postwar America. She said that military service
would give black women a chance to ``show their ability'' and be
``of future benefit to the whole race.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriet M. Hardin was born in Jefferson City, Mo., on June 20,
1904, and brought up by a grandmother after her mother died. A
graduate of Kansas State University, she worked during the
Depression as an aide to Mary McLeod Bethune, the director of the
National Youth Administration's Division of Negro Affairs and later
a civilian adviser to the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   She entered the WAC officer candidate school at Fort Des Moines
in 1942. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1948 and retired
from the armed forces in 1952. Then she worked for the Federal
Aviation Administration and counseled troubled girls at a Job Corps
center in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime resident of Eugene, Ore., Mrs. Waddy moved to Las
Vegas in 1998 to live with a friend, Barbara Connolly, when her
health declined. She was married four times but left no immediate
survivors. In the war years, she was married to Dr. Charles West, a
physician. She and her fourth husband, Maj. Edward Waddy, were
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Marie Marshall of Eugene, recalled how Mrs.
Waddy was still bowling and driving a car into her 90s. Mrs.
Marshall viewed her as a strong and independent woman who said,
``The Frank Sinatra song `My Way' was just perfect.''

WINNER RESPECTS EARNHARDT'S EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _  &UR; Jeff Burton not only engaged his older brother,
 &UR; Ward, in a tense, late-race shootout, he and  &UR; Dale Earnhardt also
locked horns during the Las Vegas 400 on Sunday at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, when Jeff Burton was leading, he tried to put the
resourceful Earnhardt a lap down.
</P>
<P>
   And twice he failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't anybody think that Earnhardt's laying down and not
racing because he is,'' Jeff Burton said. ``I think Dale Earnhardt
is still one of the best drivers in Winston Cup racing. He's not a
seven-time champion because he's not a hard racer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Earnhardt did what I would have done if I was in his
shoes and trying to stay on the lead lap. He ran me clean, and he
never did anything that was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that he's forgotten how to race and he's
not as sharp as he used to be, but I tell you, when the chips are
down and he sits in a car that's as fast as anybody else's, he's
real hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The gritty Earnhardt was rewarded with seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to race hard a couple of times to stay on the lead lap,
but it paid off,'' Earnhardt said. ``All in all, it was a pretty
good day. But we've got to get better.'' &QL; 
Send in the clowns &QL; 
Ward Burton almost took himself out of contention early by spinning
into the grassy infield while entering pit road on Lap 57.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came in too fast,'' Burton said. ``But even when I went
through the grass like a clown out there, we still came out leading
the race.'' &QL; 
Bumper cars &QL; 
Three of the five caution flags were produced by accidents. There
were no serious injuries, but a crash on Lap 132 left eight
vehicles in worse shape than they were on Lap 131.
</P>
<P>
   The melee was triggered by  &UR; Kenny Irwin, whose car wiggled, then
collected  &UR; Kenny Wallace, who slammed into the outside retaining
wall on the back straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Irwin lost it and hit me in the left side and wrecked us
both,'' Wallace said. ``That's racing. It's discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got loose on new tires,'' Irwin said. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
The last time Jeff and Ward Burton finished first and second, it
was in a NASCAR Busch Series race in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's inaugural race, Ford Taurus drivers captured 13
of the top 14 positions. Although Jeff Burton won in a Ford, the
next highest finishing Ford was  &UR; Rusty Wallace, who was ninth. Only
five of the top 14 finishers were in Fords.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mike Skinner stretched his lead in the drivers standings to 51
points over Rusty Wallace. &QL;

ARE UCLA'S GHOSTS OF NCAAS PAST PRESENT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   C'mon, admit it, UCLA fans. When Rhode Island popped up as the
No. 12 seed in the Midwest during the NCAA Division I Tournament
selection show on Sunday, you braced yourself for the punch line.
It would have been just like those merrymakers on the NCAA
Tournament committee to make the Bruins the fourth seed in the same
bracket, setting up a possible second-round showdown between the
Jim Harrick-coached Rams and the school that so unceremoniously let
him go in the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Had UCLA beaten Arizona in its regular-season finale on
Saturday, the 12th-ranked Bruins might well have found themselves
in New Orleans, on a collision course with their former coach.
Instead, the seeding went to the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the Bruins escaped their past.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's placement in a South sub-regional in Indianapolis _ it'll
face Detroit in the first round on Thursday _ can't help but
trigger flashbacks to a horrible mugging the Bruins suffered there,
one that left deep scars.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the RCA Dome in 1996 that the Bruins, the defending
national champions and the fourth seed in the Southeast, were upset
in the first round by 13th-seeded Princeton 43-41. The Tigers'
decisive points came on a layup from freshman forward Gabe Lewullis
off a backdoor pass by Steve Goodrich with 3.9 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins sophomore guard Baron Davis was a junior at Santa Monica
Crossroads School at the time. He remembers watching the final
seconds of the game on television and saying to himself, ``Man,
how'd UCLA lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Three years later, the best answer the only
remaining eyewitness in sneakers, Brandon Loyd, can come up with is
``It was one of those mysteries.'' One that Agatha Christie herself
couldn't have solved.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995-96 Bruins had cruised to the Pacific-10 conference
crown, reason enough to presume they'd put up a sturdier defense of
their national title. Looking back, the Bruins began to unravel
days before Princeton's precision play put them back on their
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd, the lone senior on this year's squad, remembers Lewullis'
layup (how could he forget?). But he also recalls how livid the
Bruins were at being shipped out of the West despite having won the
Pac-10 title and how they seethed over the lack of respect they
read into their No. 4 seeding.
</P>
<P>
   They talked so much about being regarded as unworthy, it became
a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably were, as the players would say, a little salty
(over the seedings) and the hangover carried over to that first
game,'' agreed Bruins coach Steve Lavin, then a fifth-year
assistant by way of Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his Boilermakers ties, Lavin professes to be revved
up for a return to Indiana _ never mind that Ind. stands for
indignity if you're a true-blue Bruins fan. Loyd, too, has memories
of the place that aren't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick put the freshman into the Princeton game in the second
half and he sank two 3-pointers for a fairly productive 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd recently saw a replay of the game while watching the
Classic Sports Network. Imagine that, he said with a laugh,
watching Pistol Pete Maravich one day and Pete Carril's charges
shooting down the Bruins the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm ever going to erase that memory,'' Loyd
said. ``I don't think I'd even want to. It was Pete Carril's last
tournament (before retiring), a huge upset over the defending
national champion. It really was a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not to the three sophomores and two freshmen who are
slated to start against a Detroit team that has won seven straight
and 17 of its last 19 on the way to a 24-5 record. The Bruins are
so young, they probably have no clue that before he became the
loudest barker in college basketball's circus, Dick Vitale coached
Detroit into the NCAA Tournament, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this group,'' Lavin said, ``anything that happened a year
ago is considered prehistoric.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins better respect the Titans' tenacious defense and
their tremendous backcourt of Jermaine Jackson and Rashad Phillips,
lest ancient history repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin describes Detroit as the ``sleeper'' team of this year's
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as tough a matchup as Princeton,'' he said, ``they
just play a different style.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, any team with Michael Jordan (a sophomore reserve forward)
on it can't be half-bad.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Tournament Committee could have been a lot less
kind to the Bruins. They could have been the fifth seed in the East
and, like Wisconsin, have Duke looming in the third round like the
Loch Ness monster. They could have had to confront the ghosts of
Harrick in the second round in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the only demons they have to exorcise are their own.
Injuries and inexperience, aren't they spooky enough?

LOIS WANN, 87, AN OBOIST AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lois Wann, an oboist who played in several American orchestras
and taught at the Juilliard School and the Mannes College of Music,
died on Feb. 23 at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wann who was born in Monticello, Minn., in 1912, studied the
oboe and piano as a child in San Diego and later at the Juilliard
School in New York, from which she graduated in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   When she began her career in the 1930s, there were few women in
American orchestras, and her first jobs were with the New York
Women's Symphony and the all-women Orchestrette. Hired by the San
Diego Symphony in the mid-1930s, she became one of the first women
to hold a principal chair in a professional orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to perform with the Pittsburgh Symphony and the St.
Louis Symphony, and was for many years the principal oboist of the
New York City Ballet Orchestra and in the orchestras of the summer
festivals at Aspen, Colo., and Marlboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   She also played in chamber music concerts with the Juilliard and
Budapest string quartets. As a recitalist, she gave the premiere of
Darius Milhaud's Sonatine for Oboe and Piano in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wann taught at Juilliard from 1936 to 1992 and at Mannes
College from 1946 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   She also taught at Vassar and Manhattanville Colleges, the Henry
Street Settlement and the United Nations International School.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters, Barbara Bodenhorn of
Cambridge, England, and Karynn Hatch of Bronxville, N.Y.

GET READY TO FALL IN LOVE, ALL OVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Once, my brother stormed away from the television. Off
into another room. His favorite team _ the undefeated Indiana
Hoosiers of 1974-75 _ was going down in flames.
</P>
<P>
   I monitored the end with curiosity: A quick rally. A burst of
the unexpected. A timeout.
</P>
<P>
   My brother came flying back into the room, discovering a
two-point game with a few seconds left. He frantically asked who
had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana,'' I said, as he melted into the couch, thrilled by
the reprieve, believing his prayers had been answered.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, I was wrong. Indiana didn't have the ball. And when
the commercials ended and my brother endured such a tragic twist of
emotion . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well, I was 11 when I first understood the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this passion is universal. Everyone has fallen along
with a Goliath. Risen with an underdog. Drawn in by a tournament
that never plays favorites and never lets you down.
</P>
<P>
   A tournament where every school has a story, every team has a
dream _ and some of them actually come true.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the last Big Dance of the century, and no one can play
like Duke. A team with stars coming off the bench and answers for
every nuance of the game. Once, Mike Krzyzewski was the subject of
jokes, like how he quit playing golf after 14 holes because he
didn't like the final four.
</P>
<P>
   Now, less than five years after lying in a hospital bed,
recovering from back surgery and exhaustion, Krzyzewski has roared
back to the top of the coaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no team has been so heavily favored since UNLV in 1992,
the team that beat Duke by 30 in the previous championship game. A
team so traumatizing that Bobby Hurley spent that off-season
dreaming about sharks. A team that came back and tore through the
country on its way to a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they lost. Which is what normally happens to the
preordained.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since 1974, 16 teams have entered the tournament with
one loss. Only two have reached the Final Four, and neither won the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that as you gaze at your bracket. And remember, this
tournament is always about the little guys. One-shot wonders.
One-time moments, like Bryce Drew shooting Valparaiso past a
horrified Rob Evans. Like Christian Laettner's catch-and-kill
against Kentucky. Like Lorenzo Charles dunking an airball.
</P>
<P>
   And remember that while favorites do prevail, it rarely goes as
planned. In 1995, UCLA entered with a No. 1 ranking and left with
the nets. Of course, if Tyus Edney hadn't gone coast-to-coast
against Missouri on the final play of the game, the Bruins would've
been casualties of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, you've been there. On one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I remember skipping high school on a day I hated the
world. I ended up at DePaul University, walking around the campus,
mourning the first-round choke of Mark Aguirre and the Blue Demons.
</P>
<P>
   So you wonder: Does the College of Charleston have a chance? A
team that has beaten North Carolina and won 25 in a row?
</P>
<P>
   Can Cincinnati catch fire and beat Duke for the second time this
season? Can Auburn regroup? Can UCLA survive a game without Baron
Davis? Is Kentucky the smart choice, a team that has won 28 of its
past 30 tournament games? Can Connecticut finally break through and
lose the postseason collar?
</P>
<P>
   Of all the outsiders, none may be more intriguing than Arizona.
In their shredding of UCLA on Saturday, the Wildcats looked every
bit like a contender, Jason Terry very much like the player of the
year. Question is, do they have the swagger to win six games on
neutral courts?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they're a year away. Just like they were in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, can anyone beat Duke?
</P>
<P>
   Not sure, but I remember sitting in a bar in 1985, next to a
strange girl with a Wildcat painted on her face. It was the night
Villanova played a perfect game, shot nearly 80 percent from the
field, dethroning the Evil Empire from Georgetown . . . by two
points.
</P>
<P>
   The night I fell in love. With the NCAA Tournament. &QL;

SALVADORAN RULING PARTY GAINS EARLY EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update and reorganize; changes throughout.)  (lh) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ The candidate of the conservative governing
party, a philosopher with a reputation for consensus building, led
Sunday in presidential elections that Salvadorans hoped would solve
problems of crime and unemployment that afflict the country seven
years after the end of its civil war.
</P>
<P>
   An early survey of voters leaving polling stations showed that
Francisco Flores, the 39-year-old candidate of the governing
Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as ARENA, with about 52
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   That provided him with a comfortable lead over his chief
opponent, Facundo Guardado, 44, the candidate of a coalition led by
the country's former guerrilla movement, the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, who was given 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the Camino Real Hotel here less than
three hours after polls closed, Flores claimed an early victory and
said said ARENA's own polls showed that he had garnered 53 percent
of the vote, which would preclude a runoff election. But he said he
would await the first official results by the Supreme Electoral
Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the coalition party said they rejected ARENA's
numbers and would also wait for the first official numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Among five other candidates, Ruben Zamora, the coalition's
presidential candidate in the last election who this year ran under
his own Democratic Center Union, was third with about 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among 3.1 million registered voters appeared low after a
campaign dominated by the grave problems that Salvadorans have
inherited since their 12-year civil war ended, including rampant
crime, unemployment and poverty. The presidential vote was only
their second since the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   Such apathy, political analysts said, demonstrates a loss of
faith in the effectiveness of government since peace arrived in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that despite the end of the war, the fundamental
problems of the country have not been solved like they had
expected,'' said Jose Miguel Cruz, the director of the Public
Opinion Institute at the Central American University. ``They say
we've had war, elections, peace accords and more elections, and we
still have violence and problems of unemployment and poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous elections only half of the eligible voters cast
ballots. Two out of three Salvadorans had little or no interest in
this election, according to a survey last month by the public
opinion institute. The reasons, it found, ranged from mistrust of
politicians to skepticism that the vote could make a difference in
solving the country's problems or improving living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the disillusionment of Salvadorans was not enough to turn
many voters away from ARENA, which suffered serious losses to the
party of the former guerrillas in municipal and legislative
elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls opened Sunday, Flores, a philosopher with
a fresh face and no ties to the civil war, was favored to win,
though it was unclear whether he would gain enough votes to avoid a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition party led by the former rebels, after much
infighting, had rejected broadening its appeal and settled on
Guardado, a moderate ex-guerrilla commander who had pushed for the
selection of a centrist candidate from an allied party.
</P>
<P>
   Guardado's war credentials and Flores' resume, which includes
studies in Indian philosophy and a bachelor's degree in political
science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, seemed to
leave many voters unable to see an alternative beyond ARENA,
however dissatisfied they might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francisco Flores seems to me more capable, better educated,''
said Raul Avila, 68, a tailor who said he had been held up twice in
recent years during the day. ``No Government is ideal but the hope
we all have is that he can begin solving the most serious problems
of the country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Avila voted at the fairgrounds here where 69,000 Salvadorans
were registered to vote. If the overall turnout was low, spirits
were high Sunday, as throngs filed into cavernous pavilions to cast
their ballots at cardboard podiums.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the scene was festive, with food and drink vendors
hollering for business as voters came and went, many of them
wearing T-shirts, caps and hair ribbons with party colors and
honking their horns in electoral euphoria as they sat in heavy
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were held on the eve of President Clinton's
four-day visit to Central America to survey the damage inflicted by
Hurricane Mitch late last year. He will start with Nicaragua and El
Salvador on Monday. Flags welcoming Clinton as the ``Excelentisimo
Senor Presidente'' have been up on major roads here for days.
Clinton will be the first American president to visit El Salvador
since Lyndon B. Johnson stopped by in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At a news teleconference this week from Washington, Peter F.
Romero, the State Department's sub-secretary for western hemisphere
affairs, said the president was also coming to celebrate the
region's democratic transformation after the civil wars of the
1980s and, particularly, the results of El Salvador's elections.
</P>
<P>
   That transformation would have been even more remarkable if the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which the United States
helped the government here fight after El Salvador became a main
Cold War battleground, had built on previous electoral victories to
take over power now.
</P>
<P>
   But after capturing the second largest bloc of legislative seats
and a large number of mayoral posts, including the capital, in
1997, its own inner divisions reinforced feelings among many voters
that the ex-guerrillas were ill-prepared to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, a social democrat and highly regarded intellectual, was
expected to capture much of the disaffected leftist vote.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Arena, which was founded in the early 1980s by
leaders associated with El Salvador's right-wing death squads but
has since cultivated a moderate image, united after the losses of
1997 behind Flores, a candidate known in the National Assembly for
building consensus and who epitomized the party's message of
``renovation and openness.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores avoided personal attacks and campaigned on a platform of
bringing professionalism to the police, reforming a corrupt
judicial system and generating jobs through increased foreign
investment and support of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major change in Arena is a change toward the common good,
the national good,'' Flores said in an interview Saturday.

DEANE JOHNSON, 80, LAWYER FOR ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Iowa, Pa., Idaho)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deane F. Johnson, an entertainment-industry lawyer and corporate
executive prominent in nonprofit institutions, died on Feb. 28 at
his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   He had a long illness, according to an announcement of his death
by the Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, of which he
had been the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his second wife, the former Anne McDonnell Ford,
were familiar figures for years in Los Angeles' social and arts
scene. They were married in 1968, four years after she and Henry
Ford II divorced. She soon became the most prestigious hostess in
Los Angeles and was also active in social and charitable events in
New York. She died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was with O'Melveny &AMP; Myers from 1942 to 1981. His
clients in those years included William Holden, William S. Paley,
James Stewart, Bing Crosby, Shirley Temple, Dinah Shore, Gary
Cooper, CBS and Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   For a dozen years beginning in 1981, he was in New York as an
executive and director of Warner Communications, and then of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson received a bachelor's degree in 1939 and a law degree in
1942, both from Stanford University. Later he became chairman of
the Stanford law school's board of visitors and donated his
Colorado ranch to the law school, where he had been first in his
class. That is the largest gift the law school has ever received.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Des Moines, Iowa, grew up in Ione, Calif., became
one of his law firm's partners in 1950 and was chairman of its
management committee from 1977 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was president of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team
for a time. He was a trustee of the American Film Institute and the
California Institute of Technology, a member of boards at the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and a director
of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, the Boy Scouts of
America, the Actors Fund and the American Museum of the Moving
Image, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Jane Pendergast, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is survived by his wife, Kate Edelman Johnson, whom he
married in 1996; a son, Deane Jr. of Ketchum, Idaho, and a twin
sister, Doris Winters Johnson of Redwood City, Calif.

it was a very painful delivery. The anesthesiologist wouldn't even
come into the room until she got her money,'' says Ms. Chavez.

Theater. ``Band in Berlin'' is not so much a play as a kind of
docu-cabaret. Through slide projections, re-enactments of newsreel

which murderous psychopaths really shine, it's opera; the
surprising thing is that it wasn't until 1965 that this story made
its operatic debut. What this version offers, in addition to
stageworthy characters, is a psychological dimension. It points up
the bleakness that causes Lizzie to snap, but it refuses to make

DAVID DAUBE, 90, AN AUTHORITY ON TALMUDIC AND ROMAN LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prof. David Daube, an eminent authority on legal history who was
best known for his writings on Talmudic law, other biblical law and
Roman law, died on Feb. 24 in Oak Park Convalescent Hospital in
Pleasant Hill, Calif. He was 90 and had lived in San Francisco for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   Daube (pronounced DOW-beh) retired in 1981 after 11 years as
professor-in-residence at the law school of the University of
California at Berkeley. In those years he also served as the
director of the Robbins Hebraic and Roman Law Collections in the
law school's library.
</P>
<P>
   In later years he continued to teach courses at the law school
in Talmudic, Roman and ancient law. He had been Regius Professor of
civil law at Oxford University from 1955 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Daube's collected works are being edited by Calum Carmichael,
professor of comparative literature and adjunct professor of law at
Cornell University. Carmichael said that over five decades, Daube,
who came from a strict Orthodox Jewish home, had produced ``work on
the New Testament that was revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mining Talmudic literature with a sharpness of focus and an
extraordinary degree of sophistication,'' Carmichael went on, ``he
showed that the ideas and institutions of the New Testament
belonged to a thoroughly Jewish setting and could not be understood
without the perspective provided by the Talmud. He saw what others
saw, but could produce thoughts that no one had ever thought
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Daube was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, and went on to
receive a doctorate in law in 1932 from Gottingen University after
writing a dissertation on an aspect of biblical law. He left
Germany in 1933 to escape Hitler's rule and to pursue his study of
Roman law at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
   He received a second doctorate, on Roman law, in 1936, then went
on to be a lecturer in law at Cambridge and then a professor of
jurisprudence at Aberdeen University before becoming a Regius
Professor at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   His 1936 marriage to Hertha Aufseesser ended in divorce in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 13 years, Helen Smelser Daube of
San Francisco; three sons, Jonathan, of Manchester, Conn.,
Benjamin, of Toronto, and Michael, of Perth, Australia; two
stepchildren, Eric and Tina Smelser, both of San Francisco, and six
grandchildren.

<P>
   TUCSON _ Jason Terry carried Arizona into the Top 10 and to its
12th straight 20-win season.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's tournament time, six consecutive do-or-die games,
beginning Friday in Milwaukee against Oklahoma in the first round
of the Midwest Regional. If the fourth-seeded Wildcats are to go
deep into March Madness, Terry can't do it alone. Ultimately, it's
the Wildcats' deep, talented but inconsistent pool of freshmen who
likely will determine how far they go in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Five freshmen are among the Wildcats' first nine players. Three
start. Two were named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman team. One is the
conference Freshman of the Year. A sixth freshman, Luke Walton, was
redshirted after he suffered a stress fracture in his foot in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is mounting that this is Coach Lute Olson's best rookie
class. But is it ready for the next step?
</P>
<P>
   Power forward Michael Wright, the Freshman of the Year and most
dominating among the group, recognizes that this is a new season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a good learning year for all of our
freshmen,'' Wright said. ``Now we're into a situation in the
tournament where it's one loss and you're out. We've got to fight
like dogs. All of us have to step up and show our stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wright has been the leader of the freshmen, Olson said
it's shooting guard Ruben Douglas, who found a home in the closing
four games, and small forward Richard Jefferson, a Phoenix Moon
Valley High School product who joined Wright on the All-Freshman
team, who will most influence Arizona's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on whether those two wings have developed far
enough to hurt people,'' Olson said. ``When people spread their
defense, they've got to attack and make them pay. It gets down to
the play of those two wings offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the midpoint of the Pac-10 race, the indicators
were not encouraging. But they're looking up. ``They understand now
the kind of commitment, the kind of effort that it takes,'' Olson
said. ``I think they see that we have some idea of what we are
trying to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure early they didn't think we were messing with
their games. They think sometimes we're striving for perfection too
much. The day you stop striving for perfection is the day you stop
getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that inconsistency is to be expected in freshmen, but
that Wright and Jefferson are atypical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual for a freshman to be consistent, and we've
got two who are in Wright and Jefferson,'' Olson said. ``Richard is
shooting shooting 50 percent and 82 percent at the line (in Pac-10
play). Those are not freshman numbers there. The thing I like about
Richard is that when there is a big shot, he's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright was the Pac-10's leading rookie scorer and rebounder. In
two of the final three regular-season games, though, even he showed
telltale freshman traits. He got into foul trouble at Stanford,
playing only six minutes, and against UCLA, playing 20.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 6-foot-7, 252-pound Wright catches the ball in the
low post, he either scores, gets fouled, or both. Wright changed
the face of the Wildcats from the perimeter-oriented club that won
the national title two years ago and the Pac-10 title last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to say over last four weeks what was the biggest
change in our team, it was the ability of our inside guys to get
open and the ability of our perimeter guys to get the ball to
them,'' Olson said. ``We have much better balance now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright is making opponents pay if they foul him, too. He made 12
in a row at the line in the next-to-last game against Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take it to the basket aggressively, you'll get calls,''
Wright said. ``I've noticed that a lot of big men aren't good
free-throw shooters. I shoot at least 100 a day in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wright teaming with seniors Terry, the Pac-10 Player of the
Year, and all-conference center A.J. Bramlett, the Wildcats have
been solid at three positions since the start. Jefferson grew into
a dependable fourth option.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece was shooting guard. Because Arizona had not
established a consistent threat, opponents could double-team Terry
off that position. Douglas started there early. So did classmates
Traves Wilson and Rick Anderson. They were 30 percent shooters. And
except for the long arms of the 6-8 Anderson, they were no threat
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Douglas was reinserted. In the Wildcats' closing
four games, he averaged 28.3 minutes, shot 52 percent overall and a
sizzling 47.6 from three-point range while averaging 16.5 points.
His outside shooting limited opponents' ability to double Terry. He
also had two five-assist games and made six steals in his closing
run.
</P>
<P>
   The latter statistic was the most convincing evidence to Olson
that Douglas is maturing into a reliable player. ``It's frustrating
in terms of getting the young guys to understand that the game is
about defense,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said he and Wilson didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I was in there against Kris Weems (of
Stanford) and Geno Carlisle (of California), guys who have been
playing college ball for four or five years, and I'm trying to stop
them,'' Douglas said. ``Those are physical, experienced guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to define our role at two-guard. The focus
has been defense primarily. Offense is kind of last. Me and Richard
and Traves and Ricky have all had a tough adjustment. In high
school, we were the stars of the team. We didn't have to get back
on defense. We didn't pass too much, either. This year has been a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Olson, Terry is probably the most appreciative of
Douglas' emergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until lately if our two-guard was open, the defense would
still double me and take its chances with him,'' Terry said. ``Now
Ruben is looking for his shot and making his shot. He can take it
to the hole, too. He's causing problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, like Douglas, can put the ball on the floor and
create opportunities. Jefferson is second on the team in assists
and third in rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just rely on J.T. in the tournament,'' Jefferson
said. ``He has gotten a lot of publicity with all of his awards,
and teams will be focused to stop him. We've got to get it from all
of the others. You could tell a couple of games ago that J.T. was
getting tired. Everybody helped out, and that helped him get his
energy back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to peak.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``With about three or four minutes to go (in the season-ending
87-70 rout of No. 12 UCLA), I told the young guys on the bench,
`Let's ride this. Let's go into the tournament with a lot of
confidence,' '' Terry said. ``The biggest thing is the way Ruben is
playing. There's no question about our two-guard anymore. That
means we're solid at all five postions. That's going to make us
pretty hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   With continued consistency from Douglas and Jefferson, the
Wildcats can be a formidable NCAA Tournament team, Olson said.
Terry takes it a step further. He says they can make their fourth
trip to the Final Four since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be the X-factors in the tournament, without a
doubt,'' Douglas said. &QL;

RONALD WILLETTS, 83, EXPERT ON LIFE IN ANCIENT CRETE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald Willetts, a British authority on life in ancient Crete,
died on Feb. 19 in Birmingham, England. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   His death was reported on Saturday by The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Willetts retired in 1981 from Birmingham University, where he
had taught for 35 years and had been chairman of the department of
Greek beginning in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his scholarship dealt with age-old folkways and social
conditions in Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, which is in
the eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Crete was where the Minoan culture, the first significant
European civilization, was born roughly 5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An important product of his scholarship is his edition, with a
commentary, of ``The Law Code of Gortyn.'' The edition was
published in the late 1960s and has been called definitive.
</P>
<P>
   The code was discovered in 1884 among the remnants of the
ancient Cretan city of Gortyn. The code's laws were inscribed in
about 450 B.C. on blocks that were used in a building of that
period, and they provide valuable information about civil society
in those days.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the code has to do with the rights of
families, individuals and slaves and with trial procedure. It
includes laws about family matters like marriage, divorce and
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Willetts' books that have come out in the United States include
``Cretan Cults and Festivals'' (1962) and ``The Civilization of
Ancient Crete'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Two of his translations from Greek drama were produced on the
stage. He also wrote poetry of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in in Halesowen in the English county of
Worcestershire and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the
University of Birmingham. He became a lecturer in Greek there in
1946 after rising to major in the British army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He married Annie Marion Dann in 1945, and they had a daughter,
Helen Anne.

COMMITTEE'S DECISIONS PROVE BAFFLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last week, the Pacific-10 coaches selected three
Arizona State players to the 10-man all-conference team, an
embarrassingly high number for a team that finished ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the NCAA Tournament selection committee has been
doodling at the same greaseboard.
</P>
<P>
   One word describes the 64-team field announced Sunday: huh?
</P>
<P>
   The committee is good for a few surprises each March; that's
part of the allure. But this year's pairings make less sense than
an all-star team of Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Auburn, No. 1 in the South, and Kentucky, No. 2
in the Midwest. Each year, the committee stresses the importance of
nonconference schedules: You can't control your family, it says,
but you can control your friends.
</P>
<P>
   So the Wildcats played what might be the toughest nonconference
schedule in history (UCLA, Kansas, Miami, Indiana, Maryland, Duke
and Louisville) while Auburn did not play a ranked team and stocked
its schedule with directional schools. The Wildcats also beat
Auburn twice, including in the Southeastern Conference tournament,
and somehow they're seeded behind the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kentucky isn't a No. 1, but based on stated criteria,
neither is Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford lost its No. 1 seed when it lost at Oregon State on
Saturday night, but Maryland has the strongest complaint. The Terps
are 26-5 with losses to Duke (twice), North Carolina and Kentucky
(road). They beat Stanford, UCLA and North Carolina (twice). And
they aren't a No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   Give the committee credit for recognizing Utah's dominating
performance and awarding the Utes a No. 2 seed, even though it
necessitated moving them out of the West.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the decision backfired: As the No. 2 seed in
the Midwest, the Utes are scheduled to face Kentucky in the Sweet
16. The teams have played four times in recent tournaments,
including the 1998 title game, and Kentucky has won all four.
They're two of the hottest and best-coached teams in the draw;
unfortunately, one will be out a round too soon.
</P>
<P>
   There are other sensitive seeding issues. The Big Ten got seven
bids _ and would have received an eighth had Illinois won the
conference tournament _ while the Pac-10 got four and the ACC
three, a record low. Explained committee chairman C.M. Newton:
``Other than the automatic qualifiers, we don't worry about the
leagues'' when picking at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   As the only at-large 13th seed, Oklahoma was the last team in.
Xavier, Mississippi State, Fresno State and Wake Forest were
justifiably excluded. The Missouri Valley Conference received three
berths, the Mid-American Conference two: Call it the rise of the
mid-majors.
</P>
<P>
   But the selection committee made its most serious blunder in
selecting New Mexico over California. The Lobos had a Sagarin
rating in the 80s, a nonconference schedule so pathetic that state
politicians complained publicly, no quality road wins and only one
