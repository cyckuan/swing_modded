<HEADLINE> Three Americans Brought to Court on Terrorism in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Three Americans arrested last
Sunday at the Harare International Airport with a huge assortment
of arms of war were brought to court Saturday in Zimbabwean
capital.
</P>
<P>
Jona Lamonte Dixon (35), Joseph Pettijohn (34) and Garry
Georges Blanchard (35) appeared briefly before regional magistrate
Alphias Chitakunye amid tight security and a heavy presence of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The three, who were represented by Jeremy Callow, a Zimbabwean
lawyer, and prosecuted by Joseph Musakwa of the Attorney-General's
office, have been charged with acts of terrorism and sabotage and
contravening the Law and Order Maintenance Act.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the three could be sentenced to life in jail.
</P>
<P>
Musakwa said the accused were in possession of diagram of a
state house and that they had been sent weapons by sea via
Tanzania which were intended for a Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) mission.
</P>
<P>
Musakwa also said the three were linked to the Harvest Field
ministries, a religious group based in the Indiana State of
America and were a group of mercenaries who sought to destabilize
state security.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were brought to court chained together in leg
irons and were escorted by three police jeeps full of heavily
armed officers.
</P>
<P>
Callow said that the state had breached the 48 hour detention
period and that it had denied the accused the right to have access
to a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Callow and the three refuted allegations of them being
mercenaries and that they rented a house in Harare where more arms
were found.
</P>
<P>
Musakwa said the Americans should be denied bail because as
foreigners they could abscond and that their motives had not been
fully established. Callow did not contest that.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Release All Detained in Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat has said he would release all Palestinians
detained during clashes with the police in Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure on a visit to Saudi Arabia, Arafat said he
could reduce the death sentence of Raed Attar who has been accused
of killing a Palestinian officer.
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation in the Gaza Strip, particularly
that in Rafah, has returned to normal and everything has been put
under control.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians were shot dead and three others injured in
Rafah on Wednesday during clashes with Palestinian police and
security forces, after a Palestinian military court sentenced
three members of Palestinian Preventive Forces (previously members
of Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas) to death and long prison
terms.
</P>
<P>
The accused were convicted of killing Palestinian Capt. Rafat
Joudeh in early February.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Raed Attar was sentenced to death, while one
of his accomplices was given life prison term and another one 15
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Following the court decision, hundreds of Attar's family
members and supporters started to stone police and security forces
who in return opened fire and killed Ala Jumah Humsi and Khamis
Salameh, both 17.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian military court and other courts passed death
sentences to about 20 Palestinians in the past several years and
Arafat only okayed death penalty to three of them.
</P>
<P>
In the Palestinian territories, any death sentence must be
approved By Arafat before execution.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left Gaza Saturday for Saudi Arabia to hold
consultations with Saudi Arabian leaders on the issue of
declaring an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters before his departure, Arafat said the
Palestinian side will continue to consult with other Arab nations
on this issue before he travels to Washington later this
month.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: National Front Wins Malaysia's Sabah election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Barisan Nasional (BN)
(National Front), the former ruling coalition, has won the ninth
legislative assembly election of the Sabah State, East Malaysia,
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
The BN won 31 seats out of 48 seats at stake while the
opposition Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) grabbed 17, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Former chief minister Bernard Dompok, however, failed to retain
his seat in the election held Friday and Saturday, according to
radio television Malaysia (RTM).
</P>
<P>
A total of 199 candidates contested for the 48 seats in the
state election regarded as the most intensely fought state polls.
</P>
<P>
The BN, the PBS and Parti Bersekutu each contested in all 48
constituencies. Apart from BN, PBS and Bersekutu, three smaller
parties -- Setia, Pasok and PAS as well as 27 independents -- also
joined the contest.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Assembly of the Sabah State, East Malaysia,
whose five-year mandate ends on March 18, was dissolved on
February 22.
</P>
<P>
In the dissolved assembly, the BN held 43 seats while the
opposition PBS had four and the remaining one seat was held by an
Independent.

Besides the 48 elected seats, the state assembly also had six
nominated assemblymen, three each by BN and PBS.

<HEADLINE> PLO to Announce Decision on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Council of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) will convene early next
month to decide whether to declare an independent Palestinian
state on May 4, a senior Palestinian official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, adviser to Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat, said the PLO executive committee had
authorized the 125-member Palestinian leadership body to discuss
the statehood plan, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the final decision on the statehood
will follow consulations with Arab and European countries as well
as the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is widely reported that Arafat might put off his plan on
statehood declaration in view of the May 17 Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that he will declare an independent state on
May 4, by which the Palestinians and Israel should sign a
permanent peace agreement according to the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians believe they have the right to proclaim an
independent state on the date.
</P>
<P>
But western and other Arab nations have suggested over the last
few months that Arafat delay such a move, fearing that it will
boost the position of Israeli hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the elections.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that May 4 is "a sacred date," Arafat has
played down his tone on the statehood, saying that he is ready to
seriously consider all the suggestions.
</P>
<P>
He has held frequent consulations recently with other Arab
nations and European Union member countries and will meet
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Arafat will ask Washington during
the meeting to formally recognize the Palestinians' right to an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The recognition will be part of a broad international
agreement, in which the Palestinians agree to postpone the
declaration while the international community promises to
recognize it when a state is declared later.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. opposes a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
state, urging the Palestinians to resolve the issue through
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a fresh sign of such a position, the Senate voted 98-1
Thursday to urge the Clinton administration to be tougher in its
opposition to Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The status of the Palestinian territories, together with other
issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem, is set to be negotiated in
the final-status talks, which have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's administration has threatened to annex parts of the
West Bank still under its control in response to Palestinians'
unilateral statehood declaration.

elections.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, accompanied by a 14-member delegation, is expected to
have talks with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, the Founder
President Julius Nyerere and the ruling CCM Party Vice-Chairman
John Malecela.

<P>
HARARE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The National Constitutional
Assembly (NCA) of Zimbabwe Saturday held peaceful marches in
Harare and Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, to enhance
awareness and participation of the broad mass in the making of a
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of opposition parties, labor, student unions,
human rights groups and other civic groupings participated in the
marches which were also expected to take place in other major
urban centers, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NCA said the marches were conducted to reject the
imposition of a constitutional making process without the
involvement of the majority of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional process, the NCA said, rightly belonged to
the people and it is they who should determine the process.
</P>
<P>
In Harare, several thousand people marched from the city center
to Rufaro stadium where representatives of civic groupings gave
messages of solidarity to the NCA and the participants.
</P>
<P>
In Bulawayo, participants marched from White City stadium to
the City Hall grounds in the city center, where they were
addressed by various speakers, calling on broad participation in
making a new constitution.

according to government sources in Pristina, the capital city of

<HEADLINE> Iraq Welcomes Output Cut by Major Oil Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday welcomed the
Amsterdam agreement by major oil producing countries on reducing
output, describing it as a positive step to check the
deterioration of the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed, in a statement to
the Iraqi News Agency INA, said that Amsterdam agreement
harmonized with Iraq's demands for cutting oil output with the
aim of putting an end to the deterioration of the oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Rasheed called upon Saudi Arabia to take
responsible steps with the objective of achieving stability in
oil prices by bearing the full decrease or the most of it
at least.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried that Saudi Arabia will not decrease its
oil production," INA quoted Rasheed as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister's remarks came after energy ministers from
four member countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) -- Algeria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela,
and non-OPEC Mexico agreed Friday in Amsterdam to reduce by 2
million barrels a day their crude output starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not known how much each country will
reduce its production. Members of the OPEC will announce their
production cuts during the organization's next meeting on March
23 in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said that Iraq would attend the upcoming OPEC meeting
and ask for oil cut in order to reach oil prices at acceptable
rates.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister expressed his optimism that the
anticipated meeting would achieve positive results that would
ensure moderate rates for oil prices that have suffered a big
fall.
</P>
<P>
"The present situation of the oil prices in the world market
is tantamount to big catastrophe that affected the interests of
oil producing countries, in particular last year," said Rasheed.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it will also affect the consumers at the
long term because of "Saudi policy of floating the market with oil
to the benefit of the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
"The solution of this problem lies in adopting the Iraqi
proposal which aims at achieving balance between supply and
production through decreasing oil output from 1.5 million barrels
per day (bpd) to 2 million bpd as a first stage," Rasheed said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Iraq's oil production under the oil-for-food program,
Rasheed said that Iraq had exported more than 195 million
barrels since the beginning of the current fifth phase which
started last November and expires on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth and fifth phases of the oil-for-food deal,
Iraq is allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil in six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Due to the low oil prices on world markets and severe
shortages of oil spare parts, Iraq was just able to export 3
billion dollars of oil in the fourth phase.

<HEADLINE> Defense Show to Bring Advanced Technology to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A military leader of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) said Saturday that the upcoming 4th
International Defense Exhibition will introduce most advanced
technology and expertise to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The INDEX '99, which is to be held here on March 14-18, will
"enrich the local expertise with the latest advances in defense
technology," said Sheikh Khalifa, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and
Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the UAE Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
A total of 848 firms from 40 countries will attend the
bi-annual event.
</P>
<P>
Terming the UAE as a peace loving country, Khalifa said "its
efforts to build strong armed forces emanated from its rights
recognized by the U.N. Charter permitting every country to defend
its borders and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that procuring deterrent arsenal contributes
to spreading peace and deter aggression intentions by others," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the UAE is not intending to take part
in arms race in the region and the country's concern over military
issues should not overshadow its interest in development and
progress.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Sultan Al Suwaidi, chairman of the Military Committee
for International Defense Exhibitions (CODEX), has also stressed
that IDEX '99 is not related with the current tensions in the
Gulf, which involves Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the continuous tension in the region is apparently
the main factor that stimulates the defense procurement by the
Gulf Cooperation Council member states.
</P>
<P>
According to IDEX '99 Preview, a publication issued by CODEX,
defense procurement by GCC member states continue to grow by 10
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The publication said the Gulf accounts for over 50 percent of
the annual overseas arms business of France and Britain, the two
main European arms exporting countries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns Israeli Air Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Saturday condemned Israel's continued air aggression on his
country, terming it an act of violating a country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"What Israel did and is doing is an infringement of Lebanon's
sovereignty and a continuation of the Israeli hostile policy aimed
at creating tension (between the two countries)," Lahoud was
quoted by the official National News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters have been roaring over Lebanon's eastern,
central and northern areas, including Beirut, from Friday night
till Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli surprise move provoked the alarming of Lebanese
army and anti-Israeli guerrilla group Hezbollah, with the
country's anti-aircraft units put on high alert.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that it was unclear whether the Israeli
action was in preparation for a large-scale attack or simple show
of force in the wake of two recent Hezbollah attacks, which killed
seven Israelis, including a general.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the president has been following up the Israeli
action along with Lebanese security officials since Friday night.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no reports of Israeli fresh actions in
Lebanon throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war to try to oust Israeli occupation
troops and their allied South Lebanon Army out of the country.

have revived debate about how officers handle confrontations with
minorities. In New Jersey, state troopers have come under fire for
conducting traffic stops based on a driver's race -- so-called
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
Clinton offered a series of federal initiatives and policy
suggestions designed to bolster public confidence in law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
He touted the steady drop in crime nationwide since his
administration began promoting community policing. But he
cautioned that those advances could be undermined if public trust
in the police waned.
</P>
<P>
"While each specific allegation will have to be dealt with on
its own merits, it is clear that we need a renewed determination
as a nation to restore those bonds of trust that have been
absolutely critical to our success at lowering the crime rate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To enhance relations between the police and citizens, Clinton
said he would instruct the Justice Department to expand police
ethics training at 30 regional community policing centers. He
proposed a 40 million U.S. dollars funding increase to improve
police training nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"Police departments ought to reflect the diversity of the
communities they serve," Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Increases Education Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania decided Saturday
to increase the budget allocation to the education sector from the
present 22.5 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa told a conference on education here
that the move, effective from now till the year 2004, is aimed at
enhancing the quality of education in the country.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Education Sector Reform and Development Program
appraisal conference, Mkapa said the government is also
considering introduction of education levy in the taxation system.
</P>
<P>
He said that focus of education should be on the basic
education in a bid to lay a solid foundation on which secondary
and higher education are built.
</P>
<P>
"For about 80 percent of Tanzanians, the only education they
can expect to receive is basic education; hence the need to
improve and enrich it, making it relevant to their lives and work
after their primary school education," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also urged the donors to support Tanzania's efforts till
it develops own capacity to sustain the education programs before
their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania attained a 98 percent of primary education
enrolment rate and a 90 percent of adult literacy rate during the
1970s and 1980s with donors support, but the gains were rapidly
eroded due to drastic reduction of donors funding before the local
capacity was built.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed deep concern over the literacy rates
declining and a 56.7 percent net enrolment ratio at primary school
levels at present stage.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the 21st century of science and technology, the
down ward trends in education must be stopped and be reversed
gradually as the economy picks up," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
The two-week long appraisal conference aims at making
recommendations by experts at home and abroad on how to move
forward the process of education reform and development.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13 people were
killed and six others wounded in a bomb blast in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, private NTV reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that three unidentified attackers got off
from a car and went into a "Blue Market" in Goztepe district
in Kadikoy of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The blast exploded 10 minutes after the attackers entered
into the six-storyed building in the shopping center, added the
report.
</P>
<P>
It said that most people including many women died of flames
and smoke inhalation caused by the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Two bodies were found in the second floor and 10 bodies found
in the fifth floor which was crowded with shoppers.
</P>
<P>
The blast has caused great panic in the area, said the report.
</P>
<P>
No one or group has so far claimed the responsibility for the
blast in the tourist city of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth serious explosive incident this month
probably in protest of the capture of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
This is one of the deadliest attacks in western Turkey in
years.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit issued statements, condemning the terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police immediately took strict security measures in
Goztepe of Istanbul where over 12 million people are living.

wounded in a bomb blast in Republic district in the city of
Cankiri when his car was passing by.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The
delegates representing the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo left here
Saturday afternoon for Paris to take part in the second round of
the Kosovo peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian delegates left on a special French Air
Force Hercules plane to attend the talks due to start next Monday
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Four more people will join the original 16 Kosovar negotiators
who participated in the Rambouillet peace talks held last month.
</P>
<P>
At the previous round of talks, the authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and the delegates of the ethnic Albanians
of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo agreed on the political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities were opposed to the military clause
demanding stationing of NATO-led peace implementation troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
late on Friday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reaffirmed
Yugoslavia's stance in the issue of the stationing of foreign
troops on the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president told the visitor that the continuation
of the peace talks should only conclude by reaching a political
agreement, ruling out any military means.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Set up Committee for Power Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) agreed on Saturday to establish an independent committee to
supervise and manage the GCC power linkage project approved at
the 1997 GCC summit held in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting of GCC electricity
ministers held in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, according to
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed during their one-day meeting that each
member state should pay five percent of its share in the first
phase of the project, the news agency said. But it did not mention
the specific share each GCC state should pay.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Electricity and Water of the UAE, Hamid Al-Oweis,
who chaired the meeting, said that the cost of the project was
estimated at 1.1 billion U.S. dollars, while pervious estimates
put it at 1.78 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the payments will be made within one month to
allow the committee to launch the works.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the project involves Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar
and Saudi Arabia, and the second covers Oman and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), the two other states of the six-member GCC.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project was expected to be completed in
three years.
</P>
<P>
The project is based on exchanging the reserves of energy
available in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Vows to Guarantee Foreign Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government issued a
statement Saturday, promising to take measures to guarantee the
normal operation of foreign oil companies in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The statement came amid the stories by some western media that
the military forces of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) are to launch offensives on
northern Angola's oil towns of Cabinda and Soyo, with an aim to
sabotage the production of oil, important strategic resource the
Angolan government relies on.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Savimbi's UNITA, which have suffered
series of defeats on the battle fronts, are not capable of
attacking these oil towns.
</P>
<P>
The rumors of offensives on the oil towns were spread by UNITA
itself and were aimed to scare away foreign oil companies, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the government, which is now
controlling the situation in the battle fields, will wipe out the
UNITA forces and win final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take measures to prevent UNITA men
from penetrating into the oil towns for harassment.
</P>
<P>
Angola, a country in civil war, is the second largest oil
producer in Africa after Nigeria, with daily crude output of
780,000 barrels. Oil export accounts for nearly 80 percent of the
country's foreign currency income. However, about 60 percent of
the country's oil production is controlled by companies from
Europe and America.

<HEADLINE> EU Declines to Set Kosovo Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers Saturday in the Rhine River town of Eltwille near
Wiesbaden declined to set a deadline in the peace talks between
Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians due to resume in France next
week while underscoring that NATO would have to supervise any
accord.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook at a news briefing said
"The danger with deadlines is that nothing happens until you reach
the deadline."
</P>
<P>
Cook and German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said they
expected "rapid progress" at the peace talks, which are scheduled
to start in Paris Monday as a continuation of the February
Rambouillet talks, which failed to yield an accord.
</P>
<P>
But they declined to set any time frame for negotiations which
are taking place under the auspices of the six-nation Contact
Group - Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
European Union foreign ministers agreed at this meeting that
Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians should be given a miximum
four-day deadline for hammering out differences at peace talks in
France next week, diplomatic sources of this meeting said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine would
open the negotiations with a blunt message to get down to work
with no fancy rhetoric or ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can guarantee this conference is going to produce an
agreement," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in the Rhine River town of Eltville came amid a
stand-off between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and NATO.
</P>
<P>
The leader of Yugoslavia Milosevic has rejected allowing NATO
troops into Kosovo to police a peace deal, but agreed to accept
observers sent by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) who are already in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has warned Milosevic he
faces his "last chance" and must either allow NATO peacekeeping
troops in Kosovo or face the prospect of Serbian targets being
bombed by NATO jets.
</P>
<P>
Both Cook and Fischer declared there would be no backing down
and that NATO troops would have to surpervise any accord.
</P>
<P>
"It is fully clear: NATO command structures must be there,"
said Fischer, adding: "It's no secret the U.S. has said NATO leads
or we are out."
</P>
<P>
Cook said there would be no NATO deployment without an accord
and stressed deployment would not be one-sided. "We're not going
to allow NATO to be conscripted as an airforce for the Kosovo
Liberation Army," he said.
</P>
<P>
In today's meeting, Foreign ministers from EU-15 nations also
debated moves to strengthen common European security and defense
policy.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Palestinian Leaders Meet on Mideast Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Saturday met
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the stalled Middle
East peace process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting centered on "bilateral relations and the review of
developments at the Arab, Islamic and international arenas,"
Saudi official sources told Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
But the agency did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
Arafat earlier held talks with Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz on similar issues,
especially the Israeli occupation of Arab territory and the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador in Riyadh Mustafa Deeb said that Arafat
briefed Abdullah on the deadlocked Mideast peace process and
Israel's failure to abide by the Wye River agreement signed in
Washington last October.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which was suspended by Israel early
December, Israel should have pulled out its troops from another 13
percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reiterated the move to proclaim an independent state on
May 4, a date by which the Palestinians and Israel should sign a
permanent peace deal, Deeb said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Arafat also briefed the crown prince on his tour
to European and other Arab states and their stand on a Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Riyadh earlier Saturday, part of his current
trip designed to rally support for the expected state proclamation.
</P>
<P>
The tour has taken Arafat to Egypt, Jordan, Britain and
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Germany Calls for Independent EU Military Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany proposed creating a European
Union defense capacity - independent of the U.S. - with permanent
staff, a military situation center and satellite intelligence
capacity at a meeting of European Union (EU) foreign ministers
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The focus of our efforts... would be to assure that Europe
possesses appropriate capabilities (including military
capabilities) and structures to conduct crisis management...,"
according to a paper presented by German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU will need a permanent EU military body for
strategic planning, capacity for analysis of situations and its
own sources of intelligence, Fischer said in this paper.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to strengthen Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CSFP). This requires a capacity for action backed up by credible
military capabilities and appropriate decision making bodies,"
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Among new institutions required could be permanent military
staff in Brussels, a Situation Center and a satellite intelligence
center, said the paper, which was presented at the start of
two-day meeting in Reinhartshausen Castle, a 19th Century
fortification on the Rhine River.
</P>
<P>
EU states would need to develop armed forces suited for
independent deployment in crisis situations, and key
characteristics of European armed forces would have to be
"deployability, sustainability, inter-operability, flexibility and
mobility," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Future EU operations should be possible either with or without
NATO alliance assets, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the E.U.'s members also belong to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. The four non-NATO EU states are Austria,
Finland, Ireland and Sweden and the paper said arrangements would
have to be made for these countries to take part in EU defense
policy.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts to strengthen European defense and security
contribute to the vitality and effectiveness of the Atlantic
Alliance by strengthening its European pillar," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
NATO, the paper stressed, would remain the foundation for
collective defense of its members.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers were due to present proposals on defense
cooperation to EU leaders for discussion and decision at the
Cologne summit in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Saturday
called on Israel to fully comply with all peace accords it signed
with the Palestinians to bring the derailed Mideast peace process
back on track.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah made the appeal during talks with visiting
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk in the southern
port city of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed the need for the Jewish state to continue its
troop withdrawal from the Western Bank under the Hebron and Wye
River peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Non-compliance of the agreements and their obligations will
exacerbate mistrust and frustration in the region, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Indyk arrived in Amman earlier in the day to attend a mourning
ceremony organized by the American embassy to Jordan for late
Jordanian King Hussein, who died of lymphatic cancer on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Indyk earlier met with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Raouf
al-Rawabdeh. The two leaders discussed Jordanian economic conditions
and Indyk pledged continued U.S. support for the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Washington has promised Jordan some 300 million U.S. dollars in
financial and military aid for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, one of the
only two Arab states that signed such treaties with the Jewish
state.

U.S. President Bill Clinton had praised late King Hussein as a
peace champion in the region.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Seeks Iran's Back on Nagorno-Karabakh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Azerbaijani Foreign
Minister Tofik Zulfugarov Saturday called for Iran's support for a
peaceful settlement to the Azerbaijani-Armenian dispute over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region.
</P>
<P>
Zulfugarov made the appeal in talks with Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Zulfugarov, who arrived here earlier in the day, appreciated
Iran's support for the people of Azerbaijan and presented a report
on the current situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have long been at odds over the
sovereignty of Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan
populated mostly by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes erupted in 1994, which has claimed about 7,000
lives and produced hundreds of thousands refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached a ceasefire agreement in 1994 with
the mediation of the international community, including Iran. But
the bilateral talks on the future of the disputed region have yet
to produce any substantial results.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kharrazi said that Iran is ready to continue its
mediation over the issue in keeping with its good relations with
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has only offered
an excuse to the U.S. for justifying military presence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was obviously referring to the call by some
Azerbaijani officials for the establishment of U.S. military bases
in their country to challenge the threat from Armenia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Tehran was upset by the appeal, warning Baku that it will not
tolerate the presence of U.S. forces in the region.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urges Peaceful Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi crisis cannot be
resolved by using force, but by policy and diplomacy to secure the
safety of the Iraqi people, the foreign minister of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rashid Al-Nuaimi, the UAE top diplomat, made the remarks at the
opening session of a two-day meeting of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) foreign ministers held in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
"The latest military developments does not serve this purpose
and derails the political solution and even increase tension in
the region," Al-Nuaimi said, referring to the persistent strikes
by U.S. and British warplanes over the no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This is the clearest objection expressed by a Gulf Arab
country to military actions against Iraq since the United States
and Britain carried out four days of massive air strikes against
Iraqi targets last December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al-Nuaimi urged Iraq to comply with all Security
Council resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq "must release the Kuwaiti prisoners and
detainees" allegedly being held in Iraqi jails since the 1991
Gulf war, which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The UAE foreign minister also welcomed Iraq's initiative to
open contacts with an international panel, formed recently by
the U.N. Security Council to investigate the process of
disarming Iraq of mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the initiative will result in a dialogue between Iraq
and the U.N. and finally lead to the lifting of economic
sanctions imposed on Baghdad after the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports reaching here said the GCC foreign ministers'
meeting, of which Al-Nuaimi is the current chairman, will cover
a host of issues, including the coordination of stances ahead of
the Cairo-based Arab League foreign ministers' meeting, slated in
Cairo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The GCC meeting will also deal with the recent political
activities in the region, including the visits by French Foreign
Minister Hubert Verdine and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Domestic Debts Rise, Foreign Debts Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt witnessed an increase in
domestic debts and a decrease in foreign debts in the 1997-98
fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, an annual report of the
Egyptian Central Bank showed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The domestic debts surged to 136.7 billion Egyptian pounds
(40.21 billion U.S. dollars), a rise of 11.2 billion pounds (3.29
billion dollars), or 8.92 percent, from the 1996-97 fiscal year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the rise to the mounting reliance of Egypt
on domestic resources in financing investment projects included in
the state budget.
</P>
<P>
The government borrowed 13.5 billion pounds (3.97 billion
dollars) from the National Investment Bank and another 4.9 billion
pounds (1.44 billion dollars) in treasury bills in the 1997-98
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's foreign debts, however, dropped 700 million dollars to
28.1 billion in the last fiscal year thanks to the fallen exchange
rates of most foreign currencies, the report said.

MOGADISHU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- North Mogadishu is experiencing
its second day of fierce fighting between militiamen loyal to Muse
Sudi Yalahow and others organized by the business community of a
market Sunday. More than 10 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which had subsided on Saturday afternoon has
resumed early in the morning Sunday with Yalahow's militiamen
trying to encircle the Karan market in north Mogadishu with
heavily armed militiamen and battle wagons.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the heavy machine guns and the assault rifles,
rocket- propelled grenades and the Russian-Made B-10 anti-tank gun
were among the weapons introduced for use against the businessmen
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Several rounds of the B-10 gun have landed in the center of the
market as each side tried to push its opponents away for better
protection of their positions.
</P>
<P>
Even though there are many people still trapped in the market,
confirmed reports indicate that 12 people were killed and more
than 25 others were wounded during the serious fighting for
control of the market Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The dead include a well-known street fighter with only one name
as Dhagobayr and one of the businessmen backing the forces
fighting against Yalahow.
</P>
<P>
At about mid-day Sunday, the businessmen's militiamen were
pushed back for a while and some lootings took place. According to
one of the businessmen who owns a chemist's shop, his facility was
broken into and almost all his stock were ransacked by the
loyalists of Yalahow.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, several shops and business stalls were destroyed or
heavily damaged owing to the heavy shellings against the market.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Yalahow's men had on their turn been pushed
back.
</P>
<P>
Yalahow, who controls the militiamen fighting against the
businessmen, has claimed that he has the right to impose the tax
which he characterized as acceptable and reasonable following his
claim of eradicating the bandits along the roads leading to the
market a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Yalahow said his intention is to create a more peaceful
environment for the businessmen, but he said they should in turn
pay for the taxes.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the businessmen say that they are going to fight
Yalahow and his militiamen as long as he keeps his intention of
imposing tax on the market shops and the food stores.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Agreements between Afghan Rival Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran Sunday welcomed the landmark
agreement reached between Afghan warring factions in their talks
held in Ashkhabad, Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
Iran welcomes the agreements signed Sunday between Taliban
militia, which controls nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan, and the
Northern Alliance, led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Wars have been raging between the two factions since Rabbani
was ousted by the Taliban militia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, the two sides agreed to form a shared
government, executive, legislature and judiciary and to continue
talks to address remaining problems to ensure the implementation
of the decisions.
</P>
<P>
They also said negotiations will go on for the realizing of
lasting peace through formation of a broad-based government,
composed of all Afghan ethnic groups, as stressed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Following four days of secret talks under the auspices of the
U.N., the belligerent parties also agreed to swap 20 prisoners of
war as soon as possible through the International Committee of the
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued at the end of their talks, the
two sides preferred the next round of talks to be held in
Afghanistan at a mutually agreed venue as soon as practicable.
</P>
<P>
Asefi voiced hope that war and bloodshed would be halted in
Afghanistan through the establishment of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman also hoped that continued peace talks by
all Afghan parties, tribes and ethnic groups concerned would
prepare the ground for the formation of a popular, independent and
non-aligned government in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Yellow River Reservoir Ends Ice Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Liujiaxia Reservoir, a major
reservoir on the upper reaches of China's Yellow River, has
increased its discharge after calling off a three-week alert over
ice floes.
</P>
<P>
Official sources at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Ice
Floe Command said on Sunday that on Friday the reservoir in Gansu
Province had increased its discharge to 460 cubic meters per
second.
</P>
<P>
This was possible as ice blocking the Yellow River began to
melt gradually as the weather warmed up.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two Chinese Air Force bombers dropped 20 bombs on
the icy section of the river in Inner Mongolia to prevent the ice
from causing the water to overflow its banks.
</P>
<P>
Since February 22, the Liujiaxia Reservoir had held its
discharge rate to 350 cubic meters per second to reduce pressure
on the ice-blocked areas downstream.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Ready for Peace Solution: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government is ready
for peace solution to the 10-month Ethio-Eritrean conflict even
after Ethiopia launched a new offensive early Sunday, an Eritrean
foreign ministry official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for peaceful solution. Using force is not a means
of solving this problem, " Tesfamariam Tekeste, head of the
Afro-asia and Australia desk of the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, told Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
The official said Ethiopia launched a large-scale offensive on
the Tsorona flank of the central Aitiena-mereb front, some 95
kilometers south of capital Asmara, at 8:00 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Ethiopian army carried out aerial bombings and
heavy artillery shellings in the surrounding areas Saturday
afternoon, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamariam confirmed that the fighting was fierce and various
weapons including fighter planes and tanks were involved.
</P>
<P>
There is no confirmation of the offensive from the Ethiopian
side so far.  But Tesfamariam noted that Ethiopian Premier Meles
Zenawi had already announced that his government will launch
another offensive against Eritrea "before the weekend."
</P>
<P>
Tesfamariam accused the Ethiopian government of having put
forth new preconditions for implementing the framework agreement
put forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
This new round of attacks just showed the Ethiopians "had not
been serious from the very beginning," he charged, adding that
they had accepted the OAU peace plan just "for political and
diplomatic consumption."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean official stressed that his government has not
rejected the OAU plan and has always been engaged in the
framework.
</P>
<P>
Before February 27, the Eritreans had reportedly been waiting
for the clarification of the definition of "the environs" of
Badme, a disputed 390-square kilometer patch of rocky land
southwest of Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamariam said that the OAU framework is a positive step, but
he urged the regional body to take immediate action for the
implementation of its initiative.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far Eritrea has not received any document or
reply from the OAU, the mediator in this conflict.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry official charged that the Ethiopians want
"to occupy more land and at the same time to topple the Eritrean
government," but said to change a government in a night "is a
daydream."
</P>
<P>
Life in capital Asmara is peaceful and normal. Children are
seen playing football in the street while adults are walking
unhurriedly on their way home.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the large-scale offensive by Ethiopia at
Tsorona front at the weekend, some Eritreans who can speak in
English said that they were not aware of that.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Entrepreneurs on Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A constitutional protection of
the status of private enterprises is conducive not only to the
enterprises' long-term and healthy development, it will also help
stimulate private investment and thereby push up the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Zhang Jian, founder of the private
enterprise Broad Air Conditioning Co. Ltd, the nation's top
central conditioner producer, here today when asked about the
impact of the Constitutional Amendments concerning the private
sector at a press conference sponsored by the second session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) with three other noted
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that stock rights need to be separated with
management to help create real industrial giants, adding his
company is also considering getting listed on the stock market for
further expansion.
</P>
<P>
The four entrepreneurs shared the view that a flexible
management can help make an enterprises more adaptive to market
changes and thereby more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chuanzhi, president of the nation's top PC producer Legend
Group said the company has benefited greatly from management. "
Legend Group is a state-owned but privately-run company. The
Academy of Sciences is our biggest share-holder, but we are
granted great freedom in management, especially the rights of
distribution, which enable us to follow the market rules in
management." he said.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1980s with a total capital of 200,000 yuan from the
Academy of Sciences, the Legend Group has been growing at an
annual rate of 31 percent in profits between 1992 and 1998, and
first rose into the top PC maker in China. It now holds a PC
market share of 15 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
"It is even better for the enterprise if the managers hold
stock-rights and have rights of distributing profits," said Zhao
Xinxian, president of the Sanjiu Enterprise Group.
</P>
<P>
"The leading problem plaguing the state-owned enterprises lies
with their distribution system and a lack of impetus for the
executives. The income and rights of the Chinese managers are
incompatible with their responsibilities," Zhao said, whose patent
medicine Wei-tai 999 Granules has given rise to a leading
pharmaceutical producer with 11 billion yuan in total assets and
more than 100 branches all across the nation.
</P>
<P>
The four deputies admitted that administrative intervention in
enterprise management still exist in China as a result of immature
market system. But they recognized continual and favorable changes
in this regard, saying the social environment is becoming
increasing favorable for free enterprise management.
</P>
<P>
Besides freedom in management, the entrepreneur deputies said
more transparency in management can result in lasting vitality in
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The success story of Legend Group can be first attributed to
its transparency. As a listed company on the Hong Kong stock
market, we publicize our corporate results on a quarterly basis,
compared to the half-year basis for other listed companies," Liu
Chuanzhi said.
</P>
<P>
"A listed company gets more supervision from the public
accountants and investors, and public supervision leads to
standardized and transparent management," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
The game was tight, with no team leading by a double digit
although SMB led as much as seven points twice, the last at 61-54
to tarnish the clean card of Mobiline.
</P>
<P>
Mobiline led by five twice but what could have been a victory
turned sour when they missed two pressure-packed free throws as
precious seconds ticked away at 64-63 to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
Mobiline's giant, Paul Asi Taulava who is the backbone of the
team, felt humbled by the defeat even as he logged 26 points, 15
rebounds and five assists and one block.
</P>
<P>
And for once, the hero turned goat by missing very crucial free
throws when needed most.
</P>
<P>
Only three men from each team scored in double digits -- making
the game one of the lowest scoring tussles of the All-Filipino Cup.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealander Philip Spratley
came from behind to win the men's title at the 14th Hong Kong
International Golden Mile here on Sunday while the women's crown
sailed into the hands of Chinese Li Jinnan.
</P>
<P>
"The running road is not fast but exciting," said Spratley.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealander was in the first group in the most part of
the tussle, but he sped up in the final meters and finished the
mile with a time of 4:11.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with my performance and the result," Spratley
added.
</P>
<P>
Briton James Thie became the runner-up, clocking 4:12 while
Chinese Liu Lijun took the bronze medal at 4:13.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Guangdong debutante Li Jinnan, under the coach
of Mao Dezhen who guided Wang Junxia to take the gold medal at the
Atlanta Olympics, did not meet any problems from defending
champion Cindy O'krane and the record holder Zhang Jinqing of
China.
</P>
<P>
She took her first international title at 4:43.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I ran in mile event. I am happy to win
the event but not happy with the time," said Li who triumphed in
the 800 and 1500 at the Guangdong province Games.
</P>
<P>
Cindy O'krane of Canada took the bronze medal at 4:49 and the
silver medal went to New Zealander Toni Hodgkinson clocked 4:38.

finished fifth with 14 seconds lower than her best 4:37.
</P>
<P>
The traditional event, organized by the Hong Kong Athletic
Association, was held in downtown Hong Kong. Forty-one runners
from 13 countries and regions -- Canada, China, India, Indonesia,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Law for Protection of World Cultural Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A local law on protecting the
ancient Chinese city of Pingyao, listed as one of the World
Cultural Heritage sites by the United Nations, has taken effect in
Shanxi Province, north China, Sun Wensheng, governor of the
province and a deputy to the current session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This world cultural heritage site is a property shared by all
the mankind, and we have the obligation to protect it well," Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ancient City of Pingyao, located at the center of Shanxi
Province, is home to the most complete ancient city walls in China
and dwelling houses, stores, streets, temples, government offices
of the 17th to 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
China's first bank note also originated from this city.
</P>
<P>
It was included in the World Cultural Heritage by the
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization of the UN in
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, deputies to the provincial legislature tabled
a bill to protect the ancient city in 1998, and was approved by
the provincial lawmaking body on November 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The national and local governments of China and the UNESCO
China Office have invested more than 200 million yuan (about 25.3
million U.S. dollars) for the rehabilitation and restoration of
the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
The town now has a population of more than 40,000, and its
infrastructure facilities are backward.

<HEADLINE> China's Holiday Travel Brings Larger Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's holiday season started Feb.1 and ended March 12.
This period is always extremely hectic. According to the State
Economic and Trade Commission, the railways carried 123 million
people, roads handled 1.397 billion people, and airlines carried 6.
65 million people.
</P>
<P>
Railways and airlines both had double-digit increases from last
year. The peak came 5 days before Chinese lunar new year on Feb.
16 and broke records. More people were traveling because they have
more money on hand and the week-long holiday was an ideal time to
visit families or scenic sites.
</P>
<P>
Travel for the first two weeks was flat because Chinese New
Year came relatively late this year and people didn't want to
combine the Chinese and Western new year holidays because they
were too far apart.

<HEADLINE> Science, Education Key to Development of Central, Western Regions: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
today urged China's central and western regions to seek
development through scientific and educational advancement.
</P>
<P>
"Top priority should be given to science and education if the
central and western regions want to speed up their economic
development," Li said here this morning during a panel discussion
with deputies from the northwest China province of Gansu to the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature in
session here since March 5.
</P>
<P>
As China is carrying out a strategy of invigorating the country
through science and education, both the central, western regions
and the better-developed eastern coastal regions are faced with
the same opportunities, said Li, also a Standing Committee member
of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures must be taken to speed up the
industrialization of various scientific and technical research
achievements, so as to enable all scientific and technological
personnel to give full play to their talents and knowledge, and
contribute to the local economic development, he urged.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed the importance of reforming the
existing educational system and making active efforts to promote
an educational mode that aims at improving the comprehensive
qualities of the students. Party's policy on education must be
carried out in a comprehensive way and efforts should be made to
train all-round developed talents, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
"While striving to teach the students more knowledge and
enhance their cultural and ethic progress, we must pay equal
attention to improving the students' physical fitness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his worries about a tendency of body height
decrease and eyesight deterioration among the average students in
China's primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for a person without a healthy physique to be
of great use to the country," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Before Li speaking, several Gansu deputies voiced their
opinions on amendments to the Constitution and other issues like
education, tourism, protection of cultural relics and
industrialization of scientific and technical research
achievements.

<HEADLINE> Israel Considering Release of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel is considering to
release some Palestinian "security prisoners" in honor of the
Muslim feast of Sacrifice later this month, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking after the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu
denied a report of local daily Yediot Aharonot, which said on
Sunday that Israel has agreed to free some 100 Palestinians by the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that Israel has changed its position over
the release of Palestinian "security prisoners" and agreed to free
those Palestinians who have wounded but have not killed Israelis
in terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu stressed that there is no change in
the position of the Israeli government on the matter and that
Israel will not release those who wounded Israelis.
</P>
<P>
According to the interim peace agreement signed by Israel and
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) last October, Israel
should release 750 Palestinian political prisoners by the end of
January, 1999 in three phases.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli government suspended the implementation of the
agreement last December after releasing 250 Palestinian criminal
prisoners in the first phase, alleging that the PNA had not met
Israel's demands on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On January 19, Israel released 30 Palestinian prisoners as a
goodwill gesture in honor of the Eid al-Fitr, the festive Muslim
holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. And most of
those freed were serving time for minor anti-Israel crimes.

<HEADLINE> London's Lloyd Linked to U.S. "Gangster Scam" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- City of London police are
investigating an elaborate multi-million pound fraud to establish
whether U.S. organized crime syndicates have infiltrated the Lloyd'
s insurance market, according to the BBC report on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fifty detectives from the fraud squad involved in a joint
Anglo-American investigation, code-named Operation Chain, raiding
several brokers' firms both in and outside London. No arrests or
charges have been made so far, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The alleged fraud is thought to involve bogus insurance
companies, registered offshore in the Caribbean, which offer cover
to aviation and shipping firms and the governments of developing
countries against losses due to natural disasters, air crashes and
shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
Detectives are investigating claims that the companies rent
property and other assets from legitimate firms in order to give
the impression that they have the resources to pay multi-million
pound claims.
</P>
<P>
Premiums are collected but when a large claim is made, the
bogus company is allegedly liquidated, leaving clients unprotected
and out of pocket.
</P>
<P>
Detective Superintendent Ken Farrow, head of the City of
London fraud squad, said the complex fraud involved "asset rental,
" where balance sheets are bolstered by "borrowing" or renting
property or shares from legitimate firms.
</P>
<P>
One Lloyds source, quoted in the Sunday Times newspaper which
revealed the alleged scam, said: "It is difficult to assess the
size of the problem but it could easily top 100 million pounds (
160 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"These people are highly organized criminals who are using
Lloyd's for their own nefarious purposes," the source said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sets New Guidelines for Bus Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- In response to complaints from the
riding public, the Philippine government will soon come up with
new guidelines for bus operators aimed at preventing vehicular
accidents, the Philippines News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Topping the new guidelines is a six-hour limit for bus drivers,
which aims to give drivers a chance to rest and thus reduce the
risk of accidents, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Rivera, secretary of transportation and communications,
was quoted as saying many vehicular accidents happen because
over-fatigued bus drivers tend to lose their concentration after
spending more than six hours behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
He said the lives of passengers depend on the fitness of
drivers so it is important that the fatigue factor is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said the guidelines would include a requirement for bus
drivers to take regular physical and medical examinations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another guideline aims to ban the importation of old
 buses to help minimize air pollution, Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
"Except for those that are already operating here, the
importation of old buses would no longer be allowed," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Wang Zhongyu, who
is in charge of the State Family Planning Commission, said today
that family planning is the key to China's sustained development
and that there should be a harmonious relation between economic
development and population, resource use and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Wang told a national conference on family planning in Beijing
today that every effort should be made to reach the central
government's family planning goals and that grass-roots services
and family planning cadres should be better.
</P>
<P>
These people need to be helped to build a more civilized and
advanced conception of marriage and the family to improve family
planning awareness, Wang said, and that family planning
departments need to co-operate with other departments to help
solve the population problem.
</P>
<P>
China's population will continue to grow rapidly, at about 12
million annually, he said, and that with such great pressure,
China needs strict controls over the next few years and that
family planning services will focus on reducing birth defects,
keep the gender in balance, and solve the problems of an aging
society.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Airways Raises More Fund for UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific Airways raised
more than 3.8 million HK dollars for the U.N. Children's Fund (
UNICEF) during its "Change for Good" inflight fund-raising program
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The airline has now raised a total of 24 million HK dollars for
the program over the past eight years, according to a press
release by the airline.
</P>
<P>
On each of its flights from July to December 1998, Cathay
Pacific distributed envelopes to all passengers, encouraging them
to donate the small change they were carrying to help UNICEF. Many
passengers carry coins in foreign currency that they cannot use at
their destination. UNICEF collects these coins through the Change
for Good program and uses the proceeds to support its social
development programs in 160 developing countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
"An effort like this takes an enormous amount of coordination
from many different organizations and Cathay Pacific is happy to
help in whatever way we can," said Alan Wong, Cathay Pacific's
general manager for Hong Kong and China.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to convey my sincere thanks to all Cathay Pacific
cabin crew, ground staff and overseas-based staff who helped make
Change for Good such a success," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony Sunday, Wong handed over a check for 3.8 million
HK dollars to Chairman of the Hong Kong Committee for UNICEF
Robert Fung.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Reaffirms Sovereignty Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet adopted a
resolution on Jerusalem on Sunday, rejecting the division of
Jerusalem under any circumstances, said a cabinet statement.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is an undivided capital of the Jewish people and
Israel will not agree to its division and internationalization,"
said the resolution submitted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon have
instructed Israeli diplomatic missions in the world to launch an
information campaign on "Israel's sovereignty over a united
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The move came as a response to the European Union's
reaffirmation of its non-acceptance of Israeli rule over all of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The EU was angry last week over Israel's rejection of its
ambassadors in Israel to meet with Palestinian officials at the
Orient House in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The EU ambassadors were to be briefed on the current
development of the peace process by Palestinian officials, but
the meeting was cancelled due to Israel's objection.
</P>
<P>
The Orient House is the actual office of Palestinian National
Authority in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a note sent to Israeli Foreign Ministry last week, German
Ambassador to Israel Theodor Wallau, whose country is holding the
six-month EU presidency, said that the EU does not recognize
Jerusalem to be under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Israel's call for foreign diplomats to stop meeting
with Palestinian officials in East Jerusalem would not be met, the
note said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the note, Sharon sent a message to German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer over the weekend, rejecting
Wallau's note.
</P>
<P>
EU said the Jerusalem issue will be discussed in the
final-status talks stipulated under the 1993 Oslo accords.

XINING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese geologist recently

LAGOS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo has said that there is need to encourage new
investors and to prove to them that there is a new dispensation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters before his departure for Tanzania on
Saturday, General Obasanjo said that part of the agenda of his
worldwide trip is to let the@norld know that all previous
impediments to investment opportunities have been removed.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo who is leading a 12-member delegation on a trip to
African, Asian, European and American countries noted that Nigeria
wants to inform them that the stumbling blocks of the past, like
corruption, security threat to lives and property, will be
removed, the media here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it is only when there is buoyed investment in
the country that the problem of unemployment will be adequately
tackled.
</P>
<P>
"We want to talk to international organizations like the World
Bank, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) about our debt, about
what they can do to assist us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo who has already visited the Republic of Benin this
week as part of his world-wide trip pointed out that those who
went abroad in search of greener pasture or who studied abroad and
have refused to return will be wooed to come back.
</P>
<P>
He is expected back on Thursday to receive the IMF team which
is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria on March 17 for talks on debt

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday accused the
United States and Britain of aggression against rituals of the
Islamic religion by hindering Iraqi pilgrims from performing hadj,
the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry blamed in a statement the U.S. and
Britain of procrastinating and opposing Iraq's demand of using its
frozen assets in the service of pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
During the past three months, on the meetings of the Sanctions
Committee in charge of supervising Iraq's compliance with United
Nations resolutions, the U.S. and Britain have refused remittance
of the frozen assets to Iraq, citing Security Council resolutions
that forbid such remittance, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.S. and Britain adopted such a trend hostile
to Iraq since the first day of Iraq's demand to safeguard its
sovereignty and facilitate Iraqi people's pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
Due to the U.S. and British procrastination, it would be
impossible for Iraq to use the frozen assets for the pilgrimage
even if the Sanctions Committee gives its approval because hadj
starts next week.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt, Labor Agree on Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government and the
Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) have finally reached an agreement on
minimum wage for civil servants in the country, media reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached in capital Abuja Saturday, a new
minimum wage of 3,500 Naira (about 40 U.S. dollars) was fixed for
the civil servants working in federal government while those in
local and state governments will get 3,000 Naira (about 35
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decisions made at a joint meeting between
representatives of the government and the NLC, Labor and
Productivity Minister Emmanuel Udogu said no civil servants would
be retrenched as a result of the new minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
He said that joint committees of government and trade union
representatives at federal, state and local government levels
shall be set up to verify actual strength in every government
agency to eliminate ghost workers.
</P>
<P>
In view of this agreement, the NLC announced that all on-going
strikes in the state and local governments have been called off
while the contemplated nation-wide strike called by the NLC for
March 15 has also been put off.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Saturday's agreement is expected to
restore industrial peace to the civil servants at all levels which
have recently been plagued by strikes in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage crisis began in September last year when the
Nigerian government announced a new minimum wage of 5,200 Naira
(about 60 dollars) for federal civil servants without arrangement
for their counterparts in state and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Anti-China Farce (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- An anti-China farce has been
put on show recently on the Capitol Hill and by some newspapers
here since the New York Times alleged in a report Chinese nuclear
espionage in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The farce came at a time when the Chinese and U.S. governments
were preparing for Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the
United States in April. Zhu's tour, the first of its kind in 15
years, is a follow-up to the exchange of visits between heads of
state of the two countries over the past two years, which had
brought back Sino-U.S. ties onto a sound track.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times story alleged that China started "stealing
nuclear secrets" from the United States in the 80s, and that the "
theft" of classified information from Los Alamos National
Laboratory in the past few years has helped China in "the
miniaturization of its bombs."
</P>
<P>
The article fanned up a hullabaloo among anti-China witch-
hunters on the Capitol Hill and the press. They spared no efforts
to pack the issue into Congress hearings and media discussions as
fresh fodder to step up the smear campaign against China.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, after scrutinizing the event, anyone who has no
prejudice against China will find himself duped, since not even an
ounce of hard evidence has been provided to support the allegation.
The whole story is a complete fabrication.
</P>
<P>
The fabrication of "news" out of political opportunism is an
insult to the motto cherished by the New York Times which says "
all the news that's fit to print." The distortion of facts by a
few Congressmen shows that they are irresponsible in dealing with
serious political matters.
</P>
<P>
The joint maneuver by some people in the Congress and the media
to hype up the "lab-theft" story is not isolated, but complex and
deep-rooted. It shows some people in the United States always feel
uneasy with the sound development of Sino-U.S. relations, and in
particular, they are unwilling to see any progress China makes in
high-technology.
</P>
<P>
This explains well why those people always make use of the "
security" issue as an excuse to defile China and impede the
advancement of Sino-U.S. ties, and to obstruct the export of high-
tech products from the United States to China.
</P>
<P>
Their attempt, however, will not succeed by any means, because
China, whose behavior is open and aboveboard, has never stolen U.S.
nuclear technology and will never do so in the future. With rich
intellectual and material resources at home, China is completely
capable of boosting its high-tech industry through its own efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
China, while stressing self-esteem and independence, has opened
its high-tech market wide to the world, and many developed nations,
other than the United States, are struggling hard to chip in their
high-tech ventures in China. Therefore, restrictions of high-tech
exports to China, as proposed by some Americans, will only reduce
U.S. enterprises' footing in China's high-tech market, harming the
U.S. interests in the long run.
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the nuclear energy cooperation between the
two countries. As early as in 1985, the Chinese and U.S.
governments reached an agreement to cooperate in developing
nuclear energy projects in China. However, U.S. Congress, out of
fear of China's growth in high technology, had refused
consistently to ratify the accord until last year. During this
period of time, China built up several nuclear stations under
joint ventures with French and Russian enterprises, while the U.S.
lost a golden opportunity to exploit China's potential in nuclear
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
The "lab-theft" story, cooked up by anti-China forces in the
United States, is also designed to press the Clinton
administration into giving up its policy of "constructive
engagement" with China. This short-sighted attempt will get
nowhere. In the past few days, U.S. President Bill Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and some
Congressmen voiced their commitment on separate occasions to the
engagement policy, stressing that China has been moving ahead
remarkably in various fields and playing an even greater role in
solving regional and global issues.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of anti-China choir, despite its high pitch,
is not unfamiliar. In Washington, whenever there is a visit by
leaders between China and the United States, there is a crusading
farce against Beijing. Some Americans concocted such stories as "
political donations" and "satellite secrets leakage" just before
exchanges of visit in the past two years. These sensational "news
stories", however, all fizzled out afterwards.
</P>
<P>
What about this time? -- It will be no better.

<HEADLINE> Fire Service Week '99 Begins in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Fire Service and Civil Defense
Week '99 began in Bangladesh Sunday with a view to ensuring
cooperation and participation of people by creating public
awareness about preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
In his message issued on the eve of the occasion, President
Shahabuddin Ahmed hoped that the government service institution
would work in close cooperation with the people to achieve its
purpose.
</P>
<P>
"People should be made conscious of devastation of fire
incidents and ways and means of resistance to fire to make the
observance of the week a success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in her message, called upon fire
fighters and civil defense workers to carry out their humanitarian
service with sincerity and honesty. She also called for increased
public awareness against fire and other accidents.
</P>
<P>
Activities in the week include demonstration of fire fighting
and rescue operation and distribution of information about damage
caused by fire.
</P>
<P>
Fire incidents across the country caused damage to property
worth 1.98 billion taka (about 40.8 million U.S. dollars) during
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 fire incidents originating from electric short
circuit and oven took place during the period, fire officials
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 123 fire stations under the Fire Service
and Civil Defense Directorate, but most of them have been
functioning with outdated and dilapidated fire-fighting vehicles
procured in the 1960s, they observed.

<HEADLINE> PM: Lebanon Maintains Right to Resistance Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
stressed on Sunday that resistance against Israeli occupation of
south Lebanon is a legitimate right for the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio over telephone
from Beirut, Hoss said that Israel's daily attacks on south
Lebanon will never compel the country to halt support for the
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanon's Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese resistance forces led by Hezbollah (Party of God) have
ever since been waging a war of attrition in an effort to drive
the Israeli troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces have been shelling towns and villages bordering
the so-called security zone in what the Jewish state said a
retaliation for the continued attacks on its patrols.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister ruled out the possibility that
Israel would launch a large scale military action against Lebanon
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Hoss maintained that Israel's repeated aggression is aimed at
forcing Lebanon to hold unilateral and direct talks with it,
driving a wedge between Lebanon and Syria in their peace talks
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility that Israel would have its way.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed last year that it would pull back from Lebanon
if the Lebanese government agrees to reach security arrangements
with it for the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have rejected the offer, insisting that the
withdrawal be unconditional under the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425 adopted after Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Minister Meeting Debates Spending Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers Sunday started debates on the controversial spending
reforms, dubbed the Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
The package includes the EU budget, farm subsidies and
structural aid which will flow mainly to poorer southern member
countries.
</P>
<P>
As the current EU president, Germany has set a March 24-25
summit in Berlin as the deadline for approving the entire package,
according to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
A farm spending compromise was agreed last Thursday but
diplomats said there were likely to be further talks on how to
slash agriculture spending as farm ministers overshot prescribed
average annual farm spending of 44.6 billion U.S. dollars for the
2000-2006 period.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers, meeting in the Rhine River town of Eltville,
would also focus on finding a formula to set the EU budget for the
same period.
</P>
<P>
Current EU financial arrangements expire at the end of this
year. Germany, which pays a net annual amount of 12.2 billion
dollars to the EU, is demanding to cut its budget contribution.
</P>
<P>
Southern member countries, such as Spain, Portugal and Greece,
as well as Ireland, want the structural and cohesion fund aid to
remain at the current levels. But northern countries, like Germany,
are calling for cuts.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, setting aid levels is expected to be the other key
disputed issue at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded on Sunday during Israeli shelling on a village in south
Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying the casualties
were caused when Israeli artillery units pounded the village of
Hadath on the verge of the Israeli occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardment, which targeted Hezbollah guerrillas'
hideouts, also led to the damage of three civilians' houses and
three cars, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lebanese guerrillas of the Hezbollah, or Party of God,
attacked a nearby Israeli outpost at Biet Yahoun with machine guns
and grenades. Hezbollah is reportedly backed by Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that their attacks inflicted
heavy casualties on Israeli soldiers manning the outpost. But
there is no independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim of protecting its
north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to evict Israeli occupation forces
and its ally South Lebanon Army from the area.

<HEADLINE> Albania Opposes Proposal for Balkan Regional Meeting on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Albania has voiced opposition
against a proposal for a regional meeting of Balkan foreign
ministers on the Kosovo issue next Monday, the date set for the
resumption of Kosovo peace talks in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo, at a press conference
here Saturday jointly held with his visiting Bulgarian counterpart
Nadezhda Mikhailova, affirmed that Tirana cannot support such a
proposal, saying it would constitute "a challenge to Rambouillet",
where Serbians and Kosovo Albanians had been engaged in tough
talks last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Greece Foreign Minister George Papandreou,
on a brief visit to Albania, said Milo had accepted a Greece
proposal to hold the Balkan regional meeting next Monday and then
to issue a joint statement on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Milo said Albania was "disturbed to see latest
attempts to drag Belgrade into a peace deal other than the
Rambouillet package by offering certain compromise."
</P>
<P>
"We think it's wrong. Such a deal would be a bad and short-
sighted one which would prolong the conflicts for months and would
not lay any foundation for a long-term solution to the problem."
</P>
<P>
Serbian and ethnic Albanian representatives are due to be in
France next Monday to reopen their negotiations on a peace deal
that provides for far-reaching autonomy for Kosovo province as
well as NATO military presence to supervise the deal.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's New Budget Attaches Importance to Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's new budget will allocate 4
billion Egyptian pounds (1.18 billion U.S. dollars) for higher
education in the fiscal year of 1999-2000, the Egyptian Gazette
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a symposium Saturday on investment opportunities in
the bourse, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research
Mofeed Shehab said the figure is 3.72 billion pounds (1.09 billion
dollars) more than the annual expenditure in this regard in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"The budget increase comes within the government's interest to
cope with the latest technological developments and raise the
education level to confront challenges of the 21st century,"
Shehab was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian universities are considering amending their
curricula to enhance the students' future role in the development
of their society, an issue which motivated his ministry to prepare
a new law and new curricula for higher education, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure rise for higher education reflects the idea of
the Egyptian government to attach importance to the social
services.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Finance Minister Mohi Eddin Al-Gharib has said the
budget for the new fiscal year starting on July 1 takes into
consideration the social dimension and supports education and
health services.
</P>
<P>
The budget should be approved by Egypt's People's Assembly
(Parliament) before the end of May.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches New Offensive: Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian troops launched a
large- scale offensive against Eritrea on the Tsorona flank of the
Alitiena-Mereb front Sunday. The attack started at 8:00 a.m,
according to a release by Eritrean Foreign Ministry available here
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The release said as a prelude to Sunday's large-scale attack,
the Ethiopian forces carried out aerial bombings and heavy
artillery shellings in the environs of these area Saturday
afternoon from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry once again said that "Ethiopia's
Prime Minister had informed the ambassadors accredited to his
country on Monday, March 8, that his government will launch
another offensive against Eritrea before the weekend."
</P>
<P>
The release said that the Sunday attack by Ethiopia is in
defiance of the U.N. Security Council call on March 4 urging
Ethiopia to stop its continued military action and Ethiopia has
also "openly reneged on its earlier acceptance of the Framework
Agreement" of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ethiopia charged that Eritrea's declared acceptance of
the OAU agreement was "bogus and was designed to buy time" and
demanded its "immediate and unconditional retreat from all our
territories" before peace talks could start.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the horn of Africa neighbors resumed on
February 6 in the Badme area after an eight-month lull and
subsequently spread to two other fronts.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Probe Criminal Funds in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Police Intelligence
Department and international crime squad are investigating
financial aids from criminal sources to political parties
campaigning for the coming elections, a local daily said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sidbon, head of the police's criminal investigations
department, said both local and foreign crime bosses are involved
in the election fund-raising, the Ha'aretz reported.
</P>
<P>
The police has already collected considerable information on
the involvement of foreign crime syndicates, including Russian's,
in large "donations" to various Israeli parties running in the
elections in order to exert influence on Israeli political system,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators are trying to make out whether some of
the money has reached members of the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Once police intelligence experts have analyzed the information,
Sidbon will decide whether to order the international crime squad
to launch a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
In light of the experience from recent municipal elections, the
police have set up a special team to deal with key issues relating
to the present election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The team, which had already met twice, consists of
attorney-generals and representatives of both the police and the
state prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the possibility that violence could increase as the
election day draws near, Sidbon said that if the police do not
provide a tough law enforcement in short order, it may get caught
unprepared in an outburst of violence in the heat of the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Special police teams have been deployed at all police stations
to deal with crimes such as illegal propaganda, violent behavior
of voters and party activists, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli voters will choose both their prime minister and
Knesset members in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the votes in the
first round of elections for the prime minister, a run-off is set
for June 1.
</P>
<P>
Major political parties, such as the Likud led by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the opposition Labor led by Ehud
Barak, have already finished their parties' shake-ups for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Barak, along with the Center party leader
Yitzhak Mordechai and the right-wing Herut party leader Benny
Begin, are entering the race for the premiership.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Build More Roads to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
give priority to the building of more roads to boost economic
development and ease traffic, a government news release said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Medalla, director-general of the National Economic and
Development Authority, was quoted as saying that these road
networks would help the people, especially those in the
countryside, feel the effects of economic progress.
</P>
<P>
He said many islands in the country have roads that follow the
coastline, but do not link neighboring provinces, thus preventing
many people from working together.
</P>
<P>
That is the reason that a key part of the development plan is
the building of roads, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government at the same time also plans to expand
its mass transport systems to help address the problem of traffic
congestion in Manila, the capital city.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Start Students Summer Job Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
kick off its annual summer job program for students nationwide
this month in an effort to generate jobs and combat poverty, a
government news release said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Employment Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma was quoted
as saying that the regional offices of his department are now
conducting preparatory activities for the program that would start
on March 24 and end on May 28.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to support underprivileged students so they
could finance their own education," he said.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma added that the department is also eyeing long-term job
arrangements for working students, particularly those from poor
families, as part of the government's pro-poor thrusts.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said his office is now coordinating with local
governments for the summer job program using a cost-sharing
scheme.
</P>
<P>
While the department shoulders 40 percent of the costs for the
program, the local governments and its partners shoulder the
remaining 60 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for working students, Laguesma said that in the past, they
were only able to secure summer jobs for one semester due to the
lack of funds to bankroll such program.
</P>
<P>
"There should be some continuity in the program so that the
only way students can drop out of the program is that their living
standards have really improved," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Appeals for Urgent Funds for Hunger-Stricken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRBOI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) said
Sunday that it is urgent need for donor contributions to feed over
one million Tanzanians suffering from severe food shortage.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not receive additional funds to mount this aid
operation soon, we'll see the onset of malnutrition and other
hunger-related diseases which may ultimately cost human lives,"
WFP's country Director Irene Lacy said in a release distributed
by the WFP Nairobi Office here.
</P>
<P>
Due to severe crop failure in Tanzania, WFP needs to distribute
food immediately to 1.14 million people in 12 regions of the
country, but a recent appeal to donors for 20,000 tons of food
aid, valued at some eight million U.S. dollars, raised only half
of the need amount, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three months, WFP plans to oversee an emergency
 distribution of 29,000 tons of food in partnership with the
Tanzanian government and other non-governmental agencies. The
government of Tanzania has pledged 9,000 tons of food while the
rest is to be raised by WFP.
</P>
<P>
The release said WFP has decided to use one million dollars from
its immediate response account to purchase 2,600 tons of food to
those communities most at risk.
</P>
<P>
The United States has donated two million dollars, while
Denmark has pledged 800,000 dollars and Spain has committed
230,000 dollars, thus leaving WFP with a 50 percent shortfall of
over 4 million dollars, the release said..
</P>
<P>
According to the release, WFP is facing funding shortage for
its other emergency programs in Tanzania and is currently short
of money for its refugee operation which feeds about 340,000
refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
If pledges are not received for this operation soon, WFP would
be forced to reduce recipients' rations in the coming weeks, the
release said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Sets New Terms for Peace: Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government has put
forth new preconditions in order to reject the framework agreement
put forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and block
the achievement of peace with Asmara, the Eritrean Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a statement here Saturday
it is clear that "Ethiopia is deliberately distorting the
framework agreement and reading from a new script in order to
torpedo the prospects of peace."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry said that the Ethiopian government
maintains in its Friday statement that any demilitarization can
only take place when Eritrea met three conditions.
</P>
<P>
The conditions require Eritrea to withdraw immediately and
unconditionally from all the Ethiopian territories it has been
occupying since May 6, 1998, accept the reinstatement of ethiopian
civilian administration in these areas, and bear full
responsibility for the loss of lives, the humanitarian crisis and
the destruction of property that has resulted from its
"aggression".
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are not to be found anywhere in the OAU
framework agreement, to which Ethiopia had earlier acknowledged
its solemn acceptance," the Eritrean foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea has never occupied or claimed any Ethiopian sovereign
territory.

It cannot therefore be asked to withdraw from territory it has not
occupied or claimed," the statement said, apparently referring to
the areas other than the disputed Badme region.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accused the ethiopian government of changing heart,
saying that the OAU high-level delegation on January 26 informed
the Eritrean government that "Ethiopia has indicated that it will
submit its claims when the issues of delimitation, demarcation
and, if need be, arbitration are addressed. "
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea has consistently been asking the OAU to demand that
Ethiopia make known the totality of its claims," the foreign
ministry statement said, adding that "Ethiopia has adamantly
refused to do so in the past."
</P>
<P>
It termed the Ethiopia's claim that "Eritrea must bear full
responsibility for the consequences of the war" as too "ludicrous"
to merit serious response.
</P>
<P>
"It is Ethiopia which bears full responsibility for the war and
its consequences," the statement declared.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eritrea's Permanent Representative to the United
Nations, Haile Menkerios, Friday sent a letter entitled "Issues
Raised by the Eritrean Side Requesting Clarification" to Qin
Huasun, President of the current U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Haile expressed his wishes to draw the attention of the council
to the clarity of the answers from the OAU regarding the
definition of the "environs" of Badme and "re-deployment".
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Eritrea charged that "Ethiopia attempts to
misinterpret and revise the OAU framework and design to continue
to use force against Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ethiopia charged that Eritrea's declared acceptance of
the OAU agreement was "bogus and was designed to buy time" and
demanded its "immediate and unconditional retreat from all the
territories" before peace talks could start.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Exports Down By 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite the devaluation of the
local currency and the reintroduction of a string of export
incentives, Zimbabwe's exports went down by 16 percent in 1998,
the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Last year the devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar by 60
percent against a basket of other major currencies presented huge
export opportunities.
</P>
<P>
This should have made local products competitive on the
regional and international markets, the Sunday paper quoted
Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Leonard Tsumba as saying.
</P>
<P>
But this never happened as exports continued declining, Tsumba
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, total exports fell by 14 percent to 1.99 billion U.S.
dollars compared with 2.3 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some economists attribute the country's poor export performance
to poor commodity prices on the international markets, weak
domestic capacity to open and maintain export markets, and poor
performance by some key industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The international finance situation which started in Asia is
now being felt here and this has dampened the demand for our
exports," said chief executive of Zimbabwe's export promotion body
Zimtrade, Freddy Chawasarira.

<HEADLINE> China Spends More on Residential Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China increased its investment in
residential buildings remarkably last year in a bid to improve the
people's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that
such investment last year reached 212 billion yuan (25.6 billion U.
S. dollars), a growth of 24 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
China's total investment in real estate development in 1998
amounted to 358 billion yuan (43.2 billion dollars), up 12.6
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
With the boom in housing construction, Chinese building
materials factories produced 513.6 million tons of cement and 172
million cases of plate glass last year, a rise of 6.8 percent and
7.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
As one of the countermeasures to boost demand in the home
market facing lingering Asian economic crisis, the Chinese
government has set to increase investment in the construction of
infrastructures, including residential housing and related
projects across the country.

<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
setting up regional monitoring teams to ensure the implementation
of the national food security agenda, the Philippines News Agency
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Interior and Local Government is putting up
monitoring teams based in its regional offices to keep tabs on the
food security programs of the various local government units, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has instructed the
department to provide technical assistance to provincial governors
in establishing provincial councils on food security monitoring,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has also called for the creation of a national council
on food security, which will help oversee the activities of the
provincial councils, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Department of Interior and Local Government
were quoted as saying that they are mobilizing the department's
regional offices to ensure that all provinces organize their food
councils and make them operational.
</P>
<P>
Last January, a majority of the country's governors submitted
to Estrada a food security covenant committing their full support
to the government's centerpiece program on agricultural
modernization and food security.

<HEADLINE> Hot Spell Affects Normal Life in Northern Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A hot spell has affected the normal
life of people in Bangladesh's northern region, press reports said
Sunday, quoting sources of the Met Office.
</P>
<P>
The maximum temperature of 37.0 degrees Celsius was recorded on
March 8 at Rajshahi, 204 km northwest of Dhaka, and the
temperature will continue to rise in the region, they said.
</P>
<P>
The continued hot spell in the region has seriously affected
the cultivation of rice and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
There has been no rainfall for a long time, and as a result,
about 60 percent of the ponds, hundreds of lakes and canals as
well as small rivers in eight districts have already dried up
since the beginning of the dry season (December-March).
</P>
<P>
Besides, the level of water of the major rivers like Padma,
Jamuna, Brahmaputra, Gorai and Teesta has also fallen sharply, and
a lot of pumps have become inoperative as a result.
</P>
<P>
The people living in the region are suffering from want of
drinking water, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The standing rice crops are facing a serious setback due to the
hot spell, since some 100,000 tubewells in the region have become
inoperative with the onset of the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is now experiencing an unusually dry spell which
began last December, weather experts said.
</P>
<P>
Southerly wind which causes rain is obstructed by "sub-tropical
reach" due to which the expected moisture is not coming from the
Bay of Bengal, the deputy director at the Storm Warning center of
the Met Office explained recently.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry, which
is under an overhaul, witnessed a decline in production in 1998,
according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The output of yarn dropped 1.8 percent to 5.2 million tons from
1997, and that of cloth fell 3.3 percent to 17.9 billion meters.
</P>
<P>
Of the total cloth production, pure cotton cloth declined 5.6
percent to 8.5 billion meters, cotton and chemical fiber blend
went down 4.4 percent to 6.1 billion meters, while pure chemical
fiber grew 5.9 percent to 3.2 billion meters.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 also saw a decline in the production of knitting
wool and woolen piece goods. The output of knitting wool decreased
13 percent to 307,000 tons and that of woolen piece goods dropped
8.9 percent to 267.8 million meters.
</P>
<P>
The output of silk also fell 6.6 percent to 67,700 tons.
</P>

industry since early last year, cutting outmoded spindles for both
cotton and wool spinning.

BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's output of timber in 1998
declined 3.5 percent as against that of 1997, according to the

</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that the output of timber last year totaled

In 1998, the production of saw wood dropped 9.1 percent on a

BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The production of household
electrical appliances grew steadily in China in 1998, according to
the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The output of color TV sets last year hit 35 million, surging
33.2 percent over 1997, and that of video recorders hit 3.3

<P>
Among other major household electrical appliances, washing
machines dropped 2.9 percent to 12.1 million, while refrigerators
edged up 1.5 percent to 10.1 million.
</P>
<P>
China has taken measures to stimulate domestic demand in a bid
to mitigate the impact of the lingering Asian financial crisis.
Its ongoing anti-smuggling drive has promoted sales of China-made

<HEADLINE> 150,000 Bosnian Refugees to Be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 150,000 Bosnian
refugees will be repatriated in 1999 in line with a repatriation
plan drawn up earlier by the Bosnian government, a senior refugee
affairs official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 150,000 refugees, 90,000 are minorities in their pre-war
residing places and one-third of them will be repatriated to
Sarajevo, capital of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the chief
of the Bosnian refugee repatriation commission told a forum on the
refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
At a forum underway in a western Bosnian city, Bosnian Vice
President Kresimir Zubak said that this year's repatriation target
must be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord reached earlier by the Bosnian Serbs, Croats
and Muslims, the three former rival parties should immediately
start to repatriate 6,000 minority refugee families to the cities
of Sarajevo, Banja Luka and Mostar held respectively by the
Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Since the Dayton peace agreement took effect in 1995, 475,000
refugees have been sent back to the Muslim-Croat Federation and
100,000 refugees have returned to the Serbs' Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina. At present, more than 1.2 million Bosnian refugees
are yet to be repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement that ended the four years of Bosnian
war in 1995, Bosnia was divided into two entities -- one Serb and
the other a Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
The slow repatriation of minority refugees as a result of
nationalism has become a stumbling-block to the implementation of
the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Dayton accord, 80,000 refugees should have
returned to their former residing places, but only half of them
had been sent back that year.
</P>
<P>
The international community has repeatedly urged the three
parties to earnestly carry out their commitments specified in the
accord and step up a repatriation process, especially for those
minority refugees.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Remains Largest Exporter of Tea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka maintained its position
as the world's largest exporter of tea last year, edging out Kenya
despite a record harvest in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka continues as the largest exporter having shipped 271
million kilos to over 40 countries," the official Sunday Observer
quoted brokers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenya came second having shipped 264 million kilos and India a
distant third with an estimated 205 million kilos of exports, its
highest since 1990, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's black tea output was a record 280 million kilos
while Kenya's crops were 294 million kilos, it said.
</P>
<P>
India was the world's biggest producer with 867 million kilos
but her exports are restricted because of the huge and growing
domestic market which absorbed about 650 million kilos last year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan domestic consumption is around 25-30 million kilos a
year while Kenya's is insignificant, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Kenya's export figure for 1998 is unusually low
considering its record harvest.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Govt Not to Cling to Power for Longer Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar military government
has no intention to hold on to power for a long time, said
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, one of Myanmar's top leaders.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, made the remarks here Saturday when meeting
with a visiting delegation of the U.S.-based Young Presidents'
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military government took over the power of state in
September 1988.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of drafting a new constitution. The
National Convention to draft the guidelines for the constitution
has completed more than 50 percent of its work and once the
constitution is promulgated, the Armed Forces will definitely
transfer power to the constitutional government that will lead the
country in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military government sponsored a Multi-Party
Democracy General Election in May 1990, in which the National
League for Democracy won a landslide victory with 396
parliamentary seats out of 485.
</P>
<P>
Later in January 1993, the military government started holding
a National Convention, aimed at drawing up a new state
constitution. The NLD walked out of the convention in November
1995 and the session of the convention has been in recess since
March 1996.

<HEADLINE> China to Fly Business Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Fueled by growing demand for
business trips by air, China is working on more practical measures
to promote the development of general aviation for business travel.
</P>
<P>
"We shall persist, as always, in making the rules and
regulations and managerial measures conform more to the
characteristics of business aviation in terms of operation
administration, flight standards, ground support and airworthiness
management to push forward its healthy development," today's "
China Daily" quoted Shen Yuankang, deputy director of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were only about 200 flights in and out of China
by business aircraft, but in 1997 business flights in and out of
Beijing Capital International Airport alone numbered more than 1,
000.
</P>
<P>
"But compared to the existing demand, the sector is still in
its embryonic stage," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing often hosts important international activities, and it
has more than 10,000 foreign enterprises, over 6,000 offices of
foreign companies and a batch of embassies.
</P>
<P>
"If ten percent of them use business aircraft, the market will
be four times larger than the existing scale," said Zhang Zhizhong,
director of the air transport department of CAAC.
</P>
<P>
"Given China's current gross domestic product and projected
growth, we anticipate that the fleet in China has the potential to
be as large as 200 to 300 business jets in the long term," said
Joe Walker, senior vice-president of Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear there would be many Chinese customers for
helicopters," said Elizabeth Keck, senior representative of the US-
based FAA Beijing office.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rak Thai Party Receives Biggest Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The newly-founded Thai Rak Thai
(Thais Love Thais) Party is the top receiver of cash donations
totaling 33.2 million baht (897,297 U.S. dollars) in less than a
year, the Bangkok Post Sunday quoted the Election Commission of
Thailand (ECT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The party, founded by Thai telecommunication tycoon Thaksin
Shinawatra, has received this amount of donation since its launch
about seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the Democrat Party, the core party of the
ruling coalition, which raked in 6.3 million baht (170,270
dollars) from June 1998 to February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Declaration of cash donations by political parties is in line
with the country's Political Party Act, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, it is unlawful for political parties to receive
donations from foreign individuals or organizations.
</P>
<P>
So far, Thai Rak Thai, the Democrat, Chart Pattana Party,
Palang Dharma Party and Chart Prachatipatai Party have already
reported their amount of contributions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 political parties has applied for subsidies from
the ECT's 108 million baht (2.9 million dollars) budget.
</P>
<P>
Other parties have until May to present their projects to
guarantee their money which is expected to be handed out in July.

<HEADLINE> Gold Output Growth to Decelerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's gold industry has begun
an overall restructuring process this year at the cost of a
slowdown in output growth.
</P>
<P>
Gold output is planned to reach 175 tons this year, up only 1.5
percent from 1998, in contrast to an average annual growth rate of
ten percent since 1974, the Gold Bureau was quoted by today's "
China Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the industry reflects the consequences of
dealing with major problems that have accumulated for decades
under the central planning system, but its timing is unfortunate
owing to the perceived need for bigger gold stocks to reduce the
financial risks inherent in the country's heavy reliance on the US
dollar in its foreign reserves, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The industry has to shift its operational mode from speed to
efficiency, which will benefit its development in the long run,
said Liu Shan'en, deputy director of the Gold Economic Development
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
In order to survive the market-oriented economy and gain
further development, gold enterprises should pay more attention to
improving exploration technologies and re-organize themselves to
cut costs and realize economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
Now there are over 1,200 mines across China, many of which are
instances of low-level duplication that waste resources.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices on the international market are at a 20-year low,
and the strong renminbi has also contributed to a 15 percent price
reduction in China compared to the price in 1993. As a result,
greater exploitation of gold resources is not financially viable
at present.

<HEADLINE> Computer Sales to Recover in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Computer sales in China are
expected to recover this year after a decline in 1998, according
to today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The computer market would rise 13.2 percent to 175 billion yuan
(21.1 billion U.S.dollars) this year and go up a further 20
percent in 2000, the Center of Computer and Microelectronics
Industry Development (CCID) of the Ministry of Information
predicted.
</P>
<P>
China's computer industry witnessed a dramatic drop in sales
growth last year, from 27.4 percent to 13.9 percent, according to
CCID's latest report.
</P>
<P>
The hardware sector suffered a drop in sales growth from 24.4
percent to 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Personal computer sales grew 16.6 percent, compared to 66.7
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chunlu, vice-director of CCID, attributed the decline in
growth to radical administrative restructuring and reforms of
state enterprises last year.
</P>
<P>
"Group purchasing has been the top factor in the domestic
computer market, but the situation abruptly changed last year,"
said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The weak domestic demand also resulted in falling imports of
computer-related products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
CCID's report said imports dropped 39.2 percent to 2.69 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the software business achieved growth of 23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales by the information service sector also grew 26.4 percent,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The leading domestic personal computer manufacturers began to
enter the software development sector last year.
</P>
<P>
Legend Group was typical of this drive. The company poured 9
million dollars into King Sun Software last year while conducting
co-operative software projects with IMB, Oracle, Lotus and
Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
The software sector could expect rapid development this year
after gaining strong government support in terms of policies and
finance, an insider said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lidong, a senior analyst at CCID, suggested the personal
computer makers should focus on family users this year since group
purchasing is unlikely to recover to its previous level in the
short term.

COLOMBO -- Sri Lanka maintained its position as the world's
largest exporter of tea last year, edging out Kenya despite a
record harvest in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka continues as the largest exporter having shipped 271
million kilos to over 40 countries," the official Sunday Observer
quoted brokers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenya came second having shipped 264 million kilos and India a
distant third with an estimated 205 million kilos of exports, its
highest since 1990, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's black tea output was a record 280 million kilos
while Kenya's crops were 294 million kilos, it said.
</P>
<P>
India was the world's biggest producer with 867 million kilos
but her exports are restricted because of the huge and growing
domestic market which absorbed about 650 million kilos last year.

HELSINKI -- Finland's trade surplus hit a record high of 57
billion Finnish markka (about 10.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998,
with exports and imports respectively totaling 229 billion markka
and 172 billion markka (42.4 billion and 31.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The latest State Customs statistics attributed the surge of
trade surplus to the leap of both high-tech electronic product
exports and the exports to other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that Finnish exports to European Union (EU)
countries rose 3 percent last year, with the exports to the euro
zone states such as France, the Netherlands and Germany growing 30
percent, 19 percent and 14 percent respectively. Exports to the EU
and non-EU areas accounted for up 56 percent and 20 percent
respectively. (Finland-Trade Surplus)

OTTAWA -- Canada Announced Friday that it scored victory at the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in a long-standing trade dispute
with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has ruled in Canada's favor on eight o ten points, and
has declared that PROEX, a Brazilian export program, is a
prohibited export subsidy that must be withdrawn without delay,
according to a release issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs
and International Trade.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruled that Brazil did not meet conditions that grant
developing nations more time than developed nations to remove
prohibited export subsidies such as PROEX. The harmful effects of
PROEX have been most evident in the aerospace sector. Under the
program, foreign purchasers of Brazilian exports benefit from
payments that reduce financing costs to levels that undercut the
market. (Canada-Brazil)

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Wants Good Relations With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, as a developing nation,
wants good relations with the United States and other Western
powers, one of Myanmar's top leaders said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council, made the remarks during a meeting with a
visiting delegation of the U.S.-based Young Presidents'
Organization here Saturday, the New Light of Myanmar reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, the relations with these nations have been
marked by friendship and goodwill," he said, expressing the belief
that the current state of affairs is temporary and is the result
of misunderstanding and misperceptions.
</P>
<P>
He deeply regretted the U.S. unilateral introduction of
sanctions which, he said, are not in the interest of either
Myanmar or the U.S. itself, adding that the impact is minimal,
benefiting none of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before the Myanmar military government came to power in late
1988, the U.S. government supported the country's drug eradication
efforts by providing 86 million U.S. dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
After 1988, however, the U.S. and the European Union withdrew
all their aid to Myanmar including that for narcotic drug control.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, the U.S. imposed an economic sanction on Myanmar
along with an arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S., together with some European countries,
boycotted the Interpol-sponsored Fourth International Heroin
Conference in Yangon.

BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- In July 1998 when the China
Petrochemical Industry Group Company was founded under a
government program to streamline the petro-chemical industry, it
also took over a total of 2.5 billion yuan in debts of the company
members.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a series of major reform measures, the company not
only turned around the debts but also made a profit of 3.47
billion yuan at the end of the year, according to Zhang Jiaren,
deputy general manager of this petro-chemical giant of the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, together with a large number of business executives
from the state sector, are here attending the current session of
the Ninth National People's Congress, China's top lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
Zhang explained that the major reforms measures included a bold
change of both business and management systems with production
centering closely on the domestic and world resources and
commodities markets.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Company, the second largest of
its kind in China, is a case in point. The company invested 20
billion yuan in the past five years and developed a good number of
special technology-intensive and high value-added products, which
were ordered by seven large projects, according to Liu Benren,
general manager of the company.
</P>
<P>
Chen Weirong, general manager of the Konca Group, a leading
household electrical appliance manufacturer and a successful
international market pioneer in China, said that state firms
should develop their domestic market with products that are in
demand of consumers, and their international market with hi-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
The company's monthly sale of digital TV sets it developed last
year topped 20,000 units in the United States, and its 1998 sales
revenue reached 10.5 billion yuan, up 35 percent over the 1997
figure, he said.
</P>
<P>
State firms, which boast good equipment and a strong contingent
of technicians, can be outstanding in the national economy, and
they failed to play their due role because they lacked experience
to operate under a market economy. Overstaff and poor competition
were also to blame, Zhang Jiaren, the executive of the petro-
chemcial giant, said.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises are experiencing a profound reform and will
take off again at a higher starting point, the Konca general
manager said, adding that Chinese state companies are fully
capable to take part in the international competition in hi-tech
field.

<HEADLINE> Finland's Trade Surplus Hit Record High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Finland's trade surplus hit a
record high of 57 billion Finnish markka (about 10.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, with exports and imports respectively totaling
229 billion markka and 172 billion markka (42.4 billion and 31.9
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The latest State Customs statistics attributed the surge of
trade surplus to the leap of both high-tech electronic product
exports and the exports to other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that Finnish exports to European Union (EU)
countries rose 3 percent last year, with the exports to the euro
zone states such as France, the Netherlands and Germany growing 30
percent, 19 percent and 14 percent respectively. Exports to the EU
and non-EU areas accounted for up 56 percent and 20 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sales of high-tech electronic goods abroad, including Nokia
mobile phones and network systems, jumped more than 20 percent
last year. Accounting for 26 percent of all exports, the
electronics industry has replaced the forestry processing industry
as the country's chief export player.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Upset by West Ham on Home Ground Premier League </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea's championship chances
suffered a serious blow on Saturday as West Ham United inflicted a
1-0 defeat on Chelsea's home ground in the English Premier League
soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Gianluca Vialli's side, unbeaten at Stamford Bridge until
Wednesday's F.A. Cup defeat by Manchester United, now trail United
by seven points after Andy Cole scored twice as the league leaders
came from behind to win 2-1 at Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal remained four points behind in second place with a 2-0
win at Everton, each team having a player sent off.
</P>
<P>
Leeds United are now only two points behind Chelsea in fourth
after beating Sheffield Wednesday away 2-0 while Aston Villa's
miserable run continued with a 1-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur.
</P>
<P>
There was a rare win for bottom club Nottingham Forest, 3-1 at
Wimbledon, while Derby County shocked Liverpool 3-2. The games
between Coventry City and Blackburn Rovers and Leicester City and
Charlton Athletic both ended 1-1.
</P>
<P>
It's been a bad week for Chelsea, who dominated Saturday's game
but failed to take their chances.
</P>
<P>
West Ham gave them a warning when Marc-Vivien Foe had the ball
in the net only for it to be disallowed for a push and when Paul
Kitson shot from close range for the 75th minute winner, there was
absolutely no doubt this time.
</P>
<P>
At St James' Park Newcastle stunned the leaders after 16
minutes when Peruvian Nolberto Solano curled in a great free kick.
</P>
<P>
But United took control and Andy Cole, back at the ground where
he made his reputation, hooked in an equalizer 10 minutes later
and grabbed the winner soon after the break.

Speaking to EU foreign ministers' informal meeting here, German

<P>
The German foreign minister, who chaired the meeting, said that
the EU should hold regular meetings of foreign and defense
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The bloc should also establish a committee made up of military

servicemen with a permanent staff, Fischer said.

<HEADLINE> N.Zealand Seafood Exports Top 640 Mln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand seafood exports
for 1998 topped 1.2 billion NZ dollars (640 million U.S. dollars),
up 10 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a media release issued Sunday, NZ Seafood Industry Council
Chairman Dave Shark said the results were "heartening" for the
industry which had been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Two of the best export performers were New Zealand's greenshell
mussels and Hoki (a whiptail fish), according to the release.
</P>
<P>
Sales of Hoki to Europe rose 250 percent to a new high of 88
million NZ dollars (47 million U.S. dollars) while Greenshell
mussels sales also hit a new high returning a record 118 million
NZ dollars (63.1 million U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the growing demand for New Zealand seafood was also in
part due to dwindling fish stocks in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike some other countries who now face the prospect of
reduced catches, New Zealand has been far-sighted and put in
place a fisheries management system which ensures that we will
have fish for the future," Shark said.
</P>
<P>
This would mean that the seafood exports of the country would
continue to grow, he added.

<HEADLINE> Better Climate Keeps Capital Flowing to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Steady and continuous inflows of
funds to China has convinced those hesitating European investors,
today's Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Europe increased by 39.8 percent last year to 5.
9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Leading Chinese economist Fan Gang attributed the strong influx
of European funds to the continually improving Chinese investment
climate, in contrast to deteriorating environments in many other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Peter Rasmussen, an information services
manager from Denmark, as saying that most European enterprises
wanted to seek long-term cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He said China, the second biggest recipient of foreign direct
investment in the world, had enough successful experience to meet
investors' demands.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite satisfied with the service provided by the
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Ma Yu, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
International Trade and Economic Cooperation, warned that the
environment was far from ideal with the existence of random
charges imposed by local authorities on foreign enterprises, for
example.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists have forecast a gloomy year for foreign
investment. And according to an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, experience suggests other
Asian countries are likely to be a big magnet for European and
American investment as they recover from the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Stone Material Sector Eyes Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's stone material producers
will pay greater attention to exploring the European market this
year, "Business Weekly" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbo, secretary-general of the China Stone Material
Industry Association, told the newspaper that the association
plans to organize seminars on Chinese stone materials in November
in Germany and the Netherlands, the major stone materials
importers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 major Chinese stone materials producers and
processors will attend the seminars with a view to establishing
regular sales channels in the two countries, and more Chinese
stone materials exporters will also participate in stone materials
exhibitions in Germany and Italy this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the association will also invite major European
stone materials distributors and houses to visit China's
professional exhibition in May to promote better understanding of
China's rapidly developing stone materials industry.
</P>
<P>
China's stone materials producers and processors quarries
around 135 million square meters of stone materials each year and
exports around one-third.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the world's biggest stone market, while China's
production and exports of stone materials rank second in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's stone industry has traditionally focused on
technological exchange with its European counterparts and ignored
the huge market, as the Asian market absorb more than 60 percent
of Chinese stone material exports, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil has greatly affected exports of
stone materials from the Chinese mainland. The export value
dropped from 766 million U.S. dollars in 1997 to around 600
million U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Progress in Kosovo Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ELTVILLE, Germany, March 13 (Xinhua) -- EU foreign ministers on
Saturday urged the leaders of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo ethnic
Albanians to seize "the last chance" to make rapid progress toward
a deal in the Kosovo peace talks due to resume in Paris on Monday.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made the statement at a
press conference held after EU foreign ministers ended their first-
day sessions of informal talks here.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces in
Kosovo would be an indispensable part of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The international community can not ignore the war and killings
in Kosovo, he warned.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary said at the press conference that
Serbian authorities and rebel Albanians would be told bluntly on
Monday that the international community's patience was wearing
thin.
</P>
<P>
Cook added that the two parties were unlikely to sign a deal
immediately, but there was no firm deadline for them to do so.
</P>
<P>
"The danger with deadlines is that nothing happens until you
reach that deadline," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook reiterated that NATO air strikes against Serbian targets
remained an option. But the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
also had to show that it was willing to move toward a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow NATO to be conscripted as the airforce of
the KLA," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU supports the Rambouillet peace plan and "
calls on the two parties to sign (it) immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers met here to discuss the prospects for an
accord amid growing fears that NATO could resort to military
action.

<HEADLINE> Housing Prices in Major Cities Stable in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The housing prices in 16 major
Chinese cities remained stable in 1998, Business Weekly reported
today, citing a report from the China Real Estate Index System
Office (Creis).
</P>
<P>
The Creis index measuring changes in the 16 cities' real estate
market indicated that prices were almost the same in 1998 as in
1997, barring a rise of 17 points in Tianjin and a drop of 95
points in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The central government's decision to abolish the direct housing
distribution system and the commercial banks' rapid development of
housing financing propelled the real estate sector to advance
steadily in 1998, the paper quoted Ouyang Yonghua, deputy director
of Creis, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investment of 358 billion yuan (43.4 billion U.S. dollars) went
into the real estate sector, up 12.6 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The growth in real estate investment was the highest in the
third quarter because the central government began to implement
its economic housing construction plan.
</P>
<P>
Sales and earnings of commercial housing rose 34.7 percent and
36.5 percent respectively, Ouyang said. Prices were close to the
level in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the average
price of commercial housing was 2,002 yuan per sq. m. in 1998, up
1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Individual purchasing made up more than 80 percent of new
housing sales in the majority of the 16 cities except Beijing,
where individual purchasing accounted for about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Real estate development in Beijing was different from other
cities as much housing in Beijing has been bought by organizations
and then resold to working staff at preferential prices, Ouyang
said.
</P>
<P>
The large purchasing power of work units in past years had held
back the commercialization of Beijing's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ratio of residential housing in total housing
supply was lower than in other cities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing invested 16.8 billion yuan (2.02 billion dollars) in
the residential housing sector in 1998, accounting for 44.5
percent of the city's real estate investment.
</P>
<P>
It completed residential housing of 5.88 million sq. m., making
up 69.9 percent of the total completed housing.
</P>
<P>
The ban imposed last year on work units' purchasing of housing
will put pressure on Beijing's real estate market in the short
term, but the increasing purchasing power from individuals will
make Beijing one of the best places for residential housing
development, according to Ouyang.

<HEADLINE> Moya Replaces Sampras as World Number One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Moya became the first
Spaniard to earn the world No. 1 men's tennis ranking today after
beating Gustavo Kuerten in the Champions Cup in Indian Wells,
California of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moya, the 1998 French Open champion, beat Kuerto 6-3, 1-6, 6-1
in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The victory assured Moya of jumping from No. 4 to the top spot
when the ATP rankings are released Monday. He replaces Pete
Sampras of the United States, who was beaten in the second round
in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Moya has collected a total of 3,484 points to the American's 3,
447.
</P>
<P>
Moya is the 15th player to hold the top spot since the ATP
rankings began in 1973. He was ranked fifth in the world in 1998,
having steadily moved up from 346th four years ago. The 22-year-
old had not lost a set all week until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia had a chance to move to No.1 last
month, but a loss to Thomas Johansson in the Guardian Direct Cup
quarterfinals cost him the chance.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Parliamentary President Criticizes U.S. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- President of Cuba's National
Assembly of People's Power Ricardo Alarcon Saturday criticized U.S.
Cuba policy as aggressive, the official newspaper Granma reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon was quoted as saying that every U.S. Congress action "
has been aimed at introducing new aggressive measures against Cuba
" since the passing of the Helms-Burton law three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has promised since last year to "soften"
its blockade of Cuba enforced nearly 40 years ago, he said, but "
in reality it has multiplied the fines, penal processes,
investigations and threats against the citizens of Cuba and other
countries."
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said that the Helms-Burton law approved by U.S.
President Bill Clinton in 1996 was reinforced by several
amendments, to which other legislative decisions were added. These
amendments "have expanded the economic war against Cuba and
extended the sanctions and threats to other nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon also criticized the current U.S. budget law which, he
said, "shamelessly" included at least two million U.S. dollars to
finance the activities of "traitors" within Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban parliament president said that the U.S. government
has ignored the international rejection to the Helms-Burton law. "
Instead of ending an illegal and inadmissible policy that causes
so much opposition, it has taken all unimaginable measures to
extend and reinforce it."
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. government promised Europe to make "cosmetic
modifications" to the law, Alarcon added, amendments were made to
harden precisely the chapter that they had hypocritically promised
to soften.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Float Billion-Dollar Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- With international financial
institutions promising to renew their credit lines, Brazil has
decided to float one-billion-dollar bonds on the international
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Saturday following the announcement on
Friday by a group of major German, British, U.S. and French
private banks that the lines of credit for Brazil will be
maintained until August 31.
</P>
<P>
The move, taken by these financial institutions with the
support of the central banks of their countries, seeks to maintain
the present credit lines of some 23 billion dollars, which will be
enough to settle Brazil's balance of payments this year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's central bank president Arminio Fraga said that the
issue could happen in one or two months.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the bankers have been encouraged by the idea of
the floating. It is a good business for them, but no date has been
set," said Fraga in London to Brazilian reporters who were
accompanying him on a Europe tour.
</P>
<P>
Fraga began the tour this weekend to present a new economic
restructuring program to the economic authorities of European
countries.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian army on
Saturday denounced the country's two main rebel groups for the
missing of its 41 members, whose names do not appear in the
hostage list offered by them.
</P>
<P>
According to the Army Information and Communication System,
five of the missing hostages are civilian public servants serving
in the army, two are officers, six are non-commissioned officers
and 28 are soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The army command blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) for
kidnapping them.
</P>
<P>
It said the two rebel groups still hold nearly 350 military and
policemen hostage.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, which is holding about 330 hostages, wants to
exchange them for some 480 rebels who are in state prisons.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian army explained that some of the missing hostages
were taken prisoner in combat and others were captured when they
were on vacation or on leave for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
The army urged the captors to give proof that the missing
hostages are alive and to release them along with all the
Colombians and foreigners they are holding in captivity.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Wastes Not to Pose Risks to Panama Canal, Owners Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The owners of the UK
registered ship "Pacific Swan" sailing from France to Japan with
430 containers of nuclear wastes claimed Saturday that there will
not be any danger when the ship passes the Panama Canal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) and Pacific Nuclear
Transport Limited (PNTL) representatives operating the ship made
the claim in Panama City. The ship will arrive at the canal
entrance in the Atlantic at 12:00 local time (17:00 GMT) and
passes the canal with a shipment of vitrified nuclear wastes.
</P>
<P>
The BNFL, together with the Campaigne Generale des Matires
Nuclearis (COGEMA) firm of France, is in the nuclear energy
business in all the range of services within the cycle of nuclear
fuel.
</P>
<P>
COGEMA has a contract with 10 Japanese nuclear energy producing
companies represented by the Overseas Reprocessing Committee (ORC)
for the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and for the shipment to
Japan of the final residual wastes of the process.
</P>
<P>
The environmental group Greenpeace has warned of a possible
accident of the Pacific Swan in its trip along the Panama Canal
that would be "catastrophic" for the Panamanian population and for
the environment.
</P>
<P>
However, the ship owners and their public relations department
have included in their press releases the opinion of officials in
charge of the canal security who have made observations about the
passing of ships that could represent a peril for the waterway.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Province Enters New Period of Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The economy of south China's
Hainan Province has bid farewell to its three-year ebb trend and
began a benign circulation, according to its Governor Wang
Xiaofeng.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also a deputy to the current session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top lawmaking body, said
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua that in 1998, Hainan's GDP
growth was 8.3 percent, exceeding the national average, 7.8
percent, for the first time in four years.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 also saw a 370-million yuan of profit for the
province's industrial sector, and a 14.7 percent increase in
financial revenue over the 1997 figure, both marking the first
instance in four years, the governor said, adding that there was
also a substantial growth in investment in the fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The governor attributed all theses to the improved macro-
economic control and the enormous financial assistance from the
central government.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Hainan Island, China's second largest island next to
Taiwan, was designated as a special economic zone (SEZ), and in
the same year, Hainan Province was set up to include the Hainan
Island and some small islands in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
To boost local economy, this largest SEZ in China has adopted
more open and flexible economic policies compared with other four
SEZs, namely Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1995, Hainan SEZ's economy suffered a lot due to
economic bubbles in trading and real estate fields, featuring
inflation and a distorted structure for investment, according to
the governor.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, Hainan started to straighten out the local
financial order by closing down a large number of urban
cooperatives, which has successfully helped defuse the financial
risks and bank savings began to pick up.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the provincial government has made it a top
priority to develop lucrative tropical farming, tourism and some
other new industries.
</P>
<P>
This year, a number of infrastructure projects are expected to
be completed and become operational, according to the governor.
The Meilan International Airport in Haikou, capital of the
province, is scheduled to be commissioned at the end of this month,
and the 650-km expressway around the island is expected to be
completed by October.

<HEADLINE> Malnutrition Endangers Salvadoran Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR, March 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 23 percent of
children in El Salvador are in danger of dying from severe
malnutrition, especially among the lowest-income population, says
a U.S. Atlanta Diseases Control Center report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agency warned that if the present situation continues,
more than 23 percent of the 1.8 million children could die of
malnutrition between 1999 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was published here, says that 30 percent of
children under five suffer anemia, which is an element thwarting
the assimilation of knowledge in school.
</P>
<P>
It says that nutrition irregularities in children not only have
an impact on the present generations but also affect the
sustainable development of health, education, and economy in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
Data from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), show
that the departments of Cuscatlan and Ahuachapan have the biggest
number of children with growth retardation due to chronic
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency said that half of the children in the two
departments have no access to a balanced diet, while the family
groups with a low education level have a diet based on
carbohydrates without nutritional value.
</P>
<P>
The national survey on family health in 1998 reveals that only
one of every six babies under six months is breast fed.
</P>
<P>
The report says that 23 percent of the two-year olds show
symptoms of chronic malnutrition, a condition that affects their
physical and psychical development.

<HEADLINE> Northern Lop Nor Lacks Water: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists say there is
little underground fresh water in the northern part of Lop Nor, in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
People will, therefore, have to depend on water resources from
the southeastern part of Lop Nor to supply fresh water for the
whole area which is known as "the driest place on the earth", said
Wang Futong, chief engineer of the Xinjiang Geological Prospecting
Bureau under the Ministry of Land Resources.
</P>
<P>
"Our recent survey shows that the water-bearing stratum is too
thin beneath an ancient river delta in northwestern Lop Nor," Wang
added.
</P>
<P>
The survey, however, has great academic significance, as Lop
Nor has barely been looked at in the past in terms of hydrological
and geological prospecting.
</P>
<P>
China's largest sylvite ore, with deposits of 250 million tons,
has been found in northern Lop Nor, but explorers need fresh water
for basic living conditions to exploit the find.

CHONGQING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Business licenses of 97
overseas-funded enterprises in Chongqing Municipality in southwest

In 1998 alone, 199 overseas-funded enterprises registered with

<HEADLINE> Pollution Situation Improving On Yellow River Tributary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's Qinghai
Province recently unveiled a plan to reduce the amount of
pollutants on the Huangshui River, a major tributary of the Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
Two sewage treatment plants will be built in Xining, the
provincial capital, which the Huangshui runs through. The first
phase of construction, laying 2 sewage pipes to these plants on
either side of the Huangshui river, is to be completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government will build a 30-km green belt and parks along
the river as well.
</P>
<P>
The 335-km Huangshui river valley covers a 16,000-sq.km. with 2.
74 million people, 60 percent of Qinghai's population. Some 1,000
industrial firms discharge 50 million tons of waste and sewage
into the river each year. The untreated water contains 243 types
of harmful inorganic substances and 50 types of poisonous
chemicals, according to Tan Zhuming, the head of the environmental
monitor station on the river.
</P>
<P>
As a result, grain, vegetable, and fruit output in areas along
the river has fallen a great deal in recent years.

s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have actively promoted local
economic development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has 14 ports of entry along its 5,000-km border line.
The 1998 border trade volume hit 869 million US dollars,
accounting for 57 percent of Xinjiang's annual import-export value.
</P>
<P>
The 400-odd Xinjiang enterprises engaged in border trade have a
combined annual turnover of 800 million US dollars. Major export
items include foods, textiles, garments, shoes and chemicals.
Primary imports from countries in central and south Asia include
metals, animal by-products, cotton and fibers.
</P>
<P>

30-ha market featuring 3,800 booths. The market, reportedly the
largest of its kind in central Asia, has an average monthly
business volume of 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A local trade official said the market has generated 40 million
yuan of profits since opening in 1992.

Poland and the Czech Republic, extending congratulations on the
entry of their countries in NATO, the Government Information
Office said.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan's Expressway Network Takes Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The expressway network in
southwest China's Sichuan Province is taking shape with the
province's second main road linking Chengdu, the provincial
capital, and Mianyang City
</P>
<P>
Sichuan invested 11.95 billion yuan on building highways last
year, increasing its expressway mileage to 367 km. In addition,
16 other expressways are under construction with a total length of
800 km.
</P>
<P>
These projects include Chengdu-Ya'an, Chengdu-Leshan, Zigong-
Yibin highways and the Guangyuan and Liangshan sections on the no.
108 state-level expressway. About 340 km of highways are expected
to be completed at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has actively used foreign investment and adopted other
flexible policies over the past couple of years to promote the
development of local communications.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province was given approval to issue 200 million
U.S. dollars of convertible bonds overseas for the construction of
the Chengdu-Chongqing expressway.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the province plans to spend 8.5 billion yuan on the
construction of five expressways, including the Nanchong-Guang'an
and Guangyuan-Yuanba highways. Its highway mileage will be
increased to 1,200 km in the year 2000 and 1,500 km in 2002.

<HEADLINE> China Develops World's Longest SWNT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers with the
Shenyang Metallic Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS) have developed 3-cm-long single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT)
.
</P>
<P>
Nobel prize laureate Richard Smalley, an expert in the field,
commented that the beams are the world's longest.
</P>
<P>
The development underlines how China has caught up with
advanced countries in carbon fiber research, which is a relatively
new type of material now widely used in the aero-space industry,
high-tech products, sports and entertainment commodities.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Huiming, a leading research fellow with the
Shenyang Metallic Institute, they synthesized the SWNT by applying
catalytic thermodecomposition to organic substances, and at a low
cost. The researchers have applied for patented rights in the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
The world's first nano-tube transistor was produced last year,
with a volume equivalent to one tenth of the ordinary
semiconductor transistor.
</P>
<P>
And physicists have also been working on a carbonyl molecular
electronic device through connecting nanotubes to replace silicon-
based computer chips which are currently widely used.

<HEADLINE> Jordan not to Help Topple Saddam: King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said Saturday that his country will not become a part of any plans
or actions to topple the Saddam regime in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He announced the Jordanian position during a meeting with
visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk at
Jordan`s southern harbor city of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian ruler also reiterated his call for lifting the
crippling international sanctions on Baghdad and safeguarding the
territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah described the Saddam regime as a matter of Iraq`s
internal affairs, and refused to commit Jordan to support any
plans to topple President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The king was apparently echoing his own position that Jordan
would not allow any other countries to use Jordan as a spring
board to interfere in the internal affairs of a neighboring
country, including Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan paid a heavy price politically and was isolated by Arab
countries during the 1990 Gulf crisis, for which it was found to
be sympathetic with Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan has to maintain a delicate diplomatic balance
between Iraq and Iraq`s Arab foes Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Kuwait resumed diplomatic relations in March after
an eight-year suspension of ties since the Gulf crisis, but Amman
still depends on Iraq for cheap crude oil and oil products.
</P>
<P>
Indyk arrived in Jordan Saturday to attend a mourning ceremony
organized by the American embassy in Amman for late King Hussein
Ibn Talal, who died of lymphatic cancer on February 7.
